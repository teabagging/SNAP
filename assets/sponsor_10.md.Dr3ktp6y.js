Zahl is Dean of Trinity Episcopal School for Ministry, the most ultra-evangelical seminary in the US Episcopal Church. Trinity, its faculty and its dean have no use for their own church's catholic, sacramental and liturgical heritage.A much better, fairer account of the liturgical tradition would have been given if a Catholic liturgist like Aidan Kavenaugh had been selected, or an Orthodox scholar like Thomas Hopko.

The clarity and contrast is wonderful and the manual is easy to use. The universal remote was a bit cumbersome to setup because the code for our cable box was not listed.

The delivery includes them setting it up which is also nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad TV Samsung Brand LNT4065FX... Never Buy Samsung","review":"I bought this Samsung TV cuple of years back. Lately, it has been making clicking sound 3-4 times before turning on. I would not expect to last TV just 3-4 years prior to another repair. I called customer service and logged this issue. They told me warranty expired. They would not cover the repair. Samsung is playing this game with so many customers like us who paid ~$1500 to buy this product. I would never ever buy Samsung product. I would advise other consumers too not to buy Samsung TVs or other products. They do not treat customers well and do not respect customers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent HD , great features","review":"We've had it for a few weeks and love it. It worked right out of the box and was very easy to setup, even for someone who hasn't owned a HD set before. The HD channels are crystal clear and the picture is consistently bright with brilliant colors and great balance. Non-HD channels are fuzzy, though and look a lot worse than on an ordinary TV, even in the \\"film\\" mode, which is supposed to adjust frames per second to better match traditional interlaced speeds. The built in sound is OK but not really much better than any other TV - you still need a theater sound system. The set has a great selection of inputs and does a nice job of autoselecting the input you're using. It's an excellent value for the money - no regrets."},{"rating":"2","title":"samsung LNT4065F","review":"Very Pleased.

But the first problem was it would not turn on I called Samsung and it was a compaster. They fixedit. A year later it was going out. I called to get it fixed.

I have to confess up front that I was unable to finish it. I am not a prude and do enjoy well written and appropriate sexual themes in literature. I this book however the female lead/heroine in this series is a 14 year old girl and yet sex and sexual themes are repeatedly brought up. I got very turned off and feared for the very offensive and inappropriate place this series may be going. She is 14 and yet there are repeated references to what a sexy body she has! I hope I am wrong and maybe a lot of negative reaction will persuade Anthony to edit out or change the direction in future installments, but for me this was a huge deal breaker and a no go. It should definitely not be in elementary school libraries or be given to young readers. I am very dissapointed with Anthony and will think twice and fully investigate before I read another of his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing!","review":"This is an amazing series. It is realistic, even though it's subject is an unbelievable tale of traveling through worlds and parallel universes. Piers Anthony writes this in a totally different style from the Xanth series.

It is really an amazing book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost a Virtual (Com)Mode","review":"A plain vanilla, unimaginative tale. I recommend this only for teenagers and not for any one looking for elaborate, complex storylines. The story is basically girl hates world, girl meets boy, girl loses boy, girl and boy try to find each other, girl and boy are captured by a truly nasty person who is bent on domination of all realities. If you are squeamish about blood, you might also want to skip this book or at least skip those parts. I am planning to read the next two installments since I purchased them already. I do like Piers Anthony but this is not aimed at his more mature readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This book was so horrible I threw it in the recycling so that no one else would end up with this copy.

This was my first taste. Well, yuck! Does anyone have an antidote? This guy would embarrass a romance novel writer. How anyone would find the pathetic 14 year old, sexually active, suicidal, heroine, Colene, or the sanctimonious hero, Darius, interesting is beyond me. I can't imagine to whom this book is aimed. Certainly it is not for children as hardly a paragraph goes by without mention of sex and/or personal hygiene. Neither is the tone of the book aimed at normal adults. It must be aimed at Anthony fans who may give him a pass.

Some stated that the book was sexist, I thought that maybe these people were being a bit sensitive. After all, I enjoyed Anthony's Incarcations of Immortality series a great deal. I made it about one third of the way through it. I really couldn't read anymore about perky breasts or bouncing breasts or how the lead fourteen year old character wasn't wearing any panties, especially when all it did was take away from the story. This book was so bad that I cannot even think of buying another Piers Anthony book again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!!!!!

The main problem is that the switch is on the end of the large cylindrical counterweight, so that you have to reach all the way around the lamp to turn it on. Additionally, the large counterweight (which seems like it could have been made denser and smaller) makes placing the lamp usefully on a desk more difficult.

Errol Flynn carried this film most of the way with his usual charm but even he can't perform lazarus on such a bad written screenplay. Peter Godfrey didn't help either.

In this glossy Warners remake, the adorable little gamine is played by Ida Lupino, who scampers about in what has to be her worst performance. This is one of the duds (\\"Never Say Goodbye\\" and \\"Cry Wolf\\" are the others) that Errol Flynn made in the late forties trying to extend his range, and which instead killed off his career as a major star.

It is not the responsibility of the church, YMCA, day-care center, or public school to meet those needs. As parents, we need to take seriously the God given responsibility we have been given and determine to be the main influence in our children's lives. The result of our efforts can either be rewards for a job well done, or grief from a rebellious child that was not properly guided. This book contains many insights on how to spend quantity time, not just quality time, with our children and gives many ideas on how to turn the TV set off and get our children to enjoy reading alone as well as reading together as a family, and build memories as a family that will be the root system that the child will need to withstand the \\"winds\\" later in life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun in the kitchen for Star Wars fans of all ages...","review":"Just like the first Star Wars cookbook (Wookiee Cookies), Darth Malt is cover to cover fun!

Others were introduced that were unappealing and superfluous to the story--or what was left of one. Though I enjoyed Reese's style, I have no idea what he was trying to say about sex? love?religion? violence? or how it impacted the young heroine. It was a bit self-indulgent.

The promotional copy and plot synopsis were promising, but the book is poorly written -- so much so that it prevented me from enjoying some of those promising ideas. Attempts at sexiness or titillation just come off silly, almost like a grocery-store romance novel. The witch elements of the story are such a bizarre combination of different ideas borrowed from other books, histories, myths and legends that they just don't add up to anything that makes sense.

I can't force myself to endure this book any longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"God Awful!","review":"This book is the perfect example of pretty packaging with nothing between the covers. While it does start out with a rather interesting storyline, it soon dissolves into complete and absolute drivel. A really, really horrible clone of the worst Anne Rice novel (pick one of the more recent ones). Names borrowed from her novels (Louis, Madaleine) and is it just me or is Asmodei an exact replica of Lestat. There is even a balant rip off from \\"The Exorcist\\" (like Crucifixs anyone?) But really, you could over look all of that if Mr. Reese showed any talent as more than a cut rate romance novelist. The descripitions are long and boring. His prose is so purple that one feels practically blugeoned to death with over ripe descriptions.A few times I couldn't decide if it was the overwhelming laughter or the all most sea sickness inducing writing that was making my stomach flip flop. Plotless, pointless and down right stupid, this is a novel that should have never seen the light of day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Awful","review":"Man if I only could get my pointless daydreams published like this guy managed to. The book pretty much hopes to thrill readers by appealing to their attraction to occult and scenes of sexuality and cruelty. As another reviewer mentioned, the plot does meander, though I would add through meadows of nothing. The author really has no idea what overall point he is trying to get across. It's just a daydream of a guy who can write alright."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Not Finish It....","review":"I got about half-way through this book and couldn't take any more. Reading is supposed to be a relaxing pastime, however, the more I struggled through this book, the more my head ached. I understand that the main character, Herculine, is supposed to be innocent and naive...she isn't...she is just plain stupid, and nothing she says or does, and no amount of her suffering makes me feel any sympathy towards her. I was actually irritated by the fact the four demons rescued her, instead of sending her to her impending fate at the stake. A burning to end the story in 200 pages would have been kinder for all involved; especially the reader.Mr. Reese's writing style has been compared to that of Anne Rice; perhaps if that is the sort of style you enjoy, then you will gain something from this tome. Unfortunately, it just doesn't work for me.I can't write much more about the story, since I did not finish it; and of the many pages I did read, very little was actually said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aldous Huxley would be shocked...","review":"...to see his own work in the center of this book. Like another reader, I picked it up as a lightweight companion to other reading and was absolutely dismayed to find so much of Huxley's work, \\"The Devils of Loudon\\" in these pages. The author begins, seemingly, with a view toward imitating Ann Rice, and badly, and then segues into Huxley's story of convents, mass hysteria, and a persecuted and beleagered priest. The details are nearly identical, from small things such as the shaving of the eyebrows before the priest's execution to the torture methods, to the doves flying around the pyre. This book reads not as a well-researched novel but more as a thrown together hash of Huxley and Rice and the \\"come-on\\" title belies the fact that it is not worthy of the time to slog through it. I buy a book, I read the book. This one, however, should have been the exception to that rule."},{"rating":"2","title":"Te lo recomiendo!","review":"No me habia dado cuenta que incrementar mis puntos en la parte de gramatica pordria ser tan fácil hasta que encontre a Greg.

Anyways, I read this book, and while I haven't been hit by a supertanker again, I still find it troubling that I am still not avoiding all sized boats. For instance, last weekend, I was capsized by a fleet of paper boats, and was engaged in a life or death struggle with very irritated children.

Do you think that a book on How to Avoid Tiny Ships would even be considered by a publisher?

I have never had a bad experience with them that could be blamed for the phobia, but I fear them nonetheless. For those like me, I feel this book falls short of our expectations. While I am not a professional huge ship-avoider I do practice it daily and this book misses several of the rules that I've written down for myself. Chief among them, is to avoid getting into the waters at all.Even worse, the book is filled with scenarios in which you might encounter a huge ship... just imagining myself in these situations is extremely upsetting and would cause me to break into a sweat. I would've stopped reading it, had I not hoped that later in the book it would add to my ship-dodging arsenal. Sadly, it never did.Also, there's a picture of a huge ship on the cover...

I have read this book and I am a public school teacher with 9 years of teaching elementary school. I have a BA in Psychology and a M Ed.This is a great little book. It is important that we understand the beliefs of the scientists as well as their backgrounds. Contrary to popular opinion, scientists aren't devoid of beliefs and everyone's beliefs influence their perspectives. This can be readily seen by perusing these reviews. Our beliefs also determine our actions which makes being certain of their veracity all the more important as they will dictate the course of our lives and our destiny.These scientists stand head and shoulders above many of their peers. It is important for all of us to understand what they believed and why they chose those beliefs.I highly recommend this book and I hope you will enjoy it as much as I did, and do every time I read it.

The bulk of it is something a middle school student could have done as a report; as for accuracy I would suggest reading biographies by actual historians.

Could have given you more disks, or sold them sepreratly like the viewmaster company does. Kids will get sick of the same picture, the pictures included are not very interesting. Mostly bugs and space theme, leans toward boys. Includes no paper and the paper size needed is not a standard one you could just buy.

It's refreshing to find a book that not only is easy to use, but offers a number of variations for the wording of your wedding vows.Although aimed at the wedding officiants, this book can prove invaluable to any couple who wish to be actively involved in planning their wedding ceremony. The authors include ceremonies for specific situations such as \\"older couple, previously married,\\" and \\"second marriage with children.\\" With different options available, your ceremony will hold a more personal meaning, while retaining the dignity and respect deserving of such an event.There's no frou-frou or fluff, it gets straight to the point.

What I got was a book that has only 7 different ceremony examples and only ONE of them being for a couple with children. And reading that one ceremony does not give you different suggestions. It TELLS you what to have the pastor say, what his prayer should be, what music to play and what passage from the bible should be read.

All too slowly, unfortunately.Swerling's compulsion to include the most sensational events and characters is the only caveat here. It's possible that everything she writes about actually occurred, or events like them at any rate. But a little more restraint would have made the book a bit better, in my view.Still, it's a quibble, really. The story is intriguing, the family politics (as always) fascinating, the culture and geography of the city a revelation. Swerling's writing is sure-handed and deft. I truly enjoyed this book.

Page after page after page, compounded with unappealing characters who even if one started to care, disappeared into another generation.I gave up after 200 pages.

At first I thought it would be a great idea, that was before I used it. The wipes barely get warm, as soon as you take them out they are cold. Another down fall is that the spongelike piece that goes on the bottom of the warmer dries up really fast and in my case it began to burn. The wipes warmer is a complete waste of money and is unsafe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for baby","review":"I didn't think that I needed this item so I didn't bother putting it on my registry but I ended up getting one for my shower. I am glad that I did. My son does not get \\"startled\\" anymore by cold wipes. It does a good job of keeping the wipes moist. It doesn't brown the wipes unless you are like me and forget to soak the white pad at the bottom of the warmer. The manufacturer recommends checking on the pad frequently in order to avoid browning. I like that fact that you can throw the pad into the wash and it comes out white and clean again. The manufacturer also recommends doing this about every 2 weeks. I also like that you can use two different types of wipes: 1) pop-up 2) standard wipes. I recommend this product especially if you have a baby who hates cold wipes."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't last very long","review":"I purchased this wipe warmer after my first one died. The wipes didn't turn brown as they had in my old warmer, but i couldn't get the wipes out after refilling it so I had to open the whole thing for the first few days every time i would refill it. It didn't last a year as my first warmer did. After going through two warmers before my son was 2 I am not too happy with the product but it does make it easier to clean them when they are sensitive to tempurature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!","review":"This warmer is just great. I read about the brown wipes, water spills, etc. but we haven't had ANY problems. As long as you keep the pad wet nothing turns brown. Even when we've forgotted to wet the pad for a long time, only the pad has dried out & turned brown- none of the wipes ever did. They just dried up a bit & weren't as warm. And once you re-wet the pad it turns white again. Also, I read that another poster could only get the pop up feature to work with a certain brand of wipes but we've used lots of different wipes & they all pop up fine. I've opened the lid several times & never had any water spillage either. The lid is curved so all the water stays inside the warmer, even the condensation drips back inside when you open it. I really love it. The only reason I didn't give it 5 starts is because the original we got as a gift didn't work at all & we had to return it & get a new one. That one has worked just great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I love this wipe warmer more than the others specifically for the pad in the bottom. With another brand, the bottom wipes were completely dry when we got down to them and so it was a big waste. With the ultimate, even if you forget to put water in, you can put it in and then it will soak into the wipes and they are good as new. Great product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"I love this wipes warmer. I had the dual wipes warmer to start with, and just wasn't happy with it's preformace at times, so we bought this one. I am so much happier with it. I love that you can just push the botton and the lid pops up and the wipes come out easily. However, the pad in the bottom does dry out, so you have to add a bit of water to the bottom. But that's not a problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pretty good deal","review":"Our son is a month old and we really loved this warmer when we got home from the hospital. Our son was very fussy when we used the cold wipes on him in the hospital. Two problems I have with the warmer are: 1)The wipes tend to drop back down in when a refill is needed soon. It would be helpful if the bottom was on a spring and pushed them up as the stack gets smaller. 2)The top doesn't seem to want to stay latched. I have to keep a tube of diaper rash cream on it.I have noticed the water dripping when the top is opened, but it doesn't drip out of the machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed at all","review":"I was given this at a shower from my best friend who swore by it. I live in a colder state and thought it would be great to have, but only used it for a few weeks and gave up. Like other reviewers have said, if you don't keep up with the moisture replenishing, the wipes turn brown very quickly. Also, purchasing a new insert every month or so seemed a bit inconvenient. Being a plug-in accessory was a big inconvenience as well since my son's bedroom only has 2 outlets and they are both on the same wall. Not only that, but the plug is only about 2 feet long and could only sit on his changing table in one place. The wipes do not always pop up, or when they do they come up with more than one at a time and the lid always drips water when it is opened. This is currently stored away never to see daylight again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too impressed","review":"With winter coming, I thought my daughter would appreciate warm wipes instead of being constantly startled by having a cool wipe on her behind. Of course I love the idea of a wipe warmer but once I got this one home and up and working I was a little disappointed. I should have read more carefully b/c I expected this to be battery-operated as well as having a plug-in, but no such luck. That makes it a little inconvenient b/c no mom changes her baby at the exact same place all the time. The warmer is also heavy and not very easy to carry around. I also wasn't thrilled with the idea of having to buy new \\"pillows\\" every few months to keep the wipes moist. Who has time to think about that with all the demands of motherhood?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lid does not close properly","review":"I like that it keeps the wipes warm but the lid does not like to stay shut. You have to press the lid down multiple times before it will stay shut."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"Invest in better quality wipes rather than this wipe warmer. Wipes cool off before you can get them out and put into use. Sponge drys out too quickly and can pose a hazard. We ended up having to rewet ours almost every day. Not worth the hassle. Baby will adjust to wipes from the box in no time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth It","review":"Not worth the time and effort. My daughter doesn't care, she actually prefers cooler wipes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Threw mine away!","review":"I bought this one as an additional warmer to use with cloth wipes. First of all, you have to tape down the top portion to use for cloth wipes... very classy! I also used it with disposable wipes and had trouble getting them through the top - had to use 2 hands. The fact that you have to keep buying \\"pillows\\" for this is ridiculous! If you use it without the pillow, your wipes burn and permanently stain (for cloth wipes) on the bottom! I would overlook these things if it performed as I expected, but it doesn't. Get the Munchkin warmer instead - it is the best! None of this hassle!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy will only last for couple of months","review":"I bought this for my new born 4 months ago after 2 months it has a hard time latching the cover to lock. Now at 4 months it just does not close and lock anymore so it causes the wipes to dry. I really wish I did not throw away the box I would return it in a heartbeat. I tried to contact seller but it does not seem to have any option here. So learn from my mistake, spend that little extra dollar for an item that work and last longer than 4 months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Warmer","review":"This wipe warmer is definately very good. I noticed that the last 1 or 2 wipes do turn brown but that's no big deal. The only other complaint is that only the pampers wipes work with this and even with them when it gets down to the middle of the pack they stop popping up. Otherwise it definately serves it's purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice N Warm","review":"I think this product is great. I found that Huggies wipes work the best in this. I bought the refill pop up pack and they worked great. The Pampers wipes did not pop up well at all. I also found that by keeping a small bottle of water near the warmer helped to remind me to keep water inside of the warmer. I found that if you fill the bottom of the warmer to the top of the warming pad it works the best. I poured more water in each time I refilled the wipes. I think this is a great product and my son loves it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too excited about his one!","review":"I purchased this item thinking it would be perfect for those late night diaper changes. I still think wipes warmers are a good idea, just not this one! This warmer heats from the bottom. I quickly noticed the wipes at the bottom were warmer than the ones at the top. I also noticed that the wipes at the top were a bit dried out and soapy feeling. I returned the warmer and found the PERFECT warmer at a TARGET store. The target warmer heats from the top to the bottom, which keeps the top wipes moist and warm, just as they should be. It was a little cheaper in price and it has a lid lock that the other didn't have. All around it is a better purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really a warmer","review":"I am so disappointed with this product. First off, it doesn't really warm the wipes. Sure it's not as cold as regular wipes but its like room temperature and not a warm room either. My baby still protest when I use the so call warm wipes but not when I dunk the wipes in warm water and then wipe her. I assume that's how it's suppose to be or how it's suppose to work. Too bad I threw away the box and packaging or this would be going back to amazon for a refund. Save yourself the money and just use a bowl of warm water to warm your wipes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"I like this we use it when it's cold in the house. Keeps the wipes warm but you have to use them or they dry up. I like to unplug it when we are not using it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than nothing","review":"All babies are unique, so I wouldn't buy this until you have your baby home and see how he/she likes cold wipes, but our daughter HATED having cold wipes used, so we are very glad to have this. The other reviewers are spot on that the wipes are not warm by the time they get to baby, but they aren't cold either, and there is a huge difference on the east coast when the house gets cold :) More important, our baby is happier now and doesn't cry when we change her, which is well worth the price to us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wipes are warm & baby loves it","review":"Warmer works well, would recommend to a friend. Only complaint would be that the wet pad at the bottom that is supposed to prevent the wipes from drying out gets hard burn marks on it even if you wet it everytime you reload the wipes but really that isn't a big deal. If you are trying to decide if you should even get a warmer I would push you to do it - both my kids screamed at night when changing them using cold wipes and with the warmer they were just fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Top Won't Stay Shut","review":"I love this diaper wipe warmer and it has helped me a lot as a new mom, but one month after I bought it the top quit latching most of the time and pops back up. It drives me crazy! I love everything else about the wipe warmer and how much it has helped me, but the latch just doesn't keep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought this was unnecessary but I was WRONG!","review":"Ok so.... a wipes warmer?? Seriously?? I thought this was the first step to uselessness until I discovered that my dear sweet little 4 week old boy HATES to have his diaper changed and screams ever louder when the cold wipes hit his little butt in the middle of the night. Since getting the warmer he is much more affable about the whole diaper changing thing and is CLEARLY more at ease and comfortable with the warm wipes.If you have an extra $25 in your pocket and your little one reacts the way mine did with the unwarmed wipes it would be money well spent. In fact it was so great in the nursery, we bought another one for the changing table downstairs as well.Easy to use. Solidly made and loving it so far...."},{"rating":"1","title":"wipe warmer","review":"This thing make me sooo mad!!!!!!!!!!!!! It does not latch closed ever!!! Do not buy!!

I thought these would be great but they are not for me. When I assembled everything and put the wipes in them they were nice and toasty warm I thought \\"perfect\\" but then I took one out and it took 2 seconds and it was cold, colder than room temperature cold!! I did a test to get one out and put it on my leg and it was like the rapid movement made it colder. I was so disappointed and returned it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't get wipes as warm as other warmers","review":"My mom bought this warmer to have at her house when I visit with my son. I thought the warmer got the wipes just barely warmer than room temperature. At home I have the Munchkin warm glow warmer and I think it does a much better job at warming the wipes. I fill it up completely with wipes (I usually use Huggies) and they get really warm and I've never had a problem with them drying out or mildew or any of the problems other reviewers have mentioned. If you have a choice, I'd definitely recommend the Munchkin brand warmer. Oh, and my son doesn't seem to care whether the wipes are warm or not (and he was born in January in Colorado), but I sure do prefer to use the warm wipes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wouldn't Be Without!","review":"My son and I absolutely love this warmer! It's no necessity, but it surely makes diaper changes easier, especially with a 3 week old boy who likes to \\"squirt\\"! The warm wipes makes a huge difference and they don't surprise him. As for the other reviews that claim the wipes dry out- as long as you take care of this the way you should and keep water on the pad there will be no problem. it is true, however, that huggies wipes don't pop up but it's no hard task to simply lift the lid to remove the wipe- or use pampers wipes which do pop up. This is a great product that I'm very glad to own!"},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible.. waist of money","review":"I registered for this thing but it is horrible. Huggies wipes don't work in the pop up dispenser and the pop up dispenser does not stay closed, I taped it to keep closed to keep the wipes from drying out. When you open the lid to get the wipes out water spills out. The wipes only stay warm for about 30 seconds so if you grab a few of them to clean a dirty diaper they are cold by the time you get around to using them anyway. I like the design so I still keep the wipes in it but I have unplugged it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful invention!!!!!","review":"I liked the idea of warm wipes from the moment I'd heard of it. I just couldn't imagine putting a cold wet cloth on my baby's tushy in the dead of winter. Second to an electric bottle warmer, this is much needed and I know she appreciates me using it :-). One downside to this is if you don't keep the sponge fairly moistened with water, it will brown and harden. But overall, this is a really great invention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this!!!","review":"I received the wipes warmer for my shower, and now that Julia is here, I am so glad I have it. It works great, and my little girl is calm and happy when I use the warmed up wipes on her. I am going to buy a travel warmer, too, because she cries when I use the cold wipes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scary Bacterial Growth","review":"I was excited about this product until after 2 weeks worth of use (I rotated my wipes and everything), the wipes turned brown, and there was a bacterial growth on the moisture pad. My baby also got a bad case of diaper rash, which went away after I stopped using the warmer.I also couldn't make the pop up wipes work, so I had to open the warmer each time. I believe that this might have caused the temperature to be to low and the bacteria to grow.This is a waste of money anyway. I just warm the wipe in my hand before using on my baby and he doesn't mind one bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Product...","review":"It makes changing my daughter's diapers easier and she's happier with warm wipes...

Not worth it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I thought this would be a godsend but I was very disappointed. The wipe stays warm for about one second so by the time it reaches my baby's bottom, it's cold again.

The pop-top never worked for me meaning that I couldn't pull the wipes through the hole and had to open the top and detach the perforated wipes one by one for each change, which is not easy to do one handed. I tried using the reach-in wipes instead but it didn't help any. Plus, when baby became more active, I didn't feel comfortable using the changing table where the warmer was plugged because she liked to propel herself backwards (beginning at 10 weeks old). Once I couldn't use the changing table anymore, the wipes were never nearby anyway so I put this product away before my daughter was 3 months old. Bottom line - save your money for something worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby says Ahhhhhhhh!!!","review":"My very old-school mother thought this was entirely too frivilous! But after having a tub of wipes in an air-conditioned room all evening, by the time we changed my baby girl's diaper at 4 AM, she was screaming bloody murder because of the cold wipes.

The wipes do not pull apart, so you need 2 hands: one to pull the wipe out, the other to break it apart from the wipe underneath.2. The top of mine does not close easily. You have to slam it shut. Sometimes it pops open on its own which dries out the top few wipes.3.

He still jumps from the cold wipes.I really don't understand why so many ppl gave this thing good reviews.

My one and only complaint is the ever fresh pad you have to keep buying for it. It says 1 pad lasts 3 months.....not for me they don't. I keep buying more because it just doesn't seem to work as well after a month. Also, they dry up a lot and get yellow quick so you have to stay on top of rinsing it out and re-wetting it. But overall, it isn't that bad. It's quick and not at all time consuming or anything. Also, the new pads come two to a pack and aren't real expensive so no big deal!

I used it for a couple days when the latch on the pop-up lid feature would not catch. I had my husband return the item and get a replacement. The latch on the second one would not work either. There appears to be some type of design flaw. The other reviewers are correct that when you open the entire lid, the condensation from the moisture leaks out of the warmer. While this is a good concept, the design needs work. Also, my baby does not seem to mind cold wipes. I think she has become accustomed to them since that's what we have primarily used. I will probably return the second one also since it won't work properly and get something more useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice to have","review":"This is definitely a nice luxury.

Of course I didn't listen to her and bought one. The wipes did turn brown and also dried out towards the end. You don't really need one of these because your baby is more resilient than you think.

It is best to buy namebrand wipes though for this because for some reason, a few off brands we have purchased don't really work well with the pull-through.

Since we have used the wipe warmer, he tolerates his diaper changes much more calmly and, on occasion, without a whimper.

By the time you get one out and it hits the air, it's pretty cool. It's not nearly as warm as I thought they'd be.If the pad starts to dry out before you notice, the warmer will actually dry out all the wipes. Once they're dried out, you have to throw them away.

We do have to add water to the bottom pad every time that we put a new packet of wipes because the one time we did not the pad began to get dry and brown (the pad, not the wipes) so now we just make sure to add water at every new packet which is why it gets 4 stars instead of 5. Have not tried other warmers so i cant compare it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product but....","review":"I thought that a wipe warmer was a totally unnecessary product until I bought my daughter home from the hospital and saw her jump when I put the cold wipe on her bottom. Well, that convinced me to go buy a wipes warmer! Anyway, I bought this one because of the good reviews and it is a good product but there are a few flaws. After only 10 weeks of usage, the top keeps popping back up when it is closed, even though the warmer is not too full of wipes. Also, you must add water again to the sponge pack before the wipes run out otherwise the wipes will become dry towards the end of the pile and you end up wasting them.Besides these 2 flaws, the product works great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a neccesity","review":"I bought this product because my son was born 10 weeks early. He had a rough begining to his life being hooked up to monitors, fed through a tube, having IV's attached to him, and spending 6 weeks in the hospital. I wanted to spoil him in any way I could. After using the wipe warmer for a few weeks, I ended up returning it. The lid never stayed closed. I had to set something heavy on it to keep it closed. Many times it just wouldn't stay closed and the wipes dried out. I could have exchanged it for another wipe warmer, but decided not to because my son didn't seem to care whether or not the wipes were warm or cold. He didn't fuss with the cold wipes. I did find that that it was much easier to use with the Pampers wipes that pop up instead of the Huggies wipes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"Yes, they are warm but you waste 6-10 wipes per pkg that are so dry they are stiff. Pampers are on the drier side anyway it just isnt a necessity. I'm taking them back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"We purchased this for our son because he would start every time we put a cold wipe on his bottom. Yes, now he has warm wipes, but the negatives far outweigh that one positive:1) The sponge is a pain to saturate. I have to use a whole bottle of water to make sure that it's fully saturated (purified water is expensive enough, but worth it for drinking. Not for warming wipes).2) The lid is a pain to close. I have to pull back that little tab about 4 times before the lid finally snaps shut. Of course, by that time, the wipe isn't warm anymore, so it rather negates the purpose in having the thing.3) The wipes come out 3-4 at a time, and then I have to stuff them back in. What a hassle.4) The wipes are really wet, and slide around on my son's bottom more than they actually wipe. The condensed water makes them too slippery.I'll revert to warming the wipes in my hand first - that's what we do when we're away from home anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unnecessary Item...","review":"We were really excited about such a cool gadget, but it turned out to be a useless item for a number of reasons. Although the wipe warmer works well and just as described, the few seconds it takes to get the warm and cozy wipe from the warmer to the baby's bottom, the wipe turns cold, which defeats the purpose of having a wipe warmer. The other not so obvious reason we don't have much use for the wipe warmer is because throughout the day I change my son's diapers wherever we may be at the moment, i.e. on the living room couch, in baby room, on the bed in our bedroom, etc; but the wipe warmer must be plugged in to keep the wipes warm and therefore is not really a portable item and can not be where I need it at all times. I give it 2 stars only because it actually works as promised."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT WORTH THE HEADACHE!","review":"I recently purchased this wipe warmer to keep my two month old from waking up completely during changes at night. At first it was a life saver,before I bought it I was warming up wipes in my hands, now I realize it was not worth the investment.The lid constantly pops open on it's own so that the wipes keep cooling back off, after you try to shut it several times. The sponge constantly dries out drying out most of my wipes with it, I end up having to wet it on a daily basis. Overall if you don't have a whole bunch of patience and a heavy sleeper(the noise each time you try to close the lid) stick to warming your wipes in your hands before wiping."},{"rating":"1","title":"WASTE OF MONEY","review":"Being a new mom I wanted to be prepared and bought just about every item available, out of everything I purchased this turned out to be the biggest waste of money.

WASTE OF MONEY!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple changes could make this less awful","review":"How anyone could give this a positive review I do not know. It doesn't fit a full pack of wipes so the lid won't close all the way when refilled (door ajar). Then the individual wipes door will not stay shut, popping open time and again. This is very frustrating with a squirming kid on the table and a time constraint...The doors pop open, then the wipes dry out, wasting even more money. It's junk. It is nice when it works perfectly, then I like it quite well, warm wipes soothing baby and all, but that's 5% of the time, maybe.

Truth be told, it works well as a warmer: we used with the washcloths provided and moistened Quickables. The sponge at the bottom keeps everything moist and warm.But our son developed a persistent diaper rash within a week, and after weeks of trying to get it cleared up (thanks, Zinc Oxide and Lotrimin), we decided to stop using the warmer for wipes since it was just a incubator for yeast and bacteria. Going back to (cold) wet wipes, he is now perfectly happy and not a blemish on his bum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Warm","review":"I was not impressed with this wipe warmer. The wipes are really more like room temperature at best. I can not find replacements in stores for the pad in the bottom of the warmer. The pad dries out in less than a week and I end up wasting about an inch of the wipes because they dry out. I wish I would have saved my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need a lid lock","review":"We have two wiper warmers. Two different makers. Both work fine. One has a lid that locks after you put in the wipes. This one from Prince Lionheart didn't come with one.

The other brand is still working for us. Get one with a lid that locks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wipe Warmer","review":"This is a good product to have.

WOW, what a waste of money! If purchasing this item make sure you can place it somewhere where there is an outlet, be able to place it on some sort of protector to protect your changing table from water damage, and also be prepared to also buy the travel wipes warmer because your little one will get use to their bottom only being wiped with warm wipes which is not always so convenient if your out and about or traveling. I didn't know why my Mother laughed at me when I told her I purchased this and now I know why. Save your money and purchase something your baby really needs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that thrilled","review":"I purchased this item because of the great reviews it got here, but I am not impressed. It does generate a lot of condensation soaking the wipes at the bottom too much and making their scent disipate. The wipes at the top when the dispenser was full really weren't all that warm. I have to say there needs some improvement."},{"rating":"1","title":"The least useful item!","review":"We were told that we must buy this item prior to the birth of our first daughter...wish that we had not listened. This product takes up a lot of useful space. The wipes dried out very quickly and you had to replace the \\"activator\\" pad at the bottom too frequently. I don't know about other parents, but we didn't really have the time or the energy to keep the wipes warmer functioning properly. It takes quite a bit of time and effort. I agree with the other reviews that say that by the time you actually pull the wipes out of the warmer and get ready to use them, the wipes have cooled down to room temperature. Our baby didn't really notice a huge difference. I am sure that this product has been helpful to some, but we felt that it took a lot of work for this product to be effective. Who has any extra time with a newborn? This is a product that our family could certainly live without!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous waste of money","review":"The wipes dry out quickly or are too soggy, there was no in between. Furthermore, this thing is really a gimmick \\"you must have this for your child to be a good mother!\\" piece of junk. YOur baby won't die of hypothermia if you don't have a wipe warmer. If the thing is that cold, hold it in your hand for a few minutes. Sold mine on ebay. Don't waste your time or money. Put the twenty bucks in your kid's college fund instead. It's a much better investment"},{"rating":"1","title":"silly","review":"This item is not worth the money. It dries out your wipes very quickly and you have to replace the \\"activator\\" in the bottom frequently. The wipes don't get that warm and as soon as they reach the air they are cooled to room temp. Just hold the wipes in your hand a few seconds and it does the same thing.

BIG MISTAKE!!! Our son never cries when a wipe touches his bottom thanks to the wipe warmer. We buy the Pampers refills and put the entire package in. The wipes stick to each other when pulling one out, but a little shake of the wrist and they come apart. I spend that extra time bonding with my baby. I have no problems with the wipes drying out or browning. After you reach the bottom, you have to re-wet the sponge, but it's no hassle considering the tears it will save. We keep ours plugged in all the time and have never had any problems with ours."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely pleased!","review":"I really wasn't sure about what i was looking for when i started looking into wipe warmers, but this has surpassed any expectations i had.

I owned this product and then switched to the \\"Munchkin\\" wipes warmer. The reason it is expensive is because you cannot use it on it's own; you have to buy Lionheart replacement pillows which are unnecessary. You can pay as much as $12.00 for a pair, which have to be replaced every 3 months. However, the reason why the Lionheart warmer cannot warm properly is because it does not have a seal. Therefore, it does not lock any of the heat and moisture created. On the other hand for example, the Munchkin warmer which I own now, has two locks on each side which seals warm air/moisture. Also, it just requires 1/2 cup of water with each set of wipe addition.Even if the Lionheart warmer was locked, it would still be an OK product since you would still have to purchase the replacement pillows..."},{"rating":"2","title":"It has held up for 2 years!","review":"I bought this when my son was born 27 months ago and have never had one problem with it. Replacing the moist pad is easy and affordable. They last for a few months if you soak them in water to clean them between wipes refills. I could not have lived with out this wipes warmer the past two years of changing diapers. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Warmer","review":"I received my first Prince Lionheart Wipeswarmer when our first child was born. The button to release the top that reveals the pop-up feature broke almost immediately. We had to lift the lid each time and get water all over the place. The warming pad also dries out much quicker than 1 week so be sure to wet it often or it will dry out and burn. I bought a second Prince Lionheart warmer recently after our second child was born (since the other one had broken and become annoying to use.) I figured the first one's breaking had been a fluke. Low and behold the warmer made it 2 days and the button release broke once again...which shows its a defective part of the product. It will no longer stick down so you find it left open all day and your wipes have all dried out. I don't recommend this warmer to anyone. It's a complete waste of money and very poorly made."},{"rating":"1","title":"its alright","review":"It seems to work well but you have to re-wet the sponge that goes in the bottom a few times a day or it will dry out all you baby wipes.

They need to make it work for the Huggies wipes, because the Pampers wipes are thin. The Huggies wipes stay warm until you wipe baby's bottom, but this thing is designed for thinner pop-up wipes. Also, I had a problem with the latch on the top lid. Sometimes all I had to do was gently bump the changing table while restocking with supplies and the lid popped up. More than once we've come home to dried out wipes because for no apparent reason the lid was open. We switched to the DEX wipe warmer. Still designed for the pop-ups, but it has a handy light for night time changes."},{"rating":"2","title":"This warmer is GREAT!!!","review":"This is one of the best gifts I received for my baby shower. The warm wipes really help to get that \\"stuck on\\" poop off my babies bottom without having to rub hard. I use the Wal-Mart brand, White Cloud, wipes with this warmer. They are pop-up and much softer and cheaper than any other wipes I have used. Every time I refill the wipes, I wet the sponge, and I have never had a wipe turn brown or dry out.THIS IS A DEFINITE FOR ANY NEW MOM!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy Baby Boy","review":"My son from the first time I changed him hated it. However since I have been using the wipes warmer which I recieved as a shower gift he does not mind being changed hardly at all. When I have to use cold wipes out of the diaper bag he screams and cries until I am done. However with the wipes from the warmer he sits there and smiles. I agree with one reviewer that the \\"pop-up\\" feature only works with pampers wipes from what I have seen so far, but I prefer to use only the pampers sensitve wipes anyway because they don't irritate by son's bottom. Also, I have never had any problems with wipes drying out I add a little water to the pad once a week and it works great! I highly recommend this to anyone who wants to keep a happy baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love it - but it's not safe.","review":"I really do love this product. However, after a while of wondering \\"where the heck is this water coming from\\" I realized what was happening (and that was the last day I used it).What happens is that moisture builds up on the inside of the lid. When you open the lid (the whole thing, not the little pop top) all of that collected moisture streams down the back of the lid and slips out the back and onto the electrical connection. Everyone knows that water and electricity just doesn't mix!You would think they would have put some sort of rubber gasket or something around the edges to stop that from happening.But please, for safety's sake...DON'T USE THIS PRODUCT."},{"rating":"1","title":"it does not warm the wipes","review":"I tried everything - putting more water, less wipes and the \\"warmer\\" continues to leave my pampers wipes cold and very wet.

The first day we used it, the top that pops open broke. Very poor design. That said, it does warm the wipes. But it's so annoying to use now that I can't just push the button to have the top pop open. We just have the top resting on it, and it takes two hands. It's ok with our toddler, but I think with a newborn, when you want to have one hand on the baby, this would not be very convenient to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the Job","review":"Our little boy was constantly fussy during those cold diaper changes.

However, there are a few downsides to this product. The instructions say to replace the ever-fresh pillow every 3 months and to re-wet the pillow every 1 week. I found that it dried out and browned unless you wet it every 3-4 days and the pillow only lasted about 2 months. Also, I only place about 1/3 of the package of wipes in the warmer and put the rest in a ziploc.

However, I am a big fan of the warmer. It keeps the wipes really wet, thus they work better! I also like that I can keep the wipes out on her changing table without the ugly plastic package. As for the drying out problem that other reviewers have mentioned I just keep a bottle of water in her changing table cupboard and pour some in every couple of days. There is no rule about how much water one can pour in at one time so when I refill the warmer I put quite a bit of water in and make sure the pad is soaked on each side. I think it's well worth it; wetter wipes work better so I can use two warm wipes when I otherwise would've used three or four cold, sort of dry wipes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as great as the \\"old\\" version","review":"Between caring for my newborn and a two year old, I have forgotten to add water to the unit on more than one occasion. The pad in the bottom has become hard and burned and I am so afraid about this that I have taken the unit out of the nursery and I am no longer using it. Do any of us need one more thing to remember or one more chore to attend to? I much prefer the older version of this product which was a top down warmer. They are much safer than warmers with the heating element in the bottom. The only down side to a top down warmer is you dont have a pop up system to dispense wipes and they sometimes stick together when you try to remove them from the unit. Still I wish they never changed the design."},{"rating":"1","title":"more trouble than it's worth","review":"I bought this warmer for the obvious reason. Pampers wipees are the only wipes I could get to use also and the moisture pad that is kept in the bottom of the warmer needs constent water. You have to keep a very close eye or it dries up and so do half of your wipes. The pop up lid on mine stopped staying shut about 6 months after using the product, so I have to open the entire lid and when I do so water from condensation does spill out. My son is 10 mo now and I finally unpugged it because I was tired of the water mess and dry moisture pad. We're expecting another baby and I plan on buying a different product."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Necessary Luxury for Baby","review":"I received this as a shower gift and debated on returning it because I didn't know if I would really need it. I decided to keep it and am so glad I did. My son is 3 months old and he has loved changing time from the start because of the wipes warmer. He smiles and coos while getting changed, even in the middle of the night. The only annoyance is the pad at the bottom - you really have to keep it wet and stay on top of that. I try to remember to re-saturate it every 3-4 days, because otherwise it starts to get brown and hard. I would also recommend replacing the pad a little more often than the manufacturer states (every 3 months) perhaps every 2 months. This is definitely a product worth investing in. If you buy it, buy a few replacement pads just to have on hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Necessary, and Flawed","review":"I like the idea of warm wipes for baby...but I was very disappointed with this product. First of all, the dispenser is useless. We got so frustrated trying to get the wipes to dispense properly out of the top that we just gave up and opened the whole unit to get to them during changes.

However, we have been extremely disappointed ever since we plugged it in.First, there is no \\"on - off\\" switch, so if it's plugged in, it's always on. Second, the wipes are really not kept very warm - if you don't use them in less than a second, they're cold again - eliminating the reason why we bought this in the first place. Third, the wipes aren't dispensing through the top, so we have to lift the entire lid each time - a big inconvenience when you have a squirming baby.

Wipe warmer to the rescue. I purchased this three years ago for my daughter and are now using it with my newborn. Although it is not a necessity, it certainly is a luxury. My 3 month old definitely knows the difference when I use a cold wipe away from home. It is important to check the pad frequently and keep it moist to avoid drying out the wipes. Other than that, it is a great product.

It dried out the wipes and we ended up throwing a bunch out. Our son didn't show any sort of preference of warm vs cold wipes. Sure with a baby boy the cold wipes give a greater chance of \\"spraying\\", but it still happened with the warm wipes. Not to mention now that he is 14 months old he stands up on the changing table and opens the top and pulls all the wipes out of it.

But I am basically using it as just a glorified wipe box, because it's too much of a pain to do the warming part. There is this cloth that you put in the bottom that you have to make sure is always moist, and you have to keep it moist with bottled or distilled water. So I just throw a package of refills in it and use it just like that, with no warming. It looks really nice in my nursery, nicer than just a refillable box of Pampers wipes or something, but not worth the money to use just like this. I wouldn't have bought it myself, so it was nice to receive it as a shower gift.Plus, I like having my baby used to room temp wipes, because when I go out with her and do diaper changes with room temp wipes, she is used to it and doesn't throw a fit. She didn't like room temp wipes at first, but now she expects them at room temp and doesn't mind diaper changes at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of yeast!","review":"We bought a warmer when our baby was about 3 months old, since winter was approaching. A few days after we started using it, she broke out with a vicious diaper rash, which turned out to be yeast. (We treated it with Lotrimin -- the foot fungus/jock itch cream.)A friend happened to ask \\"How's the baby,\\" so I casually mentioned the rash. The first thing she said was, \\"You don't have a wipes warmer, do you?!\\" She then told me of other mothers who warned her to never use one, because of the propensity to grow bacteria in the warm wet environment. (It's the bacteria that throw off the baby's balance, allowing the yeast to grow unchecked.)So, after owning this product for only a week, we threw it directly in the trash. Our baby is 10 months old now and we have not had a problem since. Be warned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Danger for Girls","review":"I was told by my pediatrician to not buy a wipe warmer for a baby girl because the warm moist wipes allow bacteria to grow, which can cause infection and problems with the internal and external vaginal area.

The lid opens with the wipe and you wind up having to use two hands - not safe or efficient with a baby on the changing table (A Pain!!). I took it back and got the Wipe Warmer with changing light by DEX and am very happy with it. It has locks on the lid so you can use it with any type of wipe, a night light, a window to see how many wipes remain inside AND there's NO NEED TO BUY SPECIAL FOAM INSERTS EVERY FEW WEEKS.

It does not work with huggies but does work with all Pampers wipes. This doesn't bother us because we prefer pampers.

We have 2, one for upstairs and one for downstairs. So worth the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Warmer","review":"The warmer does a pretty good job warming the wipes.

The many I faults I found were the following:1) The only wipes that work in the popup dispenser are Pampers.2) The pillow has to be saturated once a week for proper use. If you forget, the pillow and a stack of the bottom wipes dry out and become brown. (It claims the pillow doesn't have to be changed for 3 months...my daughter is going on 4 months and I've gone through 3 pillows only forgetting to saturate twice.)3) The extreme moisture from the wipes requires a washcloth or towel on hand to wipe your baby's bottom after the intial wipe, and4) The wipe is cold by the time it gets to baby's bottom.I wouldn't recommend this product. I gave it one star because it wouldn't let me give it zero."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruined by Changing Table","review":"This product ruined by new son's changing table, which would have been converted to his bureau when older.

Frankly, I do not think this product should be sold without it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the greatest things I've ever used","review":"I really wanted to have a wipe warmer, thinking my son would prefer warm wipes over cold. Well, we used it for 6 weeks and it worked, but we did have a few problems. Number one, the wipes get SO WET that they don't clean as well and you end up using more wipes than you normally would. Second, the top wouldn't latch properly so we were constantly having to pull the front tab out to get it to close correctly. Also, I was constantly pulling out more than one wipe at a time and having to stuff them back inside. It did keep the wipes nice and warm, but I finally decided it wasn't worth the hassle and put it away in favor of the wipe holders that come with the wipes. They just work better and my son couldn't care less if the wipes are warmed or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"works but there is waste","review":"I returned it because it dried out the wipes on the top and SOAKED the ones on the bottom - there was too much waste.

In theory.But I washed that pad in the washing machine, soaked it with distilled water every time, rotated the wipes, etc. etc. Seems like we all did everything we were supposed to do. And the pad still gets brown and the wipes are dry.The top lid doesn't latch, and that seems to be why the wipes dry out (not because of warming).This product is great for the first few days. You're much better off with the plastic pop-top container you can buy wipes in. Then just warm the wipes in your hands."},{"rating":"1","title":"MammaZee","review":"We were rather disappointed with this warmer and ended up returning it and getting the Dex warmer which works MUCH better.

Not worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dries out wipes","review":"We live in a very cold weather area, and theres nothing worse then having to rub a cold wipe on poor baby in the middle of the night. The wipe warmer made perfect sense...HOWEVER...it dries the wipes out so much that it hardly does the job its intended for--cleaning baby bottoms. We don't use it at all anymore, just deal with cold wipes that clean our daughter. Great idea, needs work."},{"rating":"2","title":"You need this for a winter baby","review":"I love this item because my newborn would scream when wiped with non-warmed wipes. It is true, the pop-up feature is not very good. We have tried every type of wipe with it and found that the Huggies wipes work best with it. Even still, they don't always \\"pop\\" out like they should and you have to lift the top, but for me it was worth it for the benefit of a warm bottom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very warm....","review":"I had the Munchkin wipe warmer with my son, but decided to try something different with my second baby. The reviews for the Prince Lioheart warmer seemed great, so I thought I would give it a try. My husband and I did not like it at all. I mean we loved the style of the warmer, but what we didn't like about it was that there is no top warmer as the warmer is strictly on the bottom, therefore the wipes aren't that warm. The Munchkin warmer has a top and bottom warmer, so all your wipes are nice and warm for your baby. Like I said, this is a very nice warmer, but it is just missing a top warmer in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-So Wipe Warmer","review":"I ordered this warmer after using a DEX warmer for the last 2 years. This warmer is so-so. It does not hold as many wipes as my original DEX; it varies with keeping the wipes very moist or sometimes dry by the bottom of the pile and it doesn't seem to lock closed to allow me to pull out the wipes. With these frustrations, it forced me to have my DH open up our DEX and fix the loose wire. We are now back to using the DEX - which we couldn't find anywhere to repurchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pamper your baby!","review":"I really like this product. I put in the Huggies pop up wipes and don't really have any problems. When the wipes are getting down to the bottom, they sometimes fall through the top so I have to pull them back through. I re-wet the fresher pad everytime I add more wipes and I've never had dried or browned wipes. Besides, what baby doesn't like a warm wipe versus a cold one?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ditched it after 2 weeks","review":"I found that in order to keep the wipes warm you had to severly saturate the sponge on the bottom.

I would definitely recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't be fooled on this item","review":"The purpose of this item is to warm baby wipes, unfortunately it didn't work that way. It does warm a little bit but couple of sec after you take a piece of wipes out of the warmer, it's darn cold. Other than that, the lid lock doesn't hold well, it takes all your time just to fix it, to keep it close. If it happens to have a 0 rating here, I should have given them that. Waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"The warmer comes with the Ever Fresh Pad ($7.99 for 2)..\\"necessary to prevent browning and to keep the unit sanitary\\" but the bottom layers of wipes go brown anyway so at the end I had to throw away many wipes. Off course I try keeping a lot of water in the bottom but then when I got to the bottom wipes they were drenched, and I had to squeeze each wipe in order to use them.One more thing, each time you open the lid to check the pad, or because the \\"pop up\\" feature doesn't work (it just works with Pampers Wipes), water will spill out and you'll think the pad is still wet when it's really not. If you buy it, be sure to check the botton at least twice a week, if not I'm sure the pad will be dry and the wipes brown."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish","review":"This warmer broke after only 2 months of use. It as extremely hot on the bottom and every time you grab a wipe,it opens so you end up having to use two hand to operate. The whole warmer is quite heavy and when moved it's cumbersome, not for easy diaper changes in another room. Only wipes that worked in it were Pampers, all other we have to pull out by opening it. What a waste of money! I have since purchased a Munchkin Warmer and was VERY pleased with that one thus far. That model has a lock on the door, as to not fly open every time you grab a wipe!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lid keeps popping open, wipes browning...","review":"While its nice to use warm wipes on baby's bottom, the lid doesn't stay closed anymore after a few months use.

Not only do you have the maintenance of always having to keep the pad wet (trust me, you don't think about that until it has already dried your wipes out), but when it is wet and working, it makes the wipes TOO moist!

Their lead singer, Jarett Reddick, will in the middle of a song put his guitar pick in his mouth and send it sailing into the air, catch it, and then keep playing. The songs and harmonies that they have are great. Songs like \\"The Bitch Song\\" and \\"Belgium\\" (Which is reminiscent of Green Day's \\"When I come around\\") are songs that get their share of radio play on Dallas' KDGE \\"the edge\\". They have gone head to head on that radio station and beaten bands like 311 and other big bands. Locally they are loved and nationally they should break through with these great songs.

Easy to turn inside out and tie a knot without making a mess of it, and the plastic is thick enough that you don't really feel the poo texture through it.

At least use a produce bag, bread bag, or a Subway bag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"We bought these from a pet store originally to replace the grocery store bags we had been using.

Didn't merit being added to my library, so I passed it on to a former classmate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remarkable Alright!","review":"This one of the dumbest books I have ever read--not that I finished it--I tossed it after I read about three chapters. I thought I was going to be reading about the life of Millard Fillmore and it turned out to be stories about what the author thought Fillmore's life might have been. The book is not even satire, as I understand it. I really didn't care to be reminded that frontier women smoked pipes and spit into spitoons. If I had known that the book was just silly, crude attempts at humor I would not have purchased it.

I was surprised that it wasn't. My quick review of the back cover blurb led me to believe I had found a good biography. Once I caught on that the book is intended as humor, I became annoyed that the author had no interest in distinguishing fact from fiction. I tired of reading it at around page 60. I wanted to know about Fillmore. This book only ridicules him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Presidential Biographies","review":"I am trying to read biographies/autobiographies of the presidents in order.

It's really more of a sophomoric mocking of biographers and historians who conduct actual research and write compelling stories of people's lives. It's just not funny, but rather silly in a way-too-full-of-himself way. Do not waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to tell where the \\"joke\\" is","review":"As we learned with the author's poorly researched last book, he is not above making things up when it suits his theory or whim. Here, he makes the whole book up in a misguided effort to be amusing in an effete drawing room style. The truth is that the entire book would amount to a three minute Saturday Night Live sketch or maybe two pages in MAD magazine. I really don't know why you would bother with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should NOT be your first bio of Millard Fillmore","review":"While, admittedly, the book is very well written and funny it should NOT be the first bio you read of the 13th President. I only wish I had read the reviews first!This book should not be catagorized as \\"Biography\\" but rather \\"Historical Fiction\\". My first realization that the book was not what I thought occurred when I noticed on the back cover Millard Fillmore was sited as being at the Battle of the Alamo!!With all of that said, I did enjoy the book especially how the actual history was woven into the author's tall tales.

That is, the author was blending B.S. with some reality. I have been chronologically reading a biography of each president; I wanted serious truth. I am wondering if the author, George Pendle, was trying to mimic a Forrest Gump type of character in hopes that a movie producer might pick it up, and produce a movie on it?Unless a person likes to read stupid books, my advice is to stay far removed from this p.o.s.Sincerely,Scarback"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"The book covers a broad range of short stories revealing the culture in a very unique way.

That being said, his story adds insight to our understanding of one the most ferocious battles of World War II. Few Japanese soldiers ever survived these battles late in the war. Col. Yahara provides a higher level look at what was going on behind the scenes than is often the case. If you're looking for a general overview of the battle or a look at what life was like on the front line, this is not your book.

It is very durable. However, it fits 72mm filters with ease. 77mm filters are a tight fit. 82mm filters is a very tight fit. Also putting 6 filters in this wallet makes it feel like it would burst at the seams, but it never broke on me yet (and it has been 10 years of use on my oldest one).Would I recommend this wallet? Heck yeah!It is not bulky like some others and does the job of protecting the filters. The see through pockets allows me to quickly see which filter is in which pocket without fumbling around looking for the one I need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Portable Filter Holder","review":"I still have a few physical filters I use outside of Photoshop, and this filter wallet holds them nicely. Because it folds closed, the larger filters fit better at the top. I have a few filters I like to keep in their original cases, and those barely fit. If I stick them in the bottom slots, the wallet doesn't roll/fold where it should to line up the velcro closure, so if you can't part with those old square Cokin filter cases with the nice labels and pretty example photos, this may not be the best solution for you. The pockets are mesh with a slight stretch to them. For filters outside the cases, it's a great solution, just not a dust free one."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a really big FAQ","review":"The way the books of this series work is that they took a guide for new rangers in Yosemite with the 100 or so most frequently asked questions, and wrote their own answers for each park. It's a great format because it makes for easy reading beforehand, but it's also quick as a reference when you're there because they're arranged in an intelligent order. There's also a huge reference section at the end with lists, copies of permit forms, and so forth. So the thing to do is read the FAQ before you leave but bring the book and refer to it once you're there.I've been to Yosemite four or five times since I've purchased this book, and still find it useful. Partially this is because if you go in different seasons there are different things to see, and sometimes you just want a pizza and that's in there too (Camp Curry has good pizza, if anybody's curious)."},{"rating":"2","title":"High quality controller","review":"Easy to install- and got my 1967 furnace back on line in no time.

When the product arrived at my house, I never got the English instructions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Based on these reviews it seems like I got the wrong item: this model is horrid.","review":"This is a tiny snap together kit, so the problems are hard to hide. There is a big ugly seem around the ill-fitting saucer parts, which was impossible to smooth out. The naselles don't actually fit onto the stalks, and have to be carved down quite a bit (like most of the parts) to get them straight. The little point on the satellite dish snapped off before I even got the dish on. I like all the alternate parts-- too bad none of them fit together too well. Very unpleasant experience-- I might try another kit at some point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective starboard nacelle design","review":"I recently bought two Polar Lights Star Trek Enterprise model kits, from two separate sellers, and both have the same flaw, the starboard nacelle will not attach properly!If it had happened to just one model I would think it was just a fluke, but when I had the exact same problem with a second model, then I knew it was an overall defect with that model design.This is the newer, Round2, version of the Polar Lights Star Trek Enterprise model. I have no idea if the original Polar Lights model had the same defect, or not.As it is, I cannot recommend this Polar Lights model to anyone. I will stick with the larger AMT version of the Star Trek U.S.S. Enterprise NCC-1701 model, with glue required. The glue-together models are more fun anyway.MACJR"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mythical and mystical account of Coastal Tall Redwoods","review":"This is a fabulous account of the search for the tallest trees and the resulting studies of the canopy ecosystems. This may sound dry but it is so beautifully written that it is a book you cannot stop reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was fascinated","review":"I didn't expect that the book would be so mesmerizing...I couldn't put it down. Part of that is driven by the fact that I'm a native of the area the book was written about and it was as if I had traveled to another country I'd never visited before. I so much enjoyed the details; descriptions of flora and fauna along with the characters and their emotional lives. It was a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Caution: Profanity","review":"Interesting subject matter. Contains profanity, so beware when playing in presence of children.

Richard usually writes thrillers, but this one wasn't. It was just bad. If he had condensed it into a short story at dinner, and paid, I might have enjoyed it. Maybe super-environmentalist-hippie-types will love it, but not me. I tried to read it on vacation. Boring. I left it at the hotel. (Marriott, Grand Cayman if you want to go get it.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"How to make a fascinating subject unreadable","review":"My book club read this book based upon a suggestion from someone who had heard about it but not read it. While the subject was fascinating, and the book began somewhat promisingly, by the time I reached the halfway mark I knew that I couldn't finish it. This so-called narrative non-fiction was nearly impossible to follow as Preston jumped from one unappealing person to the next without tying together an apparent story line. But, worst of all, the writing wasn't very good. Interestingly enough, the book club critique was unilaterally poor, and most members, like me, chose not to finish it. When one member mentioned that her 7th grader had read the book as part of the school curriculum, it made sense, because the writing style made the book more appropriate for Middle School readers than adults."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs a Ruthless Edit","review":"This book could easily have been edited in half, so much of it was irrelevant fluff. Yes there was a story to be told, but it was padded out with the prosaic details of it's subjects personal lives. Why would we want to know their golf handicaps, or what they have for breakfast? These people are interesting for the exceptional things they do, and where some context in their wider experiences would have added power and meaning to the story, Preston simply over does this, and actually weakens the story.The writing style is painfully uneconomical. Condensing the narrative, and increasing the complexity of its sentence structure would intensify the reading experience.I believe the science described in this book. I think it's important and it interests me, but there just wasn't enough of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who knew?","review":"Who knew that SO MUCH of the old growth forests had been logged? I mean, I knew it had been a LOT, but 97% in Oregon? I am shocked and saddened.Who knew that no scientists had really begun to explore tall trees canopies until the 1990s? That they were a mystery to science until so recently? An unexplored frontier? How totally exciting!This book reads in places like a novel, sometimes a thriller, sometimes a romance. In other places, the pure science is fascinating and holds its own. The \\"characters\\" are a curious lot of obsessives, and I enjoyed the authors' real entry into their world as more than a passive observer/interviewer. Taking his family on a tree-climbing vacation in Scotland? Wonderful! I hope this book brings much, much attention to the sad status of old growth forests in this country and the world -- I highly recommend it. You will find yourself saying, \\"Did you know. . . ?\\" a lot afterwards."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Jewel Among the Rocks","review":"My wife and I are voracious readers and often settle for books that are OK, but not noteworthy. Every so often a jewel pops out of nowhere and The Wild Trees is just such a book.We were early readers of The Life of Pi, and feel this book is just such a read. Editorially, they are miles apart, but both books surprise you by just being wonderful and refrshing.Within 30 pages of the start, you will be breathless, and then the character development begins. There is the poor son of a billionaire, a wonderful love story and of course the trees. The wonderful magnificent trees. And, it's all true.I just bought 12 copies to send to my reading friends and just felt it would be a good thing to let others know.Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oldest living things on earth.?","review":"If you have ever wanted to see or have seen the California redwoods, you will enjoy this book. Richard Preston got so interested in the trees that he learned to climb them--a feat equal to mountain climbing and just as dangerous, so he could experience them first hand. These ancient plants, thought to be between 2,000 and 3,000 years old, are a world apart from any other plants living today. Because they are so unusual, individual trees have been named, climbed, measured, and thoroughly explored from the ground to the tip. The exact location of the tallest specimens is a well kept secret by the botanists who have studied them. Richard Preston's book, which reads like an adventure novel, is a very good read about a most unusual subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"This will knock your socks off!","review":"Holy Cow! If you are even remotely interested in the environment or the giant redwood trees, this book will knock your socks off! The beginning is a little confusing because of so many different characters, but Preston brings it all together in a page turning frenzy. I could hardly put it down. His descriptive writing made my mouth & eyes water with envy! Absolutely amazing documentary style of getting the truth out about how important our forrests are!

Great insight into what motivates canopy explorers--and the biological treasures they find there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wild Trees. A secret in our own backyard","review":"I loved the book.I was a quick read. It read more like a novel than a text book or a normal book of non-fiction.It opened a whole world I was only slightly aware of; the old growth forest in the northwest and around the world, the biodiversity of the tall canopy and the whole idea that there are parts of the world and in North America that are totally unexplored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one","review":"Unless you really really really love botany and tree climbing, I'd skip this one.

This book is among the best I've ever read. I loved it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One day I read a boring book","review":"Giant Redwoods, a fascinating subject dulled by the lackluster writing style of this book. I thought I had read a chapter twice only to realize that it began with the same sentence as an earlier chapter. \\"One day in the middle of October 1987...\\" Both chapters then went on to describe people who were tree enthusiasts, had fear of heights and a penchant for Dungeons and Dragons.Some info added nothing to the tale like the 3 pages about selling knives to the country club set, boooring. I bought this book to learn about the trees but got a lot of boring nonsense throughout.When the Dyerville Giant fell it wasn't explained why they still wondered what the height of the tree was. Isn't the height of a tree lieing on its side the same as when it is standing? Seemed like a missed opportunity much like this entire book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scientific yes, but very dull","review":"This was at least our tenth book in our bookclub and the feelings were unanimous. Most people could not even trudge to the end of the book. The main issue was that there was no real character development and the author seems to insert tidbits about the people's lives that do not add to the story or the development of their characters. The story (if there is one) jumps around with no point, it seems. I will say that the information was accessible and a couple people actually became interested in seeing the trees, which is a nice aside. But overall the book was just dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wild Trees should be a classic.","review":"The Wild Trees ought to be a classic.Don't approach this book with literary tweezers. Just loosen up and go with the flow. To call it a \\"non-fiction narrative\\" sounds too uptight. Have you ever sat around a campfire and shared stories? That's the way to approach The Wild Trees. As if someone were telling a real story to you around a campfire.The pages are stuffed with a lot of tree and redwood facts as far as story books go. And it appears to be at least 99% accurate regarding tree stuff.One outstanding chapter, of many, was about the Day of Discovery, when two main characters \\"bushwhacked\\" across most of Jedediah Smith Redwoods State Park and discovered the Grove of Titans: a grove with the 1st, 4th and 6th largest known coast redwoods.If you enjoy the book and have the time, read it through a second time.

It would be like going to the deep sea with Jacques Cousteau. What an amazing adventure with amazing and dedicated people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wild Trees is a great read","review":"For such an insipid title The Wild Trees is a good read. Although it contains some of the science that has been discovered in the Redwood canapy, the story primarily concerns the excentricity of the individuals that climb the trees in order to do the science. The book also leaves the reader with a sense of wonder on the majesty of the redwood forest. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful story and story telling","review":"Having visited the region and camped/hiked in Redwood National Park years ago, I found this a great science/adventure/exploration read and human interest story. Drags with a little too much detail about earlier lives of some of the main players, but some of that helps the reader understand the \\"crazy\\" folks who would even think of climbing to the top of these titans. It is the kind of book that opens new horizons and makes the reader want to learn more. The book has some sketches but lacks pictures that would help us ground dwellers grasp what it is like for humans to be in the tops of these trees.

This booked seems like it was rushed to print before Preston had come up with a suitable way to tell this story. When it gets to the part where he is involved directly with the characters it is more coherent but the chapters that tell the story of each character is better as a stand alone essay. It just seems like a book that is half baked....not crazy...just not ready. Where was the editor?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Preston Gifts Us Another....","review":"......super, super book.

One goal of any serious eastern meditation practice is to eliminate the false dualities so often present in human perception - including the duality of male/female. It is also a selfleess means to the cessation of suffering as exemplified by desires and attachments. It is not a means to enjoy yourself shamelessly or indulge the senses in pleasure-seeking, for these too are delusions.

I also noted very early in the book that scenes appeared that were, in some cases, almost word for word a copy of those found in Pride and Prejudice, both the book and the BBC mini series.

The second half of the book deals with individual potential, and leads the reader through examples, research and exercises to provide practical tools that foster postive change. The self-improvement concepts require concentration, and the reader needs to look past a few self-publishing rough edges.

Unfortunately, this book doesn't think hard enough. The book provides some reasonable advice (some of it common sense), but very little is backed up by data. The book's examples of bad or incriminating emails are the most vivid and entertaining sections, and probably the most valuable. The closing section touches on some practical guides like Getting Things Done and Inbox Zero...but then dismiss them in favor of a sort of quasi-organized half-assery.

The most mind boggling chapter is titled, \\"How to Write [the Perfect] Email\\": a title that is undeniably deceitful. This fruitless chapter uses the poor writing style of a preteen as an example.

My three girls age 7,5, and almost three love it. The other reviews that mentioned the sand getting wet is true, but not very wet though and the kids actually like it that way. It's easier for them to make sand castles. My only complaint is that it could be a little deeper.

And that's quite amazing because my 2 yrs. old can rarely sit still for an hour. The table is sturdy enough and I love that it has a cover to cover up the sand when not in use. Table is quite low, so sometimes my kids prefer to sit on a little chair to play the sand, instead of standing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad we purchased","review":"We purchased this sandbox as a surprise gift for my son's 3rd birthday. I read all of the sandbox reviews and decided on this because a stand up sandbox made more sense for his age and size, and because the less sand that comes in the house the better! It was a hit. The kids ignored the bounce house and the playscape and kids ages 15 months- 3 years pulled up kid sized chairs and all congregated around it in the backyard. My son woke up the day after his party and asked if the sandbox was still here and he went straight outside to play.

My 6 year old has tons of fun with it also. The extra shovels, pail, and claw it comes with are great, perfect size for the table. Its just the right height for my 2 year old. The kids enjoy burying toys in the sand, burying their hands, and scooping/digging with the tools. Its a bit shallow but after we put the sand in it doesn't seem to matter. The lid is great, the elastic ties keep it snugly over the table. We have it up against the house where there's an awning, so heavy rain isn't an issue for us. I was not able to have this shipped to Hawaii from Amazon so I bought it from another site, and paid a hefty $35 shipping. But I could not locate it in any store.

We filled it with ground walnut shells (the kind you can find in pet stores) as a non-toxic alternative to sand. I like that you can pick it up and move it -- we follow the shade around in our back yard. :) I also like that it has a lid, so you can shut out the neighborhood cats.

Step 2 definitely does this product right!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids were not dissapointed","review":"Even though I read it was shallow in other reviews I was very surprised at how shallow it actually is when I took it out of the box. Box also says it holds up to 80lbs of sand. That isn't happening - One 50 lb. bag nearly filled it to the top. Though I thought it seemed small my children LOVED it and couldn't be happier with their new sandbox. My daughter dug a hole in the sand to the bottom - looked up and said \\"its empty there\\" and just went a started a hole in another area. They are thrilled - so I'm thrilled. I did only give it 4 stars though because we have yet to experience if it truly is watertight or not as it has not rained since we set it up. But from looking at it, I think it will be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun but messy","review":"Our two-and-a-half-year-olds love this table. The included tools are a nice touch, but the kids mostly like to put sand in cups and bowls and bury their plastic toy animals. The table easily holds the contents of a regular 50-pound bag of play sand, though the amount seems to be dwindling over time as the kids keep spilling it. I can't speak of its being completely waterproof or not, as we keep it under a screened-in porch, and we like the sand a bit moist anyway to reduce flying dust. Oh, and on another note, don't leave cats unattended around the uncovered table for even a minute!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hours of Toddler Fun","review":"My 3 yr old received this toy for his birthday and he just loves it.

We set it up and filled it with water for her birthday party. There were toddlers there from 1-3 who all loved it. Whether as a water table or sand table, there are lots of things to do and ways to play at the table that will be both fun and educational. I think she will enjoy it for a long time, both by herself and with other children. It is extremely durable and I like that it also has a top to cover it and keep it clean when not in use. The top can also be flipped over to provide a track for toy cars and trucks. I think the age recommendation is for children 2+, but it is suitable for younger children as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wet Sand","review":"I bought this for my daughter's 2nd birthday and she LOVES it.

I had previously bought her one for her 2nd birthday which was a big hit with all the children at her party. That being her new favorite toy I thought it would be a good idea to have one at grandma's also. The sandbox was easily put together, is sturdy and has a nice tie down lid to keep out the rain and animals. I like that it is on legs so I can easily pull up a chair and play with her. Would definitely recommend this sandbox."},{"rating":"2","title":"sand table","review":"Good overall sand table. I thought it might not be deep enough but it is a good depth for what the kids need. It doesnt seem to keep their attention as long as I thought it would and there isnt any extra room to keep shovels and buckets, but i just keep those next to the table in a rubbermaid bin. Lid seems to work well, but i havent checked it after a big storm yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Perfect Perfect","review":"Got this for grandson's first birthday. He loves it. Everything about it is good--- the size and the height of the table, the cover for it and love that it is perfect size area wise for enough sand to have room for lots of fun stuff to put in it. My grandson pulls up and stands there for very long increments of time just enjoying it. It is on the deck but it can be moved anywhere and used anywhere. I am glad we got the just sand table and not the combined sand and water table.And the price was the best for this type product that we found anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun for little ones!!","review":"I ordered this sand box for my 20 month old, because he never seems to stay still and play, and he loves it! It was very simple to put together, just pop the legs in, add sand, and voila! It's great because it doesn't get sand all in shoes, socks, pants, clothes, etc. It has a nice lid that fits very tightly, and the top of the lid can also be used to play on. My 20 month old is tall for his age, but this is just about the right height for him to stand at comfortably. t came with a bucket, a few shovels and digging tools, and I bought a sand set to add to the mix. I would HIGHLY recommend this sand table!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied","review":"After reading all reviews, I decided on this sandbox. I like that it's elevated, though I wish it were a bit taller. Today was the first day my 2 year old played with it and she loved it. She pitched a fit when I told her it was time to go inside. I am going to keep it on our covered front deck so hopefully no rainwater will get in under the lid, which was one of the complaints others had. I do think that these things are way overpriced for what they are. I purchased 3 small bags of play sand at Wal Mart because I wanted to be sure I had enough, and I only put in one bag. It seemed like enough. I thought if I put in another one the lid would not fit well. The bags did not state the weight, so I'm not sure how much I used. The cashier thought they were 25 lbs."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent play activity","review":"Not opened yet, will wait for warmer weather.

Very light (can wobble)2. Not shallow enough as a real water table but enough for sand playI wish it was a bit heavier and shallower."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Play Therapy","review":"I am a play therapist and purchased this for my play room. I ordered 30 pounds of fine-grain play sand - which fits really well in the sandbox w/o worrying about spilling over during play. The kids love it! It is amazing how children's worlds come to live when they play with sand and appropriate toys. I plan to purchase another in the next few months, as my own son gets older and ready for a sandbox. Highly recommended - the lid is wonderful too, inhibits children from playing when you aren't in the room and contains the sand when not in use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't get much better than this....","review":"If you have kids, this is a great little toy. As simple as they come, a table you fill with sand, then put the cover on when you are done. Well made, sturdy, great price. It's not the biggest table out there but also not the most expensive. My kids LOVE it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leg holes not wide enough","review":"The table arrived and appeared easy to assemble. Simply push the legs into the appropriate holes on the table. However, the edges of the holes had not been \\"reamed\\" out, and so the plastic molding was not wide enough for the legs. I needed to file down the plastic inside all 4 holes to make them wide enough for the legs. Very disappointing. Also, the sand tray is not very deep, so you are only working with a limited amount of sand. Even then, in the normal course of play sand is easily brushed and pushed on to the floor. Not a very good design at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks","review":"I do not recommend this toy, huge waste of money. The table leaks where the cables go, leaving lots of water inside of the sand. I called to complain and see if they had a solution to this problem. The customer service Rep suggested we try putting silicone around the holes where the cable goes through. That was their only \\"fix\\". I tried it, only the silcone does not stay because the cables move it around. I have resorted to taking the cables out and filling them with silcone. Lets hope the wind doesn't blow the cover off of the sand table now. Hate to pay so much money for something I have to modify."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Gift Santa Ever Brought My Son","review":"So, my son asked Santa for a sandbox. I'm a single mom and had no clue how I'd build him that. So, I let Santa take care of it instead & this is what he showed up with. My son was 3 when this happened and he's 6 now. Still playing with it. The neighbor kids ask to play with it all the time, as well. It has been such a durable toy and he LOVES it. The lid has elastic bands that pull to hook on the bottom and keeps the rain out pretty well. It's a perfect height for toddler sized kids and now that my kiddo is 6, he plays with it on his knees. Toss in a shovel and a few trucks and you'll have entertainment for hours, every day, for multiple years. It's been such a good toy that I decided to hunt one down for my very best friend's son who is now turning 3. I feel every mother of a 3 year old boy should have this toy. It's the best gift Santa ever brought him, just ask him and he'll tell you. ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware! It leaks!","review":"We recently purchased this sand table for our 3 yr old, as she loves to play with sand, but were disappointed in it very quickly. We placed it on our deck with the lid securely attached, but after 1 night of rain, the entire inside is filled with water and the sand is ruined! There's no place for the water to go, so we now have to dump the entire thing. I've contacted Step 2 directly and was told by their Customer Service Rep that there's nothing they can/will do and she suggested we try putting silicone around the holes where the cable goes through. Just another poorly created product that the manufacturer continues to make money off of!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Happy","review":"I was so happy with the product, but by the end of summer I was SO mad. It was great at first, but eventually the lid stopped fitting and for the last few months of warm weather the sand sat under 3 inches of slimmy water. No amount of air or sun would have ever dried it out. Its such a good idea, but the lid doesn't keep water out. No one I know with regular sand boxes has trouble with water getting in so I don't know why this one does. Little Tikes needs to re-engineer it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My children love this box but the lid leaks.","review":"We bought this sand table for our sons 3rd Birthday. All of our children (ages 1, 3, and 8) love this box.

This was perfect!!! After much searching online this was the cheapest and fastest site to order from. This product is great SUPER steady and so far NO water has leaked through the cover. I would say the only down side is that it is semi shallow for digging but my 4yr old daughter and 2.5 yr old son BOTH play side by side and have a great time!! It is semi heavy when trying to lift after 50lbs of sand but I can and I am a small mommma!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of Fun","review":"My 2 year old son loves this sand table.

He immediately started playing with it and played for 2 hours! He loves it and plays with it daily for long periods of time. I don't know how durable it will be, but I think it will last as long as he will need it. I do like the fact that it's elevated, not ground level, so he doesn't get as dirty. I think its height will also discourages neighborhood cats, even when parents forget to cover the table. It's a great toy for pre-schoolers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Small But Functional","review":"This is a lot more shallow than I thought it would be but it is still a great little sand box.

As you read, you feel anguishingly bootstrapped to a neophytic writer whose prose is as unnavigable and fractured as the badlands of Bryce Canyon. I read 30 pages.

Thanks to the optimism meme we're all happier than we should be.It should not be forgotten that the 'meme' is merely a vaguely defined, hypothetical element of social transmission; let's not get carried away. I bet Richard Dawkins wishes he'd never bothered coining the term.Robert Aunger's 'The Electric Meme' demonstrates a more credible effort to grasp this rather strange notion.Apparently, if you hold a seashell to your ear it's memes you can hear - not the sea (Anon,2003)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Profoundly thought provoking","review":"This book is a rare gem, providing the general reader with an interesting and valuble way of looking at the sometimes mysterious cults of popularity that many ideas including religions, taboos and politics engender.

This is NOT the filter to choose when shooting outdoors in landscape settings, or when shooting clients against props like trees and cars.Trust me, this filter is incredible when used for what it was designed to be used for.With portraits this filter hides blemishes and gives a soft smoothing effect to a client's skin, while retaining sharpness and balance. With video, it enhances depth of field in addition to the above, and is a great tool when shooting with Interview style lighting.In the hands of a semi-professional or a professional, this is an invaluable tool to enhance your work.

They could barely be further removed - in the wrong direction - from the naive energy of the original.

My only complaint is that the measly memory card that's shipped with it is so inadequately sized as to be pracitically useless, so you'll have to spend another 30 to 50 bucks on a bigger card. Since one of the biggest benefits of digital photography is that you can take several shots of everything and then save just the best, I do see this as a significant shortfall.

It is so small, and so fast, I have no reason to leave it at home.This is my second digital camera I have owned, but have used many, and using other people's camera, even just to take a few shots for them, reminds me of why I love mine so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME CAMERA","review":"I am kind of a camera buying junkie I have owned 5 differant digital cameras from Fuji, Sony and Canon. This little Canon has been by far the best camera I have ever owned.My wife and I love the small size and how durable it is. It fits easily in a pocket or purse. We like to take it out with us when we are going out to eat or to have drinks with friends. The only complaint I can come up with is the flash is not as good as past Elph cameras.March 21 2010 Edited to add:We are still using this camera. It has had a rough life and shows a lot use but it still takes pictures just like the day we bought it. We also bought a Waterproof enclosure so we could use it in the water."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT","review":"I purchased this camera and was initially impressed with the product. However in less than five days and twenty pictures the viewing screen failed. I attempted to return the camera and was told by Canon that they are not going to fix the defect. They are trying to say that I damaged this camera. This will be the last Canon product that I purchase and I would encourage others to shop other cameras before purchasing this camera. It is very discouraging that a reputable company like Canon would not stand by thier product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Diving!","review":"Do not buy this camera if you want to use it for diving ... the only Canon underwater case made for it is only rated to 10 feet. The better rated cases do not fit."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think I'm going to return it...","review":"Well, I bought this for the size and because it's recommended by Consumer Reports. HOWEVER, I have several major complaints:1) the pictures just are not that great (focus-wise)2) the flash completely overpowers pictures so that subjects look all white3) the red-eye reduction does not work at all... I was unable to get indoor shots of my children without glowing red eyes4) the zoom is not very strong... I would rather be able to zoom in more5) As others have noted, there is no battery indicator.Oh well, I guess this is going back. I guess I'll start researching cameras, again!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"the best compact camera","review":"Excellent compact camera. Very small so you can carry it in any pocket. Very fast so you can take several pictures very fast. It does not have all the settings capabylities as a bigger or SLR camera but my main concern was to have an easy to carry camera. Good zoom (optical+digital), easy to use and easy to set. Far better than a Sony. Would recommend any SD from canon."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect!!","review":"What can I say? Its the best camera I\\"VE experienced! That doesn't mean its the best camera out there but to me it's PERFECT! The zoom quality: excellent! The picture quality: super! The resolution: wonderful! I absolutely love the video feature: it takes average videos when you just want to capture something quick. The ONLY problem i have, which doesn't bother me much is that i can never tell when the battery is running out until theres like 1 minute till it automatically shuts off. I think it could be improved by using reagular alkaline batteries instead of special camera ones. Anyhow I am still in love with this great camera. I would definately reccomend this to anyone looking for THE perfect camera!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Camera (compact)","review":"This camera has proved itself. I bought in May and received it in time for my cousin's wedding. Boy did it come in handy. I took snaps, takes great pictures, even with the zoom, it works very well.

You can change settings for what ever type of pictures and environment you want to snap shots in. U can set it on automatic and just let it do it all for you. I am quite happy with this camera.

The only fault I found with it is that the cover for USB connection is broken and falls off every time USB is used. This does not influence the quality of pics of course, but it's an incovenience because the part is small and could be easily misplaced. On the other hand, the camera was bought as used, sserves its primary function so I would say I got a good product for the price.

Controls are well-placed for ease of use while not being subject to accidental activation. The body is attractive and durable, but the flexible plastic battery/memory door should be handled very carefully.As all the ultra compact cameras the flash is an issue to consider if you will use it under low light conditions.Tha image quality is excellent, very fast focus, very good video quality but consumes 2 megabytes per second it means that with 1 Gb SD card you will record just 8 minutes of video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonders never cease","review":"This is the camera I have, although I bought it in the UK, where it is called a sd500 5MP \\"Digital Ixus.\\" The Canon is more powerful, more compact, easier to operate, takes better pictures, has more flexible storage, doesn't cost any more than the older weaker cameras I have owned.The things that impressed me most were a) the giant bright and vivid screen, nice enough to show the photos to your friends without any other electronic device, b) the quick response time (no irritating delay), c) the quality of the digital movies you can take with this (they are short but full-speed). I've dispensed with my camcorder altogether in favor of the Canon's fully satisfactory performance.I have owned digital cameras for almost a decade, but this one is so far advanced over my previous ones in convenience and quality that it leaves me feeling like some old fellow who grew up riding horses getting a ride in his first horseless carriage.

And it is definietly not as expected. Even though it is wood, it is so chincy and cheap looking. Paint has actually starting falling away and pieces of wood from the stool are as well. There is nothing holding the drawer in place so if your toddler gets ahold of it they can yank it out, which easily lands on feet or legs. OWIE! as my daughter would say. The mirror is fake, which is good...but so awful looking. I would NOT buy this if I saw it in person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy this if your hubby needs a project to work on!","review":"My daughter was so excited to get this for Christmas. As I was putting it together, that quickly faded away. The piece for the drawer is too big. My husband will have to saw it. One leg for the stool won't screw in as the hole is not deep enough. My husband will have to fix that too. Also, there is nothing to attach the mirror to the table top. There are pre-drilled holes for screws but it has no threads. The instructions were not correct as the pieces in the package did not match the list on the instructions. My daughter really wanted a nice place to sit down and beautify herself and this just isn't that place! It's sitting in a corner not fully put together because it's too frustrating. Maybe the one I was sent was from the reject pile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"We got this for my six-year-old daughter for her birthday. On her birthday, we woke up early to build it together as a daddy-daughter activity. After two hours, I threw the pieces back in the box as my daughter sobbed in her room.This thing is complete crap. None of the pieces are cut right, the bolt holes are cut at conflicting angles, and the quality is pitiful. It took me almost two hours to put the stool together (a total of four bolts), and I could not bear to allow my daughter to even sit on it for fear that it would collapse. There were gaps over half-an-inch wide between the joints, the legs were crooked, and the bolts were threatening to rip right out of the cheap wood.I tried to explain to my daughter that we were sending it back, but how to you explain that to a six-year-old? We're sending it back and asking for a full refund.What a waste.

I searched high and low for a messenger-style bag with at least a zipper instead of just a flap. This bag fit the bill in terms of design and price. The only flaw is the pouch that holds the on/off light switch for the night-time reflector is not very secure. Therefore the switch is never held securely in place and gets bashed around often. Still works though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Swiss Messenger bag works out","review":"I have had this bag about a month and so far it has been working out for me.All the extra side pockets are really useful and great for storing small umbrellas, waterbottles, and all the nick-nacks you can't leave home without. My only complaint with the bag is the pencil/pen holder in the top flap. Because the holder is in the flap, which gets opened and closed all of the time, and the pencils/pens rest in it horizontally, it is easy for them to dislodge. This design flaw isn't a big deal, it is just a bit annoying at times. Otherwise there is plenty of storage space in it-- can fit books, notebooks, macbook, lunch etc, and its zippered flap keeps everything protected even when it rains. I would definately recommend this bag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"It would be a great bag if I were 13 but I'm 42.

Guess I'll just keep looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay","review":"I read this book with my teacher and classmates. I would, first of all, reccomend this book to teachers to read with their class, because it is a play, and it is fun to read with a lot of children. There are a lot of things we can learn from the book. Except an occasional swear word ( this is the reason I only gave the book 4 stars), It is a very good book.The book is about a family who was very poor. Some of the very important characters are: Mama- who is a very smart person, who counts every penny papa (her husband) brings home from work. Katrien- one of Mama's daughters whose dream is to become a writer when she grows up. Lars, Christine, & Dagmar- Mama's other children. Jenny, Sigrid, & Trina- Mama's sisters. Uncle Chris- Moma's brother, who is also the \\"head\\" of the family. Mr.Thorkleson- Trina's husband to be. These I think are the most important characters in the book.It is kind of hard to understand at first, but you'll get get used to it. Happy Reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ooops.

An exuberant and honest album, this was proof that a teen band could give value for money both in the music and the lavish packaging of the vinyl LP. From the catchy commercial sound of the title track to Braithwaite's superb ballad Lady of the Night, not to mention classic album tracks Blueswalkin' and Can't Find True Love this release is highly recommended. The only bum track is the last track, a drunken chorus which almost ruins the album. But the beauty of buying the CD is that you can program the player to skip the song altogether. It reminds me of The Beatles white album where you had to dart for the stereo and turn it off quickly before Revolution 9 and Good Night came on. And yes, you can compare this album with the white album. It is a mystery why this group never made it overseas. They are truly up there with Little River Band, The Seekers, Air Supply and INXS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfounded claims","review":"Did June Summers actually study the Pentecostal/Charasmatic movement when writing this book?

Absolutely not!Just as a majority of Catholic churches do not have occurences of child abuse, neither do Pentecostal and/or charasmatic churches support this view of sexuality.This book sensationalized a few isolated, rare incidences of such a problem and positioned it as the norm for these types of churches.I shudder to think of what novel she would write about regarding the Catholic church."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Hunting Information","review":"This book was very informative and included an absolutely wonderful section on the skinning part of the hunt.

But have you ever tried to grow a hybrid tea? It isn't easy, especially if you live in a cold northern climate. Suzanne Verrier makes the case for replacing fussy, difficult, disease-prone roses with hardy, fragrant, and often gorgeous rugosas. This isn't meant as a scientific treatise, with rose ratings and awards won. It is a guide written by a lover of roses--one who knows her way about this wonderful variety better than almost anyone in the horticultural world. The book is beautifully photographed, accurate in all essentials, and Verrier writes beautifully, in the best tradition of garden literature.My only suggestion is that Rosa Rugosa could use an updating. Some great rugosa hybrids have been introduced in recent years, and it would be nice to have them included."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"Actually I would give this book 0 stars, but there is no way to do so.

A serial killer of children buries his victims in the houses he renovates for customers. The sympathetic main characters, who are unfortunate enough to own and still live in a property Woolie (the aforementioned killer) used to hide his latest victim, are beseiged by the usual hypocrites, know-it-alls, and inhumanly cruel villans one finds populating Campbell's books. As usual Campbell he makes the reader empathize with their suffering completely. But, as I said earlier, the book proved far too disturbing and discomforting for me. I just had to close it, get some fresh air, and read something else. A dip into darkness too many for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateur stuff","review":"This book does show you how to build a silencer, however I was hoping for a bit more.

Pretty good ideas for putting them together too, and they work effectively and for quite a while.It also has a couple designs that involve some welding, but if you're able to weld, you'll want the new book by this author. Those ones are awesome.Still, if you're just looking for a new toy for your gun, or something to quietly pop bunnies with, these will work fine for that, at least as well as anything in any similar book, and better than the vast majority.

The songs are good, fun to listen to, but about half the cd is just lacking in quality compared to their previous album.

It's a lot more punk rockish but there is still a bunch of ska and reggae sound to their music and it blends into a great mix. They also touch down on a bunch of political issues with there lyrics and that's always a plus. And I love the lead singers voice, it matches well with all the different sounds on the album.

They have the sound of a band that you would expect to be mainstream. They have some of the sound that made Sublime popular, while mixing in some ska, punk and just plain ol' rock and roll. They mix up the speeds and styles of their songs nicely, and the singer's voice is truly unique. On their last CD, I really thought that \\"One More Minute\\" would rocket them to stardom, but apparently only a few people were paying attention. This album picks up right where they left off on their previous album, with more of the same good stuff. Anyway, for fans of new sounding varied-styled punk, pick this up and spread the word.

The book does not offer a broad enough introduction to wine nor tie the knots together for wine beginners who know bits and pieces.

I've read a lot about wine, since it is my business. There are some other great reads out there. Speaking purely for reference sake, this is the book I do not leave home without. It's written in such impressionable fashion, that I rarely forget a quote. Through her emotional ties in travel, tasting, and living Karen has shaped my vision of wine and its effect on culture the world over. I can't remember the last time I gave 5-stars [for anything], but for $13.47 - there is no better buy on the subject. Cheers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wine Bible","review":"Excellent reference, covered wines from all over the world, all kinds of info about winemaking, different grapes,etc. I gave mine away, I have to order another one.

Would recommend it to avid wine drinkers"},{"rating":"2","title":"WINE!!","review":"For those who love wine, like me, this is an awesome book. It goes into great detail about different wines and ways of drinking it."},{"rating":"1","title":"a general book","review":"I am a wine lover and i though this book would enhance my knowledge, but it did not. It is a general wine description book. The market has a lot more to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"The absolute best wine primer","review":"I would rate myself as an intermediate wine enthusiast. I have a good wine cellar, love to buy wines and of course drink them! I just bought the \\"bible\\" and have learned so much in the introductory section. The information will bump me up to a new level and give me more confidence when discussing wines before I buy them. It covers the most important wine regions and the wines from them. It is after all a primer not an indepth study of a specific wine. If you want to be an expert on Bordeaux then buy a book on that. MacNeil's writing style is fun and so knowledgeable without being being a wine snob, which of course a leading authority on wine could be. This the perfect wine reference book for anyone interested in wine."},{"rating":"2","title":"WIne Bible","review":"This is an excellent book on wine, wine regions, grapes, etc. The thickness of this book can look intimidating, but the larger than normal font and pictures make it easy to read and less intimidating. I keep this book by my chair for quick reference. You should also look for Karen's 13-part PBS series, \\"Wine, Food and Friends\\" on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for background info","review":"Good historical and general informative reading. A little outdated for specifics. If you are looking for \\"Wine World Geography\\" this book is amazing, and I would say that is its strongest offering."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite wine reference book","review":"I have amassed quite a collection of books about wine and this one always seems to provide me with the perfect amount of detail when I refer back to it. I have some intro books (windows on the world) that never tell me quite enough and some that are really long and provide too much information. I really recommend this book for anyone interested in wine and wine regions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good reference / educational reading","review":"This is a thick book with lots of information on everything! It's like an encyclopedia of wines. I bought 4 of these as gifts and kept one myself. The gifts are to folks who are avid wine collectors and casual drinkers. The feedbacks are slow to come back as most don't have time to go through them.For myself, the reading is educational. It's more so when I am looking up a specific type of wine or brand or winery. Good reference book to have around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"This book is awesome! I've heard nothing but good things about it, so I finally decided to buy it. All you need to know about wine! A great for me, a poor college student, to learn about the wine I love1"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wine & Wine Grape Dictionary","review":"I own several wine books purported to give you all of the information on wines, but this is without doubt the best available. Definitely superior to Jancis Robinson's book. I have been unable to find any wine or wine region that is not covered. Buy it and you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gift","review":"This is serioucly the best gift idea ever. I couldnt thinkof what to get people for the holidays and the whoel bottle of wine thing has been so done. So instead I decided to take and old idea and spice it up I bought a cheap little basket this book (which is great) a bottle of wine I found in the book and a set of glasses. Its the cheapest nicest gift I've ever given and I got tons of compliments for the idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs to be updated badly!!!","review":"This was a great book...6 years ago. While that might not seem a long time, remember that insane changes have occured lately: the restructuring of many Italian DOCs, promotion of massive numbers of Spanish DOs, new AVAs in California and Oregon, Canada establishing itself as a wine powerhouse for more than dessert wines, not to mention the stylistic change of Bordeaux after the 2000 vintage.I have also found several errors based on outdated (1997-1999) information. Though this is of little concern to novices, experts and those in the wine industry cannot rely on this information. Also, this needs to come in a hardcover form (for this many pages).Pros: value, basic knowledge goodCons: poorly laid out, outdated info, not durable, lacks advanced infoI know Karen MacNiel can do better, she is one of the most knowledgeable wine experts I have ever met."},{"rating":"2","title":"A four only because I don't know much about wine... yet","review":"If I was an expert, of course, I could better \\"rate\\" this book - as an ignorant novice, I give it four.It's a thorough and interesting read - expanding on the different wine descriptors, practices and interesting histories, as well as highlighting the regions and wines for which they are famous. The author also gives specific wines and recommendations for pairing them with foods.I would certainly recommend this book to a novice - and I'm certain someone with a bit more experience could glean information from it, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wine Bible","review":"This is by far the most comprehensive and educational book on wine that I have found! Ms. MacNeil is one of the leading women in the world of wine and her expertise, down-to-earth style and fun spirit come through in her writing. If I could only have one book on wine, this would be the one. The book is written to accomodate all levels of readers, from beginning wine lovers to seasoned wine enthusiasts. Makes a great gift for anyone interested in wine. The best wine reference on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective dvd!","review":"The first half of the dvd worked fine; however, when I tried to play the portion with Beethoven's 9th, the dvd stuttered and then froze. Amazon authorized a return and I opted for a refund--didn't want to be disappointed again. A real bummer, as we used to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Asking for some information","review":"Well, I am not exactly writing a review here, but rather asking for information. I am a student in American civilization in France and currently doing my master's on Indian captivity narratives, which is exactly the topic of this book. I am trying to get in touch with Mrs Derounian -Stodola and Mr Levernier. Do you know how I could contact them, do they have an e-mail address? Thank you very much for answering my questions, it is very important for me.

(Don't forget the adapters needed for each end which I already had.) It is very short, but long enough for the flash frame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big dissapointment","review":"I searched for a copy of this for a while now. I'm left wondering why.

BEWARE!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a Simply Pretty Cloe Doll.","review":"Spring Break is a line with Leah, Yasmin, and Cloe. Cloe is probably the middle best. Leah is really hard to beat. But this is a great doll. She comes with a cute swimsuit, lovely pink beach dress, toned make-up, beautiful blonde hair, and a great price, too! When Amazon released this I was amazed at how stunning her picture was. Any girl is sure to love her. What's even better is that after years, MGAE finally released swim-suits. Now the Bratz girls have outfits to wear in the water! I really can't complain with this Cloe.Sara, I hope you can forgive me. I really didn't mean to hurt your feelings, honest. Your a really nice girl and a dear friend to me. Please trust me. Oh, and Esweetie and Nevra426, you rock! It's great to have sisters reviewing on Amazon! Well, besides my sis and me.

I want it so badly!!! Cloe looks very good with a tan. Just a reminder to \\"Grant,\\" this is NOT a plastic surgery Barbie and never will be. It is also VERY appropriate to wear a BATHING SUIT when you are going to the BEACH! Anyone with a fashion sense could figure that one out. I am very glad that MGA entertainment made these dolls! They solved my summer doll dilemma. In 2003,I has missed out on the sunkissed summer line altogether and had no summer dolls. Now, very soon I will. These are even better than the sunkissed summer line!!!P.S. Hello to all my friends!

The colors-white and pink- are colors that I really like. Cloe is one of my favorite Bratz Dolls. This doll has two long blonde ponytails, and is dressed in a White Bikini with a white sarong over the bottom piece. She comes with a highly fashionable-prom looking- pink sundress which I also like very much! Other accesories are sandals,beach heels(both white),red sunglasses,a pink towel, a white beach bag with a pink bow, and a pink star shaped hair brush. I love this doll though I agree with the first reviewer she does look anyrexic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stress - Free : Peaceful Affirmations audio cassette","review":"This is a great tape. It is easy to listen to - Louise has a very calm and clear voice. It does what it says - on one side of the tape Louise repeats simple but positive affirmations over the top of soothing music, and on the other side there is just music mixed with sounds of nature, but there are subliminal messages which target your subconcious. I always fall asleep listening to the second side!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Louise Hay Always Does a Good Job","review":"I haven't found a Louise Hay CD that I haven't liked. I especially like the subliminal component to this CD. It is nice to listen to the ocean and calming sounds - which alone help to relieve stress. Her tapes always work well for me and the clients I recommend them to. I would recommend listening to a CD consistently for 30 days then only as needed. It is amazing how you no longer struggle with the same Stresses after you listen to the CD for a while. I listened to it when I was driving from work. Now I have it on (subliminal side)in my office when clients come in. It creates a stress free office. She tells us that Stress is just a form of fear and if we fear something - we just attract it into our lives. This reason alone should make you want to de-stress. We really can't afford to focus on our fears...we need to spend our time focussing our what we want to create in our lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Valuable Stress Reduction Tool","review":"This subliminal tape is a great help to me in coping better with stress. I'm a firm believer in subliminals because of their powerful influence on the subconscious mind. I also love the music on this tape. In fact, my boyfriend and I slow dance to one of the songs on Side 2! I would like to compliment the composer of the music as well as the author of the tape. I recommend this tape to anyone who needs help coping with stress."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as others","review":"I listened to a tape of Louise Hay's about fear from the library and it was so great so I ordered this. But this one is annoying to listen to because instead of the affirmations saying \\"I am safe\\" etc, it says \\"I am safe. You are safe.\\" because Louise Hay says the affirmation that you are supposed to hear and then she also says the subliminal message that you usually don't hear. The other track just has music with the subliminal message under it. But there isn't any track that has just the affirmations (I am safe) with the subliminal part (you are safe) hidden. It is distracting to hear \\"I am safe. You are safe.\\" I don't know why they did it this way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It!!! The Perfect Recording For Nightly Meditation","review":"I LOVE this recording. It's the perfect length of time at around 30 minutes. You can sample the first half of this recording with a free download from Louise Hay's website. I find Louise Hay's voice so soothing and the music and affirmations are just wonderful. I find myself floating away into a happy and relaxed place each night that I listen to it before I go to bed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stress free","review":"I was all set to listen to the stress free CD, candle was lighted and atmosphere so mellow, I opened up the CD that I just recieved and \\"NO CD\\" I recieved an empty CD case> Creating \\"Stress\\" not stress free.

Disappointed with the cassette. I can't gift this to a friend w/o a cassette player."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Help","review":"If your looking to get some relief from stress, do not waste your hard earned money on this. There is absolutely no text included in it, to tell you what is actually in the subliminal messages. You have no way of knowing what messages (if any) are being pumped into you."},{"rating":"2","title":"they worked!","review":"I used these for our 50 TV on a stand & was hoping they would hold up so that I can pull it out for cleaning & so far, so good! I am very careful when pulling it out. It is on short nap carpet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be all one color","review":"These products work to help push heavy furniture across the hardwood floors. However, these do not look good under the furniture. They should be all one color, so that the buyer can choose either light or dark. We put in darker hardwood floors, so the beige part is very obvious and looks tacky. We ended up tearing them all off and buying something else that's all one color. We ordered so many and feel like we wasted all that money. To give the product some credit, they would work fine if the underside of your furniture is completely flat. Then you could stick them on a ways back and under, so the pads do not show."},{"rating":"1","title":"these are awful--","review":"even if you're moving furniture across a wood floor (my situation) buy the sliders with the plastic bottom, which you can use and reuse."},{"rating":"2","title":"If You haven't seen them live yet...","review":"This is the next best thing! One of their earlier performances before the release of their latest album \\"Livin' The Luxury Brown\\" this live cd gives you just a \\"taste\\" of how dynamic this group truly is. That true talent of this group shines as you listen to their classic tracks that sound like they could have been newly released yesterday. For all Mint fans and true musicians, this is a MUST."},{"rating":"1","title":"PC Paintbrush","review":"I how lost some of the functionality of this old program and have been looking to reinstall it. I was happy to see this item for sale, however it won't install on my Win 7."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute Earrings","review":"These tiny happy face earrings are very, very cute. They're a little bit shiny and the silver and black look very nice together. I'm only giving these 4 stars though because the earrings that I received were not identical. One of the posts on the earrings is slightly longer than the other, and the happy faces themselves are not identical (one kinda has a bum eye and a bigger smile). You wouldn't notice the differences, though, unless you were comparing them side by side. Nonetheless, I would still totally recommend these, and I think the little imperfections give them some character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zermatt Daypack","review":"This backpack is a great size but the zippers are nylon and are already separating and getting stuck, it would have been better with metal zippers"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff","review":"I used this in my Tacoma to replace the factory fluids at 5,000 miles.

If the oil is no good then will edit this review"},{"rating":"2","title":"My ferrets love this stuff!","review":"I use this for when I am clipping my ferrets nails - I put some on their bellies & clip while they lick it up. Great distraction from my clipping.They really like it & I would recommend it to anybody with a ferret."},{"rating":"1","title":"Line Snapped During First Flight","review":"This line snapped today during its first flight with a new Prism Stowaway Delta Kite that I also purchased from Amazon. The new kite was lost as a result of the line snapping. According to weather.com, winds in my area were 18 mph and gusting at 28 mph. I purchased this item because of the positive reviews, but I would caution anyone that the line may snap at any time under moderate winds."},{"rating":"2","title":"High quality product","review":"This line is much, much stronger (and thus better) than the standard kite line 30 x 300 that comes with the original Easy Flyer. Easier to hold, wind/unwind and control, too. Definetely worth the extra $8 spent in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going beyon analysing dreams","review":"I came to this book through a DVD on Carlos Castaneda where Robert Moss does a comentary on dreaming. This book does a good job of expalaining the mysteries of the astral plane better perhaps than any other book I have read. While many of us are not advanced enough to perform some of the magic involved in becoming a \\"frequent flyer\\" the author does an excellent job of describing these mysteries in terms that a layman can understand. If you like Castaneda you will like Rober Moss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mysticism","review":"Though it is well written and contains some interesting ideas, this book is based on mysticism. If you are looking for a practical book to learn lucid dreaming techniques I don't recommend this one. That is, unless you don't mind wading through religous/mystic jargon in order to find useful tidbits. I suggest you check out \\"Lucid Dreams in 30 Days\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Title says it all...","review":"I love the \\"Dummies\\" series of books and this is one of my favorites. I am a single guy, live in an apartment that does not allow us to have grills on the patio so indoor grilling is my only choice.

As I took the jar out, I thought \\"I'm gonna be really mad if this jar is half empty.\\" Amazingly, it was! Actually it was MORE than half empty. That's like about 4 inches of empty space! That is false advertising.It's disappointing because not only is the packaging deceiving, but the powder tastes very bad and very \\"thin\\" compared to many other greens products I've used.I'm shocked because New Chapter's vitamins are the best!

I don't know what I'm going to do now that it's been discontinued-it was an amazing source of energy and it made me feel well! I can't understand why the New Chapter has taken it off the market. They told me it was because their manufacturer couldn't continue to promise the same standards of manufacturing that they have always had and so rather than make an inferior product they have removed it. This is very mysterious-what can have changed in the manufacturing process???Anyway, very despondant with losing this fantastic product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ivacare bed pad","review":"This is a great product. It lives up to all the claims in their advertising.We would recommend it highly"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY!","review":"This product is just glorified modelling clay, but more plasticy(?). It is IMPOSSIBLE to knead, even for an adult, let alone a child. The molds don't work, and overall a VERY frustrating project. It took a Herculean amount of patience to keep from pitching it across the room!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't do what it's suppose to","review":"I agree with the other reviewer. We were very disappointed with this toy. It doesn't do what it is suppose to. You can't knead the substance and make it into anything. We tried several approaches and let it soak way longer than recommended in the directions and it was very hard and we couldn't even use it. The only part of it that was as advertised was that it changed colors but that certainly isn't worth the money.A complete waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy something else!","review":"I installed this mirror on a 2004 Buick LeSabre on the drivers side door. I had no installation problems at all, and it looked good. About two weeks ago I noticed that the mirror has two separate vertical cracks in it, and for no apparent reason other then it has to be made with junk. Now the glass is falling out! It doesn't show any signs that it was hit or anything, there are no dents or scuff marks of any kind on the painted area of the mirror. It's too bad because it did look, but now I have to buy another mirror, but it won't be from this company again!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I needed","review":"Identical to the original factory mirror and installed quickly and easily.

However it is a reference book, no other book can compete."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard Read","review":"This boks is considered a must buy book for any one in typography or graphic design. I do not enjoy it one bit. It is a hard read, and it loses my interest. It is not good for reference at all and because the paragraphs are so long winded that you could not find what you were looking for. This may be a book more for the advanced typographer or designer, definatly not for a beginner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Type History not Examples","review":"This book makes it sound like it's going to tell you how to make unique typography.

It reveals how much beauty a well designed book can offer. It unveils the most intimate secrets and relationships between characters and pure space. It is surely Mr. Bringhurst love for life, wisdom and devotion to beauty. A must to anybody who works with design and communication."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Rock with a beat and a twist","review":"Far from the screaming and banging associated with hard rock, this group has lyrics that are understandable and acceptable, with a few cuss words.

If you like maiden or running wild, check these guys out as well.I discovered them thru vibrationsofdoom.comThe best song here is \\"Fight for your life\\". That song alone is almost worth the price of the whole album.Miss the 80's metal? Need something new to jam to? Like German metal bands? Here is your something new (even if it is 20 years old).Iron Angel only had 2 albums. They split up cause 1/2 the band wanted to become a band like Poison/cinderella, and the rest wanted to stay true to what 80's metal was about. So, while their selection is small, it is a good one.Remember how wuss a band Poison was?

Following of usual detective routine is also a major future of realist school of detective fiction which is present in this novel. Nothing is striking about this novel the first part of the novel is quite interesting as French struggles to find the means of committing a crime in a locked room. From the first deductions about the method of the murder the story turns into a very boring routine detective work nothing brilliant or shining is done by detective French he even chooses the wrong suspect and arrives at the solution by being told not by deducing logically or guessing theoretically. This is a disappointment as there is nothing in the book which qualifies as good whodunit .The characterizations are lame as well. If you are looking for a good mystery you can do better than to pick this book up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creationism is utter stupidity","review":"The 'theories' in this book are ridiculous. Creationism is complete ignorance to scientific fact. Face it, there are one of two possibilities: 1. Evolution is true and creationism is hogwash, or 2. Creationism is true, yet your 'god' filled the Earth will tons and tons of false evidence to make you look like an idiot. Which do you think is true?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Broad and accurate introduction to Creationism","review":"This was the first book I read on creationism after 13 years of evolutionary education. It helped me to see for the first time the immense challenge of \\"proving\\" things scientifically, especially regarding the distant past. It also pointed out many of the assumptions and distorted \\"evidence\\" I would later see in my introductory biology class at the private university I attend. Though not a technical work, this book is an excellent resource for learning the basic problems with evolution and for being equipped to logically discuss the merits of a creationist understanding of origins and history. It is also a good book for a skeptic because it includes only scientific argument, with no Biblical exegesis or dogma. Morris and Parker helped to open my mind with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"CREATIONIST DRIVEL!!!!!!","review":"This book is pure garbage. Creationist drivel. It is amazing how men who claim to be Christians can misquote other people. Either they are dishonest or don't know how to read science writers. They enjoy trying to make evolutionist seem like they doubt their own theory. I have read many books on evolution and do not see any doubt. However I do read of disagreements about certain aspects of evolution. What these two evangelical hacks have done is lift quotes out of context to make their case sound stronger. I imagine if one had the time to devote themselves to a useless project he could lift quotes out of young earth creationists books and Intelligent Design writers and make them sound like they deny the faith. But that would be pointless. Evolution is not in doubt and the Bible Cosmology IS NOT science. It is Bronze Age myth!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Balderdash","review":"This is diatribe taken to the lowest level.

This is the perfect solution - a screen to keep out the bugs and a canopy for shade so that you don't have to keep putting sunscreen on the baby all day long.

After discarding the useless directions and finally managing to screw on the front brackets, we discovered that the front poles just rest in slots and the back has tiny clips. So not only does it pop off when pushed by little hands on the inside, it pops off on its own as well! It will not stay on if your kid is able to stand, reach above the edge of the p-n-p, and push. We'll be returning it tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"does not fit my pack-n-play","review":"I purchased this canopy for use on my brand new graco pack-n-play and it does not fit! I was attempting to put it together when i read in the instructions that it does not fit if you have a rounded edge pack-n-play. Nowhere in the description when I purchased it was this mentioned. I had to buy it, open it, then read it in the instruction booklet- What a waste of time!!!!! I ended up purchasing the sport/outdoors pack-n-play by Graco for use outdoors and i love it! It is great for being outside. I would recommend this one instead of the canopy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't fit right and wasn't worth it.","review":"It wasn't meant for the rounded ends of my PnP but it fit in an ugly way anyway.

The book sells for over $100 and is nearly impossible to find used. Shame on Ohio University for allowing this to go on for over 20 years. Absolutely horrible book. Save you're money. Borrow a friends copy of check one out from the library.Btw he doesn't even explain the concepts in a legible way.

Instead of exchanging it I just gave it someone else whose finger it fits. And when it does, it looks really nice. The silver is very shiny and together with the stones they catch light and make your hand look very sparkly when you move it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amber Ring","review":"The ring was as pretty as I imagined it would be in person. It was, however much thicker than I imagined it to be. I would have preferred it to have a thinner band and to look less clunky.

It's a very nice ring. The band is a bit thicker than ideal, but it's not so thick that you won't want to wear it. I do find that the smaller stones don't look as prominent in real life as in the pictures online for some reason. Because of these small issues, it gets 4 instead of 5 stars, although a significant price drop could gain that 5th star back. I'm glad that I have this ring as part of my jewelry collection.

It was not at all like the Kottonmouth Kings, their usual tour crew.They speak more than Marilyn Manson about god and Christianity and they do make a lot of sense about a lot of religious stuff. But they are unlike any of their tour and label mates. They are more metal and electronic other than the hip hop of KMK and reggae of Too Rude. The most catchy songs on this album are \\"I don't fault the police\\" and \\"Drug dealing god\\"(the last one featuring KMK). \\"FBI file\\" and \\"Taxes are stealing\\" are also stand outs. The rest of the album has it's \\"charms\\" too. I was able to listen to the whole thing without skipping songs. All in all, a good cd from a cool group.

Several customers have complained about this record not loading in their computer. The disc features OpenDisc technology which is actually just a hidden weblink to an exclusive content area on the band's website. I think they are actually trying to ADD to the experience of buying the CD rather than taking anything away. I loaded my disc onto iTunes with no problem at all. I recommend you have iTunes open when you put the disc into your compuetr drive otherwise the Opendisc feature will launch first.Musically, well, to me it is some of Air's finest compositions but maybe not their most pop-oriented. They have pretty much given up on the original sounds that brought them acclaim (Fender Rhodes, Moogs, etc) but instead they have matured into fine composers and they are still one of a kind. I appreciate them for that. Too bad your computers can't read them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drab","review":"This album is very drab and downtempo.

Jarvis Cocker should return to Pulp. The album's artwork is cheezy and beautiful just like all Air albums.

This is before I started discovering the buy-a-single-track feature that many (most?) discs have available.

When channel surfing with this thing, it occasionally resets itself; turns itself off and then back on. The biggest problem with my tv is that once a while it can't be turn on. The power light and OPC light would flash on and off, pressing the power button on the remote and the set won't turn it on.

The repairman came out yesterday and said he's already done this \\"firmware upgrade\\" to 15 others like ours. Hopefully this will solve our problem.Otherwise it's awesome. Great visually and has a lot of options. We're in Indianapolis and are dropping our cable bc with a roof antenna we get our local channels in HD.

The width marking on the ruler are accurate and the blade cuts cleanly. My only construction related concern is that the safety clamp, which keeps the blade in the down and locked position, is too flimsy. The slightest touch will release the spring loaded blade back into the up and ready to cut position.The other problem had to do with the initial production quality of the cutter. Two screws from the metal cutting guide were stripped. I was able to find 2 longer screws and tighten the metal cutting guide myself, but the product would have been unusable as purchased."},{"rating":"2","title":"A user-friendly reference","review":"Those seeking quick, reliable information on how the teachings of biblical Christianity compare with those of cults and world religions can benefit greatly from this handy beginner's guide.

The success of science and technology in other words, is a kind of testimony to the congruence of the Christian view of the world to reality.Christianity is not \\"anti-science\\" but is its progenitor. To be sure, science rooted in such a world view will be open, creative, yet humble and critically self-aware of its limitations and role.

Later you read that six-month old Timmy died in his sleep. First time you ever hear the kid's name and was he the new baby or the first born? Very confusing.

Maybe I'm biased because I read Parks' last book, a book of essays called \\"Adultery and Other Diversions\\" which touches on the same issues with much more success.

It's a team game whereby the team reads the totally random put together words and tries to guess what is really being said. For example: \\"New Disc Hollow Knee\\" answer: \\"Nudist Colony\\". It is great to watch as people clamor for the correct phrase or name, and as the card holder hears it he/she can't understand why the team isn't guessing it when they sound like they are saying it correctly. If you are an audio person you will have a field day, but if you are a visual person, you will have fits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not good if you're prone to hysteria!!","review":"My daughters are as prone to hysterical laughter as I am and we've had this game for years. My oldest and I quit playing this as a game with the timer. We would just gather with her friends with no rules to figure out what the cards said because that was just so much fun. We would laugh so hard we couldn't see straight as the tears streamed down our cheeks. This was when she was in middle school.If you are easy to entertain this is definitely the game for you, if you like a challange this could be it for you also! It's still just as fun, we sit it aside for awhile and forget what the cards say then pull it out again, plus with so many cards we can't remember them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for college kids","review":"This is a great game for a college dorm late night gathering.

His text does not leave the reader with the usual task of having to decipher jargon-ridden, convoluted language. Visano provides clear and insightful explanations of core theoretical concepts. Furthermore, Visano provides a timely and fresh articulation of marco/micro and normative/interpretive perspectives. Finally, Dr. Visano provides a pathway to the integration of criminological and cultural studies. His methodological and ethical insights into the creative and strategic role of critical ethnography in the cultural study of crime are original and make a needed contribution to the emerging discussions of critical directions in ethnographic inquiry. This book is highly recommended to students and academics who are interested in the critical intersections of crime and culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doing... undoing...","review":"\`Undoing Gender' is certainly a much easier read than 'Gender Trouble' and 'Bodies That Matter'. However, it still presents thoughtful reflections relevant to Butler's earlier work. It's so gloomy to read multiple texts by the same author (especially in the academic field) and find they all explore the same viewpoint- that's why it is really refreshing to read Butler's work in succession to witness the 'redoing' of ideas. Butler's up to date frameworks are especially relevant in the forever changing realm of gender.However, in reading Butler's work I find it necessary to consult a whole heap of other titles, including work by Freud, Foucault, Lacan. Keep this in mind... it's not a light read! Consider it more a starting point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible option for makeshift shelves","review":"Initially, these shelves seemed to work fine... and then we started actually using them. First, the plastic mounting guides are very flimsy. When weight is on the shelves, they routinely warp and, coupled with the movement of the door they're attached to, the shelves come out of the bottom mounting holes on a weekly basis. The worst part about these shelves though is the lack of a side bar. When mounted to a door which is their intent, the momentum of the swing pulls items outwards towards the side... but the side only has one bar at the maximum height so when it holds tall items that fall over due to the door swinging or items that are shorter than the shelf, they come flying out the side. Usually this is a can of cooking spray or a short can of diced tomatoes which are both heavy enough to leave an awesome bruise on mytoe after opening the door in a hurry while fixing breakfast... nothing like limping into work because you busted your toe on a can of Pam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Idea - Cheesy Support","review":"The shelf themselves are made of the wire with plastic coating. These are not a problem. The shelves themselves are a nice size. The supports, the part that secures to the door and the shelves lock into are unfortunately a cheap lightweight plastic that came bent out of shape from packaging.

It comes in several pieces, all plastic, to mount to the door. Installation is easy enough, but you need a level, a measuring tape and electric screw driver. You can stager the heights of the shelves for large cereal boxes, etc., but the shelves are not too deep. You cannot store any large cans, too heavy and too wide and the ends are open so stuff falls right through. If they made the end on the shelves closed, it would be more functional. Also, the bottom of the shelves allow smaller items to fall through. Not a bad by for the $$ but they need to correct these mistakes with the shelves for a truly great item.

If you are not thoroughly annoyed with her by the end of the movie ... I don't know what to say. I also have to feel a little sorry for Tim (her partner) and have to wonder why he would put up with her.On the positive side, the moments/interviews with the pros are nice, but they get too little screen time.

They explain how they get into your head and what their thoughts are \\"destroy you at the table\\". That I liked. No, that I loved! I actually felt a comraderie with the stars in the film; knowing they had to interact with Susan at one point or another, I felt we all hated her equally and had all been tortured by her at one point!Don't expect a how-to guide, don't expect a deep documentary... expect some of the greatest poker interviews of all time and allow that to drive your purchase.

It is full of humour and aesthetics - a different film experience - in a good way. It was like a blind date for me when I went to the movies to see this film - and I was pleasantly surprised. Just sit back and let yourself enjoy - highly recommended.About the film:\\"Dom is a night watchman at a small hotel in Le Havre, France. One night the mysterious Fiona appears, shoeless and without any luggage. She tells him she is a fairy and that he can have three wishes come true. The next day two of them are fulfilled and Fiona has disappeared. But Dom really wants to find her as she has opened a new world to him, a world crowded by fantasy and love.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I loved this film. It was fun and cute.

My pictures are blurry and not sharp, you can see EVERY pixel. I mostly shoot models, and it's NOT cutting it anymore. I bout the 50mm lens, and the quality difference is incredible.

For the price, it does a nice job with the sharpness. The color isn't the best, but with digital we can always tweak that later on.If you can afford the 17-40mm f/4L or 17-85mm EF-S, certainly buy those instead.

This is a neurotic and whiny account of time in a beautiful place, the people of which, though impoverished, have a joy and generosity from which any American, and especially this author, should take a lesson.

My son has to have every new human character we find when we visit a toy shop, but he won't touch the robots. When he saw Val Cano, he quickly threw him back on the shelf, not interested in the least, as he thought he was a robot.The Rescue Heroes line has been pretty prolific now (since the late 90's) but I think this is the worst line to date.

I would not recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Norelco - quiet but weak","review":"I have personally tried this along side the Braun and Panasonic.PROS: quiet, self cleaning, can rinse the open head to remove hairsCONS:(1) weak shaver - feels like it had a hard time cutting my beard (not all that thick) so that I had to go over areas several times(2) power switch easy to turn off during shaving(3) particles of hair stick to rubberize parts"},{"rating":"2","title":"Norelco Razor","review":"I purchased this razor and have been very happy with the way it works. It has a long battery life and the Jet Cleaning works extremely well. It has exceeded my expectatioins.The only negatives are:1) The charging base is a little large and bulky, and the power cord makes it even more awkward.2) It is expensive but it is a top of the line product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing great","review":"I got this as a gift for a friend. He says it dosen't shave much better than his old norelco that he bought for 60 dollars!Save your money and get a cheaper one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even Better than my last Spectra","review":"The newer pivoting head is great as it does help the transition from face to neck and catches the hairs a lot quicker than the multiple passes I had to make with the Noreclo Spectra I had that it is replacing.The shaving is much quicker too, took me about 4 minutes with the Spectra with new blades to get a full shave while the 9170 is about 2 minutes. It just seems to catch the many stuble on my face that go in many directions.The cleaning system works fine, just as long as you change the fluid as stated. I like using the cleaning system better than rinsing under hot water like I had to do with the spectra. It is less of my time needed.I am thoroughly impressed with this latest model. I bought the Spectra before because I wanted to be able to adjust the razor tension for my sensitive skin, this new model does this also, but my face seems less prone to irritation with the settings set to a firmer one, given than I need less time for the razors to pass over my face."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keeps falling apart!","review":"It's a pricey razor yet it keeps coming apart! The hinge used to hold on the head is made out of really bad metal that twists and rusts and the head comes off very easily as a result. I wouldn't trust Norelco ever sice the merge with Phillips. To add insult to injury, the head fell on the floor by accident and it shattered to pieces. I busted out my Gilette fusion and got a much better shave in seconds flat with none of the hassle. Goodbye Norelco and goodbye electric razors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Close Shave","review":"It does what it's supposed to do in providing a quick, close shave. I especially like how quiet it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth The Money","review":"I tried to replace my old Norelco which worked pretty good. I thought going with a new Norelco would be an upgrade--not so. This thing is worse than my 5 year-old shaver. It comes with a bunch of worthless junk (jet cleaning system?). Worst of all, it rips the hair our of my face which obviously hurts!! Don't buy this thing, please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pop-up trimmer pops unctrollably","review":"Great product if it didn't have a pop-up trimmer. I've been using Norelco's with great satisfaction for 15+ years. The floating head on this unit would be great, but the minute you float it to your face, the popup trimmer pops undesireably. Impossible to just get a shave without that darn thing popping up on you. They just designed it very poorly in that the popup trimmer is attached to the floating head, while the retaining clip to hold the trimmer in place doesn't float. Obvious design flaw. I'm sending the product back."},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointed","review":"I HAVE HAD OTHER LESS EXPENSIVE MODELS OF NOTELCO RAZORS FOR OVER 30 YEARS AND I DO NOT FEEL THAT THE DIFFERENCE IN COSTS IS WORTH THE HIGH PRICE."},{"rating":"1","title":"New maintenance system is unnecessary and costly...","review":"The new continual shaver cleaning system seems to be an excuse to justify the continuing need to purchase and resupply Norelco name-brand cleaning fluid when water as used in the past will do....The new angle of shaver presentation to my face is less effective and convenient than the old....The new blade cutting system is FAR MORE EFFECTIVE AND QUICKER."},{"rating":"1","title":"Norelco 9170XLCC","review":"The razor shaves pretty well, however, the cleaning unit did not function. When I called Norelco they told me that the likely cause was a chip in the razor unit that was not \\"communicating\\" with the cleaning unit -- suggesting that it's a problem that is not uncommon and that the company knows about. The replacement procedures would take up to four weeks to get a replacement razor in my hands -- leaving me without the razor in the interem -- not a good way to keep you customers satisfied.In addition, the razor uses three rubber shock absorbers that function well, but which I can see will wear down over time (and certainly well before any of the plastic components of the razor would wear out). This is poor design in my opinion.These problems have led me to return the razor for a refund. I've used Norelco razors for 30 years, but this is my last one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots about sex","review":"There is an awful lot about sex in this book rather than a lot about Gnosis. It seems the author is really into sex. I found it distasteful and gave the book away rather than reading it. According to my local Gnosis church, Samael Aun Woer is the be all end all in Gnosistism, but I would rather find another author that didn't dedicate the entire religion to sexual exploitation. It has been awhile since I tried to read this book, so I cannot remember everything, but Tantric Sex seemed to be a lot of what he wrote about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"Poor sound quality.

This is my first Bluetooth mouse. I love everthing about it except that it doesn't work. I installed it and worked great for about a week then it quit. Shipped back for exchange. Second mouse I received would not pair up to my laptop when I prompted according to the instructions. My patience is running a little thin but I am going to give Iogear one more attempt. I can't be so unlucky that my third try would fail...er can I?I gave it two stars for now but I will report later on the third unit trial."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice design, BAD tracking","review":"I really liked the form factor and features of this unit, and was excited to have my first truly wireless mouse for my recent 12\\" Powerbook purchase. Unfortunately, I found the response time lagging slightly and cursor tracking not as smooth or as fast as my Macally iOpti Jr. mouse, so (ultimately) it proved unsatisfactory. I also found problems with having to continually go back into the Bluetooth Pref in order to wake the mouse after the computer went to sleep and was re-activated, but did not pursue a fix since the performance was sub-par anyhow. I have returned this, and will try someone else's Bluetooth mouse until I find one the responds as well as a USB mouse (or give up entirely)."},{"rating":"1","title":"pile of crap","review":"Stay away from this mouse, and this company. The mouse does not work as advertised; in particular the USB recharging function. It does not track well, and would constantly loose connection with bluetooth-equiped laptop 1 ft away!! I returned the mouse for repair; the support was terrible, and after I got it back it still does not work right. So spend your money on a different mouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it. Spend the money and get something better","review":"I bought this mouse for my new Dell Inspirion 9200. I loved the small size and got used to it quikly. It conencted just fine and worked great for the first few days. I made sure to charge it when the light told me to. But after the third day, I would use it and all os a sudden it would lose its connection. I would have to reconnect and then after a few minutes or half hour, it would die again. I thought it was the batteries, but it wasn't. I returned it and bought A logitech MX900. WORKS WONDERFULLY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"still works but i hate it","review":"my mouse hasnt broken yet but it's unresponsive when the bluetooth thingy is plugged into my computer and i hafta shake the mouse around until it starts working. battery life is horrible so i always have to recharge it. the only pro i can see is that it's small and has an on/off switch (not that it even matters)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy","review":"Item I received is either defective or ineffective.Does not hold pairing and drops bluetooth connection.Batteries do not hold charge very long.Odd small size , look for an alternative product."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"First of all, I am surprised by the lack of bluetooth mouses...mice... out there. I picked the IO Gear Mini because of a couple of good reviews I read online. However, I am very disappointed by the battery life and the method of recharging by way of the USB port. Even with the use of rechargable batteries the mouse stays fuctional for only a few hours (with or without use) and I've used two set of new batteries. Recharging through the USB port is completely ineffective. Thankfully, I already had rechargable batteries and a stand alone charger that plugs into a wall outlet. The mouse has been left plugged-in over night and it still doesn't charge completely. I am back to using my trackpad while my Mini Mouse sits in the desk drawer - a waste of money. The complaint in other review(s) about the tracking is also valid, although, I got use to it quickly and was able to use the mouse quite effectively."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get this","review":"It would drop my Imac and I would constantly have to pair it up. The battery die so quickly if you forget to turn it off when you walk away from the computer. It's TINY. And I have small hands. It's very narrow. I'm 5ft5inches. Not a big person. So you can imagine your big hands around this thing. Not a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best to steer clear of this mouse.","review":"I bought this mouse quite a while back, and while I did like its design, feel, and utility, I did NOT like the fact that one of its internal components went bad within about 2 months. It rapidly became hard to keep linked to my computer, and soon quit working completely, to no avail. I tried alkaline batteries in lieu of its rechargables, and that did nothing helpful either. Don't buy this mouse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy -- terrible mouse!","review":"I'd really like my money back for this mouse -- it works, but is jumpy as heck with my Powerbook, feeling like a ball mouse with dirty contacts. I move my mouse in a straight line, but the cursor jumps, almost as if it's drunk. There are better mice out there (I like the ones I've owned by Bluetake)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken","review":"My first mouse broke after only a few uses. When I sent it back for repairs, they sent back a refurbished mouse that did not work at all. Avoid buying this mouse at all costs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst mouse I've ever used!","review":"This is my first review and I never thought I was gonna write a product review, but here I'm just compelled to write about this piece of junk that I purchased with my precious 50 bucks. I did read negative reviews on this product but this product's positive reviews convinced me to purchase the mouse.Well, it turned out to be a mistake. This is the worst mouse I've ever used. I'm a female with a small hand, but still for me, this mouse is way too small for my hand. After using it while (while it was working), I had a pain on my hand from the awkward position. And then it often lost the connection from my computer, then it stopped working. This is just a piece of junk and I get pissed off just looking at it, and I don't even wanna bother with it.I noticed this mouse is on a big discount now and that doesn't surprise me. The sellers must want to get rid of them ASAP.Stay away from this mouse!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hello in there!!","review":"I had the mouse for about two months and it broke. I sent it back to iogrear and after a couple of weeks I received a mouse back but I think it was a refurb. That one worked for awhile and now the scroll wheel doesn't work. In my opinion it is a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"You will need your own charger","review":"I bought this mouse and have used it for over a year now. The nice part about this mouse is the range and the fact that when it works, it works beautifully. When it doesn't work, it is erratic and locks up. Turn it on and off and while the LED will light up, it will still not work well. This is the hint that the battery is low. The mouse comes with two rechargable NiMH AAA batteries. These are 650mAh batteries and are not the best. I bought 4 1000mAh AccuPower NiMH batteries. I keep 2 in the charger. These batteries work great and when fully charged will give me a month of use at about 8 hours a day. But as soon the mouse starts to get erratic, you have to swap the batteries. Do this and you will really like this mouse.Another nice feature for this mouse is the range. You can use your laptop as a DVD player connected to your TV and sitting out of the way. The mouse makes a nice remote control."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 mice later I have a catalogue of issues.","review":"1st mouse I had for two weeks and really loved it. Battery life seemed fine even when I left it on all day. Then when the battery died I charged it up but it never worked again. The light would come on but then go off. I tried new batteries but nothing. Returned it to the store and swapped it for a new one.2nd mouse wouldn't connect regardless of what I did. Right mouse button was also very unresponsive and felt like the spring was missing. Took it to the store and swapped it again (the same day!)3rd mouse connected no problem but the buttons had almost no response at all. Looks like they were both missing parts. I'm taking it back and honestly can't say I'm going to get another one.Real shame. It's just all quality control and build quality ."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"the size is compact... maybe too compact. its like that ultra-small cellphone that Will Ferrell parodied on SNL. smaller than a twinkie.the buttons and the plastic seems fragile. i don't think it would last very long.and it doesn't even work. i was unable to get it to connect to my iBook. i followed the instructions to the letter and nothing... it would be nice if the LED would light up when i was pressing the connect button (also very fragile)... get some reaction.overall i think its a low quality product... and i concur (with previous review) that the user manual should have a troubleshooting section. on that note, why do they even print a manual? they have the PDF online. they could just have an URL prominently displayed on their HARD-TO-OPEN packaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"A traveler's friend","review":"The first thing I noticed about this mouse was the size. It is tiny, even smaller than most mini mouse. I have larger than average hands and the thing feels puny. However if you pay attention on how your holding the mouse, like I do, you shouldn't experience any cramping.After using it for a few weeks I have no complaints about this mouse other than its size. Setup was easy, the tracking is pretty accurate (I find it more accurate than the full size microsoft bluetooth mouse), and there are so many convieniences. The battery lasts quite awhile due to the on/off switch and the plugged in mode works just as well as the wireless mode. The case is great for keeping everything nice and neat.All in all if you're looking for a mouse to bring with you on your travels, I highly recommend this mouse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelent Bluetooth Mouse","review":"I am a guy with big hands, and this mouse fits anatomically perfect in my hands. It has rechargables batteries and a usb cable to charge them (in the same mouse), I find that it charges the batteries too slow and I don't want that my bluetooth mouse have to be plug to any cable, so I have an extra charger and 2 sets of batteries and this way I always have my mouse up and running."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent buy takes some getting used to and a new pair of batteries","review":"I would recommend when you don't want to carry a bulky mouse along with your laptop.I use this on a daily basis not just on trips.I've grown used to the small mouse size (its like holding an elongated walnut)BlueTooth setup was straight forward on Windows XP.You really need to keep it charging and that's difficult to do if you turn off your machine. I suggest using a powered USB HUB or USB Charger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a practical wireless mouse","review":"The mouse works fine, but it's power comsumption is so high that's it's totally impractical as a wireless device. I'm changing the batteries all the time on this thing. The included rechargeable batteries are poor and should not be used. With fresh alkaline batteries it runs well for only a couple of hours and then starts dropping the wireless connection so often that it cannot be used. I do not recommend this product and instead urge you to look at other models.EDIT: I have since gotten rid of the mouse. I may have even thrown it out, waste of money. I now use a Microsoft mini WIRED optical mouse when traveling and am much happier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy individual season sets instead","review":"If you buy the individual season sets (1-4) they cost 88.98$ which is 20$ cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"kinda dissapointed","review":"I am not very happy with the product I bought from you, I think you must let the people know the specific information about ecah item, when selling a dvd you should write down the info about this product, as if it can be read by any dvd player or if it has several languages spoken or subtitles.

Its wonderful how the sound of the sitar and the violin flow into each other. The violin player is probably the best violinist in Hindustani classical music (I feel she even exceeds her aunt N.

They move alot, but due to the noise they make one would not be able to use them in an office environment.

Their appearance from a distance might fool some, but they look very much like a toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk! Don't waste your money!","review":"As posted by the other person, this is a piece of junk. Don't waste your money. It's supposed to have a motion detector, but it's like a light sensor or something that only flashes the LED when something moves 3 inches in front of it. USELESS!.

Again out of two cameras we bought, both were defective- they don't do anything.

But after I unscrewed the metal wand from the trigger assembly, this attachment screwed right it. The truth is that power washing our driveway is still work, but at least it goes more quickly because you can cover a bigger area at a time. Our driveway gets stained from the iron in our dirt and it turns kinda orange. Well, this attachment gets about 80-90% of it. Hope it lasts a longs time. If you only use your power washer reluctantly like me, I recommend this item highly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wide area surface cleaner","review":"I am really impressed with this item. Attached to my 3000PSI gas pressure washer, it cleans large areas of patios, driveways, and walkways thoroughly and quickly.

The IS is well worth the money. The biggest mistake I made was purchasing my Rebel XTI with the 18-55mm lens, tho it helped me see the difference between quality and average to low quality pics. I uploaded three images to demonstrate action in low light, portrait in low light, and flowers in a lot of light. My experience is very amateurish. Hope this helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD chromatic aberration","review":"I bought this lens for its range to be used with my 40D. It would be perfect if it hadn't some serious issues with chromatic aberration (worst on the short end.) You can see purple/green fringes on any high (and sometimes not so high) contrast in the picture at 100% view. Color rendition is mediocre at best, focus tends to be on the soft side. The EF-S 18-15mm that came with my XTi shoots crisper, less distorted, more colorfull pictures than the EF-S 17-85 with very little CA! Looks like there is a reason for Canon not posting MTF charts for this lens..On top of that, the lens in *not* supported by DPPs Lens Aberration Correction function (ver. 3.2 at the time this review was written), which renders this EF-S 17-85mm f4-5.6 IS USM totally useless for me.If I can't return it (3rd party vendor..) I'll try to have Canon \\"calibrate\\" it and take it as a lesson -- in the future I'll stick to L lenses, the 17-40 will cover my indoor and landscape needs nicely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of a major problem with this lens","review":"After around 3 years of use, the lens starts failing to capture pictures with \\"Err 01\\". This seems to be a very common problem. Search the internet for details. I have burnt my hands :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"This lens will break","review":"This lens will break on you. The ribbon cable in the zoom lens will short out due to a design flaw which basically causes you to lose the 17-35 end of the zoom. It is a very common issue that will cost $150-$200 to fix which almost is enough to buy another one used. The lens itself is not terribly sharp either, buy the newer 15-85mm or buy a 3rd party lens near this range but do not buy this lens or you will find that your investment was wasted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the greatest","review":"This lens has significant chromatic aberration especially at the wide end, which makes it fairly useless for any sort of large prints or professional portraiture. I have also found that the reds and blacks always look flat and blown out, despite what the histogram may indicate. It is also very soft even with flash. And it's big and heavy, and if you need to shoot straight down at something the lens creeps out (I had to put a bit of painter's tape on it to make it stay).I was really disappointed in this lens and will be selling it to buy something that doesn't turn the edges of my model's hair green and magenta (even after post processing in Linghtroom to remove noise and apply lens correction, etc)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think twice before you get this one","review":"I've compared this lens with the kit lens (18-55mm, $100.-, cheapest Canon lens) and couldn't believe my eyes. The kit lens was a clear winner, whether in wide, mid, or tele range!! I was outraged and happy I didn't buy it. With image stabilizer on the images very not only darker, but noticably more blurred.I tested myself because of the many conflicting opinions I read on the net. Please, before you buy it, compare. I do hope the 650.- 17-85mm was just a bad piece or else this is outrageous."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it, you will like it!","review":"As you can see by my rating - - I consider the Cannon EF-S 17-85 lens an excellent general purpose lens that I am pleased to own.

The range, 17-85 mm, is good for a general purpose 'carry around' lens."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon EF-S 17-85mm Lens","review":"I bought this lens as an upgrade to the 18-55mm lens that came with my Canon EOS Rebel XTi camera. It is quite a nice improvement, noticeably wider lens and heavier, denoting higher quality materials throughout. I think it will be a real good \\"all around lens\\" with more zoom capability. I have only taken a couple hundred outdoor pictures and am pleased, I havne't gotten to test out the image stabilization in low light/indoors. Overall, I'm impressed so far and feel that I now need to upgrade my camera to the Canon 40D to get more out of the lens that I've upgraded to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon EF-S 17-85 lens","review":"This lens let me take three other lens from my camera bag.All around great lens for studio work and outdoor or weddings too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zoom blocks at the wide end of the range","review":"The lens has a design issue. one of the screws cvontrolling the zoom loosens and over time results in your lens blocking at the \\"wide\\" end of the zoom range (somewhere between 17 and 20). Canon would charge you around $200 to fix the issue. There is a description of how to fix it on the Internet, but this is for people with above average manual dexterity. There are also vigneting issues at the \\"wide\\" end of the zoom range. For this price, the quality leaves A LOT to be desired."},{"rating":"2","title":"great lens","review":"I bought this lens in July 08. It stays on my 40d about 80% of the time. Only problem i have had, it seems to be a bit soft at f4 and 5.6. But it is sharp as a tack at f11. Maybe my copy is a bit off, but other than that I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great images, great versatility","review":"The Canon EF-S 17-85mm zoom lens is a great alternative to the 18-55mm kit lens. I use it on a Canon EOS Rebel XTi. It produces higher quality images and the greater zoom range is very handy. The auto-focus is very accurate and it's easy to manual focus as well. The image stabilization circuitry is great: I've shot pix from a moving cable car in San Francisco, panned, caught birds in flight, and captured moving surfers -- all without shake or blur. The 17-85mm zoom range (27-135mm on a camera with an APS-C sensor like the Rebel I use) gives you everything from wide-angle to medium telephoto in one lens. There are a lot of great photos to be captured within that zoom range. And you can capture them without carrying multiple lenses. In the high-priced world of camera lenses, it's a relative bargain, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good lens for the wedding photographer","review":"This lens is very versatile, offering good wide angle to a good head-and-shoulders portrait length. It's internal focusing, which helps with speed and close-focusing performance, and has image stabilizer for better low-light performance.The IS can be of a particular benefit to those that shoot in darker open areas, like wedding photographers in churches. The IS, combined with a flash, can allow use to get more background detail for indoor events. No longer do we have to accept dark, dungeon like backgrounds!Ideally, the lens would be a little bit brighter (say, f4 at the top end), and a bit heavier built. But then again, we could have that for $1,000 more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"quality optics, a bit on the slower side.","review":"nice lens, not as fast as i thought it would be, and heavier than I have been used to (sigma 28-80). Great optics, crystal clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soft With Horrible Vignetting","review":"I just purchased this lens and I noticed horrible vignetting through the viewfinder the second I mounted it to my camera. I ran some tests at all focal lengths and apertures which confirmed my initial observation.The vignetting is unbelievable at 17mm. I've been a photographer for 35 years and I've NEVER seen a lens this bad.This is unacceptable for any lens, much less a Canon branded lens.The vignetting is not the only problem. There is nothing sharp about this lens except when stopped down.Pardon me, but if I buy a 17mm f4.0 lens is it too much to ask that I actually be able to use it at this focal length and aperture?I'm returning this lens immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only virtue is zoom range.","review":"The only virtue of this lens is the zoom range.Chromatic abberation, highly abnormal distortion, and slow aperture above 17mm make this a bad value.The new Canon 18-55 IS is much better optically. Even better, go for the Tamron 17-50 f/2.8 or the Canon 17-40L for a bit more. This is the worst lens I have ever used without a doubt.Check photozone.de for detailed comparisons of the lenses and save yourself some money and get quality instead!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great, finds lots of use","review":"I'm a lot happier with this lens than with the 18-55 kit lens, the extra range and IS make it a much more versatile lens. The full-time manual / USM focusing works great, and truly is almost silent. The IS has enabled me to take many pictures that I couldn't otherwise have taken. I don't find the IS hype to be quite everything people say: while sharper than without IS, I don't find the pictures as good as with a tripod (but it sure beats carrying one). I have been able to get acceptably sharp images in the 1/15s (85mm) to 1/4s (17mm) range. There is also some vignetting on images taken at 17mm. In general it is much better built than the inexpensive (18-55, 75-300) lenses from Canon I have owned. It is difficult to evaluate if the price is worth it, but compared to other 'expensive' lenses this one certainly gets a lot of use. Whenever I travel, this lens is always with me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sharpness and Contrast are Weaknesses","review":"I was disappointed with the lens. Side-by-side comparisons of photos taken using the Canon 17-85mm and the Tamron 28-75mm 2.8 revealed that the Tamron is sharper and produces more contrasty images at 2.8 than the Canon at f5.6. With both lenses at f8 the Tamron again wins the sharpness and contrast prize. The photos were taken using the same Digital Rebel XT with all settings the same. I will say that image stabilization on the Canon is superior to my other two Canon IS lenses (the 28-135mm and the pricey 100-400mm). The Tamron, by the way, can be had for $370 right here at Amazon and there is currently a $40 rebate on that price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter JUNK unsupported by Canon","review":"Bought 20 examples of this lens for a course I teach in Photography. Had problems from the first 6 months onward. 20/20 lenses either repeated Error 99 issues unresolved by cleaning contacts, dropped aperture blades, or constant hunting around for a focus point even in brightly lit scenes. .Contacted Canon and received no support other than to tell me that they are great lenses that they've had no problems with.... try a search for \\"Canon 17-85mm problems\\" the internet is littered with examples of the poor quality and NO support. Lens has been discontinued due to such poor construction.Shame on Canon for putting a 600 price tag on a faulty piece of equipment. I will not be buying another thing from them again based on the complete lack of customer service my school, my students and I received. As a photographer who loved the durability of my first Canon camera and lenses, this is greed at it's worst."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD chromatic aberration and vignetting","review":"Do not buy this product if you are serious about the quality of your pictures. This lens has the worst aberration and vignetting at 17mm. I spent a whole day taking pictures on a coast and the results were terrifying. My images had color noise, vignetting and were unsharp. So if you are going to shoot at the wide end a lot, this lens is not for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good lens but vignetting is significant...","review":"Bought this lens to get a bit more zoom than the kit lens and am happy with it. However, the feedback you read about vignetting is real -- you see it through the view finder! I get vignetting almost always at the lowest focal length.

This lens fits all of these requirements.- Very solid build quality compared to the kit lens; I love the ultrasonic focusing and full-time manual focus.- The extra 30mm on the long end is great, especially since it doesn't sacrifice any wide angle performance.- The image quality is also significantly better. I took comparison photos at various focal lengths and compared the 18-55 with the 17-85. The 17-85 is noticeably sharper and has better contrast. I'm sure it isn't as good as an L lens, but it also much smaller, lighter and cheaper.The only con I can think of is the lens' weight. It is a lot heavier than the kit lens, but this was expected. This is the trade-off for getting better glass. Overall I am very pleased with this lens and for my casual photography use it is more than adequate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the kit lens on a 30D or Rebel","review":"While all the other reviewers go in into detail.

It sounded like it should be a fun and quirky story. Character development was weak. Kitty herself was fairly decently fleshed out, but the police officer Jack had no development at all, so the potential romance between them (really his attraction for her) seemed silly. As a mystery...the resolution and explanation was inconsistent with the rest of the story...names and plot points in the final chapters were not the same as what had been told to the reader up to that point, and since these were the pivotal points of motive, I was really let down,, and a little mad that I had wasted my time. Really these inconsistencies made me wonder if the editor had actual read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"frustratingly poor writing","review":"While the plot may be semi-interesting, the writing is AWEFUL. This book lacks creativity or any semblance of linguistic talent. I felt like I was reading something written for the pre-teen age bracket, not for adults.

All the young teen/young adult readers I know would get tired of this writing. It's banal.Sure the set up is interesting, and it's why I finished the book. But truly, the use of words is sometimes incorrect, the attempt at puns is awful, the development of the characters is weak, and the main character is not emotionally attractive. Plot? Even though I like a nice surprise at the end, it should be a twist that seems logical to all the previous plot development! This ending was not.And really, the word FANG is not a pleasant word, and should never be used so often without any meaning.

This thing was literally impossible to tune. I'm not saying that after tuning it would then go flat after a little while. That I could deal with. The strings refused to hold a note, AT ALL, even after the guy at the music store put some stuff on the pegs. I would tune one string and by the time I had done the next, the first was off again. and I mean, like the A string would go down to a D within 2 minutes.

Sadly, it is another example of a poorly edited computer book. P.118 talks of a GetBothForks function. In the example, that function does not exist. There is a function called GetForks. That may be what they are referring to(?) On the next page the book discusses Preemption. The lines referenced in the example are obviously not the lines intended. In other words, references to lines 9-13 are probably really referencing lines 15 - 20(?) Finally, that solution is essentially the same as the previous. The first question a good student would ask is what is the difference? Of course, I guess the book does not pre-suppose a good student is reading. In summary, not edited well and therefore not trustworthy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine interpretation of recent economic history","review":"One of what I consider the enlightening books that allow you to gain a new perspective on a seemingly complex subject. In one go the author attempts to explain how recent economic, technological, commercial and societal developments have conspired to create a new world order. Decision-makers would do well to use the lessons of this book to analyze their decisions. I sometimes feel that the people making the decisions, universally, are under-educated and naive and would not even consider the wider ramifications of their decisions.My only complaint is that Mr. Ohmae tends to ramble on topics that may well be more concise. He also pauses every once in a while to complain against the egregious faults of the Japanese government. I don't blame him but it would be better if he treated it in a seperate book on the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"definately worth $30","review":"I bought this speaker because the one that came with my surround sound set was tiny.

She's now 16 months, and we still use it every night and during naptime. She is a very light sleeper, so the white noise is also perfect for masking the noises of our busy house. Per Karp's recommendations, we play it at about the decibel level of a shower. Lulls her right to sleep and keeps her asleep for 12 hours a night on average!

This is an oversimplification in that not only does Hempel follow the well trodden track of such people as Karl Popper, but he goes much further in the way he looks at various \`theories' proposed through the ages. He is not afraid to look at seemingly ludicrous theories such as vitalism but analyses them to locate what is and is not science within them. He never pre-judges anything but is willing ot give it a look no matter how strange or ridiculous. Hempel is a philosopher of science to be admired in his open views. Throughout the text he surprises the reader as he elucidates aspects of the philosophy of science which don't usually occur to a practising scientist or to many other philosophers who take much for granted.Worth every page."},{"rating":"2","title":"An abstract detailing the scientific process","review":"Hempel is considered the definitive author on the scientific process.

It's not your ideal lens for shooting people (although usable at the long end) but great for indoors, landscape and groups. It's also the only one where I can get usable shots shooting blind (just raise it over your head and shoot type of shots).My only regret is not getting this lens sooner.

The only limiting factor is the maximum aperture of 3.5, but otherwise this is a lens I am extremely glad to have at my side. Solid build with an ideal wide zoom range, the lens performs well for landscapes, architectural shoots, and for \\"special effects\\".Perhaps somewhat of a gamble as the EF-S format is limited to compact sensor/short back focus cameras (those cameras with APS-C sized sensors released after 2003), but I do think they will be around for a while longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon 10-22mm lens","review":"I have been very happy with this lens.

It takes amazing pictures in close quarter areas. This lens worked perfect for taking pictures of New York City. I was able to capture great shots of the Statue of Liberty, Empire State Building, Central Park, etc. It's also great for taking pictures of rooms such as an office or any room in a house where a regular 18-55mm or even standard 50mm lens wouldn't help. It's well constructed unlike a lot of the kit lenses out there and is a tad heavy but not that bad.

Yeah, other makers have a lens that's about the same but let's face it...nothing beats a quality Canon USM lens. And this is just that...a quality USM lens.Between this and the other lenses I just bought (24-70 f/2.8L & 70-200 f/2.8L), I may just have to put my Nikon F4s up for sale...or hand it over to my kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lost Treasure","review":"I am stunned!

So much mariner language in this, of which I understood nary a word or action, But loads of excitement on the high seas, and Moses Marble a very memorable character.

A particular delight for me is watching him conduct the Liebeslieder Waltzes, leading a 17-voice small chorus with two pianos. His love for the music and regard for the singers and pianists are right in his face and are a joy to behold.This series on DVD, however, is something of a disappointment. This is a straightforward presentation of the masters used for the 1990 \\"complete\\" Toscanini Edition on RCA Victor, with no attempt at additional digital restoration of the images other than to correct some synchronization problems, using the same tacky 1980s graphics and the treacly Martin Bookspan announcements and commentary. The audio track is cleaner, and the convenience of the DVD format is appreciated, but I was expecting so much more from the usually scrupulous Testament series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I purchased this book with the hope of getting the native american viewpoint on the subject, and hopefully a different perspective. Instead, the author just restates creationist arguments about evolution, and restates scientific arguments about creationism, and he does not do a good job with either.

He makes bald assertions unsupported by either references* or logical arguments.Note the '*' above for this footnote: There are TONS of references in the book but none of the ones I really looked at supported his conclusions/assertions. Most aggravating is the fact that he shamelessly misinterprets those he quotes and/or cites facts that are completely irrelevant to the matter at hand.I just grabbed this from the library on my way out today.

It left a bad taste! In his chapter on evolution, he tosses in a couple quotes by Keith Ward, who is a THEOLOGIAN.

This is, at best, very sloppy writing, and arguably dishonest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Plain Silly","review":"Vine Deloria has done brilliant work in the past.

While I probably agree, I still enjoyed the book immensely, as it was just what I like in a book...to be entertained.

But my biggest gripe was the ending. (warning spoiler!) After thinking that the guy she ends up with (Marucci) is some kind of sleazy womanizer for the entire book and then, in an instant, she ends up with him - was too much.

It is a very easy fast read but I found myself laughing out loud several times. I woke up in the middle of the night having finished about 3/4ths of the book wondering what would happen next. The characters rang true and were all likable in their own ways. The dialog between the characters was authentic and felt like the kind of conversations I would have with friends and family. I loved June and I enjoyed the way she evolved from pretty much a real slacker who just did enough to get by to someone who took charge, learned to trust herself and blossomed into a full grown woman. This book isn't great literature but I thought it was well written, rang true and was completely entertaining.

I loved and felt for Deedee, the fourteen year-old honor student that made one mistake that would forever change her life. And I really liked Troy, Marissa's older brother. He seemed so sweet and caring and understanding.This book made me think about the things that I want to accomplish in my life- both big and small.

We talked about body image, how weight loss or gain changes how we see ourselves, mother-daughter relationships, sibling rivalry, exactly what makes one man attractive and another scuzy, even when they look a lot alike, and of course, life lists."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 1/2 Stars... It's okay, but the ending falls flat","review":"I thought the book was charming and sweet, but I never really connected with June. I think the grief should have been much heavier in almost all of these characters who have lost a loved one, and even in June, who contributed (although accidentally) to Marissa's death. June's journey never quite seems like her own (which seemed to me the point of the book), but instead it seems like a quest that she never really embraces fully.**POTENTIAL SPOILER**The \\"love interests\\" in this book also don't seem to make a lot of sense, and in the end, I was left confused by June's actions. Smolinski never quite explains what leads June to have a change of heart.All in all, the book is an easy read, and if the ending wasn't so disappointing, I would have given it closer to 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Put \\"Next Thing On My List\\" on YOUR list!","review":"Do you have a life list?

June embarks on a journey that will change her life, and the lives of those around her, forever.Next Thing On My List is funny, sweet and touching. You'll be rooting for June from the first item on the list that she tackles straight through to the last.

In order to attach the thermometer transmitter, I had to lie down in a driveway and search for a place to attach the device under the front of the car (if I were younger, this might have been easier). After getting this accomplished, I discovered that the backlight display on the compass (which has an easy to open battery compartment & an optional cigarette lighter power source) doesn't really work in the dark.

All props go to the people at VIBE who hit upon this concept of publishing all of their Tupac interviews, plus the interviews of other hip hop artists, in one book. This is a good method of examining Tupac's life and how and where he went wrong. From reading the interviews in this book, the reader can get an Idea of exactly where Tupac was coming from, and how he self-distructed his character in his last days. It was obvious that Tupac wanted attention, the kind that he didn't get growing up, the kind that only a father figure could give him. Through his words, it was obvious that Tupac was defintelely searching for a leader, someone too knock some sense into his head. Instead of trying to find that person, he became his own worse enemy. Tupac, wherever you are, I hope you find the peace that you so desperately wanted while you where alive.

There is no analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of different methods. Why/When should I use OO instead of structured methods?Furthermore, since the book covers so many topics in a limited number of pages, there simply cannot be enough information in order to apply any of them.

So far the most damning is Chapter 20, where, constantly, Pressman cites the work of \\"Rambaugh\\", such as the book \\"Object-Oriented Modeling and Design\\". Maybe if Pressman was more concerned with writing a useful text than he is in writing one to bring in more money, he'd have actually looked at the list of authors for \\"OOMD\\" and noted the correct spelling of James Rumbaugh's name.Save yourself the money and get another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book stinks!","review":"This is the worst text boot I have ever read.

Spirit of Vengeance also missed many chances for some funny/serious jokes and not this corny crap.

I don't know which was worse..the first one or this. Clearly studios have no problem burning through cash. Ghost Rider is a cool @ss character too and they make the movie so cartoonish. The acting was bad, the story was junk and the cgi was definitley not as good as The Avengers. I think its safe to say Nick Cage is passed his prime, though i see another national treasure movie in the future so he can pay off his debts. I am going to give Seeking Justice a try and see if it goes back to his old ways like Con Air or Face Off, but not keeping my hopes up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes....well....hmmmm.","review":"I have no idea where Nic Cage is going these days,* he might have made this cos he didn't get to put on Supermans suit in planned remake a couple of years ago, which didn't eventuate, so, maybe he thought. \\"I'll do 'Kick Ass' and this one and see what happens\\".Really he should have stuck to 'Kick Ass' and insisted the ending, or his ending, be changed.It is possible you may like this, I thought it was ordinary."},{"rating":"2","title":"..........","review":"The movie was good, however not everyone is a fan of Nicolas Cage so not everyone will enjoy this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible film","review":"Worst acting I've ever seen Cage do.

It is much closer to the comic than it's predecessor, but the cinematography is terrible as is the acting. Absoultly horrible. One scene you get Johnny Blaze trying to fight off being the Ghost Rider which was absolutely hysterical, only to crash his bike......seriously. Why Europe? His main weapon, Penence Stare looks more like a love scene......in fact I am wondering if it worked at all.....then the the meeting with the gent who know where to find one of the principle bad guys is at some weird gathering where it looked like a MMA smack down......against a pig......seriously. Rent/Borrow the movie and save your cash. It is very apparent that Hollywood will not do Ghost Rider any justice at all, just like ruining Punisher......sorry to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"LAME...","review":"I rented this out of the Redbox and was extremely disapointed.. other reviewers will go into long detail, im just going to say on entertainment value i was Highly Disapointed..

It is cornier than Oprah's stool on the 4th of July. Nicholas Cage has made some tankers before, but this tops the notch. Marvel should be embarrassed and needs to do a REAL Ghost Rider movie. Not these garbage films. The first Ghost Rider is pretty bad, but looks like Saving Private Ryan compared to this turd of a film. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very, very, very, bad!!!","review":"Do not waste your money, like I did. This movie is terrible. I could not watch the whole thing, just that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Comparing","review":"This 2nd movie of the Ghost Rider is quite pathetic. Nicholas Cage acted like a junkee needing a fix, (And not allowing himself one), and the Ghost Rider acted totally out of character and they changed his powers to boot. If you want to waste your money, this is definitely the movie to buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I kept thinking, \\"Am I asleep?\\"","review":"Oh, this was dreadful. I'm a comic book movie fan (usually) and I have a really high threshold for \\"ouch,\\" but this really hurt. Nicholas Cage has had pretty much two roles I could recommend someone watch and this was neither of them. Every character in this movie feels like they're right about to laugh but saving us all from it.I wish I hadn't paid even the $3.99 to rent this. Ow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused Reboot","review":"This film is a reboot that attempts to make the character closer to it's comic book version, but fails to really do so. The main problem is that Ghost Rider seems like a secondary character throughout the film. Nobody cares about the son of satan, his mother or the sect of monks after him. These characters take up way too much screen time and worst of all bring the film to a complete stop. Boring and pointless. Nicholas Cage's performance is entertaining and he captures the overall feel of Johnny Blaze quite well. The new Ghost Rider fails though. It's a badly rendered cgi creation that looks like it stepped out of a video game. Overall this film, while nowhere near as hideous as The Amazing Spider-Man or Steel, is a bad movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengance","review":"As a fan of this comic, I was dissapointed with this movie. Seems like Nick Cage is trying to hang on too hard. Could have done without the narrative..movie was a bit campy despite the good cast. Better luck next time?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass","review":"Well, the first one was pretty good and had a solid story line. This one, however, didn't take any of the first movies good content and put it to use in this one. The ghost rider is completely different (worse in my opinion) and the dialog is pretty lame. It has a natural born killers theme to it when he changes. Boy did they mess this one up...had lots of potential too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run Away","review":"When I stop watching a movie that means it was just that bad. I believe I might have made it through about 15min of this movies before I could no longer sustain the mere thought of wasting any more of my life. This was just terrible on a whole other level. Every aspect of what makes a movie good was not at all incorporated into this movie. Just dont even bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT 3D!","review":"I cannot believe I spent the money for this 3D movie...this was not a 3D movie. I don't know if this movie was originally released in 3D at the theater, but I couldn't imagine if I had gone to the theater with my family and spent $48 to see this movie!The movie itself I also did not care for.

I don't care much for Cage in the first place but I am happy to admit that he does do some good films. Like the Next film. Loved it. Even the first GR, Cage's acting was okay to good.The acting in this thing? Horrible. The situations are so contrived. The tension is ZERO. The continuity with the first story is zero also - this is actually a reboot. heh. Rebooted after one film??It has all the elements of a sequel though - over the top stupidity trying to outdo the previous film.I doubt any cast could have saved this travesty from its writers, producer(s) and director(s).One lone ray of sunshine - the twinkie joke was funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!!","review":"I couldn't even stand to watch more than an hour of this and I just turned it off. I mean WTF?! I LOVED the first one, but this one was just terrible!!! I would not waste my money on this if I were you, infact I feel pretty horrible that I spent $1.00 on this as a rental. If they wanted to make a second one they should have stuck with the same producer, because this new guy just screwed the story up completely. And the worst part is that Cage is usually an okay actor, but he was terrible in this film. Absolutely HORRIBLE!! Don't waste your money.

Not well thought out as a plot, it could have been better written as the original one was. Nothing special."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than reviewed.","review":"I don't understand all the hate and bad reviews for this movie. It was a good movie, a fun ride and a compelling story! Idris Elba is always welcome as far as I'm concerned. Yes, the tone of this movie is much darker - less Disney-esque - and a tiny bit gruesome, but that is Ghost Rider! It is based on a comic-book, but this is not a super-hero. Vengeance is not optional. Justice is preferred, but not mandatory.The most under-rated performance in the movie is Johnny Whitworth. Perhaps best known for Empire Records, he plays against type as one of the villains, Ray Carrigan, and he is amazing. He makes decisions with the role that makes him scarier than he is written. There is a casual evil to his performance that was wildly successful. It reminds me of Nick Cassavetes role of Packard in The Wraith plus a dash of Vincent Ventresca.Watch this. It is PG-13, but the horror aspects may be better suited to older children."},{"rating":"2","title":"ghost rider 2 spirit of vengence","review":"Well gotta say don't see this movie in 3d it sucks.

Don't bother, you'll be disappointed & left wanting your brain-cells back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just painful","review":"I wasn't a big fan of the 1st one but this one doesn't even measure up to that low standard. It's probably one of the worst comic book movies made since CGI made them laughable & many of those were probably better. I'd rewatch Catwoman over this easily.Spider-man & the most recent Hulk movie are good examples where focusing on the human character as much or more than the heroic persona can really work. This is the exact opposite. It spend way too much time telling a bad story with Johnny Blaze. This movie may've been better with more actual Ghost Rider clips but I'm not even sure about that as those weren't even that entertaining.I usually don't give out 1 star reviews but this isn't even worth a rental IMO. I'm sorry I bought it except then I'd still be anticipating it. At least now I know.Sadly I am still waiting for a good Ghost Rider movie and the 1st one seems a lot better now than before I watched this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst film of the year","review":"I didn't listen to the oppressed masses and rented this.

Even Cage comes off as a parody of himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Supposed to be a squeal of the first movie, it isn't, Doesn't even follow the comics, the writers/director/producer should have watched the first movie and/or read the comics before making this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Demonic Possession of the Writers","review":"Some demonic possessed evil is responsible for this non-creative (i.e. heavily borrowed) writing, directing and robotic acting and needs to be constrained by a zinc coffin and tossed into the Mariana Trench. This evil intends to zombify us all with another Exorcist II style bad child with evil connections and with the usual black robed worshippers in a semicircle with the usual incantations. The usual, don't sell your soul, or you'll die to regret it with the usual monk sacrifice. The only redeeming part is of course a couple of minutes of CGI burning skeleton on burning 'cycle. How we humans continue to be mesmerized by fire. I'm so inspired I think I'll go and put a match to a lighter fluid doused Halloween skeleton on a toy motorcycle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Without a doubt, this is the worst movie that Marvel has ever been involved in.

Passed it up in theaters (thankfully) and decided to wait for Bluray. I eagerly checked the mail looking for the red netflix envelope and there it was, popped it in a few hours later and got to watching.Something is just wrong and off about this movie. The acting, the directing style, the plot is wishy-washy, it's hard to exactly put my finger on. I found myself falling asleep within the 1st 30 minutes and finally could not bear it anymore, turned it off. If I had known the same guys who made Crank 1 and 2, I would have passed it up. Now that I think about it, it's totally obvious it was made by the same guys. This falls very short of the 1st one, which was no jewel either but much better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money or time!","review":"This was one of the worst movies I have ever seen and by far Cage's worst movie ever.

The upcoming \\"Amazing Spider-Man\\" looks really lame, too..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even Worse than Green Lantern","review":"Just when I thought that the Green Lantern movie was the worst Comic Book Adaptation ever......along comes Ghost Rider: Spirit of Vengeance. Now I'll be the first to admit that I'm not well versed in the Ghost Rider mythos, but I do know a good movie when I see one and Spirit of Vengeance is NOT a good movie.....at all. The first 5-10 minutes of the movie started out strong and then did a 180 and went downhill fast. Bad acting, bad writing.....pretty much bad everything. The special effects for Ghost Rider were decent, but that's about it. I was really looking forward to this movie and I was let down by how bad it was. Seriously, don't waste your money.

I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment!","review":"As a big Ghost Rider fan dating back to the 1970's comic book, I must say that this movie was a big letdown. I was one of the few people that actually liked the first Ghost Rider film. While it was no work of art, I thought it captured the look and the feel of the character pretty well. This latest effort really has no soul, its all over the place. I like Nic Cage as an actor, but I really wished he had stepped aside and let someone else take the role. Ghost Rider is one of the most powerful and feared heroes in the Marvel universe but in this film he is depicted as a twitching skull-faced clown. The first film was a hell of a lot better. I am glad I didn't listen to my 8 year old son and buy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor enough to doom the franchise","review":"I was a comic book kid, GR was one of my favorites.

All that i will say is that if you are a fan of the comic, and not the really old stuff, you will enjoy this film. I got more of a sense that this was how ghost rider should have been done in the first place. the first film came off as trying to hard to get as close to the original ghost rider(comic book) as possible, but this film is more of the darker ghost rider. I would compare it to the punisher and the sequel War zone. the first film did the OK origin story and the second film gets more into the meat of the character. all the people complaining about Cages acting in this film seems way off to me, i mean, how would you act if you were possessed by the ghost rider. All that being said this seems to be more of a movie for a die hard fan then just your casual movie watcher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasn't even close.","review":"When you compare this movie to other comic book movies, this one does not even come close. The first Ghost Rider movie I thought was okay. However, after just the opening scenes of this movie I knew it was not going to be good. Then after the first 30 minutes I thought are you kidding? The graphics were terrible. And the way the movie flowed reminded me of that horrible Hulk movie in 2003. It just does not have the right feel.

Just a whole bunch of really stupid scenes poorly shot and edited. Overall, the acting was poor, the writing was poor, and the cinematic direction was crappy. \\"WARNING\\" spoiler: There is a part of the movie when a barely audible/understandable Elba tells Nick Cage that getting rid of the rider is going to be painful and then locks Nick in this cave... where like nothing happens and then he's cured!

There is very little action and the storyline is lacking substance and seems to float off someplace that I just couldn't seem to follow. The acting isn't all that fantastic either. The only thing good about this movie is Nickolas Cage's reliable style of humor. I learned my final lesson with Ghost Rider Spirit of Vengeance. This is the last time that I pay $15.00 because I'm too eager to wait to rent it!Watch it again? Are you kidding?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ghost Rider-Spirit of Vengeance","review":"I love the first Ghost Rider. It was fairly true to the comic book and the story was good. When I heard about the second movie I was excited.When I started watching Spirit of Vengeance I just couldn't believe they could mess up something so bad. While the story line was again good Nicholas Cage acted like a lunatic and was nothing like the Ghost Rider of the first movie or the comic book character. Also what happened to Gost Rider's biker outfit. Totally off the mark in every way. They just messed up any chance of a number three. This movie was not worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A rip off !","review":"The first was way better than the second!Ghost Rider looked nothing like the first.Nicholas Cage acting in the first was great,but the second was a disaster..Even the special effect sucked.."},{"rating":"1","title":"ghost rider spirit of vengence","review":"I wanted to give this movie zero stars but you must select at least one star to submit a review.

This movie has absolutely nothing to do with the first one; the only character that was carried over was Johnny, and even then they completely rewrote his personality.

I don't who in the world would finance such a travesty. The direction is a total joke and all over the place. If I could give it zero stars that's what it'd receive.

I want my time back lol"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ghostrider 2 burns out","review":"I can see why the most popular positive ratings rater enjoyed it.. as he says he is 16 if you are older than that you will probably not really care for this film as it's a sequel that has changed the previous movies backstory. It's not a reboot they just opted to change things like the original deal on how he was cursed and a few other things. The story was fairly boring as was the majority of the film. Even the CG had been cheaply done it seemed in comparison to the first film."},{"rating":"1","title":"ghost Rider Sprit of veng","review":"I was disappointed, The first Ghost Rider was a 4 star movie much better actors than the second movie I would think that Nicolis would have chosen a better movie to act in.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another poor Marvel release","review":"You are becoming to see a trend in which almost every Marvel character they do in a movie turns out to be lame & god awful.The 2 Punisher movies were dreadful,Fantastic Four were also epic fails and the X-men's last stand was painfully horrendous.The first Ghost Rider was bad but this one might even be one of the worst movies of the year.It was way too short and the acting is dull.Nic Cage should retire from acting,lately he is making astoundingly bad movies.The villain was kinda stupid and pathetic and the plot was easy to figure out in about 20min.Stay away from this movie & from any other Nicolas Cage movie he does from now on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"And they dared to do a sequel!Fool me once and shame on you.

I saw this movie in the Theater with my wife and son and we all had the same reaction. We all wanted to walk out! When the Ghost rider appears, he just stands there and looks stupid until he grabs a bad guy and just opens his mouth at him and growls or whatever he did. The directors said they wanted to see what happened to a skull when the set one on fire...it turned black so they went with that look,but Ghost Riders fire is mystical and doesn't burn his skull like real life! Even his motorcycle was sad. Don't even bother renting this garbage movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"need to start over","review":"This movie was beyond terrible if it wasn't for having my son with me at the theater I would've have walked out about quarter of the way through. I can't even begiin to describe how upset I was watching this film. I've enjoyed reading the comics since i was still in school and still find time to read the graphic novels. I thought the first was bad until I watched this. This one makes the first look like an oscar nomination. That is not how I remember the spirit of vengence coming about. This bike was another nightmare..The first bike fit the rider, the second one a Yamaha V Max looks like the found it in a burned out cycle shop and added red led lights for this. This is one movie IF I do get this for my marvel collection it will be outta the 5 dollar bin at walmart or a pawn shop"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Sequel","review":"I loved the first Ghost Rider. And I was excited about the sequel, but it is just bad. Beyond bad. The story line isn't very good and is very predictable.

This move is a good example of why some sequels should never be made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I enjoyed the first Ghost Rider movie and was excited to see this one.I was disappointed.

The bike was junk compared to the fist one (when transformed). The special affects looked like something from 10 yrs ago.

Total crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"what the f*** was that...","review":"this movie...this movie is not like i thought it would be...i guess the 2 action scenes were good but its not the ghost rider i knew from the first movie...there are so many holes and questions that needed to be answered...like where is the woman from the first movie? what happined to his stunt career? and this movie answered none of them.it to me looks like one of the cheap movies from the sci fi channel i hate...i paid $4.00 to see it a week later.this movie is an extreme dissapointment...the humor is good and some action is too but theres too many holes in the story,alot more foul language then the first one,confusing story plot,an ending that makes you more confused and dissapointed...marvel is usualy great but this movie has been their all time worst...i hope spiderman will be much better then this crap..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just horrible.","review":"I watched the first Ghost Rider before this one, to refresh myself with the storyline. There was no point. This was like watching The Incredible Hulk, after watching the Hulk. It's not a sequel, but rather another tale, that tries to convince you that the previous movie never happened. The movie's flashbacks to the origin changes the story, the character's powers changed, the devil is different by name and ability, and Cage's acting just got worse. It's pretty sad when the lead actor is the worst actor in the film. The storyline was cliche, a throwback to 70's occult films, and badly so. I wish I could get a refund for this waste of my time. I encourage you to avoid at all cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I expected","review":"I was very dissapointed, I did not get a chance to see it in theatres so decided to wait and watch it here...glad i did not pay theater costs..was not worth it. it was not even as close to being as good as the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's just not good","review":"I was waiting for this to come out to watch and I wanted to buy it before it came available for rent and I'm glad I did not. I love Nic Cage but the story, the movie, everything in this movie is not up the expectations I had from the first one. And I have to say the first one was better, way better. Make of it what you want, but for all the fans of Nic Cage I would recommend to rent this and than decide if this is the kind of movie you want to spend your money on to have it in your movie library. Two stars are only because I really like Cage. But otherwise would give it one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"I\`m glad I didnt go to the theater to watch this.

PLEASE!!! file this one next to The Phantom lol save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure fun","review":"Ok dig this, I gave this five stars (movie is really high four) just to counteract others bull roarasorous and oh so trendy negativity when it comes to any move staring Mr. Cage. All of Cages recent movies have been panned by the fluffy brained primadonnas in the press, are you a fluffy primadonna? No? Then you will probably have a great time watching this fun movie. In fact I challange anyone to name a modern actor who is consistently more entertaining and stars in more enjoyable, action packed, no stupid brainwashy message, fun movies than the great, yes I said it, the great Nicholas Cage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the first Ghostrider","review":"I didn't like this one, the filming looked really cheap, like a second-hand C-rated movie. The first Ghostrider had enough action to showcase Ghostrider, but in this movie, it just wasn't the same. This movie didn't seem as menacing, and kind of tame, with weak flames. I didn't like it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is just sad.","review":"I absolutely loved the first Ghost Rider movie, and still do, but this sequel is just so, so sad. From the storyline, to the special effects, to the acting, even by Cage, who is usually so good.Overall, just very poor and very sad, if they had a rating for minus-something, I'd have chosen that."},{"rating":"1","title":"B.A.D. Movie","review":"This, my friends, was a bad, bad, movie. Not a bad-ass movie, as it could/should have been, but a B.A.D. movie. Stink, stank, stunk. Probably the worst Marvel-derived movie of all time.There were hokey special effects, music that kept building to a crescendo but there was no associated payoff in the action, horrible acting (Nicolas Cage looked VERY out of place with his pasty face and his thinning, Grecian Formula stained hair; if they can reboot Spider-Man with a new male lead they could have certainly done the same with Ghost Rider), and a terrible script that made no sense whatsoever.In summary, this was a complete flop.As Huey Lewis once sang in one of his pop songs: \\"Sometimes, bad IS bad!\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!!!","review":"This movie is, to put it nicely, very disappointing.

The first movie was maybe a 2 star movie at best, and had the chance to be great, this one was a glorified turd that should have gone straight to DVD and not been wasted on a bluray disk. If there was a way to get back that 2 hours and 5 bucks I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"AM I GLAD I BROUGHT THIS USED","review":"This movie was just painful to watch. Cage was way over the top, at times I thought I was watching a silent movie (and I wished I was) because the acting was just so hammy. I got this movie because I love 3d movies, for which I'll give it one star, the effects were cool but really wasted in the 3d department. If you like movies based on comics, get a copy of Thor or Batman, even Corman's version of The Fantastic Four is better then this."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT WAS CAGE THINKING?","review":"So many questions with this flick... How could Nicholas Cage put his name on this? How could they make such a horrible movie after the first one was so good??

Save your money and get a good dictionary or other supplement for the language you wish to learn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price","review":"We are using this book, believe it or not, as a required text in an intermediate level French course. I would not recommend it. Almost everything in this book is simply common sense. The information is too general to be useful - it would be much more helpful simply to learn about the language you are studying. The writing is rather simplistic.

It has sweet ballads crooned with Kravitz's soul searching tenor (Black Girl) as well as ear pounding guitar riffs (Are You Gonna Go My Way). He covers the emotional gambit along with a mind boggling array of instruments and recording techniques. He produces and writes almost all 11 tracks with help from members of his band Craig Ross and musical associate Henry Hirsh.

There's a little bit of Lennon, a little bit of Hendrix, and for a little black soul we have Smokey Robinson. Add a smattering of cod reggae and record it all with 'authentic' 60s recording techniques. End result? A dreary copy of the real thing. Most of the LP is riddled with repetitive, lacklustre melodies and predictable, cliched lyrics about Lurv. Only two songs stay clear of the dross, the inventive, subliminal 'Believe', which sounds as if was recorded in some kind of underwater echo chamber, and 'Sister', where Len really connects emotionally. Still, the LP sold by bucketloads. The Question is though, if you can fall for chains of silver, why not go for gold?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Admiration","review":"Admiration & respect.

There is no doubt that these two authors genuinely desire authenticity within the Church and in its leaders. They write with an almost prophetic style calling the Church to reflect on its heritage and to consider where it is going and they desire some wholesale changes within the Church. While I agree with the authors that authenticity and character is needed I reject the idea that the Church is institutionalized and therefore crippled or spiritually bankrupt. Furthermore, it is not enough to simply point out what is wrong and what needs to change if you do not supply some practical wisdom on how to create change.

Mixing it with fruit and juice made for a delicious shake that was perfect during lunch. Recently, however, they have begun using a new vendor and the taste has changed from mildly grassy, which is easily covered up in a smoothie, to very strong mint flavor. This mint flavor is impossible to cover up or combine in a smoothie and makes this product difficult to get past my taste buds. The label shows no changes but the company told me that it was just a different blend from a new vendor...yet the ingredient list is identical. I can't imagine how the ingredient list could not change as the flavor went from no detectable mint to extremely minty. Drinking this product can be likened to drinking toothpaste....not palatable! Shame...maybe they will switch back but for now they have lost my business. I advise you to find another phytofood brand!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Loose the peppermint","review":"This is a great product that has had the formulation of it altered for some unknown reason. Instead of a natural veggie taste that you would expect from a product called \\"green food\\", it now tastes like peppermint on steroids.

It did not come with very clear instructions on how to use it. But it is simple enough to figure out. Maybe practice on some scrap pieces first. It worked well for a while, but then the unbreakable handle broke after the 50th tile or so. I have lowered my star rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Story of the \\"non-breakable\\" handle","review":"I initially thought that the Natco 18 in tile cutter would suit my needs and, acccording to my research, it appeared better than a cutter I could purchase locally. About two weeks after it arrived, I finally had a chance to use it while installing tile at my weekend place.All went fairly smooth once the rails were lubricated and we cut five 12x12 tiles without a problem. On the sixth tile, we scored it well and then when \\"snapping\\" it, the handle of the cutter broke at the point where it attaches to the sliding rail scoring assembly. Examination of the break revealed the statement on the handle itself indicating that it was \\"Unbreakable\\". It appears that the handle is attached to a pot metal slider and that this weak material failed.Overall, I would not advise anyone to purchase this piece of junk. It's a waste of your money. Doesn't cut tile that well even when not broken.Well anyway, I got five pieces of tile cut before it failed. What a deal!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tile Cutter: disappointing","review":"Well, based on the other positive remarks on this item, I was feeling very excited about getting my NATTCO PC1818 Tile Cutter. Unfortunately, the \\"unbreakable\\" handle broke within 6 hours of my using it.I think my lesson learned with this is \\"you get what you pay for\\". There is a reason this is under $40.

Very small paperback with maybe 35 pages. I believe I was ripped off to the tune of $25 for this junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Women better look out","review":"This book is pretty good. It's written in a straightforward, no-nonsense way. It gives a list of where you can meet women, read her body language and know what it means. Conversation, dating; its all covered. Most of it's commen sense stuff, but it made me think about it.If you are looking for a book about how to pick up women and get laid tonight, this book IS NOT for you. It's for teaching men what they can do to keep women interested in them."},{"rating":"2","title":"What dad never told you","review":"Lets face it, women are sometimes mysterious, complicated and make no sense. There is so much to learn about them and sometimes no one to teach you. Jack Wales takes a fatherly role by shedding light on some of the things you never thought you should know. One of my favorites regarding women is on page 44 where he writes, \\"Remember that dating is a way to get to know people, not a way to fall in love.\\" He has several other kernels of truth that can help those who are challenged by women and dating and those who think they know it all.This is essential reading for heterosexuals and a great book.Before my son starts to date I'll suggest he read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish it!","review":"I started out liking this book, but I never connected with any of the characters. I really didn't care what happened to them at all. The ladies in this book didn't seem to care about anybody, or anything in their life either. I never got what was special about their friendship, or why they loved each other.I finally gave up on the book and ditched it. I love dramas and especially books about women friendship. If you want a friendship book for women, try Summer Sisters by Judy Blume."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I was really disappointed in this book.

I love coming of age stories, especially set in the 60's or 70's. But, this book is just plain boring. My biggest problem is that I find the characters underdeveloped. I did not feel a connection to any of them. I am only a quarter of the way through the book, and I don't think I will finish it. Usually a good book takes me only a couple of days. There isn't much of a storyline either. There is no way this book should be a bestseller!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"High hopes that didn't deliver","review":"The premise of this book is good; college roommates who'd otherwise be unlikely to become friends end up becoming the best of friends. The stages is set for their lives to intertwine throughout every era; careers, men, children, parents, aging, etc. But it doesn't. Moody does go through all stages of their life like you'd expect, but for some reason she chose to tell the story from one perspective (Claire), and most of the story is about the other friend (Sally). Claire always flees her own life to be with Sally. For being a story about two people, it's very one sided. And it's a strange format, being told from one person's perspective (though Claire often tells us what Sally is thinking). I also have to comment that I found the character development of the mothers in this story shallow. They weren't \\"bad\\" mother's; they didn't abandon or harm their kids or anything, but it just seems like Moody attempted but couldn't characterize mothering very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining read","review":"I bought this book on a whim just to have something to read during lunchtime. I'm somewhat surprised at the other reviews here, because I've found it to be an interesting and entertaining read.Moody does a nice job with character development, and keeps the flow moving at a decent speed, in my opinion.Perhaps my initial expectations of the book weren't as high as some of the other reviewers, and I suppose I was anticipating some of the strife within the heroines' lives as opposed to looking for a 'feel good--best buddies' kind of book. That being said, I think I've enjoyed it more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Author Makes Characters Real","review":"I read this book partially because of the reviews . . . seems people either LOVE this book or HATE this book. I loved it. The author makes these characters so real and the details in the book so real it seems this could be a true story.The true gift Martha Moody has is that if these characters weren't so real and the story so interesting, people wouldn't expect them to grow. The readers who hated it wouldn't be so passionate about their anger. I think the people who didn't like the book were really just angry at the characters, not the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time!","review":"This book was given to me by my sister and it sounded as if it would be a good, light read. was i wrong! i had a terrible time getting into the plot, there were way too many silly, overly melodramatic stories(a lawyer buying herion to \\"save\\" her brother, please!) and the characters unlikable(you keep waiting for them to redeem themselves or move foward in some way, but they never do). i was very dissaapointed to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Kept Waiting For It To Get Great.....It Never Did","review":"I wanted a great \\"Best Friends\\" book that I could savor and completely enjoy. I wanted to see two women who go through life together and watch their lives intermingle. I wanted to see myself in this book ---- Well, I never did. I couldn't relate to either of these women. I found them selfish and really annoying.... by the end of the book I was so mad I had spent time reading this VERY long book that was really about nothing. Sad and Disappointing....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Great but I have seen worse","review":"This book was strange. I didn't think it was that good but I kept reading it and wanted to read it to the end. The writing is not horrible-I have seen worse. Good try Martha. Give it another try on a new novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really enjoyed reading this novel.","review":"Being a working mom I haven't had much time to read for pleasure. Now that school is out and I am off for the summer, I decided to find a nice novel to read at my leisure. I read this book a lot quicker than I had planned because I got so into it. I found it interesting and enjoyable, and I plan on passing it on to my best friend for a nice read. It's true that the ending left me wanting a little more, but I don't really know how else Dr. Moody could have ended a story like this any differently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"Eh. I was initially engaged as this fiction story began with 2 college freshman girls who are getting to know each other. As a recent college grad, I could relate to much of the story, but as it progressed through their lives and into their 40's, I kind of lost interest. I did not enjoy reading about families falling apart and dysfunctional lives, there is enough of that in the real world. The story also dragged on with no new developments for a long time. It didn't seem like the characters changed for the better by the end, they just realized that life isn't always what you dream it to be. I would pass, it made me kind of depressed about my girl-frienships."},{"rating":"2","title":"a powerful testament to the strengths and variables of friendship between women","review":"Martha Moody has done what few writers bother to--captured a serious and sacred life-long friendship between two women. When so many books about friendships between women seem to reply on either cliched themes of sisterhood or the classic falling-out over men, Best Friends instead chronicles the lives of two women who are very different, who live across the country from each other, and who literally see each other through decades of joys, sorrows, and strange problems. The minor \\"flaw\\" with this book is the lack of plot arch, but for me the book was a saga of one woman's life, and the importance of another woman in it. It's honest, absorbing, and very, very real, something that women should read to remind themselves how much their girlfriends mean to them, and that we're never quite done getting to know each other."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely terrible","review":"I picked this book up on vacation, looking for a good read. Stubborn to the finish, I made myself read the entire book, just sure something was going to happen to bring it all together. It was sheer torture to the end. It seems every controversial topic the author could think of was in the book- embezzlement, drug use, buying heroin for family members, AIDs, infidelity, pornography, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"National Bestseller?","review":"How did this book become a national bestseller? The only reason I am still reading it, is because I do not have another book to read. The characters are not real, the situation make no sense. Do not waste your time. Do not buy this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Very Depressing","review":"If you are looking for a book comparable to Judy Blume's Summer Sisters, this is not it. Very depressing without an ending that brings closure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the fun in this friendship?","review":"Clare flies back and forth to California to see Sally more than she sees her own daughter. The two \\"best friends\\" never really seem to mesh. I know that these two bear no resemblance to any best friends I know. Clare is self-centered and boring. Sally is just kind of a wishy washy wimp and has no common sense considering she's supposed to be a brainy lawyer.I about gave up on this book half way through. Now I wish I would have."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this about?","review":"This book took me forever to finish. 5 months to be exact. In that time I finished 2 other books. I still cannot get over the story line or lack there of. Moody is very vague on detail and the storyline is hard to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Read","review":"I thought this was one of the worst books I have ever read. The characters were uninteresting and I detested Clare. At one point she wonders if Sid molested his daughter - an outrageous, baseless thought to begin with - and on the next page decides he was a good father. There was no plot to speak of.And to a previous reviewer, yes I know what \\"hector means\\". But that's probably because I have an IQ over 75 and have the sense to know when I've read a dreadful book"},{"rating":"1","title":"not an original book","review":"I think this author wrote her book after reading Judy Blume's Summer Sisters. The plot is SO not original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing at best...","review":"I bought this book after some debate in the store, only to discover that my first instincts upon reading the back cover were right.The story never pulled me in and I found myself angry at the fact that the story never seemed to progress beyond its snails' pace and psycho-babble. Unless you like vast amounts of descriptions that really tell you nothing in a novel, I don't suggest wasting your time with this one.Moody seems to have the heart to write and the ability to use big words, but hopefully with later novels, she will refine her gifts and actually create something that will be entertaining as well as \\"thought-provoking\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much there","review":"Typically, I like reading about women friendships and the bonds we have. However, this story just didn't cut it. The characters were nothing spectacular to make me care about them and continue reading. There wasn't much of a plot and I didn't enjoy reading about pornography and the twisted family dynamics. This book was not the compelling read I was looking forward to although it did pass the time while travelling."},{"rating":"1","title":"a waste of my time...","review":"the many typographical errors, unlikable characters, absence of a plot, and the position of putting minorities in stereotypical roles (i.e. gardener, maid, and chauffeur...this bothered me IMMENSELY) caused me to not even finish reading this poor excuse of a book...i will never buy a book from martha moody ever again..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not any friends I would ever want","review":"Amazing...that a story can include pornography, heroin addiction, homosexuality, promiscuity, AIDS, and murder (of one's own child no less) and still be dull! All of these depressing, ugly sub-plots must be an attempt to mask the fact that there is little substance to the plot and the characters are boring. There isn't a single likeable character in the entire novel. A more apt title would be Misery Loves Company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be titled \\"245 pages too long\\"","review":"I always make it a habit to read a book and pass it on, never expecting it to be returned. My book is in the pocket of a plane in Paris, hopefully waiting to be thrown out. I read, and read, and read, with my expectations never being met. The book was shallow, unbelievable, and way too long. She could have given her message in the first 100 pages, because there was no message. I think that she needs to write journals in the areas that this doctor is familiar. She should stay out of our \\"fiction\\" world."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book Stinks","review":"I agree with the reader from Del Ray, Florida -- this book is dreadful. I never warmed to either Clare or Sally. Neither was at all believable, and it seemed as if the author were trying to cram as many life choices as possible into the book -- randomly assigned to one or the other. I could picture the author saying: \\"Okay, who gets the gay husband?\\" -- and then striking 2 fingers on the table to see which tingled more. \\"Middle finger. Okay, that's Sally.\\"This kind of big canvas, random brush strokes approach to writing can work in a short story, I guess, but it totally stinks in a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like this, but found it slow and boring","review":"I honestly thought this would be a great read - my best friends are my room-mates from college, and it is now 20 years later, we all live within 5 miles of each other, and as the years go by, we get closer than sisters. This book i found to be slow - the 'big secrets' were obvious or not really very ineresting- the main 'best friends' in the book seemed to be sad, lonely and not very likable. The dysfunction of thier families was not something that really made them intersting or tragic, just blahhhhh... I had to struggle through this book, it seemed to drag on and on, and the trips to los angeles just more and more boring and uneventful. The friendship did not seem to be balanced, and there did not seem to be a strong bond between the two women, they were just so different and selfish. I was not thrilled with this, i would recommend Summer Sisters, that was a much better read."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun reading","review":"This is one of my favorite novels. I couldn't put it down, and I didn't want it to end. I fell in love with the characters and their story. It also made me appreciate the best friends I have. It is beautifully written with vivid and descriptive detail, though very easy to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cavalcade of Wasted Lives","review":"A well-written book that gets off to a great start but quickly dissolves into a bleak and meandering cavalcade of lives wasted and destroyed. Way too depressing for me. Like other readers, I was ultimately sorry I spent the time reading it. But if you don't mind bleak and depressing, the author does write well, so you might enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did these two characters EVER grow up?","review":"Claire and Sally went from teenagers to 40ish and still had the same issues, still had the same problems, still acted the same, and still treated people and each other the same. THEY NEVER GREW UP. My reading group chose this book and most of us had the same opinion after we read it: Why did the author keep throwing conflicts at the two main characters if she wasn't going to let them learn and change?With so much conflict going on, you'd think one of them would learn something, but with dysfunctional families, embezzlement, pornography, drugs, homosexuality, promiscuity, divorce, suicide, murder, having babies, abandonment, and adultery, these girls manage to stay the same, immature and self centered.Amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"this books rocks","review":"I have many friends that are women. I have one in particular that I have known since 4th grade. This novel articulated the feelings that I have for her in exact wording. It kept me wanting to know what happened between them. The only thing I would implore the author to do is develop Clare into more than just a friend. We don't get to know more about her life outside of Sally. This book really moved me- more than any other book about women's friendships has done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Preachy, Too Contrived, & Too Long","review":"I'm amazed at all the glowing reviews this book received. At best, it is a story about a shared friendship between two women over a period of about twenty years. Nothing extraordinary happens, no great insights, no \\"wow\\" moments. I struggled to get through it and was tired of both women by the end.I know I was supposed to be shocked to learn that Sally's father made his money through pornography -- and I was at first, but it became a chore to read about it again and again (did the author think we would forget?!). I like it when the author poses questions to its readers, but apparently Ms. Moody does not credit her readers with much intelligence.If you want to read a book that captures how emotionally complex and rewarding women's friendships can be, pick up a copy of Susan Kelley's, \\"How Close We Come,\\" or Patricia Gaffney's \\"The Saving Graces.\\" Both are quick, easy reads that prove the importance of women's friendships."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was a national bestseller!","review":"This is basically a \\"coming-of-age\\" story. So to speak. It's about two women who meet in college in the 70's and become best friends. It's told through the eyes of Clare Mann. It follows Clare's friendship with Sally from college to the present. There's no plot. It's just a long and at times boring story about their friendship through the years. Had I been Clare I'd have dumped Sally like a hot rock after about the second visit to California to visit her. Sally never goes to Ohio to visit Clare. Some best friend! All Sally does is whine to Clare all the time. I don't even know why I finished this book. I guess I wanted to see how many kids Sally wound up having, and if Clare would ever tell Sally what actually happened to her brother, Ben. I couldn't help but notice this is the author's first novel and she's a physican in Dayton, Ohio. I think Martha Moody should stick with her day job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not hold my attention","review":"This book had too much going on and I was anxious to be done with it. Its story lines were never developed to really grab my attention. I would not reccommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seldom heard if not neglected","review":"There's a lot of good music in these relatively neglected Prokofiev Sonatas. I'd never heard any of them until I got this CD. Prokofiev's 7th Sonata is pretty popular, and it may be the best of the 9, but these are all good pieces as well. Bernd Glemser is relatively unknown too, but he seems to do an excellent technical and interpretive job here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"I generally tend not to rave about books but Orrin Judd's overview of the debate over sovereignty in this post-9/11 world is among the best compilations on the subject I have ever read. . For those opposed to international bodies such as the UN taking precedence over national governments, Judd's collection is a potent collection of arguments that buttress that point of view. Yet isolationism isn't his intention given the admission that sovereignty can no longer be considered an absolute. Ultimately, it is a celebration of freedom and the dream of those who signed the Declaration of Independence that freedom be known worldwide.

This man was a dreamer, and though he tried mightily to bring a practical focus to his work, the most practical he got was in this book.

Right away, I thought this seat was unattractive. But, it was $10 less than the other seat I was looking at, so I thought I would give it a try. Boy, was I disapointed! I guess you really do get what you pay for. While I did like the cup holders, I thought that the seat was very flimsy overall. When you raise the head rest, the back rest moves with it. This leaves a narrow stalk right in the child's lower back. My son thought the seat was very uncomfortable. Further, I was surprised to discover that there was no EPS foam in this seat! I exchanged it for the Graco seat. It was more attractive, has EPS foam and the head rest moves seperately from the back.

She tells you what your mother and doctor don't tell you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Iovine strikes again","review":"With ever-irreverent and witty writing, Vicki Iovine has created another really great book to help women cope with the adjustments motherhood brings. I liked the Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy a lot better than this book, but as a companion, it was pretty good. I especially like her bare-bones honesty about the less pretty side of maternity and childrearing. It's good to have a girlfriend who has been there tell it like it is. I look forward to Surviving the Pre-teen Years, but I bet we'll have to wait on that one a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I laughed, I cried... This is a refreshing, funny realistic yet optimistic book for weary mommies."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a good one for laughs","review":"This is a breath of fresh air compared to other parenting books, and the author really does know what it's like to be a new mom..all the fears, worries, etc. This really helps you feel like you're not alone in your new life commitment as a mommy. The humor is great...you really will laugh out loud when you read this book. I didn't agreee with 100% of it and felt some parenting styles were slightly criticized (i.e. some aspects of Attachment Parenting such as co-sleeping)but all in all I enjoyed reading it. It's quite a bit like talking to a mom you would meet in the grocery store or the playground, not an impersonal \\"expert\\" like some child-rearing books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks Again Vickie","review":"Just as wonderful as Vickie's Pregnancy book. A must have for the first few weeks back from the hospital when you're unsure of EVERYTHING. Thanks again Vickie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clever","review":"As an expectant (and first-time) father, I found it added some useful perspective to what my wife was going through and would be going through when our daughter was born. Funny as heck, but not for the squeamish.I can imagine the equivalent book for expecting dads :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"She's Our Bible","review":"Every bit as hilarious and wonderful as The Girlfriend's Guide To Pregnancy. She makes you feel as if you're not the only one going through this and helps you to realize that there's no one right way to raise a child and that babies don't break if you deviate from what the Pregnancy and Baby Nazis believe. In other words \\"You already know more than you think you do.\\" or \\"Don't try and raise your child from a book.\\" Her extensive chapter on post-partum depression is the best I've seen, even in the \\"medical\\" books. I would recommend this book to fathers, mothers, grandparents, anyone in close contact with a baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read b4 pregnancy & you'll run 4 for the birth control pills","review":"I rec'd this as a shower gift and it scared the pants off of me. Apparently, the soon-to-be-flooded-with-torrents-of-blood pants. The reviewer who pointed out the negativity is right on the mark. Do we really want to know that the author was scrubbing blood off the floor so the nurses didn't have to? Did this even really happen? I found absolutely nothing reassuring, helpful, or comforting in this book. Find an alternative if you can!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"LOVED Girlfriend's guide to pregnancy, but I was a little disappointed with this one. I was looking more for information on the full first year of motherhood - this is more of a book on immediately postpartum. And I don't know many people newly postpartum that have time to read! This book could have been summarized as a last chapter to the pregnancy book. I will be returning this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to our girlfriend?","review":"I enjoyed guide to pregnancy and learned a lot from the book. But what happened to our girlfriend in her pregnancy & after that caused her to write such a bitter book about surviving the first year!!! Yes it's not always easy but she makes it seem like the most miserable of all experiences. It's actually a blissful time even while sleep deprived.To say that we don't want our husbands to help because we are scared they might do it better!Come on..we have already bonded with this child for what feels like a lifetime by the time they are born.This book failed on soo many levels. Greatly disappointed. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignorant author","review":"The Author of this book is ignorant. She writes in a sarcastic all-knowing tone that I found to be obnoxious. Generalizing, giving what I though to be very bad advice on some topics. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone. Not everyone bleeds heavily after childbirth and not everyone needs stitches after childbirth. I have had two kids"},{"rating":"1","title":"Negative Negative Negative - a sad and depressing view of parenthood.","review":"The advice is boarderline dangerous and full of mis-information. Page after page of fluff. The lack of real substance is trying to be disguised with crude and objectionable humor. After reading this book I dont believe the author never wanted child or even wants them now. Horrible!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"TOOO FUNNY!","review":"This book is an awesome and refreshing account of the stressfullness of being a new mother. Its one of those that you can't put down. She covers everything you will go through and can double you over laughing at the same time! Excellent gift, I have bought for EVERYONE of my girlfriends when they are expecting and after birth!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pre-partum depression","review":"This is a tricky book to read. It is funny, but in a very sarcastic and cruel way. No denying it has made me chuckle, but after reading a few pages I end up with a very bad aftertaste. On one hand it is scary for me, a first time mother-to-be in her late thirties, to read about all the horrors that are in store for me. On the other hand it is very discouraging to read that I'll never get my body back, no matter how hard I try. After I found myself not watching what I eat just because of all the discouragement I have received from this book, I decided to stop reading it altogether and to write this review.If you want a more compassionate, loving, respectful and yet light and fun book about life after the baby is born, I would very much recommend Tracy Hogg's Secrets of the Baby Whisperer. Comes loaded with useful advice and caring thoughts for both mother and baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nowhere near as funny as the Girlfriends' Guide to Pregnancy","review":"Not a bad book, but not as funny as the pregnancy book. That one made me laugh out loud. Also, I found some of her \\"advice\\" to be disturbing, and some of it goes against American Academy of Pediatrics recommendations. I know it's just supposed to be a funny book (and it is), but sadly, I've met a few people who take Ms. Iovine's word as gospel and don't bother to do anything other reading. If only parenting books were as easy to read as her books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Irresponsible writing","review":"I'm pregnant and have to say, THANK GOD I knew most of what she says is *highly* exaggerated before I picked up this book. Where \\"Girlfriends Guide to Pregnancy\\" is on the border of being too negative to be helpful, this one is simply irresponsible writing.While the author acknowledges that she's not a doctor, she takes a delicate, highly emotional subject and spins it for the sake of humor. The point she misses, however, is that the approach would work except for the fact that her target audience is a bunch of women WHO DON'T KNOW ANY BETTER. That makes her a bully, in my book. She's a one-trick-pony who finds humor in exploiting the perils of pregnancy. I personally know a lot of women who tell retrospective \\"horror\\" stories -- the difference is that they understand the difference between yukking it up over a cup of coffee and directing their \\"memories\\" toward an unknowing group looking for guidance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Negative Attitude","review":"I really didn't care for this book. I got the impression that she is just miserable. I don't know about others, but I do not take advice from people who are unhappy. Find the people who are happy and positive to take advice from, that is if you want your life to be happy and positive. I enjoy every second of being my baby's mom and can't wait to have my next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Funny","review":"good read overall. must be read BEFORE baby is born. helps you to realize you are not crazy. would recommend to first time moms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Motherhood Guides","review":"This book is great. It's written in a to the point, overly blunt matter of speaking. It has great information you truly would only hear from your girlfriends and if you are like me...a pioneer amongst your friends in childbearing, you will greatly appreciate advice from \\"your honorary girlfriends\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must have for every new mom!","review":"This book is hilarious! I now buy it for every new mom I know. Vicki's advise is straightforward and witty. It's the only book that helped me through my \\"baby blues\\" and had me crying from laughing too hard instead of from seeing my saggy tummy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"stunningly horrible attitude","review":"Wow. I got this book from a friend and I'm stunned. I figured on a funny look at the reality of living with and being responsbile for an infant...My girlfriends are nothing like Vicki and her crowd. Thank goodness.I'm all for sarcasm and humor. But the attitude toward men (useless clods; though I'm glad she does eventually say they can be caregivers and do a good job) and toward women who make choices toward natural childbirth (freaks) and families who choose a family bed (freakish, and in for heaps of trouble) and other things... too much for this reader. I can only imagine what she would say about those of us who choose to use cloth diapers...Add to that the incredible your-life-will-be-miserable-no-matter-what approach and I would just not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sarcastic and rude to moms who care","review":"This book definitely had some funny parts. I smiled and even giggled once or twice. However, the only reason I finished reading this book was because I wanted to see how many times the author could offend me and mock my parenting choices.This book is rude to so many. It is not at all breastfeeding friendly. It is also not conducive to intuitive parenting. She glosses over some important guidelines for babies and moms. If you want a little humor and don't mind a grand dose of sarcasm and belittling, then this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This book wants to be a funny point-of-view book but the humor is immature and totally self-involved. The advice in this book is taken from the experience of one woman, who's only expertise is she's had children herself (so doesn't the world owe her - big time!) I'm afraid the gist of the book is her, her, her. If you find her cute (as she herself certainly does) I guess you'll like it. I found her grating. The few bits of serious advice can be gotten (together with lots more useful advice) in other, more professional, books. With all the good books out there it is really a wonder that this book manages to always be stocked on the shelves. Lord knows it would be nice to get a humorous book that 'tells it like it is' about motherhood, but this book ain't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"a Sorry Sequel","review":"While I loved her book about pregnancy, this book was a bore.I didn't even finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing follow-up to \\"Girlfriends' Guide to Pregnancy\\"","review":"I learned so much from Iovine's first book on pregnancy, and enjoyed reading it so much, I couldn't wait to get my hands on this follow-up. About half-way through I finally stopped forcing myself to read it. It's not nearly as straight-forward, not nearly as entertaining, and not nearly as educational. Instead, try the book \\"Baby 411\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"somewhat entertaining and some helpful tidbits","review":"I read this book in my eighth month of pregnancy. At first, I was entertained and relieved to read a lighter-hearted pregnancy book. But by chapter two, I was starting to crave useful information rather than funny anecdotes that usually refer to pop culture and tv (two things that are already overstated in our society thank you very much). By chapter 3, I was annoyed and wishing I had bought one of the other recommended books.Overall, perhaps a fun book for those that want to be entertained but get the facts from another source."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a crock!","review":"This book is full of misinformation and personal opinion presented as fact. If she wanted to write a humor book about pregnancy, she should have written one, but she calls this book a \\"guide,\\" and, god help us, some poor women are probably going to take it that way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have BEFORE birth","review":"I received this as a shower gift - one month before my daughter was born. I was so busy getting the house in order I didn't get to read the book until after the baby was born. This is a MUST HAVE book for the 2nd trimester when you're enjoying all that is going around and you're not just waiting for the baby to be born. Only one thing Vicki - how come you don't cover teething??? It's such a helpless stage in the baby's life and when she cries, I want to cry...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Iovine seems angry about being a mother","review":"In her pregnancy book, she seemed angry and bitter about being pregnant. In this book, she seems angry and bitter about the sacrifices of mothering.Giving birth and being a mother are the most difficult things I've ever done, but they're also the most rewarding. I wouldn't trade them for anything. I'm sure that Iovine loves her children, but what a way to vent! Not only was this book depressing, but it didn't make me laugh. I felt sorry for her. Being a mother certainly has its \\"moments,\\" but I go to my \\"girlfriends\\" for support and encouragment, not commiseration about how awful it is to be a mother.If you want a good laugh with your girlfriends, go to your real friends, not this book. You can have a laugh about the unexpected twists and turns your life is taking and still rejoice in the miracle of your young family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my girlfriend either","review":"I'm sorry I read this book. It made me depressed. I read it before giving birth and my experience was nothing like this book describes. My delivery was easy, my husband is a terrific partner and father, and my girlfriends had the same experiences I had."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste....","review":"What's with Vicki ....the book is neither wise nor witty...just nuerotic and annoying after a point.....just note that all the girlfriends including vicki had paid help ..and still whine so much! ...well i too have a live-in nanny for my 3 month old daughter and believe me it takes most of the stress out of mothering...so what is vicki talking about! ...and to insist that all women have baby blues...not to mention the obession with weight...it is a wonder that vicki liked ANY part of motherhood at all. DONT waste your money on this one...it sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing!","review":"This book made me depressed. I don't recommend for 1st time mom because it only covers the negative aspect of motherhood."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't read this while you are pregnant","review":"I read this way too early. It got my pregnancy depression off to an awful start. I am sure it would be better if I read this after having the baby--while up at 3 am, but NOT while still pregnant. I have lived with my darling for 5 months and could never, EVER sit outside the door while she cried. Of course, I can't hire a nanny and moan and groan to my girlfriends about how I haven't lost the weight over morning coffee at the coffee house, but that's because I am a working mom-a teacher in the US. I may be a bit bitter, though. I think we are in such different worlds, I cannot identify with the author in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you aren't interested in thinking for yourself...","review":"During my pregnancy, I read a multitude of books on pregancy, the post-partum period, and managing your newborn. I found this book in particular to be supercilious, condescending, and in no way helpful. I would recommend it to women who have no interest in evidence-based methods of handling childbirth, post-partum care, and infant care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing!","review":"The Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnancy was my life-saver. I absolutely adored that book; it was funny but realistic. So when my due date began to approach, I was thrilled to purchase this book and start reading. Well, what a mistake! This book contains all the \\"real dirt\\" of baby/motherhood, true. But in this case, I think that too much honesty (or is it too much whining) can be detrimental. The author drones on and on about the negatives (I think there is one up-beat chapter about baby-love) and frankly, I was flat out depressed after every reading session.This book scared me to death and had me convinced (and not in a joking/funny way) that I would not sleep, eat, bathe or leave the house for months after the baby was born, all the while being dressed in stained, ragged clothes while my husband regularly wanted gourmet dinners served on time! Not a pretty picture for a first-time Mom who has no idea what to expect, and who is already feeling scared and vulnerable."},{"rating":"2","title":"couldnt have survived twins without it","review":"FABULOUS! what else can i say girlfriends? i was NOT lucky enough to have received the girlfriends guide to pregnancy and i must say, i picked this up myself for something to read while breastfeeding. iovine is outright hilarious and reassured me that i can laugh at myself. for those not amused by her humor-stay away, but otherwise, she can make sure that more women are not steeped in the \\"postpartumish\\" feelings that might befall upon us. it was validating to hear that you would lose things, and immediately after reading that, i lost my engagement ring and the actual book. amazingly enough, when i found the book, i found the ring! i have marked pages for my weary husband to read so that he can understand better that its not just me, that a whole population of women out there are just as crazy as i am. thank you vicki-keep them coming!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning don't read if you are pregnant!","review":"I really enjoyed her Girlfriend's Guide to Pregnanacy, so I bought this one used from Amazon. I am 18 weeks pregnant and after reading the first chapter I was so upset I had to put the book away. All the emphasis is on the horrors of labor and recovery and none of the joys. Might be more amusing to read after I've been through it all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate portrayal of postpartum life","review":"I found the majority of the information to be inaccurate through my own personal experiences and also from doctors. I bought this book thinking it would contain good advice and light-hearted humor from a mother who had been through it all. It contained useless drivel based upon just one woman's experience. I agree with the other readers, it was hard to relate to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book for moms with lousy husbands and cranky babies","review":"I bought this book after reading the first book regarding pregnancy. I found the humor amusing, however, I could not relate to much in this book. My husband isn't a total dud and my baby doesn't make me miserable. Maybe if I were married to a clod and had a cranky baby I would have enjoyed this book more. This book can do more harm than good if the reader buys into the theories of postpartum depression and exercise. Read with caution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gather around girlfriends, this is good spirited advice","review":"I had to write a review after I read some of the other reviews. As a parent expecting my third child, I found this book to light-heartedly reflect on many of the fears of parenthood. At this time in your life one may need help finding laughter after feeling unsure caring for your new family (husband and baby). I just found this book and have been giving it as a gift.If your feelings are hurt by this book, wait until your child does not test into the preschool of your dreams! Get over it.This book is a good fun read. Leave it out for your husband to find."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for New Moms who aren't only Moms but Women too!","review":"I haven't read this book in a while since my kids are 4 and 2, but I will tell you that I did read it both times I had a newborn.

Its out of date, and some of it just rubbed me wrong. I guess I just didn't relate as much. I recently read \\"Planet Parenthood\\" and found it hilarious and on the money. I'd check it out instead. Overall its not bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was expecting","review":"I was really looking forward to reading this book for some relief of the motherhood blues, but there was very little to be found in this book. The book did have a few funny moments, but the \\"girlfriend\\" references were too much. This book doesn't really have any quality advice and your precious time could be better spent doing anything besides reading this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very VERY Negative...","review":"I have had 2 children but ordered this book for a friend who's about to have her first. I decided to read it before giving it to her, and thank God I did! This book will truly frighten her! There is a lot of information about things that no one seems to tell first time Moms, but the author makes it sound like EVERYTHING that could possibly go wrong will. Although the tone is humorous at times, I don't think new mothers will find page after page of negativity that funny. Yes, having a baby is life changing and difficult at times, but it's not the end of the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"very few mothers could relate to any of this!","review":"This was the most useless book I have ever read on being a parent. The author goes on and on about how painful and excruciating breastfeeding is, and how all \\"girlfriends\\" can relate to this pain if they are breastfeeding. Huh?? If she had read any books on breastfeeding at all or gotten some basic advice from a lactation consultant, she would realize that her baby was latched on incorrectly and would have corrected the problem. Also, she talks about girlfriends hiding from their husbands in the house so that they can breastfeed? What?!?! This book just infuriated me, it was so shallow and pointless, I feel like the author lives in a world all her own, inhabited by stepford wife-like \\"girlfriends\\" who struggle incessantly with mothering a new baby and have to hide everything from their dumb husbands who are completely incompetent. How insulting!! Don't waste your time or money on this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, Awful, Awful","review":"I bought this book after using the Girlfriend's Guide to Baby Gear. I was impressed with the book. As a first time mom, the guide was great in a sea of baby items that I didn't have much of a clue about. Saved me lots of time and money.I bought this book used with the expectation that it would be in the same vein as the baby gear guide. I want my $6 and my time back. What a monumental waste of trees and time. This book was so bad that I threw it away-didn't even make the Goodwill pile. She denegrates men to the point you wonder if she's either a hard-core, man-hating lesbian or has *that* terrible of a marriage. With comments like \\"of course you'll be the only one watching the baby! Your hubby will be so clueless that you'll want to snatch the baby from him before he can harm it!\\" It is heavily laced with mom martyrdome. No thanks.Do not waste your money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please save your money, this a bad book!!!","review":"I got this book as a gift from friends and I totally hate it! Its so negative and she's very strong about that she thinks should be done and discounts any other options. Save your money or buy some other books that see pregnancy and motherhood as a gift from God instead of a nuisance. Because that's how she paints the whole picture, as a pain in the rear end experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expecting Dads &#65533; don&#65533;t get this book!","review":"For you expecting dads, especially first time dads - DO NOT GET THIS BOOK FOR YOU WIFE. If it shows up at you house, I would suggest it should conveniently disappear into the lost-and-found abyss.It creates far more anxiety than anticipation. To begin with, your wife will be off balance hormonally and will have very understandable fears of pregnancy. This book, while somewhat humorous, takes the most miraculous time of a woman's life and turns it into a miserable, bleak, depressing experience - triggering neurotic thoughts of abandonment, hopelessness, and misery. You will spend most of your time undoing the dour predictions rather than rejoicing in this wondrous time together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Built-in process to kill the batteries","review":"The shave delivered is OK. Probably a bit better than average. After a period of time (the unit decides this and not you) the 'change the blades' light comes on. Until you do this the light stays on, effectively killing the battery life until you buy new blades. When I called Phillips on this they expressed 'surprise' and replaced my razor, but how can this be when others in this review process report the same thing? Phillips really screwed up on this one. Do NOT buy this unit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Next Generation Electric Shaver","review":"Although the shaver looks like most of the others out there, the big difference is the unique cleaning system that cleans and sanitizes the shaver. The small amount of solution in the reservoir does the job! Although it needs to be changed out occasionally (every couple of weeks or so), it works very well. The whole unit is designed as an attracting and functional personal care appliance. Daily rinsing of the shaver (just flip it open and run water through it to flush out whiskers) works well between using the charging/sanitizing stand. Yes, it's waterproof so you can just do that. With all the shavers out there, I'm pleased with my choice of the 8160XLCC."},{"rating":"1","title":"WATCH OUT FOR THIS ONE!","review":"When I first got the Razor, the Jet Cleaner didn't work right out of the box.

The Razor itself works well, however, they do not honor their warrenty and there is no Customer Support to speak of. I suppose thats what you get from third world manufacturing."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product is poor quality","review":"After less than 3 months of purchasing this product, it stopped working. The unit no longer holds its charge and connecting the shaver to the mains supply doesn't help either.BTW - For anything purchased longer than 30 days ago Amazon's return policy leaves a lot to be desired too. It has put me off buying anything electronic from this site in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I've been using a Quadra Action 7866XL for several years and it worked well, but decided to upgrade to this new model. But it wasn't an upgrade and was very disappointing; it does not shave nearly as closely or effectively as my old Quadra action razor, so I bought new heads for the 7866 XL and continue to use that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short Life","review":"The razor worked fine and did a good job. After about two years it just died. I have no idea what was wrong with it. It would not charge. It would not work with the cord pluged in. No idication what the problem was.

For the money, this one was a waste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice for the price","review":"This razor doesn't have all of the bells and whistles that some other more expensive models have. However, it does provide a nice close shave. Over the years I've bought cheaper razors and one more expensive one. As yet, this particular model seems to strike the best balance (at least for me) between performance and price. Also, battery life, at least so far, has been excellent"},{"rating":"1","title":"Failure","review":"Would rate at no stars if possible. First one failed after 7 months, would not hold charge.

He has owned 4 Norleco rotory shavers over the years. He took this one back. It is WAY underpowered. At first he thought it had not fully charged - but it had. Says it is fine for a teenage boy in his first year of shaving, or for someone that loves to spend 30 mins looking at his face in the morning while going over and over the same area to catch the whiskers. Having to unplug the charging / cleaning station is another design flaw."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's up?","review":"Puchased this about six months ago and have tried to get it accustomed to my beard. It continues to shave slowly and not close. It even bogs down in the mustache. Went back to my Quadra and once again get a really good shave. A waste of a $100. Norelco was unresponsive to my inquiries about why it bogs down just doing a normal shave."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just bought a refurbished model","review":"I bought this model refurbished for about $70 and I'm highly disappointed. The good point is that the razor is definitely very quiet, but it does not cut close at all. Also, I don't know why the new one comes with all that cleaning equipment, when the refurbished model I got says to just rinse it with water and came with no cleaning unit.I've only used this for a few days, and I'm not willing to \\"allow 30 days for my skin to adjust\\" because my return policy will expire. So I'm returning it. I've been using a previous Panasonic model for over a year that gives me a closer, better shave than this razor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Norelco razor","review":"This razor was disappointing for me. It does not give a close shave and has trouble with the old and stiff hairs, particularly on the mustache area.It does have a long lasting battery, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak!","review":"My Braun shaver kicked out and I thought of trying the Norelco because I liked the features and was hoping to get a closer shave. The first thing that was a huge disappointment is learning how weak the motor is on the Norelco. When turning on my old Braun, my entire hand was vibrating the motor was so powerful. Of course, the important question is how close a shave it gives, and the answer - not very. I'm not sure if it's because of the weak motor or bad design, after 10 minutes of skin-stretching and going over the same parts of my beard, I still had plenty of whisers showing. Very disappointed, especially for the money. I expected a lot more from a brand like Norelco. It is going back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I bought this shaver just over 2 years ago.

Maybe Nikki should have did her fans a favor and saved Forever a Hustlers Wife when her heart and soul was ready to embrace the lives of Des and Yarni. She mentioned she had another book she wanted to write instead The Black Widow, I wish she would have left Forever a Hustlers Wife alone until she was ready to tell a good story.

It had all new drama and I was wrapped up in the book from beginning to the end. I also loved the love & passion between Des and Yarni, they were always there for each other.

She follows Will as he tries to find his missing wife and child. Then in what may become her trademark Ms Hoyt starts to veer off the tried and trite everyday world. Her plots do not go exactly where we anticipate. Her plots have a way of going to a better place than we anticipated. Her story works out to leave us with warm feeling of completion -- Of course it was Ms Hoyt and her skill that made it seem to be so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful! Can't wait to read the sequel....","review":"What a wonderful idea for a book! Ill Met By Moonlight is an enchanting blending of fairylore, history, fantasy, the ballad Tam Lin and Shakespearean themes. It is chock full of quotes from Shakespeare and I love how cleverly Hoyt fits them in with the action of her tale. In Ill Met By Moonlight Hoyt daringly uses William Shakespeare as her main character. Shakespeare's wife and daughter have been stolen by the \\"good people\\" and with the help of a gender changing elf named Quicksilver, Shakespeare has to save them ala Tam Lin. The Hamlet like Quicksilver must also bring about the downfall of his traitorous brother who has stolen his throne from him. This is a wonderfully original story full of engaging, sympathetic characters, an exciting, compelling plot and a good dash of humor and sex. It's a fantastic first novel and I am eagerly awaiting the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A straightforward, easy-to-follow guide","review":"Collaboratively developed and written by Karen Mitchell, Craig Savage, and Jim Erwin, Contractor's Guide To QuickBooks Pro 2002 is a straightforward, easy-to-follow guide for setting up and using the QuickBooks Pro 2002 accounting software to expedite one's construction business.

So over the years the quest has been to find the best rotary. I thought the state of the art had been exhausted until I encountered the 8140XL. Although it doesn't have all the bells and whistles, it does give a close shave having the greater shaving area; gives a faster shave.

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I expected a close shave like I get with a blade, but that isn't so.

Well, after a full charge out of the box the RPM speed on the blades was so slow about all it did was pull some facial hair out by brute force, but not by cutting.

It charges fast and holds the charge for weeks.

The 8140 is well designed, easy to handle, easy to move over your face, not heavy, and very quiet. The heads feels very soft and they do not get hot, I was afraid of burns, but after two months of using it that has not happens. The shave is very close, not as close as a blade, but not bad.

I also appreciate the fact that this unit holds a charge for more shaves than any of the previous units. However, this unit does not provide any indicator of the remaining charge in the batteries, otherwise I would give it a 5 star rating. This can present a surprise when the unit just stops when it runs out of juice, or one must be more proactive in recharging. Yes, it will quick charge, but my personal preference would be to have some sort of charge level indicator, which is offered on other, more expensive units."},{"rating":"2","title":"Norelco shaver","review":"The shaver is portable and replaced our 25 year old Norelco shaver.

This new 8140XL appears to me to be cheaply built, to the point that I find myself still leaning towards using the older model. In more detail, the cutting heads are slightly larger on the 8140, but much less smooth (even painful to an extent) than the older model. Also, the cutting head is held on to the 8140 by a very sloppy connection and falls off very easily when you are trying to clean it. The whole general construction of the 8140 seems to much less \\"solid\\" than the older 6848.In short, Norelco seems to have gone towards cheaper cosnstruction in an attempt to save on costs (and yes, to be able to offer the 8140 at a \\"low\\" cost to the consumer). However, this consumer is not impressed. In hindsight, I should have instead sent the 6848 in for new batteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"The charger stand that isn't","review":"One reason I bought this was to get a razor I didn't have to plug in and remember to unplug after charging. This is not a real charger stand its just an extension of the charger cord which still must be plugged in to charge and unplugged after charging. The old shaver I replaced at least had a meter on it to tell you how much time you had left, this one doesn't. Haven't noticed any difference with the 3 cutting blades per head either.Sent my old one out to have new batteries put in and will probably use the new one as a back up. On the + side it weighs less! not that it makes any difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing shave, not as good as Braun.","review":"I wasn't keen on this razor.

I know it takes time for your skin to adjust, but for me this does not give a close enough shave.I was so frustated that I have turned back to using a regular razor.

It has ceased to hold a charge some time back so I had to use it with the cord. Nonetheless, it continued to provide me with a close shave in a short amount of time. Even so, I decided to upgrade to a newer version not only so that I could again have a cordless razor but also to take advantage of any new technology.After extensive research, I settled on the Speed-XL8140 primarily based on price-point and the pivoting heads. Suffice to say, I am extremely disappointed with my purchase. The razor doesn't have near the power that my older model still provides which results in it taking me roughly five times as long to shave each and every morning. I have been using it for the past 6 weeks and it hasn't gotten any better. Even with the extended shaving time, my shave is no closer than it was with the older model. Definitely not woth the $90 I paid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More is not better!","review":"I owned one of the predecessors to Norelco's current Cool Skin line of shavers, however it was stolen from the bathroom in my college dorm, so I decided to give this razor a try. After using the razor for a month, I have yet to receive a close shave without irritation. The razor heads are so large, that they really don't contour to my face at all. Additionally, the excessive amount of openings on the razor head guard only lead to more irritation, not a quick, smooth shave as advertised. I also find it somewhat awkward to use the pop up trimmer. It comes up from the rear, which means you have to hold the razor backward to use it. If I want to invert the trimmer to buzz up underneath my sideburns, I have to hold the trimmer in place otherwise it will fold back down and close.Needless to say, I am sending this razor back to Norelco and purchasing the Cool Skin 7735X - an updated model of the razor that gave me a close, smooth, painless shave for almost 2 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product, Dangerous Packaging","review":"Best electric razor I have ever used.

This is without a doubt the best electric razor I've ever used. It is unbelievably quiet and shaves very close without irritation even on the neck hairs.

It was encased in numerous layers of blister packs with no easy way to cut the packaging to get to the razor. If you're not careful, you can easily cut yourself on the plastic packaging.The shave is adequate, but as I mentioned above it lacks the sound and feel that I used to experience with previous models which diminishes the satisfaction of the shaving experience.I would not recommend this razor and I'm looking for a replacement even though I just purchased it a couple of months ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST RAZOR ON THE MARKET, DON'T BUY","review":"I'VE USED NORELCO FOR YEARS, NONE HAVE BEEN THAT GREAT, BUT IT WAS THE BEST OF TWO EVILS.

Not sure if I got a lemon, but I'm not super impressed. But I just make sure I shave every day and no whisker pulling. Also didn't get everything I was supposed to get in the package.

For the price, this is an excellent choice and has survived several drops from the sink, being thrown around with my luggage for countless thousand miles and generally being abused.

The engineers opted for light, quiet, and battery capacity at the expense of sturdy, efficient, and useful.The blades spin much more slowly than with previous models. I am sure this makes it quieter and makes the batteries last longer (friction being proportional to the cube of velocity?), but the shave is not as good and it pulls at times.Make the blades go faster. Put in a bigger battery or accept a shorter time between charges."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent buy.","review":"I checked at the local big box retailers and the price at amazon was approx $10.00 less with free shipping.

I retired and have slipped into twice a week shaving so I was looking for something that could cut effortlessly through the stubble quickly. It doesn't. The motor seems underpowered. After many passes there are always a few whiskers left standing that I have go back and give special attention. It also pulls more than I was expecting and leaves my face slightly irratated. I have had this shaver for 6 weeks and it is still running on the first charge, but battery life is not a big concern to me.

Here I am on my third one. If you expense the cost over the years you are looking at roughly less than $10 per year (maybe replace the blades once or twice ... of course I never did). For a shave this close, reliable, long battery life, stylish - it is a no brainer. Buy this razor.

I have used a Norelco in the past, but I have been using a Braun foil shaver for the last 6 years. The first thing I noticed about the Norelco was how quiet it was. It sounded like my Braun right before it lost all power. So I was really impressed with how quiet the new models are. The shaver works very good, although it does not get around my neck as close as I would like. (my old braun is a little better around the neck). Shaving also takes about 1/2 the time as my Braun.

Small, holds a charge well, nice protective case. Overall, seems to do nearly as well as the more expensive Norelco I use while home and like my new home razor, is quieter than early versions. Only comment is that the case does not have room for the cord, so I need to remember to take the shaver out between trips to recharge.

Also, the bars are not adjustable so if your arms are not long as a monkey's arm you wont reach (I cant reach them and remain seated).

My husband (who goes to the gym almost daily) was skeptical that a piece of exercise equipment that was so inexpensive would actually be sturdy enough for daily use.It was and is. It certainly isn't fancy and the instructions are not well written (patience is a virtue), however you really get a lot for your money. Having just had a baby (C-section) I relied on the bike and gradually am increasing time on the ellipse. The fact that you can easily alternate positions really helps prolong your workout time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Trouble With Washers","review":"After just one use, I loved this bike. Since I'm somewhat out of shape, having the ability to ride the bike allows me to extend my workout and keep my heart rate up for longer than I could with just a straight elliptical. However, after about 2 months of use, the washers between the bars securing the handles to the foot pedals broke off and now the entire machine creaks and wobbles, especially at high speeds. Thinking that I just needed to replace the washers, I've been on a month long search of every hardware store in my city that has been in vain. I've not yet been able to find washers even close to what I need. Even searching online has yet yielded results. I love the machine and think it was somewhat worth the money I spent, but having this little detail go wrong and prove unsolvable is totally disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"zero stars for this product","review":"Finally, after about a year and a half, I moved this product into a corner of the basement to be thrown out.

That lasted about a month, then I had to repeat the process. I never received a guarenntee on the product of any kind, and wrote the company about it. They said they had it on file, but I never saw it. Anyway, I kept fiddling with it over and over. For a year and a half the product was the worst investment I ever made.

He asked if I had a warrenty on it. I did not receive a warrenty along with this item. I have used this machine everyday since I received it.

Bad mistake, unfortunately!!!After a week, the wheel encased in the front started making a loud whizzing sound. To make things worse, the plastic casing would make a loud crack every rotation when I tried to workout. And, like another reviewer wrote, I also got visited by the black-dust-from-nuts-and-screws fairy who left powder all over the floor.

The day after I got the machine, the left pedal broke. The whole time I had problems with the nut coming off as I exercised. I dealt with it, but after some frustration I called and ordered a new nut and bolt for the left pedal as well. THe company shipped me the right nut, which wouldn't be a big deal, but I am seriously sick of having to skip my workout to order more parts and fix the bike.

Dmitry Yablonsky and the Russian State Symphony Orchestra obviously know this score well, and have a deep affection for the music. The solos are played with great feeling and the orchestra creates a beautifully atmospheric experience.

It works great with both HD and standard definition channels.It does has some minor flaws including minor blurring during the fast moving scenes, however, most of the image flaws are the result of low quality HD signal. It works beautifully with the PS3 or Blu-Ray dvd HDMI input.It is by far the best value, just wait for the price on Amazon to go down to $1,600 and buy.

My whole purchasing experience was very good and I'm very pleased with the TV - great work Amazon and thanks to the many prior reviewers. There are only a couple unpleasant surprises that other potential purchasers may want to know. The picture in a picture feature seems more limited than my previous TV, from what I understand, the Samsung only comes with one tuner so you can't view two TV shows at once. Second, (some other reviewers have mentioned this), the remote isn't very substantial and while it is supposed to be programmable to consolidate other remotes into one, I couldn't get it to support my existing Sony DVD player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Free interest is a joke","review":"I bought the Samsung 4665 tv and charged it to my Amazon.com Visa Card.

I will pay off the balance this month and cancel the card. This is fraud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"This TV is the best one I found. It is worth every penny.

The order went through late on the Friday afternoon after Thanksgiving. Eagle called to arrange a delivery just after noon on the following Tuesday. The delivery men brought the TV into my home, unpacked it, put it on the cart, and verified that it worked. I could not have had a better experience in buying this TV. It is awesome. The thing is only 4\\" thick and weighs about 60 pounds. The picture is so bright that I use it with the power saver option activated to dim the screen a little. I am using the HDMI input from my cable box and I have my PC connected to it. I give Amazon an A+++."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do I have a lemon ?","review":"I got this in July....and it looked great out of the box.

The TV was in excellent condition upon arrival. I've had this TV for two months now, with no problems. My dad bought the LG 47 inch. Comparing the two I'll say the Samsung has a better picture quality hands down. IF you are undecided than don't be. This is the TV to get. Also I must say my experience with Amazon have been straight forward. I ordered the TV, I got a confirmation email with date of delivery, and the next thing I knew I had a man knocking on my door with a TV on his truck.

The little startup melody just plays over and over to a blank screen.Also in the DVD mode (I have satelite) the sound has to be turned up to around 40% to hear it clearly.

Would power on then shut off instantly before the picture could even come on. This started out happening for 5-10mins before it would turn on for good. Now it doesn't come on at all anymore. In my opinion Samsung offers the best picture quality bar none. But they should be ashamed to produce a product with a 3yr life and not jump on the problem right away.

To make things worse many of the panels on this set were defective. I ended up returning the set.

I have read tons of comments from other people with the same issues, one person said the service would cost over $400.I understand that it has been over two years since we purchased the TV and that we are out of warrantee but I feel that Samsung has a clear issue with this model (maybe other models too) and should repair the defective TVs without charge.It really disappoints me that Samsung isn't addressing this issue.

After haggling with rude cable folks I got my HDMI cables and cable box synced up. The picture is amazing. The number of options this TV has is almost overwhelming. (In a good way) When I have friends and family over they are fascinated. To make the deal sweeter, Amazon guarantees the price for 30 days.

We are in the same metro area as his shop but he was going to charge us a $35 out-of-town fee plus mileage.

It would occasionally produce both a picture and sound, but it was hit or miss. I no longer had a TV--I had an outrageously expensive RADIO!Last week, I finally made the dreaded call to a TV repairman. He told me he had a shop full of these blasted Samsungs. His on-the-spot diagnosis was that it developed a \\"short\\" and if he had to replace one of the \\"boards\\" my repair bill could run as high as $800!

After taking the better part of two days off of work (and I am self-emplyed -so by now I've just about lost the cost of the TV), the repair people threw in the towel and took the TV back to their shop with no estimate whatsoever of time by which they might return the TV.

After a week or two of debate I realized that I had to return the TV since I was not happy. I instead decided to spend some extra money and get the sony XBR4.

To their credit, a repairman was sent out within a week, and after 2 calls, the problem was fixed. That was a few months ago. Now, when we turn the tv on, we get a picture for a second, then it's gone. I tried researching this on the Samsung web site among others, without a lot of luck. Five years for a tv that cost 2 grand?I don't have the patience, or tech to try to fix the problem.

Despite going down from 60\\" to 46\\" the increase in picture quality is astounding. While the clarity of 1080p is amazing, it's really the depth of color that I find most impressive about this set. 15000:1 contrast ratio provides the most amazing range of colors vs. darks you can get in and LCD today. As I said, I have the set matched to Sony Blu-Ray player and a hi-def comcast cable setup with Rotel amp/preamp.

Picture quality is phenomenal. The picture is great even from wide viewing angles so even if you are not directly in front of the TV, the quality is great. Easy to set up cable and DVD hardware. The back of the unit is flat (i.e. No protusions or bulky bulges). I wall mounted my unit and its slium design combined with flat back make it as flush to the wall as humanly possible.

They are dip-covered with some laquer.You'll have to spend an hour (per each) with a diamond file, to flatten rounded edges and generally shape them. I have not tried them in work yet, have to polish and hone before that.

It is difficult if not near impossible to use when not laying flat. Also, without separate clamps for each piece to be joined, it is difficult to align corners that don't meet perfectly. With other 90 degree clamps that have dual clamping surfaces, you can clamp one piece of wood and guide in the second then tighten the clamp. This is impossible with the Grizzly clamp, you would need three arms to do it.On the up side, this is a large clamp and works very well when lying on a flat surface with the work piece well supported.

As opulent and grand as everything sounds, however, I cannot quite help but think that this performance is just WAY TOO S--L--O--W!Tintner stretches the first movement out to 30:34, for crying out loud! When I put on my old Sinopoli disk (DG 431 684-2), it is like a breath of fresh air. Sinopoli takes the first movement in 21:08, but the music never sounds rushed. It sounds right.In my view then, the Tintner disk on Naxos might serve as an interesting alternative version that can be obtained quite cheaply, but it would not serve well as a first choice. I would recommend instead Inbal or Sinopoli, but the way the recording industry is heading these days, I'm not willing to guarantee that either of those disks is still in print.

It is obvious that the authors believe the Bible is just a product of ancient myths and storytelling. They disbelieve miracles and explain away prophecy by assigning late dates to the books. The notes put forth theories that are based upon opinion and conjecture rather than solid textual evidence. More a work of anti-Christian and anti-Jewish propaganda than a balanced, scholarly work. Also, while it is not a bad translation, the NRSV does have some gender-neutrality inserted into it. All in all, I cannot recommend this study Bible.

This theme drives an overwhelming number of the characteristic \\"excurses\\" in the NISB, pointing out where the Church Fathers proposed an anti-Semitic interpretation or guarding the reader against a common anti-Semitic reading of the text. It goes without saying that the NISB scholars' perceptions of anti-Semitism are often quite tendentious.

First, it's very hard to find the main headings on any given page. Next, there is a \\"listing\\" at the back that most people will think is an index (I did anyway), and it's really not. For example, in this section at the back, you don't find the word, \\"Wedding.\\" However, if you go to the \\"W\\" section of the book contents, there is a heading for Wedding. So far, of the 20 or so dreams we've looked up, we've only been able to find 2 that we could interpret. I have had much better luck using online dream interpretation software.

Unfortunately, the book is very generic in its interpretations, and doesn't offer informative insight and analysis. The definitions are very vague and the book is for parlor games more than for true dream interpretation. I also expected a bit more illustration, but there were hardly any of those either; just a few abstract drawings. However, the biggest failure of this book and the place where it earns an \\"F\\" across the board is with the indexing and alphabetizing of the dream symbols. The index is basically nonexistent, and the symbols are not arranged alphabetically. For instance, when I attempted to look up \\"Mother,\\" it was actually found under \\"Family.\\" Also, when I tried to look up \\"travel,\\" it was listed under \\"places\\" - the listings are VERY VERY hard to find and when you do finally find them they aren't very good.

Very enjoyable from start to finish. There is a good mix of upbeat, mid-paced, and slow songs. Wonderful intrumentation with trumpets, celesta, piano and glockenspiel.

Unfortunately, many are out of print, including half of this excellent LP; the second side has been reissued on the Bluebird CD Swings. On the first side, Rogers and his Orchestra (which includes such fine soloists as Jimmy Giuffre on clarinet and tenor, valve trombonist Bob Enevoldsen, altoists Bud Shank and Herb Geller, guitarist Barney Kessel and pianist Pete Jolly) perform five familiar songs from Oz, plus \\"The Jitterbug,\\" which did not make it into the final cut.

But, even if you don't speak French the songs and melodies are beautiful and peaceful and you won't get tired of hearing it over and over and a lot of them are English only.

Rudimentary instruments out of toone or short in strings give way to the symphonicals we listen to today. The simplistic taste of farm folk at the time of the Crusadfes and before, delightfully depicts those romantic times. This CD will transport you to a time long gone by yet very much present.

Don't buy it if you want Hogs sound. By two sides, Tony is talking his blues side, and his progressive synth side. The instrumental 'Take it Out' is the highlight of the 5 blues songs. The rest of it is 19 minute epic 'the hunt'. Much of it is spoken. All of it is synth music from one of the greatest quitarists ever. His synth music does not at all match his guitar ability. It appears most people that like 'the hunt' are into its deep lyrics. I'm more into a good tune and great guitar playing. This is neither. Curiosity and love of a lot of the Groundhogs material made me buy this one. Wish I hadn't honestly.

The books were not written separately, but as one long novel and divided into ten parts for publishing. And it shows. The plot moves very slowly, and the entire book is just really a very long buildup. They don't leave for Earth until on the very last page, so don't expect there to be any space adventures of invasion of Earth. I guess that will be in the sequels.The book does have its good parts, and occasional humor, but the pace is very uneven. At times, there are several pages of descriptions of details that are completely irrelevant.If you're just looking for a science fiction novel, look elsewhere. The book does not work well on its own. You must be prepared to read the whole series. If it will be worthwhile reading all ~4000 pages, I don't know yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"I finished this series, but only out of morbid curiosity.","review":"There is little I can add to the discussion of this series. The reviews seem to fall into two lines--people who have read good science fiction, and people who haven't. The latter think this is the greatest series ever written. It does start out fairly promising, and the first few books are quite entertaining, but it seems that Mr. Hubbard contrived the next 5 or 6 books without any real conception of what they were for; he merely wanted to get up to 9 and 10 before wrapping up the story. The intervening volumes wander around aimlessly, adding little in the way of intelligible development. If writers are going to write a 10 book series, please include enough plot for 10 books. This story could have been written in 3 books, and I probably would reread it. As it stands, I'm glad I only bought the first 3 before heading to the library; I don't have room on my shelf for filler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enjoy, because it only gets worse!","review":"I got a copy of Battlefield Earth while in junior high school, and loved it! I re-read it every few years, and still enjoy it as much as the first time. Well, imagine my excitement at the prospect of a 10 book series by the same author! I bought the book as soon as it hit the shelves and started reading, what a disappointment. I got done and wondered where the story was. I forced myself to read several of the following books, but the magic of Battlefield Earth was not repeated. The first book is a passable read, but I would recommend spending your money on something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"I got sucked into the Mission Earth series after reading the spectacular \\"Battlefield Earth\\" (the best pulp scifi novel ever). Unfortunately, after buying in hardback all 10 of these bloated episodes, hoping that they would lead to a great ending, I was sorely disappointed.While the stories do have some of Hubbard's humor and some interesting satire, they don't have the cohesion, pacing or the characters of Battlefield Earth. It's not worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's very funny in parts, long series of books","review":"I've read the whole series of these books and the first one is the best. It has some very funny moments. The arrogant Central Information Appartus( Soltan Gris) guy ends up getting played for a fool. It has stings of social satire in it, like when the hero arrives at earth dressed in a baseball uniform.

As soon as this did appear I purchased the first two books and was excited to finally be able to read more from this author. It did not take long to realize, however, that this was not of the same caliber as Battlefield. I struggled through the first book, gave the second a chance just to see if things would improve, and was so bored by the end of the second book, I vowed never to waste my time on anything else by Hubbard.Battlefield Earth was fantastic. Mission Earth is a lame duck. Hard to believe they are by the same author."},{"rating":"1","title":"The beginning of the end.","review":"I read this book, and the whole series about 6 or 7 years ago. I was way too young to understand the extreme perversion found in this series and this book. though it was entertaining I wish I had never read it.There is ruthless murder, extreme lack of empathy for the suffering of others, the good character is villanized, and the vivid sexual perversions go too far.If you are innocent or too young this series will describe things that you realy should not experience untill you can think for yourself, beware.The main character is worse than I believe any person could ever be, and as the story is writen from his point of view, it tends to allow empathy with him which is not deserved. he regularly leaves a pile of dead bodies everywhere he goes, and takes genuine joy in killing people.I am reading the series a second time in an attemt to confront the thoughts this book created in me.I repeat: read this series with care because you can't un-read it, you can only try therapy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass it by","review":"I bought this series in hardback when it came out. And the only reason I have them all is that I hate an incomplete series on my shelves.This series, while very well written is nigh on unbearable.

Chalker's 'Well of Souls' for one."},{"rating":"1","title":"This isn't just Sci Fi, It is a piece of Literature !","review":"That is arguably the best piece of fiction ever written. I was riveted for all 1.2 million words of the 10 piece set.In fact, I thought this work was so great that I had every copy signed by both John Travolta and L Ron himself.It's too bad that great writers like Shakespeare, Sun Tsu, Tolkein and Mark Twain have passed away--think of the things they would have learned from this epic piece. They would spend endless hours trying to imitate the art contained in these ten tomes of human achievement.Think about it, Hubbard's writing is so powerful that he created a zombie cult on a bet (Scientology), of which myself and John Travolta are members!And this work is no different. If you could stand reading beyond the first few books, you either already are a zombie or you are well on your way to being one."},{"rating":"1","title":"i wanted to like it","review":"I just couldnt bring myself to like this book.

The Plot of this book would have been funnier if the invaders had distributed this story on earth in order to cause the population of Earth to become comatose so they could more easily subdue them. The story has a few minor problems such as bad character advancement, Poor plot line and a story that is not compelling. I would not recommend the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost ruined my childhood","review":"The highlight of this book was the very small fire that the whole series managed to form in my back yard once I'd finished the last one.If you are into slow indoctrination into a more perverse sexual outlook, or perhaps an in depth study of all the different stereotypes of homosexuality, or maybe you just want a slow walk through the terrifyingly sick mind of L. Ron Hubbard, then by all means, buy this book.Honestly though, If I hadn't fallen in love with someone who cares about my mental health then this series could have broken me for good.Avoid at all costs. Unless you are buying it to burn it. Nothing but harm can come from reading this. Please, please don't waste your time and pollute your mind.Go read Dune instead if you need a Scifi fix."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be banned from calling itself Science Fiction","review":"This is the WORST, and I do mean WORST, science fiction novel I have ever had the displeasure to read. Wait...that's not true ... it's the second worst book I have ever read. The second book in this series is the worst (don't ask me why I thought there was a possibility for the series to get better). Dull, plodding, pedantic, and totally uninspired in every way, this book raised to a new level my appreciation for good science fiction ('cause this definitely wasn't it). I guess L. Ron Hubbard must have had some serious diarrhea of the mouth as this series and Battlefield Earth are two of the largest works of science fiction I know of. I guess he was trying to make up for quality with quantity. Anyway, do yourself a favor and give this boring, bloated series a wide berth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caca.","review":"I read the first four books before I was bored todeath. Hubbard's writing style is very pedestrian, and I cannotbelieve that all the 5-star reviews in here did not come from other than Scientologists. This dekalogy is not worth a dime.

I read this set of books about 10 years ago and remember them as extremely readable and absolute page turners. They stand out as among the most enjoyable and memorable of the \\"big\\" books that I have reads, along Dune and Lord of the Rings. The satire is wicked and funny, and some of the observations extremely astute. All through the Bush/Cheney years I kept being reminded of some of the final scenes, especially the reporter who goes around making up outrageous lies that cannot be fought, as well as the scene where the entire episode of the visit to Planet Earth is collectively whitewashed from the populaces' memories by an enormous media production. All very frighteningly true.Highly recommend the set to those who can enjoy a good page-turner without worrying about \\"2-d characters\\" and other such literary commentary."},{"rating":"2","title":"A surely nice book","review":"If you have read the Battlefield Earth of L. Ron Hubbard, you won't be disappointed with this book.Once again the author presents an alien's sight at our Earth.

Science Fiction! Give me a break! This book compares to Sci/Fi the way \\"Green Acres\\" compares to the U.S. Farm Report. After reading the introduction, I was expecting to be treated to some biting satire wrapped in a good Sci/Fi story. Instead, I got a plodding story line that went nowhere for 500+ pages, and satire that reads as though it were written by a third grader. Avoid this book at all costs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolute brilliance that is addictive at the least...","review":"An absolutely wonderful novel with an intricate plot and dynamic characters.

The only reader's that won't appreciate this book are those too stupid to understand it's satire. I recommend anyone who is even remotely into sci-fi books to read this book. An intricate plot is wrapped in the corruption and deceit of the Apparatus. Characters with a personality instead of just meaningless actions. Jettero Heler is so \\"perfect\\" that it annoys the reader. You will find yourself wishing death upon him just as Soltan(the main character) does.

It is a terrible eliptical machine - you definitely get what you pay for!!!I purchased the \\"2 in 1 Elliptical Cross Trainer\\" on 03/05/10 and received my purchase on 03/11/10 via UPS.My husband put the elliptical machine together (with all the tools provided). I was so excited to use this machine. My first work out on this machine was for approximately 10 minutes. The 2nd time I went to use the elliptical (the very next day), I heard an awful grinding noise and looked down to find the right side plastic cracked. As a consumer, I was left feeling very disappointed in the craftsmanship of this product.I contacted the vendor - Golf Outlets USA - and the only good thing I can say is about the customer service I received, NOT THE PRODUCT ITSELF. I received my full money back by 03/18/10.DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ATTENTION you paid for what u get !!","review":"Attention... I love to shop in Amazon and always read the reviews. This time I read them too, but I decide to fallow my instint... Guess what? if u read this review don't buy this product !!!!! Been in my house a week and still trying to make it work good, came without a pieze that give support to handles, scrashes, and make alot of noise.. special a noise like something is broken inside, is weak don't even look like the one in pick. Is the first time something like this happens to me and everything just for not believe in some reviews... this is real.. GET A BETTER ONE, or like other review said.. you paid for what you get and I get a trash!!!! OHHH the only reason I give 1 start is because came here on time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confidence Elliptical","review":"Problems putting together - left arm/pedal bar did not fit properly. I had to tinker to get it together. Immediately started squeaking. I had to tighten the bolts on the left arm after only 1-2 minutes of use - every 1-2 minutes. (Otherwise, not only would there been loud screeching - the bottom of the arm would come apart.) Returning item. Completely dissatisfied with the item but still appreciate Amazon's service. UPS is picking it up today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was good...until it broke in less then a month","review":"This eliptical was good for the money, until it broke less then a month later! The foot rest completely fell off while my bf was on it...three times!, the bottom of the plastic cracked so that it makes and awful noise as you try to pedal it. The wires in the monitor snapped so that doesn't work now either, and it makes a grinding noise from who knows what. I mean how junky...we both weigh less then 200 lbs! We are in our 20's and its not like we have kids or pets running around knocking into it. At least they gave me a full refund..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product.","review":"I bought it for my father in law. And he loves it.Goodmachine. Doesn't take much space. It's easy to assemble and delivery was fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good!","review":"I have been disapointed with this machine from the get go! Things have been breaking from the first week. Just because you do not have the money to buy high-end does not mean you should get screwed!!!!!!!!!! I would not recomend this machine. Spend a little more for one you won't have to replace in six weeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT BUY IT","review":"I'm so upset I wasted my money on this. Its not stable and rocks from side to side when using it. One of the handles doesnt fit right and wiggles while using it. But the worst part is... you lean really far forward! Its like tryin to elliptical while bending over! If you dont want a back injury, id spend a little more money for something decent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price","review":"I bought it reluctantly because it was only $89.00 then I got $10 off so 79, but paid 44 shippping, total was 124.00. We put it together in about a half an hour. At first it felt like I was leaning forward too much on the down stroke so we put a 30 inch two by four under the front part of the frame. Cheap fix, excellent motion, I love it. Computer actually works the way I would have designed it myself. Glad I bought it, encourage anyone not wanting to spend a fortune on one to get this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Workout on it twice a week, it broke by the 3rd week.","review":"bought this machine, based on the reviews on Amazon. It was okay at first. I workout regularly with tapes, outdoors activities and started using the machine twice a week. By the 3rd week it started to make noises as if the wheel was rubbing against the plastic cover of the chain. We tried to see if we can fix it, but it didn't work. I can't use it anymore, mainly because the wheel is not rotating properly and rubber/plastic is rubbing against each other somewhere. You get what you paid for!!! Now I'm looking to invest in something more sturdy. If you exercise once every month this is the machine for you!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT Buy This Item!!!","review":"Less than two months after I assembled this piece of equipment, it collapsed while I was using it. One of the metal joints that was welded at the factory cracked and the unit collapsed. I realize this was a very low-cost unit, but this is not acceptable.I could not under any circumstances recommend this piece of equipment to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Should Have Listened...","review":"In all my purchases (trust me, a lot!) with Amazon, I've never had a problem with an item before. I figured with so many reviews, a 3 star wasn't bad knowing how negative people can be over little things. Well, I should have listened.The product got to me on time and in great shape. It was more solid looking than I had expected. It was a little confusing to set up, but once I sat down and looked at the directions, it was pretty intuitive.However, during the first use, both pedals snapped off due to the extremely cheap plastic used. In addition, the bike was very wobbly. I returned it (which also went very well, thank you) and found a better elliptical at a garage sale for half the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"You get what you pay for. I should have returned this product but didnt feel like taking the hour it would take to take it a part to ship it back. The design is alright but none of the bolts stay tight. The handle bars for your arms do not stay tight and you must stop in the middle of a work out to tighten them back before they fall off. One of the bolts for the foot pedal was threaded backwards and had to be turned in the opposite direction of normal. Also both bolts to the foot pedals are very cheap and do not tighten. The foot pedals become very shaky as the bolts loosen as you work out. Twice the bolt came completly out and the pedal fell to the floor. After the second time this happened and a large resulting bruise on my calf I stopped using this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive Coat Rack","review":"This machine is a complete piece of junk. Essentially it's the wheel for an exercise bike with some upright handles attached. On that note, it would be a terrible exercise bike as well. This is not a good elliptical. The fly wheel is very light so there is no stability to the machine. I tried what another user did and put a 2x4 under the front of the machine but that didn't help. I sanded a rut in the 2x4 for the front bar to sit inside but that didn't help, either. This machine now stands in my guest room collecting dust and holding coats from time to time. It was a waste of money.I purchased this machine a year ago and have used it no more than 30 times. The last time I used it, it wobbled around so much that I could only work out for 9 minutes. Don't waste your time or money on this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for tall people!","review":"I am six feet tall, and this machine is unusable for me - the handles are so short that I have to hunch down to grip them, which gives me back pain. As a result, I always feel like I'm sliding forward, my toes pressing up against the front of the pedals.This could be a decent machine if only they'd been mindful of all of their customers and made the handles just six inches longer!Now I need to find a short person to sell this to so I can get some of my money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elliptical Cross Trainer with computer","review":"This is a great product.I bought it for my granddaughter for her birtday,and she loves it,and really nice for price.others are very expensive,and this one suits her fine,she's only nine and wanted to get in shape so figured this would be a great way to begin,and believe me it was.Very glad I purchased this.Would reccomend to anyone.Mary"},{"rating":"2","title":"You get what you pay for.","review":"It took me a day to put together because they one of the hex-key bolts were locked in due to the split washer; which was an absolute pain in the ass. Also I bloodied my hand (slit my wrist by accident .. ) in the process of loosening the stuck bolt with my knife (note to self: you are not Jack Bauer, a knife is not a tool you use on moving machines) -- the build quality is not sturdy but I am only 120 pounds so it's fine for me. They were missing one of pedal bolts, which I had to go out and match; because they wouldn't return my calls.It hasn't broken (yet), but if it did -- I'd probably buy a better quality machine; as I only got this to see if I could commit to actually using it daily.If you're mechanically inclined and light weight, I suggest it; otherwise forget it and go the +$500 route.+200 pound people WILL break this machine in a week, trust me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value bad packaging","review":"This machine works really well, its not quite an elliptical machine it feels more like standing up on a bike and riding only with a bigger pedal stroke and you can use your arms to help out. It feels solid enough consider the cost and size. The main complaint is the packaging. The bolts weren't in a plastic bag rather they were look like they were just tossed in the box before shipping. After assembly one of the front screw that holds the legs in place was missing and I searched everywhere. Out of a hunch I opened the plastic casing and found the screw sitting inside, it must of slipped inside the open slot in front. Had they put ALL the bolts in some kind of bag this wouldn't of happened. Also the machine leans forward to much so I would strongly recommend putting a 2x4 wood piece of a dictionary under the front so it feels more comfortable. For the money this is a good value and clearly it says in the instructions to check the bolts and tighten as needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yep, I broke it.","review":"It ran smooth at first. For about a week. Then the chain started slipping causing a loss of tension on the pedals (throwing off my groove) and making a terrible banging noise. Also riding is accompanied by a terribly loud clicking noise. All this made it where I could barely hear the tv cranked all the way up while using it. The seat gets in the way if you are standing. The handle bars go WAY too far back so I had to take them off. The pedals are positioned on a narrow bar and I feel like I'm going to break them in half if my feet slip. You get what you pay for. If you want an elliptical that will last about the same length of time as a bic razor, this is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for use during pregnancy.","review":"I am on pregnancy #2 right now(one right after the other) and needed something to work out on that wouldn't make me sick. This bike did not cost a lot, is pretty basic and I am still able to get the amount of a work out that I need. Definately worth every penny. Easy to put together and doesn't weigh a lot. It's a little wobbly during use because of how light it is and I have it on carpet so maybe that has something to do with it too. I am pleased with what I got for the money I spent and will be able to keep myself in good enough shape that I will be able to make a quick rebound from my pregnancy. I will continue to use it after my pregnancy too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"Awful....the item came with damaged parts. Cracked Pedal and missing washer.I sent e-mail for replacement. But nobody got back to me. Now I am using this unsafe machine and the pedal bolt keep falling off due to missing washer!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Deal. Great Shipping","review":"I was skeptical of the quality and build of this item when I ordered. But it really is a great value if you are not wanting to spend $400+ on an elliptical. Shipped quickly and easy to put together."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissappointed","review":"I received this elliptical and was so excitd to get it only to find out I had to put it together, It was missing a couple of washers and the instructions were not very easy to read..plus alot more information than needed very confusing. Have no idea why i thought it would get here in one piece. Fedex did a good job of beating up the box and probably broke it because when I used it it automatically started clacking.....sent it back without a problem they refunded me ...my boyfreind got one too same problem it was beaten up and broken as well and returned ..maybe should try differnt method of shipping or stronger packing. all and all I really like the size but I bought a used one ..bigger than needed but not broken and i didnt have to put it together"},{"rating":"1","title":"worst","review":"see i bought tis machine in november i used it only for a month after tat i went to india and came back now the leg pad is broken because tey have fixed it in tip .. so it came out now we r searcing for washers to fix it but we r nt getting it .. waste of money...if somebody can r if te company can please send me a pad again"},{"rating":"2","title":"max user weight?","review":"does anyone know the max user weight on this item? i have searched online and can't find info. hoping it comes with the product manual.thanks in advance"},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"Like I said, you get what you pay for with these kinds of things.
