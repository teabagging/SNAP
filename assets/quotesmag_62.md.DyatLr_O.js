The movie was filmed in Italy and had the feel of a spaghetti western, though it wasn't a western at all. What really surprised me was the quality of the DVD picture. It was crystal clear even though the movie was initially released in 1978. Corinne Clery played the part of Eve, a sexy wife that constantly bickered with her husband. The music was awesome. It went back and forth between a type of hillbilly banjo music and gypsy music more reminiscent of Romania. The music made the movie in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"This PI has a miserable life...","review":"and you better like reading about it in excruciating detail.

DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY","review":"I bought this cute little vacuum, and after absolutely hating it for nearly one year, I have junked it. First of all, it is very loud. Second, wildly flimsy. Beyond that all the tools fall off while you use it! Even the main floor attachment. To make this more aggravating, the actual hoses (the metal ones) fall off each other! It also has a flip brush option for carpet/hardwood. When you flip it into position, it just flips right back when you begin your task!If I hadn't immediately thrown away all the packaging, I would have returned it.Please dont waste your money on this piece of crap. I am sooooo surprised that hoover actually has not pulled it! I would never buy any hoover again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"I bought this vacuum 14 months ago and it was a disappointment from the start. I was too lazy to bring it back to the store but I've finally given up on it. Now the power cord can no longer be pulled out of the machine so it's pretty much unusable. The main problems with are the following:- Cheap plastic construction (e.g. wheels go flying off, pieces break, etc).- Weak suction. (That's a pretty fundamental problem for a vacuum!)- The hose, telescoping chrome wand and carpet/floor nozzle constantly separate. No matter how much force you use to attach them, the pieces pull apart constantly while vacuuming. It's very frustrating. More than once I've had to resist the urge to throw this contraption out the window.My recommendation: spend a little more money and get a real vacuum cleaner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoover little orange canister vac","review":"Outstanding value on Amazon. Bought one two yrs. ago at Hoover store for $80 vs. $50 something at Amazon with free shipping. Arrived within 2 days of order. Replacing old unit b/c wheel fell off. Not worth fixing but will still use as back-up for hard floors on second level. This is a powerful vac and fairly sturdy except for the wheel on the last model. Metal extension tube is very sturdy but be sure to fit it tightly into the hose or it will tend to slip out and drop on the floor. I bought a large brush accessory at the Hoover store with horsehair bristles. Cost about another $20 but it makes vacuuming hardwood and tile floors quicker and easier. This is a very powerful little vac. Comes with accessory brush that doubles as crevice tool (top comes off) or leave brush on and it is great for vacuuming floor moldings and woodwork. Buy bags on-line in bulk for best savings."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for...","review":"The metal tube that connects to the hose, does not have ANY locking mechanism, so it often comes apart, VERY annoying. I now have it rubber band together. Also, the power is pretty weak, you would have to go over the same spot several times just to get the smaller surface stuff sucked away. For the same price, probably would get more for your money with a strong hand held.Definitely would NOT recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really cute, too bad it doesn't work well","review":"I bought this vacuum to clean a small (about 700 sq. ft.) house I rent. It's an adorable vacuum which is good because there's not a lot of storage so it kind of sits out there, and it's definitely not an eyesore. Unfortunately, it just doesn't clean so well. The vacuum power is reasonable if not vigorous, but the handle is too short -- you need to bend over to use it, even my 5' 4\\" girlfriend is bent over halfway using the thing. I guess it's good that you're down there because the hose detaches constantly and you need to put it back together. Be careful that you don't use the vacuum enough to fill up the bag! We went all over town -- in a major urban area, no less -- to finally find bags that fit the thing. Unfortunately, I absolutely would not buy this again. Only gets two stars because it appears to actually generate a vacuum consistently and without trouble."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fits the bill perfectly and affordably","review":"Last year, I had hard wood floors installed in my home, and I wanted a new canister cleaner to clean up the dust and such. I shopped around quite a bit locally before I found this Hoover.I've been completely satisfied with this cleaner. It would be nice if it were bagless because the bags are hard to find unless I buy them online.2011 update - I am still using this vacuum cleaner, and I am pretty happy with it. There has been one downside. The electrical cord tends to head back inside the vacuum on its own, so I have to tie a knot in the cord when I am cleaning so that it doesn't retract before I am ready. For me, this doesn't take away from the item's usefulness.I have been buying replacement bags here on Amazon.com at a decent price."},{"rating":"1","title":"it is o.k.","review":"I use it when I clean my son and daughter in lsws home.

No, I didn't expect a whole lot of suction, but this is what we bought because we were on a tight budget and also had very little storage space in our new home. Why do I curse it, every time I use it? Because the extension falls off the hose, and all the brushes fall off the extension! I'm usually in flip-flops when I vacuum and so many times I've been hit in the toe by falling parts! It also isn't that compact when it comes to storage. It takes up just as much space as any other vacuum cleaner, as far as I'm concerned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"I agree with the other ladies who have written reviews: Cute litte vacuum, no suction and the dang wand won't stay together - extremely annoying!

At that time, I bought this product because I had small house and I thought this little vacuum cleaner would be a good. Also, I have been told that Hoover make high quality vacuum cleaner, but this product made me very disappointed! We use a vacuum cleaner twice a month. After few months of using this product its wheels came off and its Floor attachement broke. The floor attachement part come off very often while you are using it.

I love the orange and the fact that it's lightweight but that's where the love affair ends. The wand is always falling off and I have resorted to keeping it off and using it like an oversized dustbuster. I suppose you can duct tape it together but what's the point of that? It is terrible on carpeting, even very flat low shag carpets. The bags are hard to find and expensive. I usually just reuse the ones I have, cutting other close looking bags to size. You have to constantly clean the filter because it clogs up so fast and then all suction is lost.It's cheap though and ok for small areas but backbreaking for larger spaces. Don't recommend it unless you live in a one bedroom apartment without carpeting, don't want to spend a lot, vacuum only a few times a month , and don't mind appliances that fall apart while you're using them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, but won't stay together","review":"This vacuum is adorable and cleans my hardwood floors well enough. Unfortunately, the hose has a tendency to disconnect from the vacuum head, which turns a normal household chore into an exercise in frustration.

However, the cord stopped retracting after 3 uses, and the nozzle constantly separates from the long metal wand.

They insist there is no known issue with this vacuum cleaner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quiet and light","review":"I was looking for a canister vacuum after being disappointed with a bagless vacuum I purchased a while ago. The Hoover Portable Canister vacuum was a great choice. I love how light weight it is and was surprised by how quiet it turned out to be. It would be perfect if it had a little more suction but that is the only reason I did not give it 5 stars. Great value for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Looks - don't count","review":"Purchased this Hoover 3 months ago. I currently have a Eureka Mighty Mite and decided that I wanted to have another lightweight canister vacuum for downstairs. I happened to come across the Hoover Bright Orange canister vacuum and thought it was so neat looking, and since it was a Hoover - how could you go wrong.Well the problems are as follows: suction - fair at best; wand connecting to the head won't stay put - it keeps coming apart no matter how hard you push the wand into the head; the bag - since I wasn't getting any suction I checked the bag and found that though it was only half-filled, the bottom of the bag had disintegrated - this happened twice. I'm not sure if this was due to its close proximity to the filter/motor, but I have never had a bag do this on any other vacuum cleaner I've owned.Sorry to say, but it's a great looking vacuum, but that's the only thing going for it.Definitely buy the Eureka Mighty Mite if you're looking for a vacuum for light cleanups."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good, performs ok, falls apart though","review":"I love to look at my little orange hoover and it doesn't do a bad job of cleaning up a 1 bed apartment that includes hard wood floors and a shaggy rug.

You will spend half of your cleaning time putting the attachements together...and watch out when they fall they don't break something. I hope Hoover read these reviews and change this design fault. Until they do I recommend you go for something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoover Canister ORANGE vacuum","review":"I LOVE this little orange vacuum! A lot of design and thought went into this vacuum. It's light, but pretty powerful considering the size. IT's perfect for my little house with hardwood floors and oriental rugs. I can literally carry it while vacuuming and it has a dial that you can actually vary the degree of suction with. In other words you can turn the suction down far enough to dust delicate things like lamp shades, or up enough to vacuum rugs! I've never seen this feature in any vacuum before and I love it. It only has one attachment though, which is why I only gave it 4 stars instead of 5. It really could use a corner attachment so you could vacuum corners with something other than the metal pipe, (or the samll brush) that will scratch hardwood floors."},{"rating":"1","title":"No suction","review":"This vacuum cleaner is very cute and practical(you can vacuum under the furniture) but at 8 amps, it is not powerful enough for carpet.

So let me fill you in: this is an 8 amp vacuum. Now you know why everyone says it has poor suction. It's also pretty tough to clean carpet very well without a rotating brush, which this is also lacking. NO indication of that on the package, no picture showing you that you're buying a canister vac with no brush (dumb). Hose comes off the head because the only thing holding it there is friction. The bag is minuscule, seriously. I'd like to say this vacuum sucks, but really it can't even do that. Small, light and cute are the only things going for it. So disappointing because I like Hoover's stuff, we love our simple old Tempo widepath and I'm going to go return this and buy a Tempo for the office as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy, unless you just want something orange.","review":"this thing does not work. i mean, come on. it's so cute. don't you think they would charge 300 dollars for it if it works? it barely picks up anything on the hardwood floor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT get this vacuum","review":"I have no problem with the attachments that come with this vacuum. I love the no-frills approach, and it comes with only what you could possibly need. I don't even have a problem, as some people have mentioned, with the wand coming apart. I would be happy with this vacuum if not for one thing: THE SUCTION. It has very poor suction. When it comes right down to it, that's the main reason for having a vacuum, no?If you live in a dorm or want to vacuum up your hardwood floors, this would probably work fine, but for expanses of carpet more than a few feet (especially with cats. What was I thinking?) go for something more robust."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new approch to life.","review":"An excelent book, it reminded me that historical figures such as Rilke, Nietszche and Freud were also confronted with fear and angst.

The Infinite Concept of Cosmic Creation is a book which describes a universe which is infinite and unending, composed of energy and follows no mysticism, deities or chance but adheres to strict scientific laws. Originally written in 1956 as a series of lectures and letter compiled into this book it is still amazingly current. The author really dismantles religious beliefs and stresses a scientific approach to everyday living. Historic events, philosophical and moral issues are addressed in a relativistic manner and the author makes one think about good and evil in an \\"Einsteinian\\" framework. The author keeps challenging accepted beliefs and summarily shatters them, forcing the reader to really think about things .

I know they wanted to be with Terri when she died. Maybe they could have been if they hadn't been in a bitter feud with her husband leading up to her death. This situation could have been handled so much better than it was. Was it Terri's wish to have her family saying such awful things about each other? I don't think so. These people, and a ton of media people, owe Michael Schiavo an apology."},{"rating":"1","title":"How tragic","review":"Terri's family ignored the facts when she was alive and now write fiction after her death....shame on them. They can write whatever they want to make the family look loving and close rather than the dysfunctional reality that it was, but facts are facts. Nothing they write can change the court transcripts, depositions, nursing home records, or accounts of their lack of personal involvement. It's especially shameful that her brother and sister now \\"live off from Terri\\" when they couldn't be bothered to even visit her when she was alive..... shame, shame, shame on them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thumbs Down for \\"Terri's Family\\"","review":"Anyone gushing over the \\"concerned and loving\\" parent's of Terri Shiavo really needs to read Michael Shiavo's book on the life and death of his wife. Unlike \\"Terri's Family,\\" he uses real documents, court and hospital records to support his case. He also exposes the Shindler's (in particular, Bob), as being much less concerned with their their daughter's treatment and more more concerned with affording a bigger condo.Terri is finally resting in peace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emotions not Facts Rule this Book","review":"This is the Schiendler's recounting of the events that led to their daughter Terri Schiavo being removed from life support. It is a very highly emotional story. How could it be otherwise? However, the emotions get in the way of the facts of the case. Many of the alledged events they say happened before and after Terri's collaspe, never happened. Even at the end of the book, they discount the findings of her autopsy. I honestly believe this book was written for monetary gain. Sensationalism always sells better than the facts. To get the complete story I reccomend the book \\"Terri\\" by Mike Schiavo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another good one from Wylie","review":"This is the third and final in an excellent series of books by Jonathan Wylie. I was lucky enough to pick these up cheap at a garage sale - they're not easy to find now! But keep an eye out for them in the secondhand book stores cos they are worth the read!PLOT:Xantium, the once glorius capital of a great empire, is now a burning shell that harbours unimaginable evil. The Empress Ifryn and her family have fled to the Southern lands, while Fen, Dsordas and their companions have returned to Zalys, their island home. But even in these remote places they are not safe, and their battle with the usurper, Chancellor Verkho, is far from over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broderbund Customer Service is a Bummer!","review":"In view of the terrible reviews that were posted for PrintMaster 17, we ordered a DVD for PrintMaster 16 to replace our old PrintMaster 15.

Well done Sir."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pleasant Surprize","review":"This was my first Hiaasen book (and I purchased it used for a dollar)so i wasn't expecting much. i usually like cozy mysteries, however, in this case I was glad to make an exception. The book was wry and wonderfully funny. Three dimensional oddball characters and crazy situations (written smartly). None too deep, I felt like I was on a particularly manic Spring Break. Nothing wrong with that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bogs Down After a Good Start","review":"The first 50 pages or so are indeed laugh-out-loud funny. The next 50 are okay. But then it really bogs down, goes around in circles, starts repeating itself, and just gets dumber and lamer. Hiaasen is a great writer and humorist but he just ran out of steam and ideas on this one. By the end, you just want it over with. All in all, not among his best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Carl Hiaasen","review":"You know, when an author puts out a number or series of books, there are bound to be favorites. Unrelated, I always found Robert Parker's \\"Searching for Rachel Wallace\\" to be my favorite Spenser, Nelson DeMille's \\"Up Country\\" my favorite DeMille and my favorite Follet, easily \\"The Pillars.\\" And this is my favorite Hiaasen.\\"Striptease\\" is funny and in it's own way riveting as is \\"Skin Tight.\\" But \\"Native Tongue\\" raises the bar on well written wackiness. I would tell you about the plot but I'm not sure there is one. Just watch Joe Winder, a frustrated Carl Hiaasen in his own right, and wait for the appearance of Governor Skink. That's ex-Governor Skink. 5 Stars. Larry Scantlebury"},{"rating":"1","title":"Humorous, but too many errors","review":"I enjoyed the book but the author's errors occurred in areas that I'm very unforgiving of. In one place he mistakes semi-automatic firearms for fully-automatic firearms. Even if the author doesn't feel obligated to do much research for light fiction like this, the editor should have caught something so blatantly wrong.I enjoyed some of the ridiculous characters that always show up in his books. But, like Stephen King, I'm beginning to notice that he has certain characters that he uses again and again. The hermit in the woods that knows everything. State troopers are always perfect and dedicated but feds and city cops are dummies. Throw in a scene that involves a complicated sexual position. It just seems a bit lazy. I know it's light fiction, but I like a bit more flesh to my beach reading.I should mention that I didn't actually \\"read\\" this book, I listened to the unabridged audio version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ultra-sleezoid characters","review":"Carl Hiaasen has a delightfully warped mind. \\"Thank God,\\" his devoted readers will say. Like his others, this book is set in a very bizarre country known as South Florida. And all of his baddie characters are intent on exploiting the environment or scamming tourists. Native Tongue begins with a family vacation being \`disrupted' when a rat - uh, no, a rare weirdo vole - is tossed into their rental car. A convertible: perfect for rat-tossing. Insane and inane but dedicated environmentalists are pitted against the usual bad guys: real estate developers and environment rapists.Four stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"More like Hiaasen-lite","review":"Dang, Carl, how could you?Let me start by saying that CH is one of my favorite writers. His stories aren't necessarily epic in nature but his dialog & characterizations & writing in general are virtually beyond reproach. Even though his storylines border on slice-of-life rather than edge-of-your-seat thrillers, Hiaasen's writing is typically so good, his books are still extremely entertaining page-turners.That said, Native Tongue was quite a letdown for me. Usually I'll finish a book like this in one or two days. I struggled for almost two weeks to finish it, putting it down at the drop of a hat.In his defense, this was one of Hiaasen's earlier efforts. Everything since Native Tongue has been infinitely better. If you're new to Hiaasen, don't let this book turn you off. His other works are definitely worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I gave this book to my sister who is always looking for good books and she said when she was reading it she laughed so hard she had to put the book down a few times. It's a a great book & I am glad to introduce this author to another reader!"},{"rating":"2","title":"There's a method behind the madness","review":"This is not necessarily a typical book by this author. Although it has the usual strange and demented characters, there's a serious purpose hidden under all the fun happenings. That is, the author laments the passing of the Florida ecosystem to developers, and he is particularly aiming at Disney, although the book doesn't come right out and say it. Even without keeping in mind the somber undertones of the book, the reader will enjoy the usual wild ride through the Florida environs with a strange, but eerily comforting, cast of characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hiaasen, where the unexpected and unaccepted reign!!","review":"This is classic Hiaasen, serious eco-message, whacky characters and a fast pace that pulls it all together!When a former journalist takes a position as a publicist for an entertainment company he finds himself party to a big con job, and that is just the beginning. This story brings together Skink, the former Florida governor turned eco-terrorist/hermit, and Jim Tile, a Highway Patrol officer, a slimy con who is in the witness protection program, a little ole granny who shoots people to make a point and a young woman in a raccoon costume. When more land begins to undergo development in the Florida Keys, and endangered animals and people start disappearing you know Hiaaasen will take you on another crazy ride where the unexpected and the unaccepted reign!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hiaasen's A Genius!!","review":"This is my first Hiaasen novel, and I read it in two days during the approach of Hurricane Bonnie. I just couldn't put it down! The whole thing is so unrealistic, that you can't help but believe that everything in the entire book is true. This world is just that wacky! And it has something for everyone... Mystery, murder, comedy, sex, passion and a cause. I can't wait to receive my next Hiaasen novel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Some of the best characterization ever","review":"I can't get over how much I enjoyed reading every word in this book. Hiaasen's dialogue is fantastic and there is never a wasted word, a testament to his journalism background. His dark humor resounds in the book, giving his characters a depth to their shallowness and an erotic edge to some pretty dicey situations."},{"rating":"2","title":"An entertaining and easy to read book.","review":"Hiaasen has another good book here. The book is revolves around Joe Wilder and his PR efforts for the Amazing Kingdom of Thrills theme park in the Florida Keys.As always there are unseemly characters abound. And Joe takes us through a rollercoaster ride of fun and games as he tries to bring down the man behind the carnage.The book is well written and easy to read. Parts of it had me laughing out load while I read, making my better half think I'm a little cuckoo!Over all I found this to be a very enjoyable and funny book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely entertaining","review":"The book didn't make me laugh out loud like the critic quote's pasted inside the front cover say they did. It did get a good chuckle out of me but more importantly it kept my interest through the end.The strangeness yet believability of the characters and the situations where \\"if it can go wrong it does\\" keept me turning pages.I liked it enough that I want to give Hiassen another shot especially after reading some of the reviews on his other works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Summer Read!","review":"I love all Carl Hiaasen's books but this one is one of my favorites. Each one of Hiaasen's books about Florida have one native that is fighting to try to save some of Florida's natural habitat/animals. Native Tongue is about 'saving the endangered Blue-tongued Voles'. As the story unfolds we discover - there aren't any Blue-tongued Voles -- only regular Voles with their tongues dyed blue with food coloring! Just another scam to lure clueless tourists to Florida.In the end, the good guys win, and the bad guys meet an uncomfortable end. If you need a laugh - pick up Native Tongue."},{"rating":"2","title":"I smell a rat!","review":"Mickey Rat that is. Carl Hiaasen does it again with an imaginative poke at the big boys in Orlando with Native Tongue. As you can expect there are environmental undertones to the story, but that's what makes this one so lovable with an ensemble of screwball characters that are all too believable. Hiaasen does a fantastic job of painting a picture that reveals more of Florida's odd residents as well as its fragile beauty.James A.

While this book doesn't seem to have the same \\"flavor\\" as the first two, it is still an enjoyable read. (It seems a bit odd to see Ludell as an independent adult while she's still in a series of books written for children.)

On the same order, I bought a sock cover that you pump the air out of with a little hand bulb pump.

This book presents the best of the best in the perfect package. Some were laugh-out-loud funny with Reilly's sardonic wit, while others definitely put me in a pensive mood for the next few hours.The way Reilly writes his columns shows that these stories are about life and that sports are the secondary factor.

The Leap Frog walker is USELESS. The wheels move & spin WAY too easily... the walker can easily get away from your child; plus, any tiny bump or nudge and the music either starts or resets.

I was told he couldn't be responsible for an item bought from the store! The package was not tampered with, and when I told him that his attitude was rude / negative. I asked if he could help me, maybe he could send a donation to our town's new autism center. He said No - we already make other donations. This company does NOT promptly try to fix a problem. Even when I told him I would tell others of their poor customer service."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, solid toy","review":"My 11 month old weighs 22lbs, so I really needed something that would be solid and strong as he tries to learn to walk. Some of the walkers we'd use at play group or at friends' houses were too light, and when he'd push on them, he'd go flying forward. So I really, really appreciate this toy. It remains stable as he stands up, and moves at just the right speed when he pushes it. The music on it is pleasant, it has an on/off switch with volume control, and it has different settings. It isn't really a toy for him to just sit there and play with it for a long period of time, because like some of the reviewers wrote, it has to be moving to really get it going and do a lot. I still give it 5 stars anyway, because I really appreciate it as a walker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mother of 2 boys","review":"This walker is great. We bought this for my 10 month old son, who showed NO interest in walking at all. Within 3 weeks of using the walker, he was walking on his own. My only complaints are: 1. The handle could be adjustable to allow for growth. I have tall boys and they have to lean over to grab the handle. 2. Also, if you put any pressure on the drum, it moves off the spinning wheel and won't turn. Try to explain to a baby that he can't push on it... it doesn't exactly work. Other than that, it has fun activities and the boys love it, even now that they walk well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy It! Frustrating Toy!","review":"Save your money! Here are the problems: 1)clunky and heavy to push (difficult to turn for a child) 2)frustrating for child b/c not much 'hand manipulation' -- In other words, other toys gratify a child's need to push buttons/see a reaction-- the only thing a child manipulates is the 'yellow horn' button which just shows 3 shapes. My son broke it b/c he tried to turn the wheel and push the piano buttons--these are not meant to be pushed! 3)Poor 'wear-ability' -- In other words, it broke quickly for a toy. Now the music sounds like an old broken record (seriously). 4)It uses up battery power quickly, too! INSTEAD--We got the Fisher Price Brilliant Basics Musical Activity Walker--GREAT BUY! LOTS of items for hand manipulation, EASY to push, for baby AND toddler use, and fun with or without batteries!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Product is Sub-Par at best","review":"The wheel on the product makes a grinding noise that easily overpowers the music and the music itself is terribly annoying and resets everytime your child hits a button making it cut into the words that are supposed to be teaching your child things! Not a bright idea Leap Frog! Also, I got this for my son when he was almost 1 for Christmas last year and when he would pull up on it, it would take off going forward leaving my child on the floor behind it wondering what the heck happened! This toy is already broken and it isn't the fault of me or my child, it is the poor workings of the wheel. It refuses to spin after changing batteries, cleaning the battery ports with an alcohol pad, and other suggestions from leap frog support. NOT recommended, try at your (and you child's) own risk!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"False advertising","review":"Well, it looked great in the store, but wasn't what we were looking for. I am actually bringing it back today to get a refund. The sound tracks are great. The music is pleasant and upbeat, but you can't really \\"play\\" with it.

I'm glad others are enjoying it, but I felt we did not get our money's worth, especially since it's not that sturdy and moves really fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Fragile","review":"My son received this walker for Christmas. It is a good walker because it allows plenty of room for his feet between the wheels. But as a toy, this thing doesn't hold up. Unfortunately, my son likes to spin the alphabet wheel which initially just worsened the sound quality but has now completely jammed up the songs. We don't even bother turning on the sound anymore which is a shame because when it worked, it was fairly enjoyable (especially the trumpet). This thing lasted about 1.5 months. Not good enough for a toddler's toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this push toy","review":"My son loves it and loves pushing it around the house.The wheels are not too loose so it's ok pushing it on the wooden floor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the $","review":"This toy is not worth the money, there isn't any interactivity with the toy at all! The front looks like there are lot of things to push, it is misleading. The only interactivity is rotating the little ball on the side with the shapes on it. The rest of the movable parts only move when the walker is pushed. It's probably a good toy for some, but my son MUCH prefered his Little Tikes Push & Ride Racer. This item doesn't interest him much, not worth the money for us. But each kid is different."},{"rating":"2","title":"If I could give it 10 stars I would!","review":"This is by far the best gift my son has ever received. He spends hours a day playing with it...not just walking around with it, but playing with it too. The music is catchy and fun, and I often catch myself singing it even when my son isn't playing with the walker! He easily pulled himself up using the wide handle, and was walking around in no time. Even though he isn't walking unassisted yet, he will crawl to this walker and then walk to get something he wants...it truly is an amazing toy. This is durable as well...my son has run it into the wall many times, and there's not a scratch on it. My only tip would be to buy lots of batteries...it takes 4 AA and we have changed the batteries once a month since we've had this toy. That just shows you how often it will be used!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a play toy, just a walker assistant","review":"I wanted to buy a toy to help with the next stage, walking. My son is 8 months old and is standing and climbing on his own. He used the toy to help him stand but then there was nothing else to do. He could push it but he was looking up the entire time not even at all the stuff going on down below. I didn't want to teach my son to walk with his head hanging down either.The toy really misrepresents itself when it says you can lay it flat so they can play. The toy offers no real interaction for the child, except the horn that can turn, everything else is activated when the child walks behind it. I was disappointed that the child couldn't even spin the wheel in the middle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very handy kitchen gadget","review":"This does the job that it is designed to do.

The information is getting to be a bit dated. At least half of the hikes we have tried have had some outdated information.On one hike, the trail was nearly gone after what appeared to be years of no use. It would have been somewhat dangerous for us to continue the hike.I will probably throw the book away and get a more up to date one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dated material, not current with the areas changes.","review":"This out-of-print book is quite outdated itself.

Again, very outdated material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightenment through Music","review":"The challenging part about reading a book by an enlightened being is that the author is writing from an experience of consciousness (non-duality) that is impossible for the ego (duality) to comprehend. However, Hazrat Inayat Khan's writing is easily understood and could be valuable to both spiritual aspirants on the path to enlightenment and/or musicians looking for deeper levels in their artistry. This is a book to be studied, not just read.

Avoid this coffeemaker at all costs!","review":"Boy, I sure wish I'd read these reviews before buying this \\"coffeemaker\\". I had the exact same problems as everyone else right from the start. No matter how much jiggling and wiggling I did, it constantly overflowed ... I had grounds in the coffeepot, all over the counter and in the water resevoir! The \\"sneak-a-cup\\" never really worked...I would take out the pot and it would just run even faster! What a piece of junk. I lasted about a week before I pitched the darn thing and bought a DeLonghi for just $10 more that I absolutely love!Save yourself the cost of the rolls of paper towels needed to clean up after each brewing session and avoid this coffeemaker!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoot the so-called designer of this coffeemaker!","review":"This is absolutely the worse coffeemaker I have ever owned or used. As indicated in the previous reviews, you end up with coffee grounds and water all over the counter and the design causes excessive amounts of grounds to fall into the water resevoir. The coffee is good but not any better than most. I cannot believe I let my husband talk me into getting rid of my Proctor Silex, 12-year old, \\"does nothing special\\" coffeemaker just because it was slowing down and looked old."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a piece of junk","review":"this is a good looking pot with just the right features however it is a very lousy design. My problems are a filter arm that will not stay attached when you go to clean it or remove it from pot. I am constantly chasing the little spring down the sink, under the cabinets, under the stove or anywhere else that little thing can roll under. I have had B & D send me two replacements and they all stink! What a total waste of money.

At least it was a gift to my dad, so whenI move out in a couple months, I can find a new one for me that actually works!It has always made coffee, but frequently overflows if you don't position the potjust right so the lever unplugs the basket.

Who knew you had to?"},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE WASTE OF MONEY!!!!","review":"My mother in law bought this for us as a Christmas present. It worked fine for about 3 days and then the problems started. I made coffee one morning and walked away. I came back about 3 minutes later to find coffee running all over the counter. I removed the pot from the burner to stop the flow and cleaned up the mess. When I replaced the pot on the burner, the same thing happened...I adjusted everything possible (basket, pot, etc.) and nothing stopped the coffee from spilling out. I still have no idea what happened. I emptied the pot and started over and it worked fine. Days later the pot began to leak constantly. Coffee drips when the pot is removed for pouring, the unit sometimes begins to brew immediately and other times it takes a few minutes to start. I am very disappointed since I have always had good luck with this brand. This thing is going in the trash and I will buy another brand!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk","review":"Coffee pot looks great and sounds good on paper, but the engineering must have been done by a group of 1st graders. When brewing, the drip part of the filter holder does not line up with the hole in the carafe, and the carafe does not totally engage the anti drain lever. This causes the coffee to not run out through the hole in the bottom, but rather overflows out the top. Also, if you pull the carafe out while it is brewing, it causes coffee to spill everywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT RECOMMENDED - LOOK SOMEWHERE ELSE","review":"Bought the pot and knew the first day that the drip proof pot wasn't drip proof, but it sure sounded good. Soon the burner coating started peeling off and now, after only a few months, burner element died. Nothing but trouble. I thought Black and Decker had a good reputation, but after this one, questionable. BE SURE TO SEND YOUR REGISTRATION IN on this product. You are going to need it."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star, please, it deserves LESS!","review":"This is, without a doubt, the most annoying coffeemaker I have ever had the displeasure to use or own.1-It leaks water everywhere, at least when it is not overflowing because the pot isn't contacting the back lever (for the pause and serve \\"feature\\").2-It overflows every time because, no matter how hard you push the pot back, it never fully depresses the back lever.3- The coffee is always full of grounds because the water comes into the basket from the tank under too much pressure, causing the grounds to spray up and over the basket edge.4-The coffee is never hot (everyone who likes lukewarm coffee, raise your hand -crickets- that's what I thought).Overall, This is a beautiful LOOKING product (which is how my husband and I got suckered into buying it), but it does everything you DON'T want your coffee maker to do.

This caused the unit's digital controls clock/timer/power (at the base of the unit) to go haywire. I haven't been able to use the clock/timer since. For the past 2 months I have been making coffee by plugging it in and pressing random buttons until the pot starts brewing. Now, 3-months after occasional use, I can't get the unit to turn on at all.

In this recording Abbado is conducting with style, but without extra sentimental effects. Domingo sounds fresh and surprisingly dark - a close to ideal Riccardo. Bruson's rich baritone works well for Renato, and he is one of the best singing actors of the modern operatic stage. Yelena Obraztsova is the best Ulrica on record. There is charm in Gruberova's Oscar and Raimondi's Samuel. Ricciarelli is the only unfortunate member of the cast. Her voice sounds much worse in the upper register. In the first act trio you can barely hear her next to the powerfull voices of Obraztsova and Domingo.

Starting in issue 44, Joe Sinnott took over as inker of Jack Kirby's work and the result is startling. Sinnott dramatically improved the art and brought out the talent that Jack Kirby has.The stores themselves and mixed, but the Galactus tale still holds well including the introduction of the Silver surfer. My personal favorite is the battle with Dr. Doom after he stole the Silver Surfer's powers. Doom pontificates in all his bravado and the FF finally realize (du) they are out of their league.

So far this game ranks right under final fantasy X, and X-2. The story line is a 4 out of 5, graphics 4 out of 5, music 5 out of 5, and replay value is definetly a 5 out 5. Its a dark tale about different tribes trying to reach nirvana, which can only be achieved by defeating all the other tribes. The battle system and leveling up system somewhat mirrors Final Fantasy X-2. The only thing i regret about the game is that it is short, but part 2 will be out by the end of this year. I highly recommend this game. Its much funner than star ocean, or shadow hearts.

It is so relevant of childhood and the intimate imagination each child experience. The drawings are astounding, in their detail and quality.It is definitely a book to treasure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the 10 bucks!","review":"Virtually every track of this recording is distorted due to what must have been excessive gain during the recording.

Both singers are too operatic for this music, and the orchestral backing is lifeless. Avoid this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A drab, lifeless performance.","review":"More proof that James Levine is the most consistently overrated conductor of the last 25 years. He's been able to hold a certain New York job for quite a while, so really all the praise must be for his consistency rather than artistic depth. But then one listens to a recording like this, and the drab, lifeless, superficial musical mind of Mr. Levine becomes as evident as ever. We're talking about an absolute musical masterpiece, two fine singers, and one of the world's great Mahler orchestras and what do we get? A recording that could easily be mistaken for something on Naxos. Forgive my vitirolity, but it's disconcerting that standards have reached such a low point, even with Deutsche Grammophon. Hey, if all the notes are correct, it must be a great performance. Delete this one quick, DG. You already have a winner with Guilini."},{"rating":"1","title":"a shame","review":"I give this production 2 stars because from a purely musical point of view, there is something to admire here. The orchestra is well handled, the vocal performances are fine and the engineering is well done. However the staging is a travesty. This opera is about the way that man is \\"dehumanized\\" by war and other harsh elements of modern society. I think the plot and music of the opera demonstrate this in a very convincing manner. I do not see that the replacement of the proper scenario of this opera with one which is simply absurd, and which features ridiculous costumes, pipes everywhere, pervasive images of human cadavers adds anything to it. I'd advise a pass on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"hell on earth","review":"Berg - WozzeckIf you are looking for hell on earth, this it - nothing is omitted; necroophilia, bestiality, sodomy - all in a staging that resembles mechanical intestines (intentionally, according to stage director Bieito).

In fairness, the singers are quite amazing for artists willing to endure this.Oh, BTW - the baby is closer to puberty, is gassed and graphically toilet-trained onstage. Is this original?

If you are looking for all the artists that played and all the songs from Live Aid this is NOT the set for you. In fact there's been some audio recreation on this set which I don't think is even mentioned in the collection. I felt gyped but you can read about it in Wikipedia's listing for Live Aid. Good performances by U2, Bowie and Queen as is expected but some of the other 80's acts are HORRID! I was at Live Aid and had no sentimentality for this package. The good thing is that this set promises to give some of the money to the Band Aid effort, though where that money will eventually end up is as mysterious as where Led Zeppelin's fottage wound up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete, Greed","review":"I moved my TV onto my deck that day so I could better my tan for a date that night.

It was a happening. When Led Zepplin came out with Phil Collins on drums, I thought I had died and gone to rock heaven. How can a band not allow its footage to be included in this DVD?

I am sure some footage was lost but don't buy for one minute the explanation on the DVD that nothing was saved. In 1995 on the 10th anniversary of the event VH-1 showed a special packed with highlights. Led Zeppelin not being on is another lame excuse from the band. If they are so concerned about their image why do they allow their classic \\"Rock and Roll\\" to sell cars.

I remember watching the event, and even have a well-worn, now-unwatchable VHS tape of some of the acts.If you want to know what music was like in the 80's...Live Aid encapsulates pretty much all of it. I think it's easier to say who wasn't involved with it than who was...and Phil Collins managed to perform on multiple continents for it. The lineup is absolutely stellar, and there are very few bad performances to even bother noting.It wasn't as racuous as Woodstock, and it wasn't as Gonzo as Lollopalooza...but Live Aid documents a moment in our artistic and social history that makes the price of this an absolute steal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bob Geldof, Queen, Judas Priest and U2 were Great!","review":"I purchased this DVD because of Queen and Adam Ant. The Queen set was perfect and the Adam Ant song was an interesting look at him in a live performance. I also enjoyed the Judas Priest set, U2, Bob Geldof, David Bowie, Dire Straits, Hall & Oates with Eddie Kendricks & David Ruffin from the Temptations, Ultravox, Paul Young, Patti Labelle and Teddy Pendergrass. The highlights for me were Bob Geldof singing \\"I Don't Like Mondays\\", Freddie Mercury and Brian May performing \\"Is This The World We Created?\\", David Bowie singing \\"Heroes\\", the appearance of Teddy Pendergrass, and the confrontation between Bob Geldof and Margaret Thatcher(I'll never think of her again without remembering this footage). For these moments alone, I am perfectly happy with my purchase. There are many performances that I will probably always skip; but the good on this DVD far outweighs any of these mediocre performances."},{"rating":"1","title":"I won't buy it, and this is why:","review":"1.

It will take me back to that day in 1985 when I was glued to the TV until late in the evening. Many people wrote they missed Led Zeppelin on the set. I was not much into that kind of music those days, so don't even remember them. But (if I am right) the Cars also sang: who's gonna drive you home. I absolutely miss that song on the set as it gave me the chills. Furthermore I am surprised to see the US recording of \\"heal the world\\" on the set. Basically none of the \\"stars\\" on that song actually took part during live aid. I was quite irritated and angry that day in 85: where was Michael Jackson, Prince, Stevie Wonder, Diana Ross, etc, etc.Nonetheless I advise: go and buy it, relive that day and for the young ones I would like to say: look, listen and experience real music.

Dylans and the Stones performance only contained Blowin in the Wind. Billy Joel, Plant and Page, and Waylon Jennings were not even on the dvd's. On the positive, there is the entire Queen perfromance which is worth buying the dvd's for and the great performance by Mick Jaggar and Tina Turner which was I think the highlight of the show. All the other perfromances are edited or missing songs to the best of my memory. The quality is medicore at best and the sound is not that great either but is better than nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame. Why did they bother?","review":"The booklet claims that footage has been misplaced or lost or whatever. However, if you watch the way certain acts are edited it's obvious they had the missing footage, and simply skipped portions of performances instead of including the entire set. Secondly, it is inconceivable that there are no broadcast quality recordings of this entire event available. The notes would make you think assembling this DVD was next to impossible, but c'mon. It was 1985, not 1955. We're not talking about lost kinescopes here. No question, this is a scam to release a more complete set in a few years. All this on top of bland, amateur packaging... Yuck.

Unfortunately, I sometimes see a reoccurring flaw within in a story, and I can't shake it to the point where it ruins the whole thing for me. In this case, not to be blunt, but has Joanne Baldwin ever met a man she didn't think was gorgeous and wanted to sleep with? I'm far from a prude, but I find it hard to like a character who seems so hard pressed to sleep with any guy she meets, human or otherwise... If you can get past that, it's a nice read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware the weather - and the F-bomb","review":"The story's fun, no denying it. In terms of plot, my only problem was that the author tried to be too coy with why the heroine was on the run from her Weather Warden peers.I just wish Ms. Caine hadn't been so coarse in her choice of language. When the \\"F\\" words start to outnumber the plot twists, I decide the author lacks creativity.It's a shame, as I was looking for a series to enjoy. This one's got a good concept, but I won't fund it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Story is awesome, preoccupation with sex stupid","review":"The story itself was great. The preoccupation with sex deserves 0 stars, yes, a big goose egg. I know many can look past the sex, with Joanne constantly talking about guys butts, muscular bodies, the vividly pornographic scene with David caused me to have a very guarded view of the rest of the book.Note: If a pontential reader is looking for porn and wants to disguise it then this series is it. I decided to give Ms. Caine a second chance with Heat Stroke. It is worse... Ms. Caine, please leave out the sex or at least keep it to yourself and the series would be #1 best seller for a long time.

Few authors can catch and keep my attention. Rachel Caine put her hands around my throat and she squeezed. This went way beyond can't-put-the-book-down, she induced a state of reader coma so deep that I was sure if I stopped reading the story would go on without me and I'd never know if the characters survived.

Buy it.HJ"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent series!","review":"I've read recommendations of the series since I started reading paranormal fiction (started with the Dresden Files) and kept putting it off with the thought a book about some chick that could control the weather did NOT interest me.

However, they are what made this story so fun.

The female protagonist, Joanne, is strong, loves cars and mechanics (thumbs up!) and seems to have a realistic view of the world. This creates a very promising plot, with action, battles and some romance. But in the end, it was missing something, maybe I just didn't sympathize with Joanne, or it was just a lack of more character's insights . Well, it's the first book of a series and I haven't read the others yet, so it really is just an introduction to the Wardens and djinns world."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Little Disappointed","review":"After reading the \\"Morganville Vampire\\" series I couldn't wait to get my hands on more Rachel Caine novels. I ordered \\"Ill Wind\\" to start reading the \\"Weather Warden\\" series. I found \\"Ill Wind\\" to be disappointing. Whereas I couldn't put the Morganville books down, I had to force myself to read this book. Maybe it was the subject matter that turned me off.

Plan for speed.\\" Paranormal romance so hot you'll feel like a Fire Warden is in the room with you, working their magic, as you read. Who would have thought the weather could be so exciting...and sexy? Ill Wind (Weather Warden, book 1) is a fast paced urban fantasy thrill ride that builds like a gathering storm. Joanne Baldwin is a fabulously tough heroine who likes fast cars, strong magic, and hot men. Not necessarily in that order. I will never think of Djinn, or the weather, the same way again!I recommend Ill Wind (Weather Warden, book 1) to readers of paranormal romance, fantasy, suspense, and especially to fans of urban fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Romance, Mystery, Fantasy or Weather Warden","review":"The best thing about this book is its brevity.

Then on a lazy afternoon I picked it up to read only to finish it the same night.The characters are not in-depth as I would like and all the flashbacks were a bit maddening, but the action just didn't stop. I wanted to know what would happen next and I truly LIKED the main character. She was sexy, confident, and smart.In Ill Wind, the world doesn't know about the unknown heroes, the weather wardens, that protect the people from mother earth. Without the wardens, mother earth would have distroyed all known life long ago. Joanne is one of these weather wardens who is on the run for her life. The people she once worked with are trying to capture, and possibly even kill, her for killing her boss.

On the nitpicking front, it was interesting that in the book, tropical storm Samuel was early in to the Hurricane season, but starting with a letter \\"S\\".

The story moved along quickly throughout and was enjoyable. But I'm not sure if I like Joanne or not, and the relationships between her and the other characters didn't make me feel much about them either, other than David. It was a good set up for an interesting new world. The whole idea of the weather, specifically storms, being sentient and out to kill us, was fascinating to me.

Its anecdotal narrative doesn't always work (the sequence with the tyrant is amusing but too broadly played, for example), but it does build up a picture of an alternative, more open-spirited approach to religious devotion more in tune with nature than scripture, and the ending is both funny and quietly touching, as Francesco's followers spin round and round in circles until dizzy to find which path God wants them to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After reading information about St. Francis, I thought that this DVD would be very inspirational even with subtitles. However, it was seem to portray the characters as too dimwitted to be taken seriously as spiritual examples.

Compared to other movies of St. Francis, 'Francesco' for example, this movie is terrible. First of all, the acting is horrible. Second, the \\"Flowers\\" of Saint Francis that come out in the movie are fruitless when compared to other more subsantial themes from the book. The movie doesn't even develop the 'flowers' (stories) well. St. Francis is not even depicted as the humble saint he was, but rather, more like God himself. St. Clare is inserted in the film in a very odd and abrupt way, saying nothing but a prayer in mass. Also, the movie deals with nothing of St. Francis' pre-saint phase (granted, the book doesn't either). I can go on and on about how this movie is bad. Buy Francesco instead and learn more about St. Francis."},{"rating":"2","title":"AUSGEZEICHNET!!","review":"The muscular scene of Wotan and Loge entering Niebelhiem ALONE is worth the purchase price!

The songs are much too slow and lack the same bright choruses. The hidden track only hints at what might have been although none of these songs would bear comparison with those on 'Eventide'.

Otherwise, it is an abysmal rendering of a sentimental but beautiful old opera. How Sir Thomas Beecham was snared into conducting this silly relic in 1929 is incomprehensible. The singing is worse than mediocre; it resembles a parody of the type of operatic scenes depicted in early talkie movie musicals circa 1930. Robert Easton has got to be the most dreadful devil ever recorded, more or less talking his way in a flat drone through the part rather than really singing. The less said about the other two leads, Heddle Nash and Miriam Licette, the better. Beecham was much better served to conduct an authentic Faust, in French, with Geori Boue & cast in 1947. If you want a 1930 Faust - and there is an excellent one - get the French conducted by Henri Busser, and/or Beecham's later, postwar version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Important work on neglected subject","review":"Although there have been other efforts to tie economic theory to ecology, game theory, and other fields, and even, as in this book, to physics, particularly thermodynamics, none has approached the breadth and depth of this author's work.

We then grill the chicken, and we bag our chicken, 2 breasts per bag, for freezing.When we thaw the chicken for our dinner, we have consistently had wonderful, subtle yet spicy flavor.

Interesting story that flowed between current and future and back again. The idea that a future child could be created and then appear and go back in time many years was intriging. It surprised me and had me thinking of the future, could it be so bleak? The future in this film was a bit disconcerning but well done. The lead character is sexless, was it male or female?

Don't bother!!","review":"I purchased this movie after hearing a great review about it on a science teacher's listserv. I was excited to see if their praise for use in the classroom would be accurate. I was so disappointed!! IT WAS AWFUL!!! The only part my students would pay attention to is when the main character is swearing at the top of his lungs, oh and the part where he watches a porno. The scenes from the future with the maintanence clone are confusing and they do not explain well how this future world came to be. The first 3/4 of the movie are slow and I was hoping for more depth. The last 20 minutes pull it together a bit, but overall this was a waste of my time to watch. Maybe I went into it with too high hopes and looked at it from the wrong perspective of use in school. Either way, I was disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy This Granola","review":"If you are into Granola, and you haven't tried this, you really should give it a go! Out of many granolas that i have tried, this is definitely my favorite. Oats, Honey, Canola Oil, Almonds, Vanilla. That's pretty simple! It turns out it's not only simple -- it's pretty great tasting too, especially as executed by Udi's.I often eat this granola in plain yogurt or milk. It's sweet, but not too sweet. The almonds are sliced thin, and add a nice contrast to the oats. But my favorite part of this granola is the texture. Hard, but not too crunchy. The oats aren't 'chewy' like in some granolas. perfect.I have nothing bad to say about this stuff. I foresee more orders in my future!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Granola","review":"I'm very diligent about monitoring what goes into my body as nutrition and have been making my own granola for years.

But this was too obvious, too pedandic and i wound up not finishing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"Until now, I have loved everything I've read from Charles de Lint. This one was a big disappointment. The characters and the situations were strained and hard to believe - both left me with a feeling of being contrived. This is in stark contrast to my impressions from other novels that I've read. This one seemed like he was trying to be 'hip' using technical lingo (why he would do this, I have no idea!), but instead it just sounded dated (the lingo is indeed all out of date) and unnaturally stilted.Definitely would not recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable.","review":"I had a hard time deciding whether to give this 4 or 5 stars. It's probably a solid 4-1/2, for me. I would agree that this book was enjoyable largely because I'm already a Charles de Lint fan, and I'm familiar with most of the characters. While not my absolute favorite of his, I really enjoyed it. I love the idea of a website becoming something more than its creaters had envisioned. I love the idea of cyberspace being more than just a compilation of information. I also found myself contemplating just what makes a being \\"real\\" or valuable, as Saskia and Christiana struggled with that question themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Spirits in the Wires held a lot of promise for me, but it just didn't deliver. De Lint's regular stable of Newford characters is here, and I found that distracting rather than pleasant, since I felt he was a little too self-referential. Even the presence of Christy and Geordie Riddell, among my favorite de Lint characters ever, couldn't quite save this one. The writing plodded along in places, and the magic in the books didn't take place in Newford, but rather on the Internet. Since De Lint is a master of urban fantasy, that disappointed me. I also didn't feel it would have made a good introduction to Newford, since a lot of the time I found myself reading passages and going, \\"Huh? Who are they and why do they matter?\\" For a better introduction to Newford and its denizens, try one of de Lint's short story collections, or maybe Someplace to be Flying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book.","review":"I found this book very helpful.

Set in small town in coastal California, the author mixes episodes in remote ages past, reincarnation, and modern high school politics in the striving for the Tellurian Crown. (Tellus, you may remember, is the proper name of planet Earth.) An island barely off the coast is progressively being destroyed by the earth forces of wind and waves, at the same time uncovering an ancient temple which may, - or may not, - hide secrets of the remote past including the Crown, if that really exists, or existed.The author weaves the events in present reality together with the world of fantasy into a seamless web. At times we question if the happenings in the novel are part of the present high school events, or being staged by the sinister forces from the past. I found it a very absorbing book. I recommend it to anyone who likes fantasy fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goddess Worship","review":"If this works for 10-15% of people I would be surprised.

Its very cheaply made, and you can't understand what the wrestlers are saying and talking about because of the bad audio. They make the DVD extras sound great but don't be fooled. All they are is a one-on-one conversation with the wrestlers and its info the wrestling fan already knows. On the Hardcore Holly interview you can hear a train in the background and once again the audio is horrible on these interviews. The only good thing on this DVD is the \\"Road Dogg\\" interview, the rest is junk. The star wrestlers they use on the writing and back of the cover aren't even in the documentary.

The action is sharp and fluid and makes you feel as if you are one of the spectators watching the angels fight!The artwork is rather simplistic but in a nice refreshing original way. I like this art style alot.Overall any CLAMP fan or anyone who loves comedies should try this out.

Well, we had to take the vehicle to the dealer for a fix and they put the vehicle on their computer analyzer and guess what? The Actron had diagnosed it correctly. It is really handy and does what it says it does. I would recommend this to anyone. A good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Already paid for itself.","review":"I got this reader because I don't always want to drag out my Autotap scanner and computer.

The directions are a little short on details about what you are looking at, but that does not detract from the usefulness of the tool. My only problems with that unit are: (1) it will not reset the \\"service\\" light on my 1998 Volvo V70--I still have to take it to Volvo to have the light reset, and (2) the CD that came with it made me think that it might give advice about how to fix the problem. At Autozone, where I used go to have the codes read (using an actron product higher up the chain), they would enter the code into their computer and out came a set of diagnostic procedures and things to try.

The brain is NOT, repeat NOT a negative hostile entity, as he posits. Having integrated body wisdom is important. People cannot function adequately and positively -- they cannot think, act or anything else -- unless they utilize both brain and heart. I am sorry that Paul Pearsall's docs missed the clues of his lymphoma for so long -- but that does not make their brains -- nor his -- nor the brains of others - hostile and negative entities.

However, for any Christian who is truly seeking to know the Lord better, this book is a good read, for it provides insight into what kind of philosophies are being conjured up outside of orthodox theological circles.

This seamless blend of scientific knowledge, state-of-the-art medical practice, complementary approaches, and personal experience is written in a clear, easy to understand style. (And it also has excellent illustrations of current surgical options and post-surgery exercizes.) The material is well organized in a format which makes it a valuable reference tool for patients and medical professionals alike. It is a must-read for everyone with an interest in breast cancer treatment and recovery. It's the latest of over 25 books I have read since my breast cancer diagnosis, and it's the best by far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Up to date, informed, and incredibly compassionate!","review":"If you just want the latest research, go read the New England Journal of Medicine. If you want the latest research PLUS experience, understanding, compassion, and answers to your most embarrassing questions, get this book!I heard the co-author, Francesca Coltrera, speak a few weeks ago. I was absolutely blown away by how lucid, informed, and compassionate this woman was. She didn't just present the book as a bible for people undergoing breast cancer treatment (though it is that). She talked about it as a a kind of lifeline--a source to go to for questions the doctors and nurses don't have the patience (or experience) to answer.I hope you don't need a book like this.

Two thumbs up Dr. Kaelin! T.G.

I found the book to be thorough, compassionate and very clearly written. It's an unusual book. As other reviewers have commented, breast cancer guides are either from MD breast cancer \\"experts\\" OR from patients. This is the only book I am aware of written by someone who has lived both sides of this disease. I will recommend this book strongly to my patients with breast cancer, and also to their family members and friends. Thanks to Dr. Kaelin and Ms. Coltrera for providing us with such a terrific resource."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lone voice of dissent","review":"I must be the only woman in America who didn't like this book -- I found it superficial and was disappointed that it didn't focus much on her own experiences.

They're just the right combination of teenage life and funny moments, which means that they're not going to bore you like most teen books that have entire chapters of the character wallowing around, feeling sorry for themselves. Sure, Georgia does that, but it never stops being funny!Then He Ate My Boy Entrancers is one of the best, including Georgia's thoughts on the Hamburger-a-gogo types (Americans), and her new love interest, The Italian Stallion Masimo. The plot moves along quickly, and you can't help but laugh with Georgia and her embarrasing parents, little sister, and supportive (sometimes) friends.The Georgia Nicolson series is mostly for fun, but it has the truth of the struggles of teenage life in it too, between Georgia's trouble with 'the Horn' and the average worries of us teens.

They frequently contradict each other, even on definitions of terms, and the material overlaps so much it's like deja vu.The other major problem is that the explanations in the book are horrible and disjointed. Concepts and terms are referenced as if the reader already knows them--even though they aren't explained until later on.And let's not forget the typos and poor English that dot this book.

It's great for conditioning one's body to the rigors of MMA or for cross training purposes.

The Pit workout does it and is more fun for me because I am interested in MMA. I am noticing a higher level of strength and fitness, and getting a little more cut. P90X feels like aerobics compared to this! I still mix in the weights DVDs from P90X, but the PIT pushes you harder. And you are still using just your body and don't really need equipment. John Hackleman is a cool dude and is helpful and instructive with no BS.My only criticism is that you should do some jump rope or jacks while John talks before each set cause he stretches the water break about a minute too long sometimes.If you get the boxset, you will have a more complete picture of what John teaches in regards to fitness."},{"rating":"1","title":"What workout?","review":"This is the worst workout video I have ever seen.

Plus, the three workouts follow a goofy upper body, lower body, whole body split, which is presumably borrowed from body building, but makes no sense in martial arts training where movements are not designed to isolate muscle groups.Hackleman's second home work out DVD \\"Crosspit\\" fixes many of these shortcomings and is a much better product."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's ok","review":"I like it somewhat.

But if you are doing fine woodwork and need pretty countersinks, then this tool is not the one to use.I used this with a handheld drill for holes I made in a piece of steel sheet metal. This bit chattered like crazy and made terrible countersinks. It was so bad that I had to file the holes smooth again.

And it takes some effort to struggle through this book. Little insight is provided into the enigmatic Jefferson. The character is not well developed and the book lacks pace, being mired in insipid detail. The members of the supporting cast are presented as effete sycophants or sybarites. Even the illicit relationships lack spice. In all fairness, the book may have spark interest in some as a period piece, but it didn't do much for me. I loved \\"Jackson\\", was not impressed with \\"Jefferson\\", but I look forward to \\"Grant\\" with much anticipation."},{"rating":"1","title":"brooding and smutty","review":"Byrd has done an excellent job of putting the French Revolution into the context of the American Revolution. I enjoyed the perspectives of the impressionable young Short and his master Jefferson on the situation in Paris leading up to the Revolution. However, this book never quite takes flight, and Byrd devolves into sordid descriptions of Jefferson's and Short's daliances with married women. The reader is shortchanged by the suggestion that the complexities of these men is driven by their lewd behavior. The smuttiness does not end here. Byrd chronicles the seedy side of Paris through the exploits of Jefferson's slave James. James's ineveitable request of emancipation is driven by his desire to participate in the circus-like excess of Paris, much to my disappointment. Although I learned much about the hypocrisy of Jefferson, the burden of reading this book far outweighed the lessons of this great man. The plot never quite develops and the dialogue is very inconsistent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grounding-Thought Provoking","review":"While walking the reader through the daily life of a monk's spiritual journey, this author also inspires the lay person to listen to the \\"Music of Silence\\".Every chapter deserves contemplation.

I've used Irwin bits in the past with good results, and these seemed like a good deal. My old brand M bit lasted about half-way into the project (about 250 holes through studs/joists), when it started getting dull, so I switched over to one of the new Irwin bits. It was so dull out of the package that it would barely drill a hole, with considerably more effort than my old, worn bit. I then tried the other new Irwin bit, and it started ok, but after 5 holes it wouldn't drill, either. It's almost like Irwin missed heat treating the bits. At that point, I went to my local Home center and purchased a new brand M bit which I used for wiring the remainder of my house without any issues.Unfortunately, enough time had lapsed between when I bought these bits and when I tried using them, that I was outside the Amazon return period, so I'm stuck eating the cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was purchased by my child.","review":"This book was purchased by my child.

For Example, the whole thing about cloning is difficult to comprehend. Aside from that it is fine.

Also, I find the Bose has more ability to fill a room.That being said, the Athena has good quality sound for under $100. Add in that it has a USB connection and it's a no-brainer. I'll give up a little sound quality to save over $200 and have more flexibility to play other devices.Good quality and great price. Excellent value for your money. Just wish it came in white to match my iPod."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent, but that's about all","review":"The remote does not work unless you point it exactly where it wants. And the sound quality is just decent. Not a huge fan of it. Good thing it's outside on the porch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sound But Cheaply Made","review":"The sound of this unit is first rate and a great value if you compare it to its competitors that cost considerably more. However,after using it only two weeks the volume up button ceased to work. The saving grace was the remote that provides an alternate way to control volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound. Better than expected.","review":"After reading several favorable reviews, I purchased this to provide music for a small dance class via my ipod touch. Super portable (although you need AC outlet) and much better sound quality and volume than I expected from such a small unit. Extremely quick delivery from Vanns (as always) and terrific bang for buck. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent speakers","review":"I bought this product because of the reviews, styling and the price (around fifty dollars). It has excellent reviews, including an A- rating from iLounge. The speakers do not distort the sound, have good volume and more than enough bass for my tastes, and are really compact and good looking.One thing that you should be aware of is that when you connect an iPhone 2G, it shows the message \\"This accessory is not made to work with iPhone\\". Everything works, though, and it even charges the iPhone, but the message is a bit annoying.Overall, I am extremely happy with this purchase. They are perfect for my apartment's living room (~220 sq feet)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big sound for little dough","review":"Im please with my purchase of the Athena iVoice. I agree with most of the other reviewers that the sound is very good for the price ($79. Vanns). I would recommend it to a friend. The only thing that prevents me giving it five stars is the remote. It has a very short <8ft range, but given the price, Im not dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing clarity ... A super bargain !!!","review":"I bought this unit through Amazon / Vanns - a very reliable online seller that I have tried in the past. I am using this speaker with my 80GB iPod 5.5 Video. The sound quality of this speaker is simply amazing! I had an opportunity to do a side by side comparison with a $299 Bose Sound Dock and the Athena is easily 85-90% of the sound quality of the Bose.I also like the fact that the power supply is built-in so there are no adaptors or ugly wall-warts to carry around AND the power supply is 100-240 volts so it can work anywhere in the world without any voltage conversion!The only weak point is the remote - well, it does it's job but very basic ... one really cannot complain at this price point though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I needed","review":"The small space and the sound quality is just perfect for the office. It doen't take up a huge chunk of my desk and the sound for the office is great. I don't know how it would work if you had a big space and you wanted the sound to be perfect quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I'm a tough, bargain-concious consumer so buying this device involved a lot of research. Great quality sound for awesome price. The sound is so crisp I can \\"blow away\\" my daughter when she cranks her stereo. Now she borrows my player when using her mp3 player. Only wish the remote was more functional and it came with a standard USB port. I highly recommend this product. Hmmm...could probably be a great Christmas gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"I've had the unit for about a year now, but only paid about $50 for it. About six months ago it developed a volume problem. When the unit is first turned it goes to full volume. It will also sometimes turn on all by itself, at full volume, durring a thunderstorm. The sound quality is pretty good though, especially for the price. I like bass, but find the iVoice a little too bass heavy. I usually wind up using the bass reducer function on my iPod. I would have given it 4.5 stars if not for the volume issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"trouble with volume control","review":"Sound is great - however, right when my one-year warrantee was up the volume control went out making it nearly useless."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit of a challenge","review":"It took 3 times to get it right but they did stand by their product and corrected the error. It came with a European outlet plug. Sent it back once, and received an identical set-up. The next time they just sent the correct plug without having to make the return. The speaker itself has a great sounds with a nice deep tone bass and adequate volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound, great price","review":"I read all of the reviews on this before I made my purchase. I was leery of the quality, based on the low price I paid ($48). I was WRONG. The Athena iVoice has great sound. I couldn't be more pleased. Yeah I am sure there are docking stations on the market that are superior in audio quality, but not for this price. For excellent sound quality on a budget, I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"I've had this for almost a year now and I'm very happy with it. The remote needs to be lined up with it pretty straight to work, the volume starts out at max after it's been unplugged... but this system can really hold its own with music quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware price jump","review":"A public service announcement for all those looking at the Athena iVoice Dock & Sound System: this unit is priced five times higher than it was when I bought it back in August, from this same site.I purchased this unit for $49.88 through Amazon on August 11, and I wholeheartedly agree with all of the positive reviews found here. The iVoice is a beautiful-sounding speaker system which has served me well. Many of the reviews found here, however, reflect a much lower price point than the current $250+ price (as of 12/29/08). Now that the price has moved into the same bracket as competitors like the Bose Sounddock, I would advise anyone looking into such a purchase to do some further research. I know that I would never have bought this unit for $250, and I would venture that many of the other reviewers below might concur."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work with 3G iPods","review":"This product simply does not work with 3G iPods. Once docked the iPod does not respond to any controls and freezes up. This should be stated in the product description and on the manufacturers web site. There are plenty of other buyers who have seen the same results - search Google."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very happy with this stereo!!","review":"I love it! Good sound for a decent price, very convenient to use and a nice look. I'm glad I got this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Product was defective","review":"I received my speakers and really enjoyed them until the unit started turning the volume up to MAXIMUM every time I turned it on. Quite embarassing considering I had it in my office! It was so loud it hurt my ears to get near it to turn it off. I called the manufacturer and they admitted some of these are defective and they've been having complaints. So if you get a decent unit, great - but there's a chance it will be a hassle as mine was. I didn't get a replacement based on the reviews I read online of several people having my same experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound, BUT starts at max volume when you turn it on","review":"It has good sound (which is why I didn't give it one star) but it starts at max volume every time you turn it on. This is very annoying, but I've figure out how to deal with it. I just start it on a quite song, hold it facing the floor and begin lowering the volume immediately. Not worth the money for that inconvenience and I will never buy from them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good product","review":"i compare the bose product from my brother and the ivoice, the sound is similar the only diference is the bose have more volume but the fidelity is same"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works for us!","review":"Excellent Sound, nice construction, fits the Nano perfectly (and other sizes too). Excellent purchase for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice sound and quality for what you pay.","review":"This product has great sound quality and decently loud volume. It isn't the loudest thing out there, but you get good, accurate sound along all volume levels. Haven't had a chance to use the video out feature, but that seems it would be handy when we go out of town and want music or to watch videos on the TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best bang for your buck!","review":"I got aLogic3 iStationfor Christmas, and the sound quality was horrible. I returned it and ordered the iVoice based on the reviews I read here, and I am so pleased with it! You can crank it really loud and the sound quality is still excellent, and it's got great bass too."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Complete Dud!","review":"WAY too short (practically capri length), WAY too baggy in the legs, WAY WAY too tight around the waist . . hey, they're a 2X for cryin' out loud!

If you want to Tec dive or just want to know about it ,this book is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exteremely informative!","review":"I found this book to be very informative. The author discusses the various features of dive gear, but remains brand neutral, in fact, not a single preferred brand was mentioned in the book. Techniques for expedition diving and a thorough explaination of the different types of rebreathers were also covered.

I read only the English translation, so what was lost, I cannot say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obvious scholarship, but not for the non-theologian","review":"I'll open with the caveat that it is clear that this book is prime intellectual material; however, if you don't know the whos, wheres, and why nots of Christianity and Judaism, including the complete biblical vocabulary, then this might not be the book for you. I purchased The Jesus Legend hoping to learn an objective lesson about the life and times of Jesus and the creation of the church. Unfortunately for me, and I would assume anyone without a substantial grounding in theology and the history of Christianity, it quickly becomes obscure. Don't try to read it on an airplane without a dictionary, for example. Furthermore, the author spends a great deal of time defending his earlier works and counter attacking his critics, so it isn't a good first entry into an understanding of the historical Jesus. I would appreciate any emailed suggestions from other interested secular surfers on what that book might be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for 5 minutes then died","review":"Sadly because I was only able to use this product 3 months after I bought it I wasno longer able to give it back.

I hand wash this in the sink but I suppose if I threw it in my dishwasher it would be okay too.I was never able to make an omlete on a grill or in a pan that came out like I thought they should until I bought this pan. They come out so beautiful you hate to eat them. The heat transfer is perfect, don't crank the heat up too much on this or any other of the stainless steel Chef's ware. You cook at way lower heat than say cast iron. Most people that are disappointed in these style pans are using too much heat.Probably the only draw back is no lid but I have a 12 in' glass lid from my other pans so that's not a problem for me and the cost to value on this is so low you can afford a lid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective and possibly dangerous","review":"I bought this pan based on the great reviews it received from America's Test Kitchen.

So, I promptly returned it and asked for a replacement. The replacement was equally bad!I'm an experienced cook, and have NEVER owned a nonstick pan that does this.

I do not know where this pan was manufactured;(the predecessor was stamped \\"made in China\\"), but this pan had no identification of its source of manufacture. I noted it felt lighter when picked up. I have also discovered the quality of its non-stick surface is not as good as the former pan. I frequently use it to cook omelets, and have found they often partially adhere to the surface when attempting to slide the omelet from the pan onto a plate to fold over, requiring an assist from a spatula. I am sure there are better alternatives available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless pan and warranty","review":"We have one of these pans that is about two years old. The non-stick coating is coming off when you try to clean the burned-on food that sticks to the \\"non-stick\\" coating with normal use. The pan is now worthless and when I called Cuisinart regarding the warranty I was told that I would have to pay to ship the pan to them to \\"be evaluated\\" before they would honor the warranty. Even if they did honor the warranty I would have to pay $7 service charge in addition to the shipping cost to receive a replacement.This \\"Lifetime Warranty\\" is a joke and the pan is now not even safe to use.I will never purchase another Cuisinart product based on my experience with this pan and the customer service of the company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nonstick finish not in it for the long haul","review":"Have owned this pan for about five years, and really liked it at first. I'd hoped it would last a very long time, given the new-formula, supposedly sturdy, nonstick finish, as well as its strong stainless steel clad construction. But the nonstick surface has been progressively peeling off around the rivets for the past couple of years, not anywhere we use utensils. It's just plain surface failure, and we don't want it in our food. The degradation of the nonstick surface is all the more disappointing because this pan seems otherwise to have everything else going for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly balanced and not flat","review":"I was very excited to get this... so maybe I'm more disappointed than I should be for the price. This is a heavy pan with a nice thick non stick coating... but I don't actually use the pan because the balance is off. It tips far more than my super cheap lighter weight pan.

What do i do when my child runs away from me toward the street and then hits and bites me when I pick him up? I don't want to spank, but a 24-month old just doesn't take to \\"a talk\\" or timeout like Dr. Sears says he should.

Unfortunately, those times of genuine connection were rare. I have worked very hard to heal those old wounds and to move forward in my relationships. On the other hand, as a new parent, I felt that it was in my son's best interest if I dug deeper into my self and experiences in order to provide for him the \\"best that I can be\\".This book has been fundamental in this endeavor and I encourage any parent to do the same."},{"rating":"1","title":"I WANTED to like this book","review":"but it offered no real practical advice beyond common sense approaches.

I recommend it, highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author appears to be extremely sexist and classist.","review":"While much of the advice in this book is quite useful, it is difficult to get beyond the author's outdated views of gender roles within the parenting relationship. The author bases theories and notions on the assumption that mothers stay at home and take primary responsibility for care of the child. This book completely ignores the economic realities of most american families, as well as the desire or more and more fathers to take an active role in their child's life. The author writes to an all white, all middle class, all traditional gender roles audience, which is not the reality for most of us."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you aren't AP, don't get this book!","review":"If you didn't breastfeed or carry your child around almost 24/7 in infancy don't get this book.

I'm keeping the book (I got it as a gift), but only because when I skipped around, it seemed to have some advice we might find useful when our child's older.

True story, it's in the book.If you are looking for a practical book on parenting and child discipline, tryTo Train Up A Childby Michael and Debi Pearl. It is short and to the point so even very busy parents have time to read it and put it into practice. I have 3 boys 5,3 and 2 and I started seeing wonderful results in just a few days!!

I was very disappointed in this book. Most of the book seems like a glorified autobiography on how wonderful Dr. Sears and Martha are at raising their kids. And the book lacks any real advice. Most of the advice is \\"start out connected to your child and then you will know how to handle trantrums/hitting/biting/screaming.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be helpful in certain situations.","review":"We bought this book because the reviews called it \\"essential\\" but we found it to be useless when we tried to put its ideas into practice. The authors do detail problems and offer solutions but their advice is actually quite vague. We bought the book to try to get some help but following the advice in the book just made us frustrated. They don't have suggestions for people like us, whose discipline issues aren't as pat as those in the book. For parents who are starting out, this might be a helpful book to read but for us, whose problems are more established, the book really wasn't any help at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"I agree with about 95% of Dr Sears advice.

My 14 month old & I are always getting compliments on her wonderful behavior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the Read","review":"This book was a disappointment. There are no practical tips for disciplining your child -- it is more about why you should be using the Attachment Parenting method of child rearing and if you aren't, why you should be. The author does discuss several of the different styles of discipline, but he lacks any sort of objectivity. Not to mention there is not a single fact or statistic to support his arguments. I do not recommend this book if you are looking for a good, practical guide on disciplining your child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Help Me","review":"I bought this hoping to find out how to better discipline my children. It was a big disappointment. I believe that children (even young toddlers) need to be told \\"No\\" and have set limits. Redirecting does not work for all children and certainly didn't with mine. They are too strong-willed and wouldn't forget what I was trying to direct their attention away from. We need to teach our children that we, as their parents, are in charge, and I don't think that this book advocates that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Help for working moms?","review":"Does anyone write a good discipline book for working mothers? I enjoyed Dr. Sears' Pregnancy Book and bought this looking for advice as my 21-month old son gets older. However, in addition to many of the criticisms already expressed (little practical advice, holier-than-thou, etc.) this book is based on the premise that the mother stays at home with the child. While I believe in SOME of the tenets of attachment parenting, I went back to work when my son was 12 weeks old. I refuse to believe that my (and my husband, since he is an integral part of raising our child - unlike the assumption of this book) discipline efforts are doomed just because I \\"weaned\\" my child from attachment too early. I will keep looking for a more applicable book."},{"rating":"2","title":"very helpful book","review":"this book was recommended by my son's preschool teachers.it is extremely helpful and easy to follow - as with all parenting books you take what works for you and your family. chapters ar broken down easily (as much a tired parent may actually read at night!)helped us with our 3 year old AND gave us great suggetions for our baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Dr. Sears Book by FAR!","review":"This book is a must have for any new parents. Who wouldn't like a method of parenting that can actually help PREVENT some of the headaches and misbehaviors? Rather than putting all the focus on the PUNISHMENT angle of discipline, Dr. Sears has given an approach that looks as discipline as the whole package of raising healthy happy children. I recommend you purchase and read this book while pregnant, as raising successful healthy children begins from day one, not just when they are old enough for punishing. Discipline, as clearly demonstrated in this book, has nothing to do with PUNISHMENT, but with child rearing as a whole."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good AP book","review":"This book was just a little disappointing in that it didn't have alot of concrete advice, just kind of general ideas that I already had in mind for parenting. I still would recommend it though because I really like Dr. Sears and think that what is in the book is pretty good, it just wasn't exactly what I was looking for. If you are new to the idea of AP parenting then this is a good one for you, or just struggling with what to do, it might be a good reminder."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Those Who Want Alternatives","review":"This book is an excellent resource for those who want to discipline their children but don't want spanking to be their sole resort. As someone who loves her parents but doesn't like the way they disciplined her, I found the information given to be very helpful. In the introduction, the authors say that the expert on your child is you, and if any of their ideas seem too permissive or too harsh, to go with your instincts. This reflects the \\"reader-as-capable\\" tone that prevails throughout the entire book and which makes it a must-read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!

It's like it's written for people who can't think for themselves. The advice and explanations given in this book were things I take for granted that all parents understand. Either that or I'm a perfect mother- (and I know I'm not.)

Being preservative free with very little sodium (less than 100 mg per can), the flavor of the beans comes through and is excellent.The one complaint I have about Eden pinto beans is that they tend to chelate (leech their protein). This causes them to stick in the can, and removing them requires one to force them out of the can with a spoon, knife, or fork. The end result is that many of the beans get smashed, which doesn't work well if you want to boil or cook them, although it would save some time in making a vegan version of re-fried beans.Note that you'll find brown specks in some varieties of Eden beans. Do not be alarmed: the specks are kombu (kelp), an organic sea plant that's used as a natural preservative. The kombu can be consumed with the beans, or you can rinse it away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Replaces \\"Meat\\"","review":"A wonderfully, smooth and creamy bean. The best I have ever tasted. Filling and satisfying. My \\"go-to\\" bean I can always rely on for a variety of meal ideas. The Bispheanol-A free cans give me peace of mind. Although the beans stick a little at the bottom of the can, it's no big deal for such a good product. I just gently pry them loose with a spatula. Only two cans arrived dented, but were not bulging. No worries. I will be ordering these again and again as soon as I run out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Quality. Lots of dented cans though.","review":"If it wasn't for the dented case, I would give this product full marks.

Amazon is great about issuing a refund, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"Let me start off by saying this is now my reference blu-ray. Every \\"bit\\" generated aurally and visually from this disc is stunning. The performances are without an audience. It feels as if the concert is personally performed for you, the viewer. The \\"rough\\" hall space, casual dress of the orchestra, and importantly, the consistent and focussed camera work (many of today's music discs are filmed in an \\"ADD\\" manner) give the film a relaxed feel.Archucarro's playing? Well, Magnificent!Included on the disc are a whole host of extras, including additional solo performances in the Prado Museum (Madrid)and a 40min film about Achucarro and his career.This disc is what all live music performances should strive for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stands above the rest","review":"This really is a complete book about the Titanic. It includes chapters such as: 'A complete chronicle of the Titanic disaster' that lists what happened nearly every minute of the fateful night; 'mysteries of the Titanic - a century of secrets'; 'Titanic 1997' which tells about James Cameron's movie; and 'The quest of the century' which details Dr. Robert Ballards' discovery of the wreck of the Titanic. Also the book includes a complete reprinting of the 1898 novella that seems to have predicted the Titanic disaster.This book is really great for anyone interested in the Titanic. It is fascinating, well written and detailed.

The sound is pretty clear, and I'm pretty happy with them.One negative note: If the transmitter is connected to a power source while you're using the headphones, you'll hear an electronic buzz in the headphones. The buzz isn't unbearable, but it is definitely audible. Turning down the volume on the headphones diminishes the buzz, so you can minimize the buzz by turning up the volume on your sound source and turning down the headphone volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good sound quality, Reasonable battery life.","review":"I use this headset primarily at work so I can play music without being tethered to the mp3 player. Overall, I've been happy with the headset. The sound quality has been very good. The only problem I've had is that periodically some sound will drop out, especially if I'm more than 5-10 feet from the player in another room."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely a good value","review":"Ok, here is my review: For the money I paid for it this is an excellent product.Good: I use this at my desk at work (can't program with wires in the way). The range is good. What you have to do for the sound quality to be good is _turn the volume on the headphones down all the way_. This cuts out the static that you hear when you first plug them in. Good battery life, four hours for sure (charge them during lunch).Bad: One drawback is that the headphones are a little flimsy. I would think twice before using these for exercise. But unless I try to program and do jumping jacks at the same time, these will work great for me. Also, the transmitter is huge, that prevents you from being able to work out with it as well. Again, not a problem at work though.Hope this helpsAP"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy solely for cell phones","review":"These paired right away with my VX9800, I could hear the beeping and such, but when the time came to listen to music, the music played out of phone's speakers, not the headphones. Thus far, I've read nothing good about these headphones and cell phones, so, if it's cell phone head phones you seek, look elsewhere. As for their worth otherwise, they work quite well when using just on my computer, very fun. The range is decent, not as far as I'd hoped, but decent. After wearing for about an hour, they start to hurt. They fit very snugly and comfortably otherwise.

The back of your hands and your fingers are where the most blood vessels are, and these gloves have no circuits in these areas. I wore them for about 10 minutes on a 10-degree day, and my fingers were nearly frozen stiff. Who cares if your palms are warm when your fingers aren't. The batteries are sort of a pain to deal with - \\"D\\" size are way too big to fit into anything, so your coat sleeves can't fit tightly around the gloves.

They are fairly well insulated and provide a moderate degree of dexterity.However, the heating element is ineffective. Inserting batteries into the gloves provided little (if any) increase in warmth. My fingers remained cold.In addition, I have recently discovered that the thin wire connecting the heating element to the battery in one of the gloves has become disconnected. These gloves have not been subjected to any harsh abuse, so it is disappointing to find that the wire had been disconnected so easily.If you are looking for a pair of heated gloves that will actually make a difference and keep your hands (including your fingers)warm, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very little heat","review":"I bought both the Nordic Gear batter-heated gloves and battery-heated mittens.

It did suffer from the fact that all the characters tend to sound the same in the dialogue. The plot is basic witch meets vampire and they are chased by baddies thinking they are good.Basically, this book was safe for the author to write. Upon learning that this was Hallaway's first book, I do hold some hope that her later works will change in a way to push them beyond middle of the road.

Shame on you Rising Sun, as the picture quality was excellent. I can only assume that they never monitored the sound during the shoot. If they did, the sound director needs firing.

Not once does it rip into an extended trance jam where you want to lose yourself in space & time. The tracks are too short to keep the mojo flowing. The tracks lack passion and emotion. And the total flow of the CD is off... would have been better mixed. And it has too many crappy vocal samples.My suggestion, pick up ANY of the Global Underground CDs.

There was very little footage about Monster Trucks. Most of the tape was made up of clips of other types of Motor Sports. I thought the idea of \\"no talking\\" would be a good thing. The tape REALLY lacked appeal because you could not hear the sound of the truck engines. It was like watching a movie on \\"mute\\". You could not hear the crowd cheering either. It just took away from the enjoyment. Also, my husband thought that the tape looked like a home video.

Bratz collection. The small details on the clothing and the streeks in the hair make the dolls look much more realistic than any \\"Barbie\\" doll. I think the Bratz dolls are great dolls for kids, because unlike Barbie, they are based on real life fashion. The only two reasons i could not give this beautiful Funk Out! doll five stars is because of durability.(ex. The dolls shirt ripped) And the hair! It is not that i don't like the hair, it is beautiful, but it gets tangled very easily and is hard to brush after a while. Overall, this is a great toy for kids.

The characters are wholly unrealistic, the writing style is juvenile, strained, and uninspired, and the plot drags on repetitively. If you want to read a book where the protaganists are all goody-goody gumdrops and the antagonists are pure evil without any reasonable explanation, where the writing sounds like it was written by an seventh grader with a deadline, and where each segment of the story is retold five times (one for each character), then perhaps you will find this book enjoyable.

This is even after using a heat gun at low temp, to get them to cover on my ears.These would be OK for big kids, but to me an ADULT, needs something more robust, yes the fold up mech is nice - but in the end if the audio is not up to snuff, it just won't matter.As a point of reference, the older SONY ear clipz sound is better, better still are SENNHEISER PX 100, that also fold - they have FAR SUPERIOR audio/bass/volume quality.I will be giving these away soon.NOTE: Philips can produce some nice headsets, to me this just is'nt one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I was looking for","review":"I needed a pair of headphones that were behind the head but also folded up for travel.

Nevertheless, as long as they stay on, they are excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible fit and very uncomfortable","review":"I just received these headphones with high hopes and I must say that I've seldom been so dissapointed. The fit of the headphones over your ears forces the tops of your ears to bend through the plastic headphone loop so that it feels like your ears are flapping in the breeze. Extremely unnatural and darned uncomfortable. The plastic band that goes behind your neck has no adjustment and on my neck its already rubbing - how can Philips expect me to use these in an active life style? Of course I'm already bummed that I can't return them because I actually had to take them out of the plastic / cardboard packaging to try them on. Now that the package is opened its against Amazon's policy to accept them as a return so I guess I'll have to sell them off on ebay or just toss the darn things in the trash.

Peter Watts is a splendid, hard science fiction writer whose technological descriptions rival many I've seen from the likes of Gregory Benford and Greg Bear, among others. Unfortunately, his characters are not nearly as well fleshed out as theirs, often resembling one dimensional figures whose existence merely serves to advance the plot. Nor is his writing as lyrical as theirs, which I found rather surprising since one of his acquaintances is Canada's best young writer of science fiction, Nalo Hopkinson. Yet fans of technological science fiction will undoubtedly find \\"Maelstrom\\" quite intriguing, even if it only resembles in tone and substance, genuine cyberpunk fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Sequel","review":"I bought this sequel to Starfish, and to be frank, was disap-pointed.

I don't think I'll keep it, either, that's howdisappointing it was to me. Too many disaparate strings of thestory just did not seem to be resolved in a satisfying way.

These other people must be crazy. The Samples have always run a thin line between awsome and downright cheesy. The lyrics on here are so week vh1 wouldn't play them. I really feel like the band has lost their edge. I can tolerate a mellow turn. All the slow transmissions songs are nice but then most of them were great to begin with. Thier brother songs are on this album and they don't cut it. I would sight some of the lyrics if I could remember but I hardly litsened to it. If you can't go back to the modified police songs that gave you a unique sound please don't be an opening band for hootie and the blowfish.

One or more of them are always on my CD changer in my home, car or office. This album, however, has been disappointing- while some reviewers say the band has \\"matured,\\" I think they've grown tired. In fact, their lack of energy corresponds with their signing with a major label. None of the songs offers the kind of boost I have been accustomed to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their most mature album to date","review":"A lot of new instruments on this one, adding yet another dimension to a great band.

The reader was only left to guess at what she could have POSSIBLY written to these inmates.Aside from that, something very vital was missing from the book. Perhaps it could have been the \\"lack\\" of letters from the MOST notorious inmates that would have been sure to interest the reader. I don't know what it was but I was not that impressed with the book. I would have been most joyous having brought it used for a cheaper price than brand new out of the bookstore.With my being an avid true crime reader, I guess I was expecting a little something more \\"raw\\" with less whining.

It is not easy reading however. Even though there is some of the most incredible descriptions of deviant behavior I have EVER EVER read, there is also a lot of boring material mixed in. But I guess that's what letters often are. These guys didn't know there letters were going to be published in a book. One thing that was bothersome to me is that the author didn't include her letters to the killers and i really wonder why. I would have liked to know what she said to them and the fact that she left them out only makes me believe that maybe she didn't want readers to know what kind of tactics she used. In all, I loved seeing how these guys wrote and the things they said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately, she paid the killers to write her letters!!!","review":"Unfortunately, Jennifer was so bored and lonely that she thought it would be cool to go out and actually pay, YES, PAY convicted serial killers to write her things to put inside this \\"penetrating\\" book of hers. Killers profit off of their crimes because of people like her. Not only did she pay these killers for their boring letters, she gave them a forum to complain to the world how unfair ALL of the trials were and how innocent they are all as well.

Douglas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money","review":"I don't mean to sound harsh, however, I wish that I had read the reviews before I purchased this book. The title and story line sounded beyond intriguing, however, the book was far from that. I am not quite sure how a person is supposed to learn about the psychology of serial killers in this book when the majority of the book is a compilation of convicted murderers claiming their innocence. Out of the 306 pages and 14 serial killers I found only one to be somewhat informational. Although the testimony of David Gore was at times hard to read I felt that his confessions were the only ones that allowed a person to get another glance into the mind of a serial killer. My suggestion would be to go to the bookstore, find this book, spend a few minutes to read the David Gore letters and then put it back on the shelf before you waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Audience guest, saw Furio on Leeza","review":"I don't know if the killer's or critics are scarier. I went to see Leeza while in LA and Furio was on the show. She brought up so many valid reasons why its important to study and know rage, up close...it seems she thinks it comes full circle, her book the end result of childhoods that sucked. It's more than that, but I ordered the book, and I think everyone should. I hope her \\"message\\" about violence, rage gets out there. These men are living examples. She wasn't trying to make movie stars out of them. It was heroic on her part - more so, to deal with her critics - back off!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better ways to waste time","review":"This book is a boring waste of time. The author doesn't include her letters, so the inmates' letters are sometimes difficult to follow. She probably chose to omit her correspondence because she hasn't always been truthful regarding her identity or her motives for writing and receiving the letters. The author could benefit from an ethics course at her local college. In the end, the reader has learned no more about these inmates than what is available about them elsewhere in much more interesting and better written books and articles. Do yourself a favor and waste your time with a less painfully boring endeavor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic!","review":"This book is not insightful in the least. It is deceptive in it's description. This is no more than lie filled meanderings from criminals who have been given too much air time already.

One gets the impresson that Ms. Furio sent the same \\"opening letter\\" to masses of multiple killers and published anyone who responded more than 3 or 4 times. The book is poorly written, horribly edited, and worse - not even entertainingly voyeuristic.Almost all of the serial killers in the book claim their innocence and want financial help in funding their appeal. The only story of any interest was from David Gore of Florida. However, his letters were so disgusting that I questioned the need to even put them into print. I wondered about the families that had to read his vivid recollections of his crimes.I would recommend this book to anyone seeking a book to lull them into sleep, to throw at howling alley cats in heat, or to smash cockroaches.

I read the book waiting for an exciting part, and it never happened. Just a bunch of convicts writing letters to the auther saying how they hate the police and how they spend their day reading, writing, or watching TV.

She merely has collected responses to her letters (which she does not print). In that Furio fails to provide any background for the reader in psychopathology (and she has none), the average person will have no idea of the veracity of any of what the killers have written. They will be used by the killers for their own purposes and think they have learned something. For profiling students, the book has someting to offer. IF the student has a good background in psychopathology, then, he/she may study the various methodologies and attitudes these criminals present and this could be useful in the identification and investigation of suspects in sexual homicide cases.

When I started reading the second part I finished it within the same day. The story takes on an amazing turn, suddenly describing the events of the first part from the other side, the view of the Zirrzh. I never enjoyed reading a SF novel that much. Timothy Zahn manages to put the reader into the place of an alien race making its first contact with the humans, without giving away too much and keeping up the tension and mystique about the 'elderdeath' weapon until very late. Brilliant and highly recommended"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad folowup to book 1","review":"After Zahn's great start to this series, the middle book suffers from the usual \\"middle book\\" syndrome of trilogies. It's not awful, but it just doesn't live up to the previous book. The aliens all talk like they just escaped from a bad melodrama compared to the sparkling dialogue of the humans in the first novel. Also Zahn makes a few goofs hither and yon, and showed that he didn't do a whole lot of research. For example, an alien drug that he made up for this book he gives the name \\"premarin\\" which had me laughing out loud. (Premarin is an estrogen replacement drug currently on the market.)

This is hardly a collection of children's summer camp projects. There are a couple of very simple designs like a daisy-chain hatband and flower bead decorations to sew on hair elastics, and I wonder if she saw these and thought it was all like that.The necklace on the cover is about midway through the book. My personal favorites are the chrysanthemum scarf design and the loomwork belt.Like most books of beadwork projects, this starts with relatively simple decorations for beginners, then takes you through increasingly complex designs. It also has a good introduction to tambour beading and to India's Ari style chain stitch. You can put beaded designs on gloves, socks, belts, bathing suits or umbrellas. Any clothing can be made more interesting and attractive with beadwork added."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Sci-Fi romance","review":"When I found out they were fans of Georgette Heyer, romance writer, I learned why their books attract me so.Nothing deep, but fairly consistent in SF framework (ie, some logic in the invented context, skills, etc) with an emphasis on characters and what they feel, not just what they do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Disappointed","review":"Mostly a rehash of Crystal Soldier.

There are five girls, all attractive (in their 20's) wearing what appears to be costumes with wierd pants split at the sides and tank tops. Four of the girls never speak. The main instructor talks while exercising and I think the voice over is better for the student, like me. This video was relatively expensive and not as complete as other videos I have in my library.

I ordered them in baby pink, and it's a lovely color. The satin finish is a nice touch as well. The cons are that the heel is very high (approx. 4.5 inches), and you will probably be in pain after a couple of hours. Or hunched over. Or doing that half-walk, half-hop you do when you blister the backs of your feet and don't have any lotion. Buyer beware! These are not for all-night dancing.

It is a welcome breath of fresh air to the stale platitudes of the religious right who view God largely as a judge, rather than as a loving father. The authors challenge us to rethink the Bible, sin, hell, salvation, the trinity, prayer, healing, and even the church itself in terms of love. There are plenty of footnotes for those who wish to read further. For those unacquainted with the recent pilgrimage of non-calvinistic thinkers like Pinnock to construct a theology known as \\"Free-Will Theism,\\" here is one of the best places to begin. Although still considered conservative in its approach, this is moderate theology at its best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This book is a mixture of \\"heretic\\" doctrines: charismatic, feminist, New Age (meditation) and other pagan ideas.

One of Hitchens' most disturbing criticisms - which has since been confirmed by former members of the Congregation - is that the millions of dollars' worth of donations sent to Mother Teresa by people like you and me were NEVER used to make these clinics more sanitary or to provide basic medical care for the indigent people who arrived at their doorstep. The reason, Hitchens says, that Mother Teresa is known for her work with the dying is that so many people died in her clinics! Listen, folks, if even *one* person died unnecessarily, that's one too many and more than enough justification for Hitchens to conduct this long-overdue investigation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A liberating book on the truth behind Teresa's methods","review":"This is perhaps one of the most important books to be written in the last ten years about the complicated relationship the rich have with the poor. Far from just an expose on the devious tactics used by Teresa to increase the material wealth and public image of herself and her order, Hitchens also exposes the spiritual fraud exacted on the bodies of the non-Catholic poor on whom the success of her mission (in terms of her spiritual agenda and her own political ambitions) so desperately depends. Keep in mind while reading this book that Hitchens, ostensibly much like Teresa, is crucially concerned with liberating humanity. Unlike Teresa, his idea of liberation is much more in concert with our collective understanding of decency and the possibility of people finding salvation in the world they create."},{"rating":"1","title":"So what?","review":"So what? Mother Teresa was a \\"traditional\\" Catholic. There are traditional Catholics and nontraditional Catholics. What is the point?It seems that Hitchins has a problem with the fact that a so called \\"traditional\\" Catholic is so revered around that world that he feels the need to debunk her image. Has it worked? I doubt so, as millions still admire her service to the weak and poor - yes even many of us who did not agree with all her conclusions, actions, and thoughts.I learned a long time ago that just because someone reaches different conclusions from me does not make that person evil, or bring into question their motivations. Maybe Hitchins too will grow up one day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Chris","review":"As soon as I see Christopher Hitchins picking maggots of a dying human being I'll give some credibility to this excessively mean spirited excuse for a book. Like all of us, except for Jesus, Mother Teresa was a flawed human being - yes a sinner. Unlike many of us, however, she worked for those most like to ignore. Hitchins may fancy himself a \\"progressive,\\" but it is interesting that he spends his time writing books like these instead of serving the \\"least among us,\\" - the very people \\"progressive\\" like Hitchins once claimed to represent."},{"rating":"1","title":"All men are bad, according to Mr. Hutchins","review":"Mr. Hutchins assumes that he is doing us a great service by pointing out the \\"hypocrisy\\" of Mother Teresa.

Instead, he merely speculates about her alleged intentions and smears her with basically no supporting evidence whatsoever. I expected more from Hitchens, who holds himself out as a provider of truth.

With a razor wit Chris Hitchens shows the dark side of the Mother Teresa phenomenon. Instead being a savior of the downtrodden and dispossesed Mother Teresa comes off as advocate for the conservative branch of the Catholic Church. It also raises a question about the amount of money her organization receives while her patients ( or victims in some cases ) live in squalid conditions. This book should be required reading for anybody taken in by the Teresa for Sainthood bandwagon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what it claims to be","review":"Mr. Hitchens is guilty of intellectual dishonesty, muddle-headedness, or some degree of both in the way he frames his attack on the figure of Mother Theresa. By and large what he says is true, but what it amounts to is not so much an indictment of Mother Theresa as an attack on the religion she represented, one that holds, for instance, that salvation is more important than health or confort, that suffering may be a way to greater holiness, and that abortion is a grievous sin. I understand how someone like Mr. Hitchens might disagree with these views (indeed, I am an atheist and disagree with them too), but the book amounts to the shocking revelation that Mother Theresa was (gasp!) a traditional Catholic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bigotry","review":"I worked in one of the MC's hospices in seminary. They took in those no one else does and do work that no one else will. I bet the author has never changed an AID's patients diaper. I also bet the other critics haven't done it either. When I see them taking over Mother Teresa's good work then they have the right to be critical. I never saw such hard working and dedicated women as those nuns. Certainly the Indian people have expressed their love for Mother Teresa during her funeral. These critics are typical liberals who hate the church for opposing their anti-child and anti-family policies. I guess my main question to them would be how many children have you saved?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-Catholic Hate","review":"This absurd attack on Mother Teresa rests on obvious McCarthyite tactics: Mother Teresa has contacts with criminals (Keating) and right-wing dictators (Marcos), so she must be a bit of a criminal and a dictator too. One could just as easily argue that Mother Teresa has contacts with pro-abortion politicians (Clinton) and Communist dictators (Castro)---all of which is true--and, so, she must be a pro-abortion Communist. Ludicrous, of course, but in the anti-Catholic atmosphere of the Left, such hate is pure gold."},{"rating":"1","title":"Getting a little desperate, isn't he?","review":"Hitchens cute carpetbagger scholarly style in this book outweighs the small impression it might otherwise have made. He reminds us once again that he is still one of the chief apologists for the political division of the school of resentment, the post-post-modernist informed, new bureaucratic academic conformist's solution to Noam Chomsky. It's funny how this book is really not about Mother Theresa's fallability, but about Hitchens' intended audience; this is merely entertainment for self-styled intellectuals who like to make space for their own mediocrity and inaction by destroying others reputations. Even if Mother Theresa were to truly be a saint, if there is such a thing, it wouldn't have changed anything Hitchens had to say."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read it and venture into the darkness.","review":"There are those, minions of darkness, for whom light of any kind, or size, or amount is deemed a dire threat. Hence they are driven to extinguish it whenever and wherever they find it lest even its merest luminescence expose and destroy them. In their witless frenzy no weapon is off limits. Thus even a diminutive nun living a Spartan life helping the poor, the sick and terminal is deluged with the sludge of spurious recrimination for being a shill and the tool of propagandists. It will ever be so with lights that shine in the darkness. Mother Theresa stands in a long line of living lights among whom are Martin Luther King, Mahatma Gandhi, and Jesus Christ. The sad truth is that their last state will be worse than their first because with each light they extinguish they bring themselves ever closer to that which they fear most. I give it no stars since light is any form is inimical to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mother Effer","review":"Incredible how dogma and ignorance can make a well meaning person into an evil person.

His objectivity is to be praised, although not so that of the institutions which push the Mother Teresa bandwagon with myopic sycophancy. The media, religious and political institutions drawn up in this analysis are powerful, and they use their power. One feels a little sorry for the central character - she certainly sold out at a number of levels, but maybe the institutions in question are just very adept at building heroes for their own purposes. Then again, the problem here is that so many people get hurt or die because of the hypocrisy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hitchens dares to stand up for what is right","review":"It is not always popular to tell the truth; but Hitchens does not shrink from it.

Any well-read individual (and I'm not referring to the \\"I've read 20 Steven King books crowd)can't help but be astonished at the popularity of this trivial book. There are no footnotes, there are no citations - nothing to indicate this text has any scholarly merit. His logic is often weak enough to be turned on itself, and his characterizations of ideas and events reek of \\"angsty-13-year-old-with-agenda\\" rather than any real objectivity. For my money, it's about as good as the pulp fiction that currently rots the brains of the masses. This, along with \\"God is not Great,\\" is \\"Twilight\\" for the casual atheist, and for anyone who REALLY wishes to question or doubt, works such as this pose problems in their simplicity and stand as a setback to legitimate secular thinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just more anti-religion loathsome propaganda","review":"There truly is no limit to the hatred of some.

It is ironic that people who have done nothing more in their lives than read a simple book and write a critique criticize and even condemn a literal saint who dedicated her entire life to helping others.

Hutchinson seems to imply that she received millions of dollars in aid and yet she didn't provide a high level of aid to the poor of Calcutta. Thi simplies that she was living the high life in luxury - nothing could be further than the truth read her journals for a clear picture of teh kind of life she leads.Go ahead and hate god, that's your choice and you'll be held to account, but on the facts admit the Mother Teresa was a saintly woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"appeals to the basest in man","review":"There is an urge in most of us to find the \\"clay feet\\" of great people. We cannot stand greatness, especially moral greatness, in others. Why? Because it is a reproach to us. It reminds us of what we are not. Let us just step back and ask ourselves: has Hitchens ever worked among the poor, let alone dedicated his whole life to them? No. He sits in comfort, aiding neither the poor, nor really anyone else. Has he invented anything? Come up with a useful theory? Brightened anyone's life in any way? Has he even uncovered truth as a journalist? No. He is just an angry opinion monger. When he has made even a single life happier, then he will have earned the moral right to judge Mother Teresa."},{"rating":"1","title":"Next one up is Jesus","review":"Hitchens is no doubt an entertaining writer.

What Christopher Hitchens reports about the hospice is completely untrue. We administered pain medication on demand. Our hospice was highly recommended by UCSF's Aids clinic and all of the AIDS organization in SF. We had a long waiting list of AIDS patients trying to get in. Public Health Nurses would work on a daily basis at the hospice and were highly supportive of its operation. In this one area, Christopher Hitchens seems to have purposefully sought out people who would support his side of the story. Such deterministic reporting makes me wonder about the accuracy of the rest of his book. The title reflects his bias.

I bought this book after seeing him on television a number of times and admiring his \\"take no prisoners\\" rhetorical style. Unfortunately, this book was a disappointment. For starters, the book is less than one hundred pages, in large print. Not the end of the world but the cover price on my paperback edition is $17.95. I paid less through Amazon, but really? Eighteen dollars for under a hundred pages? Finances aside, the book's contents are weak. Do not get me wrong: I respect Hitchens's willingness to take on the sacred, and I also agree with a number of his conclusions. But the superficial nature of his arguments is infuriating, even more so because Hitchens is obviously brilliant and the effort seems lazy. Not recommended unless you are a traditional Catholic who is patient, bored, or angry enough to take on Hitchens's diatribe in a serious manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting facts, difficult language","review":"Interesting facts indeed, though the language was quite difficult for a foreign reader (Swede).

The church wanted a hero and using myths and lies elevated a self serving woman to the level of potential saint in the eyes of millions.

I especially love the story about Charles Keating and Mother Teresa's letter of appeal on his behalf. If there is a God, Mother Teresa had some splainin to do when she met St. Peter.

This book was obviously vomited out in order to try and tarnish the reputation of the saintly Mother Teresa who spent most of her life helping others. It is pompously written in an elitist, pseudo-intellectual, double talk style. I can, certainly, understand why Hitchens, who appears not to have done much in his life except to spew hatred towards popular religious figures, would have so much antipathy for someone like that. I suggest people read Mother Teresa: A Complete Authorized Biography or Something Beautiful for God if one really wants to read about the life and works of Mother Teresa.

Not one of the morons who has dared to criticize this book has refuted any of the specific claims that Hitchens makes - because they can't!

Mind you, I am a highly spiritual person - what I object to is blind obedience to the dictates of a religion, with no consideration of its shortcomings.Far from dispelling light, as one of the reviewers claims, Hitchens is shining a beacon on the truth about Mother Teresa.

Any game that forces you play through the SAME 15 minutes of gameplay every time you die towards the end of a level is a waste of my time. No save points. No mid-mission saves. I could be out making money, or going on a date or playing something that's actually fun and rewarding. What makes me so mad about Galactica is the fact that the graphics/sounds are really well done...that and the fact that I have waited 29 years to fly a Viper in a video game and when I finally do, I want to forget the name Battlestar Galactica altogether. Strictly for the sadists out there. I just finished the game BLACK and found it to be a walk in the park compared to this game....Look for my copy used online."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget this game!","review":"I LOVE flight simulation/fighter games. With that, I hate this game because in no way do you feel like you're actually flying. It takes so long to get ANYWHERE. For example, the first level you have to protect the Galactica. The final part to it is to protect the bridge. If you are caught anywhere else BESIDES that general vicinity, you're going to fail because, like I stated earlier, it takes forever to get anywhere.

I only have about 30 seconds to save them, before they die. And then I have to start the entire first level again. This happens about a half hour into the game.

These kids have EVERYTHING.They are pretty spoiled, but most of them have managed tobe decent people, despite their lush surroundings. It is fun to see them interact, with the gorgeous backdrop of sun and surf. It's a lifestyle that most of us will never know, and maybe that is part of why it is so fascinating. They take it so for granted. A new Beamer from Daddy for graduation. A quick trip to Cabo. Blowing a couple thou in a boutique with your besties. And the pedicures!This series was made about 6 or 7 years ago, so it would beinteresting to see where these kids are now. We know where Lauren Conrad and Kristin Cavalleri are, but the restare not really in the public eye.

In fact, those people may even be disappointed as well.This book gives a very quick synopsis on the different franchises available. There is very little differentiation between the different franchising, with the exception of product type. For example, you can examine the different pizza franchises, but don't get enough information about which franchises are best.So, if you are looking for just a few thumbnail sketches at the highest level, then you will probably enjoy this book.

Steven M. Wilson's craft allows the reader to share in the emotions of the characters and the dialogue, while still making the pulse race during tautly written battle scenes. The fine treatment of the main characters, both Allies and Axis shows that just in real life, war is rarely about absolute villains and heroes. Rather, Wilson will have you deeply engaged in the exciting victories and crushing defeats of the brave men on both sides of conflict.\\"Voyage of the Gray Wolves\\" is a highly recommended read, and stands up well next to other excellent examples, such as \\"War of the Rats\\" by David L. Robbins, or \\"The Forgotten Soldier\\" by Guy Sajer.

So, unless you like to instantaneously transcribe music as you play along, or unless you just want to peck things out on a piano, this book is probably not for you. Another disappointment is that the songs don't include any of Coltrane's solos-- they merely give you the basic, introductory tune of the song, with some chord charts and repeat bars thrown in.

Unfortunately, the system did not make that possible. It does indeed catch mosquitos. I watched the DVD they provided and could see that it was working in terms of catching the bugs. However, the real test of how well it works, as the DVD points out, is whether you can enjoy the outdoors without getting attacked by mosquitos. Despite running the system 24/7 for 3-4 weeks, our backyard was as buggy as ever. I even used low-level DEET sprays (5%) to see if we could reduce the amount of DEET. They still were bitten. Our nanny, poor thing, was covered in bites on her exposed ankles.

I can't say that it never caught a mosquito and it does catch something so I'd give it two stars. Looks like the next step is propane powered mosquito catchers.

First off, i'm a Pretenders fanatic. Second, I love tribute albums, because their point is to offer covers that sound dramatically different than the originals! (see Holly Cole's all-Tom Waits cover album, \\"Temptation\\" for the best example of this--it's mind-blowing). This album, however, despite a clever title, is an atrocious flop. First off, all the arrangements are the same! Secondly, every female singer sounds like a dead-on drag queen impression of Chrissie Hynde! thirdly, I swear these aren't really \\"real\\" groups--it all sounds like the same woman. Actually it sounds like the lead singer of the Divinyls--on a muscle relaxant. And why no male singers? This album is some kind of perverse rip-off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad, Good for a Different Pretenders Perspective","review":"Unlike the first reviewer, I thought this album wasn't bad for the money. The only gripe I had was that they could've picked better songs and more of them. While it's true the singers all sound like Chrissie, it still works. The album is more of a breath of fresh air blown into 25 year-old songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good starter deck","review":"The cards are pretty a pretty standard assortment and you get some oversized hero cards.As far as I know there is no chance of a loot card of any type in these, so if you're looking for them head elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Lot of Fun !","review":"This pistol is just like the one from yester year. The .22 cal. has just enough pop to target practice with or take out small game(30 to 40 Feet). The quality is outstanding.

After all it is a pump pistol not a rifle and it will take more power to pump it up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice high quality!","review":"This is a very well made and very accurate air pistol. I bought this to compliment my Benjamin 392. All metal built to last. I have shot about 100 rounds through this gun so far with no issues. It is very accurate! I have no problem hitting my target at 40ft. the gun also looks great! Very nice wood finish! My gun is very sturdy, grips are tight, trigger pull is nice!

The writing is so good you are there in the action, living and breathing and walking with the characters. Plus, the characters are so interesting and well-formed -- so much so, that you don't even feel that they are characters -- they're real people. At least I wished they were and I wished I could go visit them. Right now. Mr. Everett is also tackling some tough subjects: an anti-gay hate crime and a prickly gay man; racism in Wyoming and the rest of America; disappointment and betrayal in marriage; cruelty towards animals. Big topics.

I was not familiar with previous work from this author.Cheerful but not annoying, encouraging but not shallow, the author manages to help divorced women (her primary focus) see divorce as an opportunity to move forward, changing their lives and their futures in positive ways.Without thinking about it, we always label divorce as a negative: it is. But if we are open to learning, growing, maturing, and becoming a better person, divorce gives us that opportunity --- whether we want it or not.This is a well-written book from an author who clearly understands the thoughts, feelings, and struggles of divorced women.

I know that sounds like silly fanboy hyperbole, but the finale of the song is absolutely awe-inspiring. The performance comes from the Rolling Stones Rock'n'Roll Circus, a tv special that was never aired because the Stones were not satisfied with their own performance.This version of \\" A Quick One\\" reveals the Who before they became international maga-stars with Tommy - snarling, explosive, triumphant punks with a sound that no band could match. No wonder the Rolloing Stones buried the show in a vault for 30 years; there was no way that they could match such an incredible performance. Truly one of the 10 greatest live moments from 60's rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Music, Horrible Remaster","review":"The reason this CD sounds so poor is because it was poorly remastered. The original LP tapes were used because the person who remastered it was too lazy to find the best quality sources for each track like they did with the DVD. So what they did was to use an old LP master, and they bathed it in so much hiss reduction, everything sounds like it's underwater! This might be one of the worst sounding CD's I've ever heard and it's NOT because of the nature of the original recordings. It's because of a poor remastering job!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Who Kids Are Allright Rocks","review":"This is an absolute must for any Who fan. The original cd release was muddy and practically unlistenable. This new remaster by Jon Astley is a great improvement.

The performances are somewhat flat at times, and the sound quality is ocassionally dull.That being said, this is generally a good sampling The Who in concert. You get the hits (\\"My Generation\\", \\"Pinball Wizard\\" and a sizzlling \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\") as well as some rarities (\\"A Quick One, While He's Away\\"). For the most part, the songs are good, though the studio recording \\"Long Live Rock\\", while a great tune, seems a bit out of place.Overall, this isn't exactly a must have (though the movie most definitely is), but it's anice addition to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"hungarian underground","review":"when i first heard this i was a bit confused - i've never heard this kind of sound before! i was amazed by the simple yet deep and chill-out taste of it. i STRONGLY recommend it to everyone who enjoys FILA BRAZILLIA, TALVIN SINGH and enything connected with ethnical psychedellic sound!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fasta and the furious","review":"If this game is half as good as the film this game should be quility the films were excelent if the game is half need for speed and half fast and the furious this game will be wicked there is mention of there being another then there will be two awsome racing game out for once AMAZON ROCKS!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"going 2 b a great game","review":"this game is going 2 b great in most of these reviews the people r right and hate 2 tell u mike from new york, NY USA Nos stands 4 nitros oxide systems so i c ur not a racer so stop being a poser and write reviews 4 some poser gamepz"},{"rating":"1","title":"This game kicks ...","review":"Ok this game is tight.

One of those that doesn't pay his bills on time and had been stealing water from my household overnight because he would rather support his habits than provide running water to his girlfriend and newborn baby. As sympathetic as I am to the girlfriend and the baby, I cannot afford to pay for their water usage in addition to our own so I bought this faucet lockout. The following billing cycle from the water/sewer company reflected a $27.xx drop on our bill. The month after it was an addition $14 below that. We have now had this for going on a year and love it! We dropped from an average $150/month for water+sewer to now being between $80-$135/month. The $135 being months that are hot enough for the outside water toys/slides/kiddie pool.This is a very good investment and will pay for itself in no time if someone is stealing water from you or if you think there is a risk of someone doing so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Effective Faucet Lock","review":"A couple of summers ago I noticed my water bill climbing higher and higher and couldn't figure out the cause. It turns out that friends of my neighbors kids, who lived in another neighborhood, would play with the hose and spray each other when we were out of the house.

Placemats? They may be celebrities, but they arent doing any mind-blowing design. Another problem with this book is that some of the projects require a wide-spread crafting knowledge (screenprinting and crochet) and the supplies for those things (screen and ink, squeegee, etc) which could get a little spendy. the wearables are not that cute or inspired (applying rows of snaps, embroidering on the shoulder? children could have come up with this stuff. check it out at the library first.

It turns out that the fraction of the blade causes such heat that a normal blade will distort rather qucikly and plain steel will rapidly lose its edge and the wide kerf causes increased waste and lengthens the time the cut takes.

I also enjoyed how Tracy was the one who valued sex as something sacred.

The whole second season was a disaster that sent the show into a downward spiral. The show was retooled to change it from a quirky college drama into a primetime soap. Instead of rich compelling storylines about college classes and a young woman's journey of self-discovery in those four years, we got the start of the shallow will she pick Ben or Noel storyline? Felicity fornicates with the artist guy for no reason and the aforementioned infamous haircut. This was followed up with even more bizarre choices for the characters: The black chick sleeping with the professor, Ben has a kid by another girl and Julie turning into a basket case. Sean getting testicular cancer. After this the show got unwatchable and the network knew it. That's why they kept moving it around. Avoid at all costs.

Comfortable head gear.The drawback(s): the outside cover lenses are very pricey (15.00 or more for 5). If you work in a lot of crawl spaces like i do, the outside controls can be damaged.

I guess this works faster than a whitening toothpaste (10 days versus 2 months or so), but my teeth haven't changed much at all (more of a placebo effect).It really isn't that hard to apply--just like the instructions say, dry your teeth thoroughly, paint on one thin coat, let dry for half a minute or so, and don't eat.The side benefits were that it leaves the surface of your teeth feeling very smooth and prevents you from caving in to late night snacking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!","review":"The pictures on the box make it seem so easy to use - but buyer beware! This product would not stick to my teeth regardless of how thoroughly I dried my teeth beforehand! The product dried immediatly after dispensing it from the tube, not even giving me enough time to brush it on a single tooth before it was a dried icky blob of goo that wouldn't stick to anything but the brush and my fingers and lips! I wasted 3 out of 14 packets just trying to get one successful application with no luck. Three nights and 7 packs later, I still have had no successful applications.When I did try to smear the dried up blobs on my teeth with my fingers out of desperation and went to bed, I woke up with lumps of this gross stuff floating in my mouth! No telling how much I had swallowed in my sleep! Ick! It may have wonderful whitening effects if you could somehow find a way to glue or tape it to your teeth!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Check dates!!!","review":"I actually bought this product a few days ago at a chain drugstore.I had some serious trouble applying the product, then found it didn't stay on very well and some of the packets were so shriveled that I couldn't get any product out of them and had to try another, so I decided to look at reviews on Amazon to see if anyone else has any tips...Then, having read someone else's review about the same problem, I checked the expiration date on the box. 2 months past.As I said, since it doesn't stay on too well, and my yield from the box will be much less than 14 days worth, I have to say the whitening effect isn't so pronounced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Did not know this performance existed.","review":"An excellent set of performances & the 2nd is superior to the digital remake Karajan did in the early 80's.

This DVD was a refreshing change from their style. I am pretty familiar with the Kundalini yoga moves and didn't find this workout to be super intense, like some of the other reviewers thought.Erin has a nice, soothing voice. The backdrop of Malibu Cypress Gardens was nice to look at too. Two of the exercises in the back showed modifications.I liked the fast pace of this routine. I feel very energized after finishing.Erin uses different terms for some of the exercises and this confused me at first. She calls \\"down dog\\" by \\"triangle.\\"It also would have been nice to have more explanation and words on the screen for the \\"adi shakti\\" meditation. I used to just say what I thought were the words.

He passionately believed that she had torn apart his family in the space of a night. And now, in the cold light of dawn, he wanted his revenge!This is probably one of my least favorite Reids.

Adamas has a hidden agenda throughout the entire book and if he really loves annie so much, why is he trying to push his cousins agenda? It doesn't make sense.

Weak dialogue or thin characters I can ignore, but the plot of this movie, basically, is that a woman is pulled into a haunted world of lost souls and other miserable creatures by the ghost of her aborted pregnancy who wants to instill guilt, pain, and, most importantly, ask why.Really?The pro-life vibes of this movie are obnoxious and undisguised, so step carefully. While I really appreciated the look and feel of the movie, especially some super imaginative concepts and designs, I couldn't stomach the underlying plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"The writing is SOOOOO BAD!","review":"Ugh! I can't take it. People don't pick up the phone and listen into it. They answer with \\"Hello?\\" or \\"Wei?\\" immediately. When people see something startling the don't ever so slowly start to look at it slowly turning their head over 20 seconds. If it's surprising they jump or shreek, if it's not so surprising thye inspect it immediately. Slow zooms with unrelated scary noises. A few more unbelievable parts later I just turned it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spectacular Visuals, but.....","review":"Ting Yin is writing a new book about the supernatural called RECYCLE. As she begins writing, the world of RECYCLE starts to come alive, and as she journeys from the real world into this decaying reality where what we abandon goes, she sees many incredible and disturbing sights.It's ambitious, but it just doesn't work. This film can't seem to decide whether to scare or amaze, and though it does the latter very well in several scenes (the alleyway filled with amusement park rides was breathtaking) it doesn't save it from embarrassments like the cave of abandoned fetuses, or the cheap looking zombie hoards... cringeworthy! And even when the visuals are high quality and evocative, the synthesized score overpowers any quiet eeriness they're trying to convey and makes the action seem cheesy and comic.If this film had been shorter, had less (or just NO) dialogue, and a better score, it would've made a nice art movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way to slow and confusing","review":"The DVD jacket, the Product Description provided by Amazon Instant Videos and the trailer really fooled me. I wanted Horror and didn't get it with this video. It was so slow, I never did figure out what the point was and was never scared. Ting Yin somehow opens up the door of the supernatural guided by one of her book's phantasmagorical creations and when it came to life, it was not terrifying at all. I had to ask, what did those \\"things\\" have to do with her book/life? I felt it would have been better if I saw more scenes of her writing the book while experiencing more supernatural incidents before it comes to life. And who is Miss Chu Xun and that other writer? And why couldn't she recognize her grandpa until the end? Angelica Lee is a very good actor and her young supporting actor had good chemistry together; that is what kept me until the end, but I would not recommend this."},{"rating":"2","title":"buddhists remember these departed, abandoned and aborted","review":"Stunning visuals, kept my interest all the way through it. Mirrormask comes to mind. Very similar to Buddhist services for the departed which include the aborted, abandoned ancestors, suicided or killed. Very interesting to included abandoned items and ideas and other mental creations. Like the plot twists and the tweak at the end wasn't bad at all. I reccomend this one, not gross and very suspenseful."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth a watch for the visuals if nothing else","review":"Honestly i would probably give the story a 3.5 because i didn't think the ending completely fit the movie. The visuals(especially at some of the darker points of the story) were definitely the best part of the movie and make up for what i thought the ending was missing. Overall i would say its at least worth a watch if nothing else as it is a very unique movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"Re-Cycle, the Movie","review":"Hmmmmm, Not really a scary ghost story at all. Rather, a social commentary on how we take what we want and discard the rest, to include our honnored dead and aborted fetuses, without regard to the consequences, usualy the loss of our soul and those of so many others. The movie uses the supernatural genre to convey the message, so there may be some jump out of your seat moments, but not many.I happen to agree with the message and enjoyed the presentation, but beware. If you don't think you need or want to hear the message, then ultimately, you will regret the decision to spend the money. Much of the acting was wooden and the effects were, average."},{"rating":"2","title":"strange, but good!","review":"The Pang brothers have a certain way of showing a ghost that is truly creepy. The concept of the movie is unique and I can appreciate that. The actual story kinda jumps around and is a bit random, but for me it worked because I kept watching to see where it was going next. But its basically about a writer and shes working on her next book but cant come up with any ideas. Then all of a sudden shes actually in this world of a all her forgotten ideas. This world is constantly changing, like it goes through cycles and she cant be in a spot when its changing. So she has to keep going to find a way out.This Blu Ray does not have the best image quality I've seen, but it still looks amazing on an HDTV.If you like the Pang brothers, If you like strange movies that require a bit of imagination, or if you like creepy ghost movies, then you might enjoy this film"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is why Hollywood Sucks","review":"If your as fed up with the crap coming out of Hollywood as I am, then ReCycle will be a welcome addition to your home video collection.A beautiful picture, scary, but not without reason, and packing a powerful message, this film is nothing less than amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"ehh","review":"Delivery and product condition were great.

This is especially evident in the scene where the heroine must part ways with her child guide - it's probably four times longer than it has to be.

Basically it brings me back to what I've always believed, the majority of people have no way of discerning what is utter tripe and what is actually good or at the very least, interesting. So what if the visuals are fairly well done, the story is unbelievably bad and obvious. Why is is so hard these days to get a decent and well written story? Why do we almost always have to sacrifice story for visuals?I like to take chances on movies to find those very few gems out there.

Overall though this movie had a pretty transparent story, with plot holes and inconsistencies. The little girl was the biggest one, and the one that broke the camel's back, so to speak. Every person in the 'other' world was essentially zombie/ghoul like, yet the little girl is not. This is purely to further the films \\"message\\". Even if you accept that the whole thing is just a guilt-trip inside the main character's head it still is not ultimately that satisfying since it is so disjointed.

The most disappointing thing was that it just didn't sparkle even in the sunlight. I was wearing a diamond band from Costco and it sparkles beautifully. There was an article on CNN about the differences between purchasing diamonds from Costco & Tiffany's and the conclusion was that you do get quality diamonds from Costco and its well worth it.

The first half of the book is a review of the timeline of the 60's, including profiles of all the major departments, people and governments involved. The second half is game-specific, and offers new departments, a new base class and prestige class, and plenty of campaign ideas. Overall, a very good sourcebook for a campaign set in the 60's.

I received an Emerson wine cooler as a bridal shower gift in May because my husband lived in an apartment after we were married we did not have the space to put it anywhere. We moved about one year later and I was finally able to open the product and just under 3 months later it died!! I got on the internet and searched the product and it seems that everyone is having this problem. I called the company to see if they would do anything for me because I had only used it for 3 months!! The product did sit in the box for one year but that would be no different if it sat on the shelf at Target for 1 year. The customer service mangager at Emerson said all he could do was offer me an apology. I told him about the numerous reviews and complaints by consumers and he said they are all out of warranty so there is nothing they can do. Basically, this wine cooler is set up to die right after the warranty is up! DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy","review":"I received this wine cooler as a gift and am extremely disappointed with the quality.

This is not a family film.He was much more believable in \\"Conagher\\" and \\"The Sacketts\\".The film has an interesting story line, and portrays the dangers of travel in the old west very clearly. After watching this movie one can understand why staying with the wagon train was the wise thing to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"All the stereotypes from the 1950s","review":"All the stereotypes are here from the 1950s western: the silent \\"Injun\\", the heroic mountain man (Sam Elliot), the honest and hardworking pioneer family, the greedy and sadistic bad guys. The dialog is also filled with hammy stilted lines that one would expect from that era. The simple black/white characterizations and trite sentimentality were difficult for me to watch. Sam Elliot is perfectly cast, and there are a few good scenery shots and a cohesive plot, so I gave it 2 stars. I might recommend this as a movie for kids except for the violence - there are at least 8 shootings and one severe clubbing. There is also lusting of the lowest kind by one of the outlaws towards the pioneer woman (hence the clubbing). If you are interested in an excellent modern western for adults with subtle dialog and characterizations (and plenty of violence), tryThe Propositionwith Guy Pearce."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Western","review":"This is a great western movie.

Unfortunately, it is a far cry from that movie. The Quick and the Dead was too predictable, the dialog was stilted and unrealistic, and the characters...well, they were too much \\"in character\\" and not believable.

This machine has worked flawlessly for me from the beginning. Never a paperjam, no problem with the fax software, full duplex printing and document feeder. Who could ask for more? I purchased the extra paper drawer so I have 1 for legal and 1 for letter (each holding 250 sheets) which means less shuffling of paper. My use is probably 70% printing, 20% copying, 8% faxing, 2% scanning.My network has computers running Windows XP and Windows 2000. The software I use is primarily Office software and printing from the internet. The printer is shared on the network and, again, works flawlessly. No garbled fonts and I have never, ever needed to reboot the printer.I'm searching now for a color model and am using the features and reliability of this machine as my benchmark."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paper curls","review":"I had a Brother 9600 printer.

Since my office isn't air conditioned, I expected some slight curling as was the case with the 9600 but the 8840D was so much worse. Even 24lb laser paper wouldn't print more than a few copies without backing up. If you can stand the long wait, customer service is good. They sent a replacement drum and when that didn't work another printer. Neither stopped or reduced the curling to a tolerable level. I regret having to return this printer since it has so many other good qualities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"This book was just awful. I mean I don't try to be overly p.c. but come on, Mulatto. I think Cameron should have been ashamed of herself for trying to pass as white and denying who she really was. And to make matters worse she still wanted to be part of a sorority that was clearly rascist. Does she really think someone who uses the n-word and is prejudice would ever accept her as a 'sister'. I think she was a weak character who didn't have the backbone to stand up for what she was. If you plan on getting this book. Don't! It's awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book on video","review":"This is truly a book on video, and if that is what you want than you'll be pleased. It follows the text of the book and the \\"animation\\" is pictures from the book mildly animated. My son adores this video and it added to his love of books and his love of Dr. Seuss. He is 4 1/2 and clamors to read Dr. Seuss books daily. However, the video is also a nice addition to our reading time. And in the past, it held my 2 yr old's attention better than the book alone. Now as he matures he sits well for books also."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is a book not animation!","review":"This is extremely poor exploitation of Dr. Seuss book. This DVD has very poor animation.

I hadn't realized there was a remake of the original black and white version, and since I like Debbie Reynolds and am typically a fan of musicals I decided to watch. I was very disappointed. The acting was inferior across the board from the Ginger Rogers version. Due to poor pacing and lackluster performances, Bundle of Joy couldn't inspire a laugh. It was a real dud compared to the comic romp of Bachelor Mother. Save your time and watch the original version."},{"rating":"1","title":"A not so funny musical comedy","review":"This movie aired recently on TCM. It was a remake of Bachelor Mother which starred Ginger Rogers. Bachelor Mother was considerably better than this dud.Basically the script is quite poor and not very funny.

Debbie Reynolds does her usual good job but she simply can't carry this movie out of its mediocrity.I feel I was quite generous in giving this movie two stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bundle of Joy","review":"I had never even heard of this movie until I saw it on TCM about a year ago. It is a cute story about a young salesgirl Polly (Debbie Reynolds) who ends up getting fired from her job. On the way back to her house she sees a young baby on the orphanage steps and saves it from a terrible fall. When she takes the baby into the orphanage they think it is her baby that she is giving them. The employees think that because she was fired she can't provide for \\"her\\" baby so they convince her boss to give her the job back. She ends up realizing later in the movie how much she loves the baby and wants to keep it. She meets the man of her dreams (ironically her real husband, Eddie Fisher) and adopts the baby.When are they going to put this movie on DVD?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable!","review":"Great for an evening when you are tired of things blowing up or vampires seeking you out.

Upon inspection, the wood was very cheap and it is only glued together. It may have come unglued because we, like many parents, are running a humidifier in our son's room. I cannot speculate. All I know is that I went out and got a better hamper from a local discount store for half the price.

IF you are too, then you need this book. The title says it all...A Continual Feast! This world will leave you famished at the end of the day, hungry for something rich and meaningful. These phrases will in turn inspire and direct you to live fuller in the 21st Century by remembering these past wise words."},{"rating":"1","title":"The prices","review":"for these books are so very high. Love the series and Father Tim, and all the people of Mitford. Love the author , J. Karon. But really.. how about a price break, especially for books like this one. Granted it is great for all the quotes, but this book is not worth all the money it is selling for. And perhaps too like a few of my other favorite authors, print it in softcover. More affordable to the folks who enjoy this series and books by J. Karon. way too over priced."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Continual Feast","review":"My book arrived in a timely manner and in very good condition. It is very interesting and fun to read. It is also very uplifting and a help at different times, as are all the Mitford Series. I have told others of the books and want to share them with everyone. Thanks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Let the Buyer Beware","review":"Having read and enjoyed all of the Mitford Books, I ordered this one, together with Patches of Godlight. Imagine my surprise when i discovered that instead of being printed in a readable form, both of these books contain mostly \\"handwritten\\" writing. They are printed in a barely legible script longhand, complete with misspellings. This may be a cute and clever way to present what are called Father Tim's favorite quotations, but, for me, they were hard to read and a big disappointment. I wish they had been printed rather than presented in this manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT DID I JUST WATCH?","review":"Oozing in pretentious atmosphere; riddled with a nearly unfathomable plot; and acted with little intensity or credibility, NEMESIS GAME is an empty, meaningless thriller. Carly Pope (First to Die) plays a young girl whose mother was killed in an auto accident; Adrian Paul phones in a performance as a fellow game player with a repulsive tattoo; and Brendan Fehr sneaks in for a small but pivotal role as a spacy game player. Despite some of the clever riddles, the movie makes little if any sense, and the wonderful character actor Ian McShane is wasted in the role of Sara's father, a policeman.An interesting premise but I hate movies where everything is so ambiguous, you get no payoff. If that's the \\"design\\" of life, we're in big trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"yawnnnnn is there meaning to it all","review":"just finished watching this movie in itself its a decent thriller and adrian paul for a change doesnt play the good guy what is the meaning behind all the unexplained bad events in the world who knows but it isnt this i guess we could blame the devil and old fashioned idea and concept its as good as reason as any and much better than the mumbo jumbo in this flick worth watching once but if u are going to buy buy it on the cheap not new"},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligent","review":"For a first time film maker this movie was quite intelligent. The twist and turns kept me guessing and the end caught me by surprise. I couldn't help but try to guess the riddles before those on screen. Well thought out script and acting. If you like riddles or your just a fan of anyone in the cast, definitely give this a look."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor.","review":"Stupid movie.

But that knowledge didn't in any way take away from my enjoyment of this book. I liked this one much more than I liked Last Known Victim, probably because I like Spencer and Stacy better as main characters. This was also an interesting mystery, with a lot of turns and red herrings everywhere. The attitudes and treatment of gaming seemed a little... antiquated... but I may be more progressive than some. Overall, it was an entertaining read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Killer Takes All","review":"The book is very good. I wanted to read it before I read the title, Last Known Victim by this same author. It is about New Orleans and since I'm from Louisiana I'm enjoying the details in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've never been disappointed by an Erica Spindler book!","review":"I am also a member of Doubleday and get offers on suspense novels through email.

I liked that it kept me guessing until the very end! Will read more of her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Killer Takes All","review":"This is the first book I have read by Erica Spindler. I thought her writing style was fine, but I found myself becoming bored with the \\"game playing\\" aspect of the novel. I have never played \\"role playing\\" games, and I have no interest in them. I didn't realize just how much of the story would be about \\"the game\\" based on Alice In Wonderland characters. Midway through the book I was reading frantically, not because I was enjoying it, but because I wanted to finish it so I could read something else! I may try another novel by Erica Spindler, but I will read about the plot a lot more carefully before I purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT mystery!","review":"I am a first time reader of this author. REALLY enjoyed this page turner and quick read. Looking forward to checking out previous books from her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Erica comes up without a full deck.","review":"I found the book, which promised an interesting premise to be incredibly dry. It didn't evoke any sort of terror, or shock like some of her earlier work (Namely Shocking Pink). I knew exactly who the killer was from the point of introduction. This Book just didn't do it for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watch out For White Rabiits","review":"This is my first book done for the new year. It's got plenty of drama, suspense and intrigue. Set in New Orleans, this deals with a serial killer who likes to play role playing games that turn out deadly. Stacy Killian is introduced in this novel, when she meets Spencer Malone, his family and his Aunt Patty. She's been left cryptic notes from the \\"White Rabbit\\", putting her life in danger, when she's next on his list. It's up to the NOPD to protect her and stop this \\"White Rabbit\\" from killing others. What a rush!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Work for Me","review":"This book is readable, but I wouldn't recommend this book to someone looking for romantic suspense. First of all, there is very little romance in this book. The \\"romance\\" between the two main characters is barely touched upon -- there isn't even a love scene between them! Just a \\"morning after\\" scene, which I found highly disappointing.Secondly, the plot in this book is remarkably complicated and involves five major plot twists in the last 100 pages (I'm not kidding here). I don't mind a suspense novel with a good twist or two, but I think too many twists hurt a story's credibility. I also found it difficult to keep track of all the different characters in the story as well.Spindler is a good writer and writes in a fluid style. I'm willing to give her writing another shot, but I would suggest passing on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Killer Takes All","review":"My daughter gave me my first Erica Spindler novel for a birthday gift. I was hooked. I have read all her books and continue to want more. This book is incredible. The twists and turns in the novel. You think you know who it is only to find out it is not who you thought it was at all. Keeps you on the edge of your chair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best.","review":"The humor in this book isn't the cute almost innocent humor of the first two. This book has a different and much more adult oriented plot line. However, it still has it's funny moments and is enjoyable.

There wasn't enough documentation to prove her theories at all, and it wasn't a book that I had hoped for: a clear, cut-to-the-chase book on potty training. If users are really serious about potty training at an early age, a better book to read would be Linda Sonna's Early Start Potty Training. Linda Sonna presents theories and backs it up with numerous amounts of research that makes her points seem valid. Her method is straight forward on how to start potty training at various ages and answers the questions of accidents and mishaps."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I liked the book very much, its strength and weakness lie in the same thing: that it's not a manual for Elimination Communication. In that I mean that on the one hand it lacks a bit in practical tools & tips for the beginner EC'er, but on the other hand it gives a comprehensive description of the subject - the advantages of EC, the historic background, physiological background etc. I learned a lot from the book and was very motivated by it to practice EC, but I still had many practical questions that were left unanswered. Still, it's a great book, I gave it 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I couldn't put this book down. It was just so fascinating to learn about a common, around-the-world practice that I'd never heard of in the U.S.I think Bauer does a great job of explaining the technique and how to use your own instinct when it comes to natural infant hygiene.After reading it, it seems like a no-brainer to me. Why didn't I think of it before? That just goes to show you how ingrained we become to our own culture's way of doing things.I can't wait to try natural infant hygiene, and I feel like Bauer's book will be one I go back to for instruction and reassurance.Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very inspiring!","review":"Before I had my baby I read another book, Christine Gross-Loh's \\"Diaper Free Baby\\" which is actually a great place to start if you want to try elimination communication/natural infant hygiene. Ingrid Bauer's book sort of takes you to the next level. I read it when my son was a month or two old, and we were already practicing EC, and the book helped me learn to trust my instincts. Ingrid Bauer does a wonderful job of painting a picture of what it's like to go diaper free with a baby."},{"rating":"2","title":"can't do without it","review":"i read this book while pregnant and was a little blown away, wondering if i could do it. the day i got a tiny potty in the mail, i set my 6 week old daughter on it and she peed! as if it was nothing new! she is nearly 5 months old now and we never buy diapers. our friends and family are amazed. it is an essential to share with new parents.we are so proud of our daughter, and i am so grateful to this author -Gentle Wisdom is very appropriate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very informational","review":"This book is AWESOME. Ingrid Bauer has done a wonderful job providing the information you need to do EC. If you were only to pick one book on EC, this one should be it. Very well researched, she even gives info on things such as the scientific reason babies don't have to \\"go\\" as often at night.I will say that she does take some liberties and slips in other random parenting advice, which you can tell she is very passionate about (such as her belief in wearing your baby with you all the time and preferably naked--sounds fine and probably is a good idea, it just won't work with my lifestyle), but it's easy to take it with a grain of salt. Besides, you might agree with her other parenting advice!Bottom line about this book: Love it, love it, love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Like plaster..","review":"This has to be the worst I have used.

I actually received this as a free gift for spending $30 on Aubrey's website. This lotion is truly unscented and wonderful. How often will you find a body lotion that is unscented, SPF 15, absorbs quickly, contains healthy ingredients and leaves no residue behind? Did I mention that it is less than $10? Amazing! I love this stuff so much and lucky for me this can be shipped to a military address overseas. The biggest reason I love it is how well it moisturizes my skin. My dry skin doesn't \\"glow\\" very often but with the summer around the corner it is important that my legs be moisturized and presentable. My skin is moisturized, healthy looking and I love it.

Well, it made my face redder and covered with tiny red dots. I then went to the rosacea sufferer's forum and read how for some rosaceans niacinamide works and the others it makes their rosacea worse, so I guess I fall into that last category :( I was so disappointed and saddened, I really thought from all I had read that I had finally found that magic potion for my rosacea, well, back to the drawing board. I do not blame the product, I think if you do not react to it it will work for you and this has a good amount in it with nothing you don't want, but just know that niacinamide is not for everyone and you never know if you might be one of the unlucky ones...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"Plain and simple-IT DOES NOT WORK!

It's actually rather pretty when you let it run through a fork. The smell and taste are both mild but pleasant. The smell is similar to vanilla, and the taste is a buttery vanilla. It has an immediate aftertaste that is a bit bitter, but a sweetness that lingers for a while. I think the flavor would be quickly lost in cooking or baking (it might works with seafood, but I don't think I'd try it with red meat), but it would go very well with white and green tea, and mild herbal teas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Honey Ever","review":"This creamy honey from far off New Zealand has a distinctive but subtle flavor unmatched by any other I have ever tasted. It regularly sells out at Fairway, where I usually buy it, which is why I purchased it online (though more expensive this way). Last winter, I went to the store to buy a few jars for small Xmas presents, and was told that a woman had come in the day before and bought 20! Clearly, I was not the only one with this idea. No matter where I buy it, however, I always get some for myself too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thick creamy deliciousness!","review":"This honey is literally like no other honey I have ever had. At room temperature it is thick, not at all runny, creamy looking and tasting, the perfect level of sweetness, not overly sweet like many honeys and it has just the slightest hint of zest, almost minty quality.Airborne in general makes some incredily unique products that you can't really find anywhere. I highly recommend their entire product line! The only drawback here is the price. The listed price here is twice the price that I find this stuff for at my local international market.EDIT: The price seems to have come down, was sixteen before, now around the eight mark which makes it on target with my local international market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay headphones, lousy microphone.","review":"Purchased these for use while playing online games.

My projects didn't always turn out quite right, probably because of the difference in versions, but I got the drift.I think Quark is a pretty complicated program, anyway.

We've had if for 18 months and only recently had to change the filter.

It is on level 2, but we've never had to use level 2.It is easy to fill. It leaked on us once, but that was because the gasket around the screw-on cap had fallen off when I was filling it.

As far as durability, it's still working 3 years later. However, it goes through filters often. However, every humidifier I've bought goes through filters quickly. Its a problem with filters, but it keeps bacteria out of the air better than other kinds. The bigger problem was finding replacement filters. It took much web surfing to find a place to buy them from. If you buy this unit, I recommend buying several filters at a time, that way you always have some on hand.My biggest problem with the unit is that the lowest setting is not that quiet. I also did not think it did the best job humidifying the air.One other issue I had was emptying the \\"base\\". I ended up spilling water every time I carried it to the sink. Other models have a larger base and spilling water is not a problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"This humidifier doesn't humidify","review":"I've had this for over a year now.

Hooper's chapters contain Americanisms, theological statements opposite to that of the beliefs of Lewis, and a writing style emphasizing physical actions and not thought processes.The dead giveaway is that 20% of the novel contains detailed descriptions of apparatus and their use. Lewis hated with a purple peeve such items in literature.Hooper has also rewritten much of the poetry of Lewis to exclude the allusions to classical Greek and Roman literature.For more information read \\"Light in the Shadowlands\\" and \\"The C.

In the Penguin edition, Raeburn subordinates everything to the struggle to write hexameters in English. Why? The result is alien, ugly and unfaithful. Take the first line, where Melville conserves Ovid's first joke, namely starting an epic with a preposition, and incorporates the crucial Lucretian reference to bodies, in a line of elegant English verse. Raeburn fails on all counts.

A few scholars believe that this was a literary hoax created by Ovid himself. It would enable him to write the 'Tristia' and 'Letters From The Black Sea'.'Metamorphoses' is his main achievement. It contains 250 stories from the Greek Mythology and they all have in common that the principal character changes into another form. Most of the time they turn into an animal or a tree but also in a river, a constellation of stars, a rock or a flower and other pleasant surprises.If you read this book you won't find many happy endings.

Since we were working outside in December in late afternoon, we were working against the clock. The stand set up easily even without a manual (none was included). My 10\\" Hitachi compound miter saw will eventually need a mounting board, since the mounting holes are not in line as required by the stand's mounting brackets. I was able to get a firm enough mount with only two bolts. The way the saw needs to be mounted is not the best feature--I had to shove the bolts in from below to be able to have the nuts accessible. Once set up we got all the molding cut efficiently. Breakdown and transport are easy. Thanks to other reviewers who suggest things to make it a better product. Especially Derek Cox, who noted that parts from Riyobi are compatible. Like I said, great value, especially for light, DIY use"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works for me","review":"The stand works fine for the Milwaukee 10\\" compound miter saw. It's solid and stable. I recently bought a Delta mobile planer and figured a way to mount it on the Denali. This allows me to use the roller supports of the Denali to support long pieces of wood at both ends of the planer thus reducing snipe.The only thing I wish this stand had were wheels to make it easier to move once equipment is mounted. I'm trying to figure out wheels now.I did have a minor issue of a bead of weld material interfering with one of the orange handled screws tightening a roller. Quick remedy was a few minutes with a file and the bead disappeared.There is no such thing as the perfect tool for every user.

Given the price, I frankly wasn't expecting to be bowled over by the quality. After getting it set up and attaching my chop saw, I actually went inside the house to bring my wife out to look at it! Those who said \\"for the value it's a good tool\\" are right on the money. I'm looking very much forward to using it in my handyman business. The extensions are solid, the legs are solid, the saw mounting hardware seems solid (time will tell) and the fit and finish is really nice for the $100 I paid. I'll echo those who said \\"don't be afraid to buy this tool.\\" You'll be well satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Early Results","review":"I just received the stand today and within ten minutes I had it together with the saw on it and I cut my first board. I believe that this stand is as rigid as my Dewalt was when it was new. Tomorrow I'll be cutting 2 by's for a built-in entertainment center so I'll know more after that. First response is this could be very good for the cost. I didn't give it a 5 because I don't give out 5's unless this turns out to be perfect and without pneumatic wheels if can't be a 5.Its been a couple of weeks and one built-in entertainment center later I can say that this stand does well. As I said before it would be nice to have wheels but I'll fabricate something later. It only real short coming is that it would be nice to have longer stock supports but even so it's not bad with it's current capacity. I'm a little worried about the plastic knobs but all in all, I think I'll purchase another to throw in my pick up for the job site. Nothing wrong with this stand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic !!! High quality at a low price.","review":"I was a little skeptical at the quality of this product with such a low price.

I thought that this couldn't be any worse than what i saw at the retail stores and took the plunge. I trusted the reviewers before me and crossed my fingers. I agree with all the people that gave it 5 stars because this stand is fantastic. It has the quality of a Dewalt at the price of Black&Decker. I mounted my 10\\" Dewalt dw713 and it fit like a glove.

I bought this stand for my Dewalt DW713 10-Inch Compound Miter Saw. Works great. Quick release mechanism is very nice. The only complaint I have and the reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is the locking pins for the legs. They are the detent type, just push in on them and fold up the legs. I have found while moving the stand around, ok dragging it to be fair, the pins will come out of the detents fairly easy. Other than that, I'm very satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think it's well designed","review":"After over think if it needed this or not, I ordered this thing now I don't know why I waited so long.

It's a fantastic stand - solid and well built. I had seen the Bosch stand prior to getting this one and it was shaky when using the saw. It had one leg that was height adjustable for uneven ground, but despite that, it just wasn't all that sturdy. The Denali stand is rock solid and works very well. The only reason it's 4 stars instead of 5 is the lack of wheels for easy moving and storage, but other than that, I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprising out of the box","review":"When I opened the box it came in, it was very well packed from the manufacturer, with absolutely no damage from shipping. Set-up was easy, and I'm very happy with how sturdy it is. The legs lock positively with a 'snap'. The extentable supports are steady and strong.

The version of Ethnicolor which opens the album reverbs, and gives really open feeling of a concert piece. Second Rendezvous is played in its *entirety* (unfortunately rare on many concert releases), features full choir and of course the backing of fireworks. The little-heard Equinoxe Part 7 is featured and makes an etheral concert piece.

What a disappointment; I am shocked that this movie was as bad as it was. DJay in this movie is the lead character, yet he's a despicable piece of garbage who can't rap and is a pimp. Yep a no-good pimp who murders rivals and exploits women. DJay is not at all likeable; who wants to see a no-good loser make it anyway? Where are the movies showing brothers making it out of the ghetto as doctors or lawyers? There are 100x more of them out there, yet the media loves to lionize 'hustlas' like this loser DJay.

This works.There are two drawbacks, however:1) the protector doesn't go high enough up the back. There is still lots of wear on the seat back because of the lack of protection there. This is the biggest disadvantage for me.2) it makes the seat slipperier. Tight installation of the carseat is more difficult to achieve, although that may be less problematic with newer carseat latch system. I do have the best method for tightening those seats that still use straps for installation. If you have the captain style chairs, install the seat tightly with the chair reclined and then push that seat back up as far as possible and your carseat will not budge, not even a millimeter; and the slipperiness of the seat protector is moot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only buy if you have anosmia.","review":"Had it for two weeks and it smells so bad.

In my opinion, however, these pieces do not reflect his brilliance nearly as well as do his piano concertos or his septets. They are pleasant to listen to, but not particularly striking. it is interesting to note that all require extreme virtuosity from the performers. The bassoon concerto is in a style very similar to Mozart's, and nice to hear considering the rather limited bassoon repertoire. The variations for oboe and orchetra are pretty, but I find to the variations to be somewhat simple and unoriginal. The clarinet quartet is very interesting to listen to. Its second movement requires each of the four players to play in a different meter. Although I feel it lacks the grace of the other two pieces, it is certainly the most original of the three. Either way, while these aren't Hummel's best works, they warrant a listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good desk reference","review":"I just got a copy of \\"The essential dictionary of investing and finance\\" and I feel it is a good book to refer back to since it is filled with useful terms in several categories such as bonds, stocks, general investing, mutual funds, etc... it even covers some technical analysis terminology.I believe that this book will be really handy whenever I am reading something online or in other investment books/publications and don't know the meaning of the word.The guy who wrote this book (Jerry M.

That's all right, I like synth-pop, but for some reason this just doesn't grab me like other synth/EBM bands (VNV Nation). It's just too repeatative. Aside from a couple slower tracks, most of the songs have the same beat. The vocals express no emotion as if the vocalist didn't really care what he was singing about.

The book does give some justification for why they're useful in the ERP systems context but web services are not magic. As a software developer who uses web services every day I know better.The book has lots of examples and case studies for how companies can benefit from using an ERP system but it has precious little in the way of details as to how they work or how you might configure a system.

The worst part is that parts of the picture at the bottom were chopped off, some of the best parts were no longer there. I have these on VHS that I recorded from TV and the VHS recordings are better than these DVD's. At least the VHS has all the scenes and the bottoms of the screens are there.

I'm quite disappointed Universal didn't put more effort into finding the best copies available to transfer to DVD, when so many other studios send out their detectives to find the best prints available for DVD, let alone helping to preserve our film heritage.

This book failed to be an instructional book because details are held back.For example, he said he learned a great technique by shooting both B&W and color film for the same subject, but he didn't mention at all what technique he learned!!! Why mention it if he's not going to share it? All the technique he talked about in the book are so basic and vague that I get more confused after reading this book.

Then you better quick save because as soon as you try to jump on them they'll fall down and you'll have to start again. All the surfaces except the floor seem very slippery and moving on them is another exercise in frustration. I quit at the military base because I didn't spend $20 to waste 30 minutes randomly hitting tanks to stack them up so I could move on.Most of the secret locations and holy items are almost impossible to reach unless you are prepared to spend a ridiculous amount of time on it.

However, it lacks the some of the charm of the games it tries to imitate. Your character is somewhat slow moving and the action isn't really that fast.

I do think his 8th is a bit overrated, but this is one of the finest 7ths I've ever heard, along with Bohm's live 1977 (Bavarian Radio SO), Furtwangler's Berlin (beter sound than Cairo or Rome, all with the BPO from circa 1949-50) and Knappertsbusch's 1949 VPO. Those are the only performances of this symphony I've heard that gave me goose-bumps and sent a chill up my spine.

When I found it in a store, I was jumping up and down. When I saw it, I wanted it to go on and on and on. It even made me cry at the part where Luna found Kakaru in the snow.I think the best part was at the end, when Sailor Moon used the Silver Crystal. I do not think the Snow Dancers sounded like yapping dogs, but I agree for the most part that they were not scary at all.What do you expect for the transformations, after all, to have a new one every show and Movie????? They get a new one every enemy!!??I think that if you really wanted to learn the attacks, you could rewind and listen until you get it.(DUH!, after all, it is a movie, so you can rewind!!)I think that all the voices were clear, and I would rate this as my favorite movie.(Until I get Promise of the Roses and Black Dream Hole!!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Sailor Moon Flick","review":"Sailor Moon S is a great flick with some minor glitches, but all together, it's a buy you won't regret. The movie begins with the senshi on their winter vacation. Luna comes down with a fever and is being cured by an astronomer. His name is Kakeru. Luna starts to fall in love with him after a while. The situation turns bad for Luna as Kakeru's sort of girlfriend, Himoko, appears. Also, the senshi are facing a dillema when an evil ice queen Kaguya threatens to freeze the Earth and turn make it part of her collection. I cried the first time I saw this movie just because I'm emotional. Don't blame me! I think you'll feel more for the characters if you switch to Japanese with subtitles. The dub is just too, loud. The voices are, shrieky. The extras are something to be happy about. There's a picture gallery, a biography on each senshi, a story on Princess Snow Kaguya, and a preview of some Pioneer animation titles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its ok ......","review":"I saw this movie and thought \\"Ok thats nice but ..... there is just something missing\\" I thought the video was a little BORING and was short on action ! The enemies were a little dumb \\"SnowDancers\\" ? Thats sounds just a little bit lame you know ? I saw the dubbed version so.....It might be a little different from the erm...undubbed one ! But anyways I thought that the movie was a little weird ! If you saw the last few episodes on SailorMoonS dubbed you would know what I mean ! the HolyGrail is destroyed ! And in the movie its still there ? And working ? And another thing ! Uranus,Neptune,& Pluto dont EVER join the Inner's in the S Season !! (again a dubby) This movie really lacks ALOT of well....shall we say ...planning ?"},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is a real good one to get all you fans!","review":"Believe me. Once you watch this movie, you will fall in love with it. You will also start to want more videos because oyu can't have enough of it. It is a story with Luna and a scientist names Kakeru, well, that was the name in the Japenese format. I am not sure in dubbed. It has a great story with an Ice Princess from another Galaxy. It has all of the outers except Sailor Saturn. I recomend that you get the R movie first before you buy this video, though. Just to know the story more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't ever buy","review":"What the Americans did to what was once a wonderful japanesse series I guess wasn't good enough for them. They had to ruin the movies, too. People, if you truely want to see this movie buy the uncut subtitled version. See the movie the way it's suppose to be, not the butchered Americanized garbage that the dubbed version is."},{"rating":"1","title":"This reeks!","review":"This movie REALLY sucks! It was really stupid and made no sence. I never saw the Japaneese version, so mabie this crap is just the result of bad dubbing???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yet another great Sailor Moon movie!","review":"This is a great movie but not the best of the Sailor Moon movies. Highly recommended for any Sailor Moon fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DiC all over again","review":"Do yourself a favor and get the subtitled version of this and the other 2 movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sailor Moon S is just a romance flick","review":"Sailor Moon S among with the other sailor moon movies differ extremely from the regular storyline and in my opinion are less imaginative and certainly less etertaining. Sailor Moon S did have though a very nice romantic storyline with Luna falling in love with a human."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as R or Super S...","review":"This movie was kind of weak. When I first bought it it was the only one of the three I had,so I really liked it (especially the outer senshi). But after I bought the other two it wasn't very good in comparison. The plot is suprisingly weak for the usual Sailor Moon and it almost completely revolves around Luna. It's also VERY predictable. All of the senshi get to use all of their attacks equally, the newer ones in the first battle and the older ones in the last battle. It reminds me of a whole season summed up in two half hour episodes. The music is nothing to brag about, either. Moonlight Destiny is a very good song, but the rest sound like a scifi movie from the sixties (unlike SuperS, which had wonderful music with lots of emotion). If your out to collect all three movies or love Luna tons, then by all means buy this movie. If your out for music and a good plot, I reccomend SuperS or R."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Bad.. Don't Buy It.","review":"You should only buy it if you want to see the othe three other scouts. Although, I am told there are guy scouts that change into girls. Curious to see what that is about."},{"rating":"2","title":"GOOD","review":"OKay, when i told my friends I had bought this sailor moon movie, they were all like \\"Oh, all the other ones are better...\\" and stuff like that. I thought that this one was really good, but they were right. The other ones are better. that doesn't mean I'm putting this one down or anything. this movie is totally awesome. I loved it. in the end, it made me wanna cry. I mean Luna was awesome... I wished it aws real life. It's kinda is a remake of the Berly seen. I mean come on, the silver crystal again, on to boulder type things, in cold weather... but it was totally great. if you liked this one, go get the others too..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I thought this was a great movie! The characters were enjoyable as ever and the story was typical Sailor Moon.The reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because the story was TOO typical in that Sailor Moon uses the same techniques to defeat her enemies. I think the writers should have made defeating the bad guy, (er.. girl,) more of a challange.Halfway through I felt the movie should've been named \\"Luna's Story\\" because she seemed to have a LARGE role in it. Not that I'm complaining about that or anything because I love Luna a bunch and her role was important to the plot, but while she got more screen time others like Sailor Uranus and Mini Moon, among others, had very small roles and didn't speak much.Despite these little things I really enjoyed watching this and would highly recommend it to any Sailor Moon fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite movies","review":"This movie is focused on Luna and an astronomer kakeru who saves her life from getting hit by a car, and takes care of her when she is sick. He discovers a stone that was sent here by princess snow kaguya who plans to freeze the earth. The animation on the dvd is so much better than the vhs. If anyone is saying to themselves ill buy the vhs because its just sailor moon and its cheaper. Don't, because its not worth it. With this dvd you get japanese and english language. English Subtitles, and great animation. What more could you ask for."},{"rating":"2","title":"My least favorite of the three.","review":"When I first saw this, I didn't expect anything big or small, so it was just what I pedicted.I also wish they would come out with more movies of Sailor Moon and have them be longer.The summary of this movie is basic:A scientist sees a comet and gets a weird crystal that fell after the comet did. The next day, Luna is sick. The scientist saves her, and after a while, she falls in love with him, neglecting Artemis! Then Luna notices the crystal makes him weak. And a snow princess ccomes to earth wanting to freeze the earth and get her crystal back, and it's up to the sailor scouts to stop her."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Different Sailor Moon....","review":"I thought that the japanese voices were better than the english voices of the Sailor Moon show that airs in USofA. The music was good, and I thought that when Luna finally got her chance of being a human, was a good ending. I would recommend this movie to any Sailor Moon fan out there........The only thing that was bad about it was the length of the movie. Should have been a little longer....overall \\"Excellent movie\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie","review":"I have to say that this was one of the better Sailor Moon Movies. R was as well but i don't have high hopes for the SuperS dub. Any how I thought that the movie theme was well thought out and the relationship between Luna and the scientist is cute. I do have a few problems with this movie though. My first is Luna. I mean in the show and the movies she sounds like an old aged person not a teen girl. In this movie when Luna transforms in the Princess she looks like a 16 year old girl but she sounds 40! I ruined that touching part of the movie and made me want to laugh. The other problem i had was with Sailor Uranus! Lord my he have pity on her soul. I think i have never heard worse acting in my life! I know that she should have a deeper tone and i could bairly make out what she was saying! I took me 3 times watching the movie to figure it out! All-in-all it was a good movie considering they cut a lot of stuff out but i still recomend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Umm . . .","review":"I just got done watching the S movie, and I was slightly dissapointed. I mean, the outer scouts sounded to . . . I dunno, but they're suppost to be older than the inner scouts, not younger. And I noticed Haruka sounded higher and Michiru sounded lower. Got a mix-up? You bet. And that \\"Mini moon\\" thing? Uh, Hello! It just sounds to corny. Plus the whole thing sounded like they were acting, theey didn't have any feeling and it was weird. If you already have the subtitled S movie, don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!! So romantic!!","review":"This movie is great!!! i didn't like it at all when i saw it the first and i think the second time too! But after a while i loved it! it's really romantic and it also made me cry, each time i saw it! Luna is very dramatic in this movie towards the man she falls in love with, but i still feel sorry for poor Artemis! Still if you like more of the soap opera peice of sm, this is for you!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie rocks","review":"Yes you herd it this movie rocks. I enjoyed the movie, for one it had three new scouts <no background> Luna human form and many other attributes. My only problem is that it is hard to hear the new scouts, power and morphing wise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outer Senshi Flop and Sailor Mini Moon","review":"I thought the Sailor Moon R dub wasn't that bad. Not too much was changed, considering. I expected some changes concerning the outer senshi (Uranus, Neptune and Pluto) in the Sailor Moon S movie dub, but I didn't expect it to be horrible. Until you see the first scene with Haruka, Michiru, and Setsuna, it seems like a decent dub. The moment the outers get a scene and open their mouth to speak, I was horrified. Haruka with a high-pitched voice? And Michiru's voice sounding so VERY similiar to Haruka's? And what's with calling Chibi Moon \\"Mini Moon\\"? I recommend either buying the subtitled version or if you have dvd, get that. Then you can have the subtitled version to switch to if the dub disappoints you as much as it did me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest movie of 'em all!","review":"K, so call me a hopeless Luna fan, but this movie is so cool! Besides the fact that it stars everyone's favorite feline, this movie also has a good plot. Definately the best movie of the three SM movies (SMR movie is a close second)! Oh, and watch out for a human Luna..."},{"rating":"2","title":"man this movie is good","review":"I really liked this movie its so likable i have a 5 year old brother that can not read and he loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS MOVIE ROCKS!","review":"This movie is really sweet! It has an awesome plot, and it has the outers! How cool is that! This wicked Ice Queen, is out to make the world a planet of Ice, to add to her collection, but to do it fast she needs a special item, to find out what it is, BUY IT! See, if I told ya, it wouldn't be exciting, but, its a really cool movie... SAILOR MOON RULES!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"S\\" is for \\"Superb!\\"","review":"Sailor Moon S is by far the best of the three movies, featuring all ten of the Sailor Soldiers and Tuxedo Kamen pitted in battle against the Snow Queen, a wicked being who wants to freeze the entire Earth and add it to her collection. This movie also features Luna in an interesting side story, which I won't spoil, but provides a lot more insight into her character than her usual nagging at Usagi in the TV series. All in all, this movie has everything, excitement, suspense, romance, and not one, but TWO hot guys! What more could an anime fan ask for?"},{"rating":"2","title":"moonlight destiny","review":"this was a good movie, a lot better than Supers. Luna falls in love with an astronimer(i can't spell!) who's very sick because of princess kayuga.the best things are seeing luna as human, and seeing the outer senshi(exept saturn)transform! Everone should see it! i wouldn't watch it dubbed though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Usagi is cool but this..............","review":"I realy like Naok's sailor moon but this movie is a mochery of the entire seris!I think that this movie was stupid! I mean come on a cat falling in love with a man?!I think that the comic book seris blows this and the cartoon out of the water!so if you remotley liked this check out sailor moon out at your local comic shop,trust me this sucks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mini Moon?","review":"I own the subbed and dubbed version of this movie. Ket me say that I found alot wrong with it. Several scenes were cut from the dub. They named Sailor Chibi Moon Sailor Mini Moon. For one thing Chibi means Small or Little not Mini! Is it just me or does Mini Moon conjure the thought of the movie \\"Austin Power the Spy who shagged me\\" in your mind? Also the seiyuu for Uranus is all wrong. The seiyuu is too feminine. If they keep that seiyuu for episode 93 it will ruin the whole episode. ALSO (SPOILER)I don't want to ruin it for anybody but does Pioneer? There's a scene from Episode 200 of Galaxia in the opening credit."},{"rating":"2","title":"kid moon and moon voice are very good(in japanese)","review":"no surprise. But I love the sailmoon team friendship"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for the completist... Or Luna fan...","review":"This movie put me to sleep. Plain and simple. I found the plot the worst of the three movies. The first movie made you feel for the characters, and the third was just *fun*. This one, however, feels like a standard spotlight episode, doubled in length. Not a lot happens, and the villain is the garden variety I-will-do-something-evil-to-the-planet-because-I-Can type. Of course, it /is/ Sailor Moon, and it /is/ in the original Japanese (No name changes or odd edits! Rejoice!), so I'll probably buy it. Eventually. But not until I've forked over the dough for the other two movies first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly Dubbed","review":"Sailormoon s the movie is very nice but in the dubbed version its horrible they changed the music and cut some scenes ...sailorpluto sounds like a kid! she is suppose to be silent and quiet but of course DIC (...) like hell! and sailorminimoon? ok this isnt too bad.....get this in japanese with english subtiles forget about buying the english version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sailor Moon S was great!!","review":"This movie was great but R was much better in my opinion. Even though a love story about Luna and the science guy was cool a movie needs some action like it did in Sailor Moon R. I have never seen the Japanese version but I know. Plus they didn't even play a song like they did in R in both Japnanese and the dubbed. You may ask hold on how do you know they don't play a song in Jpanese when you never seen it. Well.....my friend told me. All in all this was a great movie though it wasn't what I expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good love story, but not as good as expected.","review":"Now don't get me wrong. This was a great love story, but just not what I expected from Sailor Moon. The story tends to skip around and the outer Sailors are rarely shown (what's up with them and that coffee shop?). The transformations are wonderful, but a tad revealing (think Barbie). The Ice Princess is a bit revealing, too (think super Barbie). Overall, it's a great movie for all ages.Suprisingly, Sailor Moon doesn't cry much in this movie. Luna finally learns what love feels like, leading to an interesting story. The end fight sequence is wonderful and well animated. Sailor Chibi Moon is in there, too, but not much, and doesn't do any fighting. A great movie, and a must see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Love Story","review":"For those of you who have read my review of \\"Sailor Moon R: The Promise Of The Rose\\", you already know I am a completely obsessed Sailor Moon fan (moonie). This movie earns my highest rating for different reasons than \\"Promise\\". \\"Promise\\" was a much more action-based movie, while \\"Hears In Ice\\" is much more a love story. With love between Kakeru and his astronaut girlfriend, Serena and Darien, and others, it combines to make a really sweet movie. The animation is well done (as usual), and all the attacks are wonderfully drawn. Also added in are touches of humor throughout the movie, which make for an even more enjoyable watching experience. This is defintely one for the video collection. Don't hesitate...buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Reason to See This: Luna as a HUMAN","review":"I bought the subbed version through Amazon. Pioneer did a pretty good job and was similar to VKLL too! and VKLL did an awesome job with the R and SuperS movie. The original music was beautiful. Of course being that this is S.M. there were some very funny points in the movie. Usagi and Chibi-Usa's hijinx it made the movie enjoyable. Although there was some humor this was not completely a comedic film. It was mostly a drama with heartfelt pitty on poor Luna who fell in love with Kakeru (an astronomer.) Like the other movies the developement of the characters has been expanded compared to the original japanese version. There is a point in which Luna (while still a cat) cries her sorrows out to Usagi, it makes you feel her pain and suffering as well. In the end your tears will vanish away with smiles."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Word Can Actually Describe This Movie...... BEAUTIFUL","review":"This movie was absolutely beautiful.. I ordered the subtitled version because I wanted to see and hear the original Japanese. This movie was really amazing. It kinda started out slow but it was building it's plot around certain characters (don't want to reveal certain information), but made up for it in the end. Usagi(Serena) is really a great character. For North American veiwers not exposed to Japanese Sailormoon I'd recommend this movie, you'll love her even more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! What a great movie!","review":"I've gotta say, this was the best movie I've ever seen. Because I live in America, I've never gotten to seen Sailor Moon S. This was my chance to get a taste of what I was missing! When I finally got it (after waiting impantiently for 3 days ^_^), I loved it so much, I watched it twice a day, every day, for 10 days straight! If you live in America, and can't wait until fall to get a taste of SMS, you should buy this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hearts in Ice Will Break Your Heart","review":"Sailor Moon S The Movie: Hearts in Ice, is a Wonderful conclusion to the S Series. When the evil Ice Queen has plans to take over the world using a pure heart crystal, it is up to the Sailor Scouts, Including Chibi Moon, (a.k.a. Mini Moon), Uranus, Neptune and Pluto, to stop her from turning Earth into an Icy world of death. In the meantime, Luna falls in love with a human, and the only hope to save his life is for him to meet Princess Snow Kaguya, who he has believed lives on the moon since he was very young. A great film for both fans and non-fans of Sailor Moon. In my opinion, in comparison to Sailor Moon R the Movie: The Promise of the Rose, this film is much more worth your time. A great addition to any collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVED this movie!","review":"This movie was soooo cute. I would recommend this to anyone who loves romance/comedies. It was very touching and I'm sure many people can relate to the way Luna was feeling. It was great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sailor Moon S Hearts In Ice Dub Review","review":"I bought the dubbed version and I haven't seen the subbed so I don't know how much they butchered it! Anyway I think it was the best of the two dubs. There were a few things wrong. One being, They could have at least left the original music! And the whole MINI MOON thing; NO WAY! I mean GET REAL! I didn't like pluto's voice and I didn't like Uranus' at first. But I didn't give it a one star for all of that garbage! I liked the story and it was a nice movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"This video was very well focoused on Sailor Moon. Although I have not yet seen the subtitled, I know so much about Japenese Sailor Moon. I still believe this movie is an excelent base for hardcore Sailor Moon fans AND new ones who don't know much. It has everything in it! It may be very different from the other versions, but it still can show viewers a great show!"},{"rating":"2","title":"sailor moon ok?","review":"Hey sailor moon fans!

What is their problem? I'm really discusted with the way they cut stuff out for no reason, oh, but wait, there IS a reason! \\"Too much violence!\\" The only cartoon with bad violence that pops in my head is South Park! Sailor Moon dos not have alot of 'violence'! ....Mini Moon? Let me kill them now! And they poor outer senshi! They screwed them up!From the dissapointed me, ~UsagiSenshi~"},{"rating":"2","title":"It was okay.","review":"It was great to see the Outer Senshi (outer scouts) but the plot line? i'm not saying i hated, i liked it very much but who wants to see a little pink-haired, red-eye freak swimming around in the air, NAKED? Not me but i have to say it was a better movie than SuperS but not as good as R. i still advise you to buy this movie (if you want too =P)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such an enchanting romance","review":"This was an excellent movie. I've gotta say I like the R movie better, but if you don't mind some drama and love, this movie is worth the money! It is definitely a fantastic romance movie, with deep, touching moments. It may get a bit sappy at times, but it's still great. And I was so glad Sailor Pluto, Neptune, and Uranus were in it! Their transformations look incredible! The scene where Luna transforms into a human is very revealing, but she looks really pretty as a girl. Just one thing. Why did Tuxedo Mask have to make such a STUPID showing! I mean it's stupid! Watch to find out! One more thing. The song they play during the credits, Moonlight Destiny (Moonlight Densetsu) is one of the most gorgeous love songs I've ever heard. I mean it's beautiful! Watch this movie now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sailor Moon S Movie gets 5 STARS","review":"I think this movie was very well done. The storyline follows through real well and the animation is spectacular. You see all of the inner and outer senshi (soldier in japanese) except Sailor Saturn.The story is about a mysterious comet approaching Earth during the girls last winter vacation in middle school. Luna is in love w/an astronamer named Kakeru and an ice queen is trying to freeze the Earth.This movie is a must for all Sailor Moon fans, esspecially those only limited to the North American version. This movie is meant for people ages 12 and up. Parents should think twice before showing this to a younger child. Otherwise, this is a lovely movie. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mini and the Outers(sounds like a rock group)","review":"Sailor Mini Moon? It sort of reminds me of Minnie Mouse. Maybe they could have called her Tiny Moon (no that sounds like Tiny Toon..sorry) OR they should have just kept calling her CHIBIMOON! JUST IMAGINE WHAT THEY'LL CALL CHIBI-CHIBI! They'll probably call her Mini-Mini or something! This movie is good if your a die-hard Sailor Moon fan and want to watch EVERY movie and episode!Why didn't they leave the ORIGINAL Outers transformation music? I could listen to that music for hours! I hope that DIC does a good job dubbing the next 2 seasons (but they had better leave the original music and stop calling chibimoon Mini Moon, unless they want us to die laughing^_-)!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good for an english version for kids.","review":"I own the subtitled one and I still think it's better. BUT, I fell in love with Sailor Moon with the DIC actors, and I still love them all. I love the corny lines and Terri Hawkes! I think it's funny with the Xena wails of the Snow Dancers and the Mini-Moon/Mini-me reference. Think about it. That was done on purpose. I like Sailor Neptune's voice, done by Barbara Redecki (Sailor Moon's mom and Queen Serenity in the series. Sailor Pluto's VA is still Sabrina Grdevich. But I can't figure out who Sailor Uranus' VA is, (I think its the Sarah Lafleur one). I don't really like it, she should be more masculine. The editing wasn't that bad actually. Someday my future kids and I will watch this together. :)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ummm....i love sailor moon...but...um...","review":"Ummm....some of the voices were really horrible, and the transformation music stunk. bad. but I am sure the Sub-titled is much better. the good thing about it, was the animation, and also the action, it was nice to see the scouts fighting for a change instead of using one attack and then giving it up to sailor Moon. it was also nice to discover the relationships between Luna and Serena, they are usually crabbing at eachother in the cartoon series. but it dragged on at some points...I would recommend buying the R movie before you buy this. This is better than the first SM movie though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The SUBTITLED version is great, people!!","review":"First of all, I was just wondering why Amazon puts the reviews for the dubbed version here... but anyway, you HAVE to buy this movie!! It's so touching and funny, NOTHING like the dub. The dub chops every great anime series to bits! (I wish there were a law prohibiting dubbing anime...)

It's better","review":"For the people who've seen both versions of the S Movie, you know the original is better. Luna the cat is sick & nearly gets hit by a car. A kind young man saves her life. she falls in love & is becoming troubled. The first time I saw the original was when I was in 3rd grade & it pulled me into the japanese cat's world & emotions. The English version isn't nearly as good as the real one. The voice actors & actresses are more emotional in the japanese version. In the dubbed version they change some lines to go with the persons mouth. The japanese version of the S movie will pull you into the telivision as fast as the sun's rays. As for the dubbed version, if your child is 9 or under, the dubbed works best. But for kids 10+ this is very nice, a great girl's movie. If you're 10+, get this. It's so very nice. It still up to now, leaves me in tears."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bishoujo Senshi Sailor Moon - Ruined","review":"Well, i watched it, and was very dissapointed. The essence of the original was totally lost. The outers were just awful....They're supposed to be cool. And what's with them being all ditzy and everything? That's not supposed to happen!

I own the Japanese versions of the series S, and all the movies. I KNOW what quality acting is. And this is far from it. It you even consider buying this movie, GET THE SUBTITLED VERSION. THE JAPANESE VOICE ACTORS ARE MUCH MORE EMOTIONAL, AND THEY CERTIANLY ACT BETTER. Arigato for listening. Ja ne!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"The movie dubbed was horrible! The outer senshi sound like freaks! Mini moon, pioneer must not do any reaserch on nemes, hillbillies refer to their kids as mini's! Like say someone's name is Joe, he would call his kid mini Joe!

I've alwayshated the dubbed Luna's voice, but hearing it come out of her human form mouth was almost too much. The only things that even partially redeem it are the fact they left Kakeru and Himeko's names the same, some of the attacks closer to the originals, and they pronounced 'uranus' correctly. Other than that it was a total loss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grrrrrrr >:-P","review":"I hate DiC for what they did to the REAL Sailormoon! The dub is horreble.

Luna's unrequited love broke my heart, but Sailor Moon finds a way to heal everything. I sat with 5 other adults in a dark room to watch this movie -- when the lights came on we were all crying. Sailor Moon harnesses the love and energy of an entire planet to save us all once again.

They totally ruined her voice. It's way to high and doesn't suit her at all. I am not pleased on how they dubbed Pluto's attack. Instead of whispering it she now yells it. The whole reason that attack was cool is now gone. The dub voice for Luna did not fit this movie at all. Especially when she was in her human form. It was a teenage body with a much older sounding voice. The original VA's where there for the inner senshi, so that was cool. I can understand Sailor Mini Moon. But don't change Sailor Moon's attacks, that was pretty lame.

He lives in an opulent San Francisco Hotel, yet is comfortable sleeping in the wild. Paladin has access to various city newspapers soon after they are printed. He travels by horse, stage, and train.

In the UK we probaly didn't get all five-six(?) series, so come on Paramount (or whoever owns you) let's have the remainder.

With case studies from recent history, she shows the simularities and the differences between male and female aggression. I don't mind admitting that some of the women in this book sent shivers up my spine!Perhaps the most telling proof of our culture's refusal to acknowledge female aggression is the startling and worrying refusal of law enforcement agencies, including the FBI, to acknowledge the existance of female serial killers. Perhaps the best example of this is Jack the Ripper, infamous throughout the world for murdering five women, and yet his contemporary Jane Toppan, cold blooded poisoner of almost 100 people, is consigned to a footnote in the history books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Used as Textbbok","review":"This was for a class I took but it was REALLY intersting I enjoyed it!

It relies heavily on percentages without giving the reader the raw numbers, and it selectively quotes primary sources without giving the reader entire passages that contradict its central tenet: OMG, we gave women a little power and they're taking over. Its greatest flaw, however is the way it fails to compare male crime rates and female crime rates. The stunning jump in crime percentages is possible only because the raw figures for women's crimes were so low to begin with. Rather than raising an alarm for this, a more productive approach would be to ask why women in fact so many fewer crimes than do men.In sum: typical backlash literature, trying to prove that women are just as bad as men are.

There are only a handful of Recovery Programs and Sober Livings that do true honest work, and sincerely care about helping their clients. It's not just a money game. Thats why 12 Step recovery programs are so widely successful, because they are generally built on helping people, no costs, no memberships, and no fees.As far as recovery programs go, I would suggest anyone visit [...].

His premise is correct that an addiction is the body and minds way of getting something that it needs.

I just could not put it down! (Hence it delayed me sending out the book).What captivated me the most was Prentiss' novel outlook on the cure for addictions. He seems to have nailed it on the head - look to the root cause of the problem - which is often multi-faceted and he addresses each one of the possible treatment aspects in a holistic way. Most other treatment programs blame alcoholism on genes and call it an incurable disease. That approach does not seem to help people.Prentiss' research and wisdom is a breath of fresh air.

But there is also a lot of California \\"holistic\\" babble about \\"Traditional Chinese Medicine, spirituality, yadda, yadda.... and an obvious and tedious campaign for their (very expensive) program at Passages.Way too much information about Pax's problem, you could skip Chapter 3 completlely, unless you really want to learn all the sordid details of one person's relapse after relapse.I believe that some people could benefit from SOME of the book, but if you expect what the title implies, you will be indeed disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the First Six Chapters","review":"Read the first six chapters.

The program promises to \\"cure\\" alcoholism but after you are cured they say you can never drink again- ever. So how is that a cure? To me a cure means you can drink responsibly like none alcoholics do.Abstinence is not a cure and is no different than what the 12 step programs promote only cheaper.

I was a heroin addict for 3 years, and have been sober now for 6 months, thanks to AA and an innovative treatment center in malibu called Walking Miracles ([...]), that I highly recommend. That being said, no treatment center can 'cure' you if you don't want to be cured.

The whole story is written in a fiction style manner, though referenced throughout the text, but this makes it easy for non scientists to get into the topic. The book still contains all the facts I want to know. The print is small but still readable.It seems that the authors ran on a very low budget because the layout is simply horrible. The second point of critique is that, because of the fiction style, I miss a bit of a longer introduction which explains in more detail what it's all about, instead it plunges directly into the story. I like that the story is not only about physics, technology, it's more about the players, the people, their mindset their morals. I would further like an update of the book, as it's now a bit dated.All in all I really can recommend the book as a read and as an eye-opener.

It conveys meaning to any who \\"have eyes to see\\" and illustrates the difficulty some have in seeing the message of simplicity and love of all and the joy in being. In simple symbolism of shadows, light, and image if we are willing to look we can see the illusions of the modern age and its empty quest for meaning in materialism.

Faulkner is brilliant, he captures the simple, pure humility of St.Francis. What ever happened to him after the movie? Donovan's music is outstanding and fits in perfectly with the simple and humble atmosphere permeating throughout the movie.

It was purchased in February 2002 & already borrowed 16 times.

But Francis' simplicity, innocence, humility & love for God's creatures came through beautifully. Plus, the cinematography is stunning, & made me homesick for Tuscany & Umbria.I've always loved St. Francis since my mom took me to the church named after him on 31st ST in New York City.It wouldn't hurt any of us to be more like the poor man of Assisi."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do You Get It?","review":"It's a classic.It's warm.For the spiritually minded, it has a simple message.I believe this movie is presented in a way that some just can't understand, especially if their job is to critique movies, as the \\"official\\" Amazon description on the page demonstrates.

This film being very correct in the history of the earlyCatholic Church does reach out to other faiths. The music beingvery much of the late 60's style does fit in the scenes. True that today we would use some of todays music if filmed today but would it fit as well. Watch the Dedication of the Chapel and tell me that with the music it doesn.t get you. Or earlier the building of the Chapel. This is a Classic and worth it.In this age of getting rid of the old we should remember thatnot all of our modern and recent remakes are as good as theOriginal.

Zeffirelli admits himself that he felt so thankful to God after he survived a terrible car accident that he became a born-again believer. Therefore, he wanted to thank God and church for the miracle that happened to him by doing a movie on a religious subject. Another example of how a lack of critical approach turns out a poor, tasteless and boring cinematographic creature. Scenes that are supposed to be uplifting and inspiring appear just outright stupid and grossly overdone with tear jerking and sugarcoated vulgarity and banality. No surprise that it is not a very well known Zeffirelli film - he would not become famous doing some dull and dumb productions like this. The soundtrack is horrendous. I would not recommend to those who are looking for artistic value rather than a sermon."},{"rating":"1","title":"St. Francis as a hippy?","review":"This is a real low budget Hair.

It's a shame that the film director didn't think the real story of this great saint's life was interesting enough to be told truthfully. (So it goes with Hollywood). If you do decide to see this film, we strongly recommend reading St. Francis' real-life biography so as not to be mislead! Caution: there are a couple of nudity scenes.St. Francis of Assisi is a true Prince and pillar of the Catholic Church. He was given the gift of the Stigmata and suffered Christ's wounds in his body for many years. (Not revealed in this movie). St. Francis had a very true and deep devotion to Our Lord present in the Blessed Sacrament. (Also not revealed). The truth is, his real-life story is beyond anything Hollywood would ever dare produce today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good story told well.","review":"This movie was recommended to me from a friend at church.

I was a senior in HS and went w/a girlfriend and thought that it was great. Fast forward 40 years: I came across this selection while browsing the list of free videos offered by AmazonPrime and was excited by the prospect of watching it again. Unfortunately, some things are best left as memories. On second viewing--with a pair of much older (and sober) eyes--the movie was a crushing disappointment. The acting was sappy, the script made me cringe, and even the music by Donovan was hard to stomach. While the actual story of St. Francis of Assisi is very engaging and inspirational, this movie did not begin to do it justice. Sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"movie stayed with me for years-","review":"I watched movie first in the Navy. I had a distinct feeling of an intense bond with St. Francis as well as Italy.

This movie perfectly captures the saying by a saint, \\"Oh let me feel the tears of a newly awakened saint...\\" This movie captures the very beginning of Francis' journey and does not show the hardships he faced as the years flew by. To be sure despite the hardships he did not regret his decision. According to legend he did go see the Sultan in Jerusalem to convert him. The story continues that the Sultan treated him well and said, \\"If all Christians were like you perhaps I would convert.\\" Then he let him go freely. This movie awakens my heart each time I see it and brings joy. Dated or not it is something Zefferelli should be immensely proud of.I suggest the reviewer from the Bronx should get out of the city for an afternoon and spend it in a field of poppies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tom, you're not alone","review":"I've tried so hard to like this film but, alas, even four times hasn't done the trick. I REALLY like St. Francis and his story is challenging and inspiring, but this film always makes me want to giggle and, in fact, put me off from studying the saint for years. St. Francis comes off like he's on drugs and everyone else looks like they get inebriated just looking at him. Francis was extreme, granted, but the light within him was from God, and I just didn't see that in this movie. And I have to agree that, although I usually like Donovan, the music here always struck me as silly. The facts of the story are probably accurate but I grew up in the '60s and this has always just looked like revisionist film making to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bother sun, Sister Moon DVD","review":"This DVD did not play.

I contacted them about it and they were very nice about explaining the return policy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible leftist simplification","review":"I know this movie was made in the 70s, right after the age of Aquarius presumably faded, but is that really an excuse to see everything through pink hippie glasses? St Francis was not a hippie, he was not a marxist ideologue, and he did not treat the leaders of his age with arrogant disdain. This is clearly the way that Zefirelli likes and approves, and wants others to emulate, even those dead a few hundred years. And it's easy if one can reinvent reality to suit one's desires. I wonder what it feels like to be rich, an opinion leader and jetset member, while heaping scorn and ridicule on the establishment of another era. But the danger of hypocrisy has never stopped those of his ilk, witness today's entertainment-media complex. I think the music is as insipid as the social criticism, but the cinematography is okay.I have been to Assisi, I have read about St. Francis, including his biography by Bonaventura.

Since the movie was such a letdown, I drove over to my Library and checked out the Relectant Saint The Life of Francis if Assisi. The book is far more informative and paints a more realistic picture of St Francis. It's strange how Hollywood can make such a mess out of something so beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where did the beauty go?","review":"I remember this as a wonderful beautiful and loving movie from the first time I saw it in 1973. ...The movie is slow, the acting is poor, the scenery is wonderful but the story was so poorly presented that it hurt. This movie is a real candidate for a remake. A wonderful story that could be presented so much more wonderfully than it was, even though in 1973 it seemed so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timely and Spiritual - Beautiful","review":"This movie is a rather hokey making of the story of St. Francis of Assisi. Having said that I must say I found it beautiful and moving beyond belief. However, I was so moved I bought 7 more copies and gave them to my family and only one person thought of the movie as did I. If you are not a person inclined to believe that people can connect to an unseen world for spiritual reasons, then you will not get anything out of this movie.

The \\"dreamy\\" Francesco is harmless, if all one wants is a film the kids can see, but one wonders just what point the film is an attempt to make.

I myself am a big foreign-rap fan, and if you would like to be, then grab a good foreign rap cd, and look into Doc Gyneco, et al...for god sakes he's done stuff with American Artists if you're that picky.

This book does not fit every single solitary situation or person that it is being used to help. There are many examples of severely extreme cases in this book that do not happen to every person or every type of Bipolar Disorder.When one reads this advice they have to assess the situation about their partner themselves. Ask their self, is this an example of my partner? There is plenty of wonderful advice in the book & I think they did a wonderful job putting together a single book about a disorder with so many varieties.The book stresses that it takes work to manage a relationship with somebody that has Bipolar Disorder. It does not claim to be the cure all for every situation.In general this book can be helpful if you are willing to read it and follow the advice relevant to the needs of your individual situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"in response to Georgie from LaJolla","review":"It's obvious you are not a compassionate person. Compassion starts from within. I have a son who is BiPolar and Diabetic. Our lives have been a constant give and take. We are talking illness not behavior issues like domestic violence or abuse. There is a difference. In relationships when both partners are healthy there is give and take. In relationships when there is illness there is also give and take but the person that is not ill has to couple that with compassion and understanding. Is it easy? No. Is it worth it? ABSOLUTELY...but only you can answer that question. Would you end a relationship because your loved one has developed cancer or heart disease? It saddens me to think that you are so selfish and that your psychiatrist agrees with you. This is not about co-dependence. It is about learning how to live with an illness, one that effects you and doing it with LOVE, COMPASSION and DIGNITY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting Book.","review":"I recently found out that I have bipolar disorder and this book is very helpful.

It seems like my husband's bipolar disorder holds me hostage with the mood swings and verbal abuse and now I am supposed to keep charts and diaries and ask him questions. Our lives revolve around what kind of mood he is in and after 14 years of it I feel ready to bail out. It just seems like the author expects the partner to be saint-like and totally wrapped up in their spouse's disorder. This might help a couple that is just at the beginning and if the person with the Bipolar disorder is willing to take meds and be involved with their treatment. Good luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful in identifying coping tips","review":"As an individual with bipolar, I would like others to understand me and help me stop myself when I am beginning to act inappropriately.This book identifies many tips that can help outsiders understand the disease and help them help the person that they love.I've asked my husband to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY this book, early","review":"I found this book quite by accident while looking for something to read at Borders. I was diagnosed as bipolar about a year ago. But in the previous two yearsfore diagnosis, I wrecked my marriage, my finances, was suicidal, and almost bankrupted my company. With medication, good support around me, i am doing much better. Most bipolar people do not think anything is wrong, only that people around them are distressed. My advantage (disadvantage) is that my Dad also developed the disease at midlife and so I know i have the same thing, and that all things i do or say do not always make sense.I honestly believe that having this book earlier in my condition and having a spouse who used the techniques described, would have saved my marriage and finances."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holding the bipolar spouse & partner responsible !!","review":"I have been married to a BP for almost 12 years and this book put many of my feelings into writing. I had a problem with the chapter on finances as I think it should have been made more clear that Bipolar II people generally do not have A problem with spending sprees and mania. Also, I think the book presented a lot of extreme cases, i.e. multiple hospitalizations and being unable to work and have sex. BUT I think with that aside, the book has some great practical ideas for management."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plenty of all-in one type books do the same thing","review":"I suffer from bipolar disorder and got this book for my fiance and for my parents. It was no more or less helpful than any of the other books out there. There wasn't any new information and unfortunately I don't think it helps those without the disorder to truly understand what is happening inside our minds. It just helps take care of \\"symptoms\\" instead of offering insights into understanding.

There are only a few pages on this topic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally wrong","review":"This book is the opposite of Codependent No More. It promotes and fosters codependent relationships and puts, as other reviewers below said, the responsibility of the BP person onto the partner who is well. Don't forget that BPD is not a license to do what you want. Personal responsibility, like taking prescriptions, visiting the doctor, and striving towards real balance, cannot be overloooked. Do you like to tiptoe on eggshells all the time and bend to someone else's issues , sacrificing your identity and life? That's what this book recommends. My analyst agrees. Dangerous and wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really helpful","review":"I found this book really helpful for me to better understand bipolar. It also gave positive, practical ways to help my partner and myself. It provided the facts about this illness and didn't gloss over the negative aspects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent tool","review":"I bought this book for my best friend/ex bf and I think its great. I was recently disgnosed as bp II and I think that this will help him understand more how to cope and not make the situation worse. It is so easy to make someone who is being irrational from bp so much worse. I take meds and go to therapy, but this is a great tool for the spouse/partner/friend of someone who is bp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patience is required to love someone with bp","review":"I read this book while dating a bipolar man. Like many others, I became frustrated with the suggestions being made to the non-bb partner. Basically, the suggestions were the non-bb partner should take on all the responsibilities in the relationship. In addition we are asked to stuff our frustrations and \\"never argue\\" with our bipolar spouse. We also \\"trigger\\" our bp spouses. After reading this book and dating a bp man for two years, I felt depressed. Prior to reading this book I was already his caretaker. After tolerating multiple issues/symptoms he attributed to being bp i later found out he was cheating(very common with bp). It was way too much for me to bear. In the end I decided I don't have the patience/understanding to be in a relationship with someone who is bipolar. I need a more balanced relationship/partnership.I do think this book will help non-bb spouses who are EXTREMELY patient, in love, and understanding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something lacking","review":"I was very excited for this book, I was really seeking out an all-encompasing book on the topic for my loved ones. After reading this book, not one of my loved ones will ever see this book, unless of course they seek it out and purchase it themselves. I think this book casts people with Bipolar in a very negative light. Instead of being useful and instilling hope, I found it to be depressing and very limiting. I feel you should give your loved ones a really good idea of what it means to be bipolar, but it should be cast in a positive light, not a negative one."},{"rating":"2","title":"FABULOUS book","review":"I have bipolar. My sister has bipolar. We both love this book. We have each marked up our books. My sister has given hers to my mom who is learning about her daughters' illness.

He says it how it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended","review":"This book is a must read for family or friends of anyone bipolar. It helps you to understand the disease, the symptoms, and triggers. The one thing I felt the book was lacking was \\"what works\\" ideas.

Thank God for the author."},{"rating":"2","title":"More help than any therapist!","review":"I am so grateful to find specific suggestions to help me deal with my partner's behavior and emotions.As a Buddhist, I know that \\"not arguing\\" is not co-dependence, and prevents unnecessary stress and hurt feelings for us both. It is a conscious, compassionate decision that sustains my own positive behavior & emotions, despite the stresses of his illness or any other negativity around me. I understand that some folks might feel this non-reaction is patronizing - but folks with BPD can be so self-centered! Partners have to refuse to be drawn into unnecessary drama.The \\"bi-polar free zone\\" suggestion really works at our house, particularly in the evening when everybody's tired. Creating the health cards is helping our 13-year-old daughter understand and deal with her father's behavior.The one thing I regret the book doesn't discuss is the positive effect of good nutrition, not just avoiding junk food and caffeine.May all our sufferings be eased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy 2 sizes up!!!","review":"I must admit that it's a very good product.

I had to buy a used VHS tape as there is no DVD available in US.William Holden and David Niven are terrific but the best in the cast is Maggie McNamara and I wish she had done more movie work. The dialogue is witty and the story is charming.With all the trash being put on DVD it is a shame that this little gem is not. It is also fairly hard to find the tape and it is not cheap but it is worth paying a higher price for.Again, the biggest asset of this movie is Maggie McNamara and you will not get to see her in anything else of this caliber."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncommonly Bland Performance of an Exciting Work","review":"I grew up in the 1960's with the Bernstein recording of the Ives Second. Although this recording with the Nashville Symphony claims to use a more authentic edition of the score, I was sorely dissapointed by the lackluster performance. Lowfat cottage cheese has more zest than this reading. Although the orchestra plays in tune and together (the best I can say for them), the conducter fails to communicate the quirky, irreverent fun of this delightful work. Flat!, very flat!! Superior even to the classic Bernstein recording is Michael Tilson-Thomas's wonderfully crisp and exciting reading. The Nashville Symphony recording may be scholarly, but that is exactly how it sounds--boringly academic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to Wallow In","review":"Most of Ives's orchestral music sounds like a great big sloppy mess, but it can be fun to wallow in from time to time. It is nice to have this music available at a budget price, and both performance and recording quality are truly excellent. Whether you are a long-time Ives fan or rather a music fan curious about this iconoclastic composer, this CD represents an excellent bargain."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"This recording just doesn't achieve the fullness and cohesive complexity of two works that are extremely challenging, although in completely different ways. Both performances sound rote and oddly passionless. The Nashville Symphony certainly gets an 'A' for effort, but it has a way to go before it can be accepted as one of the premier orchestras in the country. Look elsewhere for your recordings of Ives' 2nd and the Browning Overture."},{"rating":"1","title":"About as much fun as a...........","review":"... I tried to like it , I really did, but just can't.

Sorry I just can't make it through this film ...The musical numbers are suppose to be rock n'roll? HA HA HA! .. On a scale of 1 to 10 I give it -100!

But it was so dated, I couldn't wait 'till it was over. Also I think some of the scenes were added or changed. At least, that's the way I remembered it. The music was awful, especially the Kris Kristoferson music, if you could call it that. Most of the time he was too drunk to sing. And the tales of his down hill collapse was nothng short of boring. Barbra's songs were fair. Evergreen is still remembered as a nice ballad, and Barbra did sing one OK rock tune. But most of her stuff was also boring. The two stars instead on one is for the song Evergreen, not the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am so0o0o0o0o disappointed!!!","review":"I cannot believe they're releasing this DVD in 5 more years.

But it is a great movie.","review":"I am reading all these awful reviews for \\"A Star is Born\\" and I can't believe that one would go so far to deconstruct a movie this much. It wasn't meant to be a serious charecter analogy, it was meant to be a love story, end of story. The writer and director needed to develop the chearecters enough for the viewer to like and feel like they knew them. Personally, that movie did all of that. I loved every minute of it. If I wanted a complicated movie, this isn't one I would watch, but I watch the charecters because they are fun, likable, and while there are many movies that have done that over the years, this has remained my favorite because the actors were believable, the music was great and has stayed with me, soundtrack is key in any movie, and with Barbra's jumpsuit's. it is like slipping into a more pleasant past.

It's hard to tell if I loved it due to nostalgia, or because it's fun seeing the way she looked in the mid seventies. That voice, those clothes (from her closet due to budget reasons, right) and that afro. Jon Peters produced the movie and her hair...if you like Babs, you'll love revisiting this entertaining remake."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Star is Born for the 70's Generation!","review":"The Classic James Mason and Judy Garland version of \\"A Star Is Born will never be topped. And I don't believe that they tried to in 1976. A Star is Born in 1976 was an incredibly popular movie, and although it was shunned ,and skewered by the critics, it played in theatres for 6 months. So in the 21st Century you have to have the wisdom of watching this movie through a 1970's lens. I ENJOY watching a rather young Barbra Streisand rocking out on the Finale-Watch Closely Now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with the 1937 or 1954 versions","review":"Poor Barbra.The best part of the DVD is her comments; they are beyond over-the-top to show how her sense of reality is gone. Yes, she is literate when talking about design and lighting and casting; but from her tone you would think she made a film to challenge Ingmar Bergman.Instead this is a film so bad and so banal; she is basically playing herself--an unsympathetic woman who can sing her a** off. At no point do we know why she and Kris fall in love with each other. At no point does she seem at all sympathetic or even grateful for her success.And why doesn't Kris get to write and sing his own songs???"},{"rating":"1","title":"A really bad remake!","review":"I'm a big Barbra Streisand fan but this movie remains such a bad movie remake of the original two. It was a disappointment in 1976 and remains one today. The writing is truely awful. A movie to avoid--rent the 1954 version instead. That version remains one of the best movie musicals of all times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"Maybe this match-up worked in the seventies, or whenever this won best picture, but I found Kriss Krisofferson and Barbara Streisand to be bland and boring. The songs were horrendous and the storyline stilted. The dialogue was absolutely moronic. Maybe the film is saved in it's third act, but I wouldn't know because I stopped watching somewhere after the midpoint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kris makes this worth watching.","review":"Kris makes this movie worth watching. Just think how much better it would have been if Barbara hadn't hogged the film. It could have been a five with better direction and editing.

It is a classic love story, and the music is great (beyond Evergreen)! Since it was the mid 1970s, much of the theme includes women's evolving roles.

Next to \\"Heaven's Gate\\" (a minor classic that film snobs roll their eyes at), this film showcases Kristofferson's unique and understated acting skills. I'd love to see another remake of this film -- starring Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown (imagine the hip hop and r&B soundtrack!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Fine Wine","review":"This movie has not aged well at all. I never felt comfortable with Barbra Streisand in this role. After 20 years, its only worse. She should have never tried to portray a rising rock star. And that tight permed hair, yikes! Kristofferson would never have looked at her twice in real life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Streisand's climactic performance","review":"Kris Kristofferson must have found it so easy to basically play himself. Sure, this movie may seem quintessential of the 70's genre, but the fact that Streisand managed to finish it after firing her boyfriend and taking on the task herself is quite simply amazing. Oh yes, the concert scenes at the beginning could have been from just about any open-air stadium event, but the one at the end is the very best that any singer could aspire to achieve. I have watched the solo that Barbra performs, and am glued to the screen as she hits every note whilst shedding tears. How many artists - never mind so-called superstars - could have done this as well as she does. Buy it, even for just the last scene!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Babs, What's the Hold-Up????","review":"After many, many, many years of waiting patiently for this DVD release it still is a no show. It's not the greatest movie in the world, it didn't exactly break box office records, so why I am I still forced to watch a cracky-line filled 20 something year old copy of this musical? I don't want to speculate but it must have something to do with the music rights. Everyone get over it. The fans clammer for this one, Babs! Make us all happy. The movie itself is high camp, a guilty pleasure if it were. Kris Kristofferson is no actor, not really a good singer either, but HE IS AN EXCEPTIONAL songwriter. And, Babs, we LOVE the hair, and the end credit line MS. Streisand's wardrobe by... her closet! That's priceless. No film collection would be complete without this one.

I wanted to take a date to see \\"Rocky\\" in the theater, but she insisted on seeing this movie instead. Just like my date, this picture turned out to be a dud. Because it's loosely based on two previous releases of the same title (one starring Frederic March and Janet Gaynor; the other featuring Judy Garland and James Mason), the plot is uninspired and predictable. As for acting, both Streisand and Kristofferson should stay in the recording studio. The only redeeming feature of this film is Streisand's performance of her hit song \\"Evergreen\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Star Is Born","review":"I am extremely disappointed with the quality of this DVD and have it packed and ready to ship back until I saw that it had to be returned within 30 days. The movie continuously skips throughout. I had not had the opportunity to watch it until this past weekend but with the constant interruptions, I couldn't even finish watching the movie. I then watched The Way We Were and found that it too had interruptions though not as often as A Star Is Born. I didn't even bother to open The Way We Were (it's still in the original packaging) since I had such bad luck with the other two. I love all these movies and am wondering why they are of such poor quality. I've not ordered movies from Amazon before but if I'm not able to exchange them for better quality DVDs, this will be the last order I will place. Is there any way I can exchange?"},{"rating":"1","title":"It should have been called A Star Is Still-Born","review":"Or A Star Is Boring.Being a fan of the three previous versions (Before the Gaynor version ,there was a film called \\"What Price Hollywood\\" that contained many of the elements that we think of as A Star Is Born), as well as a fan of Striesand's I went to the film's premire in NYC back in 76 hoping to be blown away .Instead was just appalled at how uninvolving this turkey was.On the other hand I've enjoyed the soundtrack album over the years, so I tried to watch the film again recently.Lowered expectations didn't help.Now it's not only boring but dated as well.If they really wanted to update the story for the 70's Barbra should have played the Norman Maine role.I think this film ties with Dino DeLaurentis' big monkey movie as the worst remake ever.Even the musical remake of Lost Horizon looks good by comparison"},{"rating":"1","title":"My error","review":"I thought I was buying the album and not the download, I have tried in vain multiple times to reach someone , anyone to correct MY error.

Self-concious and strained, it's just difficult sitting through it all. Kristofferson comes off the best. Barbra, trying to bring to the screen a youthful/contemporary character, fails miserably.

This Film is by far the best of the Star is Born Films! Barbra Streisand is at her peak as both an Actress and Singer in this film! This is the Film in which I first fell in Love with Barbra, I was only 13 years old when I saw this Film and When I saw Barbra on Screen, I realised I was Witnessing the Greatest Entertainer in History! The DVD Extras are Great , with an Extra 16 minutes of Deleted Scenes, never before scene and the Wardrobe Test are a Rare Treat! What I love Most of all is the Commentary by Barbra!

Suarez makes a big deal about how he is a decorated officer, but no police officer worth their salt would put out books teaching citizens to be members of a tactical SWAT team.The author obviously isn't a police officer in good standing anymore because no commanding officer would permit someone to profit off the tactics presented here.If you are a gun-enthusiast, you would be better off buying something by John Farnam or Andy Stanford.

The rich diversity of the music and the intense live shows just make Primitive Reason one of the best out there, and definately the best in Portugal. As for Jess King, I don't think she was ever IN the band, she was only used as a guest musician. Plus, Primitive still sound amazing with her collaboration. The tracks with her were diferent than the usual PR style, but she was just that, a GUEST musician, not the true essence of Primitive Reason, she just added backup vocals to already amazing tracks.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Gruesome Enough for a 1st/2nd Grader","review":"One of the things fascinating to children, especially boys, is the potential of really loud booms that might just wipe out life as we know it on our planet. And killer asteroids certainly fall into this category. This book is almost certain to attract the attention of young boys in the first few grades.The book has a certain boy attracting sensationalism in its style but is scientifically correct and points out the current thinking of the majority of scientists as they consider the likelihood of impacts by killer asteroids. A fair amount of attention is paid to the Chicxulub Crater that is generally believed to have ended the age of the dinasaurs.The book points out that asteroid strikes like this one only occur about once every 50 to 100 million years. Still it's been 65 million years.All in all, a book that should please the scientifically or gruesome youngster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outlanders Tigers of Heaven","review":"Though this particular Outlanders novel was not as fast paste as others before, it was still one of the best stories. Even though this plot was nothing more than the sterotypical rescue/escape from captures plot, the novel was full of plot twists and revealations, while leaving so many questions unanswered.

As the Amazon reviewer noted, it is hard to tell the characters apart, and this adds confusion to the boredom and repulsion. The plot didn't capture me at all, and the so-called sensational action was very predictable and campy. I guess if you're into seeing a woman have sex with a dog, and other defilements, this might be of interest to you.I love all types of obscure stuff out of Japan, but this falls way short.

In one scene, Jojima, looking for clues, is talking to one of his underworld connections, who is busily trying to sexually excite a dog for a bestiality photo shoot. In another, Jojima grills a thug sporting a ludicrously large afro. As Miike gleefully undercuts taboos of polite society, a second theme rises to the fore - the discrimination of non-Japanese Asians living in Japan. At one point, the afro-ed thug argues that Ryuichi is a hero among all non-Japanese working in the underworld because he's willing to take all the societal alienation and estrangement and force it down the throats of the Japanese yakuza. Aside from the dizzying, genre-bending cinematic exploits, the film's sharp and intelligent dissecting of Japanese society makes Dead or Alive a truly fascinating, memorable film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great opening, crazy ending, cool middle!!","review":"DoA grabs you from the start with a real opening montage shot, edited slickly and stylishly, after 10 minutes it calms down andthe pace slows but what a great intro!this movie, has what I love about movies, great cool and down right nasty bad guys, over the top violence, gangsters,drug themes, nice looking leads and above all very very stlyishly made.You wont see this on TV, because its all in your face and pretty raw but all very entertaining stuff from Japan!Check out this DVD, recommend you experiece this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mojito Night is a success","review":"This set is just perfect! the size of the glasses and glass to prepare the mix...

The length of string was comparable to most of the other kites along the beach.When done, the whole kite and string fits right into a little bag, which is small enough to fit into a purse. The trick to getting it into the bag is to roll the kite tight around the kite string cylinder, put it in the bag and stuff the tail into the cylinder.

The write-ups of the restaurants and other food places are interspersed with brief articles on French lifestyle, cheeses, wines, customs, and other foodie points of interest that I wouldn't have thought to look up but which I found extremely interesting.

Bocelli has made-so successfully-Verdi sound absolutely BORING- this is a crime committed against music making.

If somebody talked in exactly the same tone and voice all the time, wouldn't he/she bore other people to death?

There are hundreds of wonderful, starving tenors who could use a tiny bit of this publicity. I have heard some of them passing the hat for half-pound coins in the Covent Garden marketplace. Charlotte Church is a novelty also, but she can sing. Zubin Mehta should be ashamed of himself for jumping on Mr. Bocelli's gravy train.

You hear better singing in most music schools, and it is a pity what passes for professional opera singing nowadays.As a Verdi tenor, I think he should stick to \\"con te partiro\\". At least in popular music we don't form expectations for the singing that he can't possibly begin to fullfill.Listen to Franco Corelli or Mario del Monaco in the same repertoire!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead beat without any Passion","review":"What a waste of my money. I just failed to get any passion out of this singer. It seemed to me that he's just memorized all the arias and recited them in public with his eyes closed, not one word or sentence missing but with no passion--a most important factor and element when singing arias--but forced enthusiam. Give us at least some passion, Bocelli, you just cannot singing these passionate songs without any deep feelings albeit facial expressions!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hubris Redux","review":"What a sad spectacle. In crossover material this performer has carved a niche for himself: he'll go down in cultural history as the vocalist who made it almost respectable to own Mario Lanza records. This tiny, unformed instrument is absolutely inadequate in this repertoire. The poorly-supported sound is geriatric and strangled, the tone gray, the phrasing amateurish at best. This is simply the worst excuse for Verdi singing ever committed to disc. Maybe a few of the apparently hypnotized fans of this poor, exploited man will buy a disc by a real singer, and hear these arias actually performed; apart from that hope, this is sad, depressing self-parody. My apologies to those sincere fans of Mr. Boccelli who will feel slighted by these unhappy words. This is just not professional quality at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, he is an opera singer","review":"It's troubling that anyone would describe this album by saying that Bocelli is no opera singer. That myth persists but it is belied by the performance on the Verdi CD. If you enjoy Verdi, you will enjoy Bocelli's interpretations. His vocal range is extraordinary, his high notes effortless and sustained. Again, you have to like Verdi, whose music is quite different from the Puccini arias and other plaintive and melodic selections Bocelli commonly chooses. His technical proficiency grows with each performance. It's hard to see how anyone could listen to this CD and not enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like this album, PLEASE try listening to other tenors","review":"When I was about 12 years old, my parents took me to see the Neil Simon film \\"Murder by Death.\\" Afterwards, my mother complained about what a bad actor Truman Capote was, and I can remember wondering to myself what she thought was so bad, since his acting seemed fine to me. However, when I watch the same movie today, it's perfectly obvious to me that Truman Capote's acting is bad. My point is that, even if you love Bocelli's singing and think that anyone who doesn't like it is a snob, you should try listening to other singers famous for their Verdi performances. For example, check out Placido Domingo or Giuseppe di Stefano or even Enrico Caruso. Don't listen with the goal of \\"proving\\" that Bocelli is just as good as they are; simply enjoy them. Allow your tastes to grow and mature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Verdi singer","review":"I believe Verdi's music requires a bigger voice that Bocelli's. He is a good pop singer and should keep singing pop."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't hear it","review":"I thought that if I heard Bocelli away from the Nightmare Woman, Sarah Brightman, I might hear something I liked. I did. Verdi. But not this performance. Face it: This man cannot sing opera. I'm sorry he's blind. I'm glad he is popularising classical music, but somebody should tall him he has no voice for this. There are hundreds of wonderful, starving tenors who could use a tiny bit of this publicity. I have heard some of them passing the hat for half-pound coins in the Covent Garden marketplace. Charlotte Church is a novelty also, but she can sing. Zubin Mehta should be ashamed of himself for jumping on Mr. Bocelli's gravy train. Mr. Bocelli should limit himself to the \\"Love Theme from the Godfather,\\" or to singing with Ms. Brightman, next to whom he sounds good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad versions of exquisite arias","review":"Andrea Bocelli possesses a beautiful, dark voice but, sorry to say this, I don't consider him a tenor. This collection is the clearest proof of that. For common listeners he is ideal but for any experienced opera listener he has a rather flat, ordinary voice. If one compares his singing in these arias with the versions that Bergonzi, Bjorling, Domingo, Carreras, Kraus have given us, he'll at once realise the difference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful music, beautiful voice","review":"My appreciation for the recordings of Andrea Bocelli continues to grow. This CD is a collection of some of the most beautiful arias written, sung with a lovely lyricism and attention to phrasing. So many critics of Bocelli accuse him of having a \\"small voice\\". I have found in my own performing experiences that a so-called \\"small voice\\" can be much more intimate, able to invest a performance with more subtle nuances that communicate more clearly to the audience the emotions of the piece. Who can say that the baroque lushness of a Bernini sculpture is more beautiful than the simpler lines of a Michelangelo? So too, the lush tones of Placido Domingo or Pavarotti are no more lovely than the purity of Bocelli's voice. Each has its own unique beauty that truly can co-exist in the opera world, if only the critics would let them. This recording is a fine sample of Verdi's works, performed brilliantly. Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The public speaks","review":"My wife turned me on to Sr. Bocelli the first time she'd ever heard him. She discovered him through his pop recordings. I'd always been an opera fan, so I was surprised that his cd appealed to me. And his voice and range have only improved. This is quite evident in his newest release, Verdi's arias. He sings each aria as it was written, and meant to be sung...with beauty and passion. He feels each word he sings, and conveys that feeling to the listener. From the quiet beauty of \\"Ah se, ben mio\\" to his rousing rendition of \\"Celest Aida\\". How many opera singers do you here drop an entire octave from one phrase to the next, as Sr. Bocelli does in \\"Io la vidi e il suo sorriso\\" with exquisite perfection? If you want to hear opera sung by someone who loves it as much as the person who composed it, this is the cd for you. Run, don't walk to your nearest record store and pick it up. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Light tenor for heavy arias","review":"This CD proves that Bocelli is better suited at singing light Italian songs than operatic arias. These Verdi arias are for real tenors like Corelli, Domingo and the Big P. Bocelli's pharasing and style is awful and is diction is worse, with that Tuscan accent that permeates all over. Zubin Metha directs this CD, propably to try to give Bocelli credibility as an operatic tenor, something that he sure is not. Bocelli should stick to his bread and butter, light melodic songs with an occasional top note. As for singing opera, forget about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there an Italian word for Chutzpah?","review":"It's a shame that many people will come away from this experience thinking that this is the way legitimate operatic tenors sound. I must say that my reaction was stunned disbelief that this was actually being offered to the public as a serious contender amongst the vast array of truly gifted Verdian interpreters. That roster is long, distinguished and well known (or so I thought), and nothing is to be gained by listing it here, except to say that Mr.Bocelli certainly does not belong in that august company. The painful truth is that this is a tiny, reedy and weepy-sounding instrument. That he can muster a certain amplified heft in his upper register doesn't come close to salvaging this vocal and artistic disaster. The fact that this will probably be a commercial success is depressing, but rest assured that Verdi will survive even this ignominy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Listening","review":"Bocelli doesn't have what I consider to be a top tenor voice. What he has is a personal flavor about his voice that shows he enjoys singing. With Verdi tunes it is hard to miss and he has selected some of the favorites. It keeps him in the \\"pop\\" circuit without taxing power or notes. For a stroll in the park with your trusty disk player, most enjoyable. For home listening by the fireplace and on a built-in player, he does not jead the list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!!","review":"The more that I listen to Andrea Bocelli, the more I think that he is the closest sounding tenor to the great, Enrico Caruso. Caruso had a powerful voice but made his voice flow throughout the songs smoothly. Andrea Bocelli has a similar style as Caruso. This particular CD is a great addition to my collection of Bocelli's music. He does justice to Verdi's Opera's. I have an Italian radio program. Out of the many opera singers I play on the show, which are Pavarotti, Caruso, Domingo, Franchi, Stefano, and others.......Andrea Bocelli is the most requested singer on the show!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Voice To Be Appreciated","review":"Although opera has never been my forte, through Andrea Bocelli I am becoming a convert. He is leading me to a higher level in music. Verdi is an example of my increasing appreciation for this new world. Oh, yes, I've heard many of the great voices of our time, but none, and I emphasize none, has ever left me wanting to hear more. No voice before Bocelli's has carried me to such unexplainable emotional heights. He is singing to me, not above me. There is heart here and a voice for the people. For those who want to experience a pleasant journey rather than an exhausting mental drag, Verdi, should be your choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERDI VICTORY by Andrea Bocelli","review":"Andrea Bocelli has scored another victorious cd with his valid voice. He has a quality no one else has been able to capture. His ability to go from sweetness to strength without much effort is amazing! After listening to many tenors singing these same opera arias, though some very good, I can say: at present, there is no greater lirico tenore than Andrea Bocelli."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bocelli's Verdi","review":"Bocelli loves Verdi's arias and it shows. He may not have the volume of a Corelli or Del Monaco, but he has elegant diction with words and a pure clarity of note that neither Corelli or Del Monaco possessed. His timbre is beautiful and the colour of his voice captivating. For those critical of Bocelli's efforts, I would offer that the likes of Maazel, Chung, Mehta. Corelli, and Celletti can't all be wrong: He has the goods, so get over it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"What a waste of money. I was not impressed with this. I got this CD and I wonder where is the talent that everyone has been raving about?!?! If you want to listen to great tenors; Domingo and Pavarotti are WAAAY better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talent or Marketing","review":"The marketing suits will tell you Bocelli is the greatest tenor ever - certainly he's sold more than the Three Tenors combined. If you love his story - overcoming a physical challenge - then that's great for you - I will politely disagree with the Marketing Department about the quality of his artistry. If you want a great story and a great voice, check out Thomas Quasthoff, the talented bass-baritone. He doesnt have anywhere near the number of marketing suits that Bocelli has AND he has an inspiring story of overcoming physical challenge. OR of course you could ignore the marketeers and try a new tack and just buy music by talented musicians regardless of their personal story (what a concept)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Verdi Has My Profound Sympathies","review":"If Verdi could hear this CD he would not only turn over in his grave, he would do triple pirouettes. Verdi was a great master of his Art and it takes a Singer who is a Master of his Art to interpret such greatness. That Singer is not Bocelli. He does not rise nor is he capable of rising to the occasion.Maybe in another 10 years if he studies he might make another attempt. In the meantime he should stick to his fluffy off-key duets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ordinary Monsters","review":"Started this book and read the first 3 chapters and stopped...it's poorly written, boring and the characters are not interesting at all; I didn't care about any of them, so the book is not worth reading, in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"So just how awful can this DVD set be?","review":"Very... so I picked this up for next-to-nothing, figuring, it's got to have _some_ redeeming features, gratuitous t&a... _something_.

It is hard to find in a retail or drug store. It does a fantastic job of cleaning the lenses with just a tiny amount of fluid. One bottle lasts me over a year. My gas perm lenses have been clean for as many as 7 years, and the only reason I got a new lens is because I lost it. When an eye doctor looks at a 7 year old contact lens and remarks that it is spotless, and this is the product you use, that pretty much says it all.

They always came in cheaper on Amazon than my local drug stores and the expiration dates were always far out.

The dialogue is believable, the nitty-gritty details good color, the characters are well-developed, the complications gripping yet easy to follow, and the violence is \\"you are there\\" and realistic. You even get into the heads of the villains so they're more than cardboard cut-outs.

Nicely written and beautifully illustrated, this work is gushing with well organized and correctly sequenced information.

If you can understand the spirit of Mahayana Buddhism, you can appreciate and learn from anything. It doesn't really matter if these monks are pretending wisdom or not, there are a lot of valuable teachings in this Kong Ans. Kong Ans are handed from time to time.If you practice meditation and open your wisdom (but one requirement is that you have to have enough faiths and blessings to meet the right teacher who will open your wisdom), you will understand that there's only doing and no thought.That's the spirit of Chan.Buddism is just a name because people like naming things. There is Buddhism and yet there isn't Buddhism. I can only say that I am learning how to live creating less offenses and more blessings around myself and I learn it because I met a great teacher. But we are not interested in calling ourselves Buddhists. We just pursue the ultimate happiness and change ourselves within."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond me, folks","review":"I have a fairly comprehensive Zen library (at least 100 volumes anyway) and bought this on the strength of the gushing reviews on the back cover. Big mistake. Zen koans obviously aren't supposed to \\"make sense\\" on the rational level or be susceptible to critical analysis in the same way you might analyze a poem, but the vast majority of these are simply dumb and unenlightening, followed by an equally dumb and unenlightening series of questions, followed by an equally dumb and unenlightening \\"commentary.\\" I frankly stopped reading after about 200 of these. \\"Huang Po asked Zen Master Fu Hong why Bodhidharma came from the West. Fu Hong replied, 'The stone cow sits in a green chair.' Question: What did Fu Hong mean by 'green chair'? Commentary: Fu Hong made a big mistake. Grow up, fat boy.\\" If that's your idea of the path to enlightenment, add this book to your library. If not, buy \\"Repo Man\\" and watch it eight times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unenlightenment","review":"After reading this book it was clear that koans are not a useful practice for pursuing the truth. The author lists numerous koans, and then gives some ludricrous explanations in the form of pretend wisdom based on his view of the doctrine of Buddhism. Daily life will give a Zen student all the koans needed to pursue ultimate truth. Studying koans only helps fill a student's head with more fake \\"knowledge\\".Zen is the ultimate psychology of self knowledge, and it's misleading to think that koan study helps achieve anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great SAT preparation text","review":"If an SAT book deserves to be apotheosized, this is the one. Vocabulary words are placed in Continuums to allow easy differentiation among small differences in shades or degrees of meaning. Plenty of fully explained verbal practice examples are provided. Mathematical formulas are presented along with examples of their appropriate use. No matter how well prepared the student may be, this book is bound to present new and additional information that may very well lead to significant SAT score enhancement. Much of the presented information and methods are available nowhere else. Considering the importance of the SAT score in determining college admission, the cost of this book is definitely worth improving one's chance of gaining entrance to an educational institution of excellence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book!","review":"If you worked up the motivation to date after fifty this book will surely discourage you.

Using my experience of the test, the essays, and my excellent teacher, I can successfully say that this book WILL distort your image of the real AP test. The one compliment, if any, I can give, is that the outlining and notes of each section was sufficient. Besides that, the practice tests were absolutely awful, and the sample grading the author provided was inaccurate. In one edition (I think it was 2nd), I scored about a 30/80 on the multiple choice section, and freaked out. The only \\"5\\" essay the author provided was absolutely stunning---so stunning that the only way someone could have written that was by totally cramming on that topic and that topic alone, then getting lucky on test day. I don't recommend this guide at all. And I certainly didn't get a 30/80 on the multiple choice on the real test, seeing as how I got a 5.

This is one of the most poorly organized books I have every studied. But in all fairness, I WAS subconsciously pinning it up against the Cliffsnotes and Princeton Review which are FAR more efficient to study. The essays that are presented are FAR TO DETAILED and not a good indication of the expectations of the College Board, especially with the few minutes given to write the essay (DBQ and free-response).

It's best feature is its sound quality. I have a $100 Grundig portable AM/FM and Shortwave radio. This radio's sound quality is better than the Grundig. The one negative trait is it does not have an Auto Gain Control; therefore at night when radio signals tend to be stronger, you would hear some hum on some local stations.

They must have gotten a different radio than I did. The radio doesn't lock onto stations at all, and it's very difficult to get it tuned in to even a strong station because the analog dial has very little play in it so you need to get the setting just perfect since even a hairs-breadth off means lots of static. The only thing worse than the reception was the sound quality which has a very tinny sound. The only reason I am giving it two stars is that it is so inexpensive you can't expect much.

I'm delighted to be able to say that the radio is far better than I expected. It's your basic AM/FM radio with a jack on the side for a mono earphone. Tuning is done via the old-style analog wheel, but there is an LED on the front which lights up when the signal strength is good. And good is an understatement. I easily listen to San Francisco stations here in Sacramento (90 miles) and the sound quality is just fine. Since the radio isn't digital, there are no station pre-sets or memory, but the tuning dial is pretty accurate, and I've not had any trouble finding my favorite stations. I'm going to purhase a couple of more of this radio. One will stay with the camping equipment, one in my emergency supplies, etc.I wasn't expecting much for a $10 radio.

Fit and finish is decent as well, and the belt clip is metal rather than plastic, which means you can actually use it without fear of it snapping off and smashing your radio on the floor.

They are just so simple to operate with only three controls; one for AM/FM, another for tuning and one for on/off volume. They are very sensitive and pick up a lot of stations and the batteries last ages.The only issue is that they do not decode FM stereo, but only mono, and the \\"headphone socket\\" is only wired for mono earpieces. If you try to use a stereo headphones or earphones you will only pick up sound in one ear. I got around this issue by buying my folks special voice recorder mono earphones. For no cost Sony could have easily wired in a stereo socket to address this issue. I rated the radio 3 stars for sound quality due to the mono/stereo issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Radio","review":"Needing a new pocket radio for the bathroom and to take with me when im working around the city.

It works as I expected. Reception is typical. It'll pull in any station I would expect it to and when I move around the stations come and go as will with any radio.One thing I didn't expect was that the headphone jack is mono. It only works in one ear. That's fine for me since all I listen to is talk radio with it and I like being able to hear from the other ear. Just thought I'd mention this in case it's a deal breaker for you.My only complaint is that the volume knob is super touchy and goes from zero to sixty in .03 seconds. I mean from no sound at all to blasting with the slightest touch.Other than that it really suits the purpose I bought it for and was worth the $10.If you want a beater at a beater price this is for you.

However, this radio cannot pick up any station I try to tune in to. I live in the New York metro area, and I use this radio primarily within 30 miles of the center of Manhattan, yet I cannot pick up 93.9FM clearly, and I cannot pick up 660AM, 820AM, or 880AM at all. That's basically all I ever listen to, so this radio is completely useless to me. I would be tempted to say that maybe the building I've been trying to use this radio in is somehow blocking the signal, but I know other people in this building who have no trouble tuning into some of these stations with other radios, so I highly doubt that that's the issue. In summary: unless you live within 5-10 miles of the transmitter for the stations you're interested in listening to, I wouldn't bother with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money!","review":"Very limited stations.

But when the ICF-S10MK2 arrived and I turned it on, I quickly discovered that its headphone jack sent a sound signal only into one ear of my Sony MDR-E818LP Fontopia Ear-Bud Headphones that work fine with many other devices.Of course, there was no mention in the ad that this would happen, so it's my fault for not guessing that, but most mono systems I've ever used at least put that single sound in both ears. The mono isn't the problem, it's that I don't hear that in both ears.

I can't imagine what the other reviewers were smoking.This radio has horrible adjacent channel isolation. One example is that I listen to a lot sports radio and the local station is 97.1 FM, but the Country Music station at 95.5 drowns it out. This happens with other stations too.I have a little larger Sony in a bathroom that gets much better reception. In fact the FM radio on my little 1\\"x2\\" Sansa Clip MP3 player (with no antenna) gets better reception than this thing.Hard to tune, but you would expect that.My guess is that most people who have reviewed this radio listen to one favorite station with a strong signal.Only saving grace here is that you won't be out much money.

Oh well.PROs: small size, and it's really cheap.

The problem mine has is that it goes from really low volume on the dial to really loud,(during the dial adjustments) there is no in between. You would think that being that it has a dial that would not occur, but it does. This was the sole reason for purchasing a new radio, my old one had a volume dial problem also, I thought it was just that make.

The big problem is that the dials turn too easily. Just the slightest brushing against my pocket causes either the volume to turn down or the station to be tuned away from. This often happens just from the movement of my limbs as I walk. The dials need more friction. It's extremely difficult to insert the radio into a pocket of any size without turning one of the two dials.I anticipated the 1-channel problem and bought an adapter from Radio Shack to divide the signal into two mono channels so I could hear my programs (mostly news) through both ears. But after a very short time I found that the slightest bump could cause the signal to cut out.

Though the Studebaker was looked \\"cheap\\" it worked just fine until i lost it!The Sony has a nice look & feel, and AM perfomance is acceptable, but the FM tuner only picks out 2-3 VERY STRONG signals. These signals seem to bleed across all the FM band. This may be a defective unit, but it's not worth the shipping to send it back.If you need a small, simple radio, buy it locally, before you leave the parking lot, pop in the batteries and test it. If it has problems, walk it back into the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing For My Use","review":"I collect AM radios and was anxious to add this cute Sony to my collection. Had I not wanted to actually USE it, it would be fine. I like to listen to my radios in bed late at night and I don't want to disturb my mate. I hold the radio right up to my ear and listen at the lowest possible volume. This radio has no low volume! Ths on/off switch/volume control goes from zero to 50 - nothing in between! No low volumes are available. It's a defective control but who in the world is going to seek a repair or even a refund on a $10 item. If listening at very low volumes and a nice smooth, linear control are important to you... SKIP this poorly made radio. It is not worthy of the Sony name."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tone, great reception, great value!","review":"This was another present for my wife whose previous bathroom radio finally died after some 15 years...and Mama's totally happy with it 'cause now she can choose from all kinds of stations, not just the three or four she'd been limited to for all those years.

The reception is very good and the sound quality is just great. My only complaint it that it was not designed very well to be walked around with in your pocket. The headphone jack is on the side instead of on the bottom or the top (which would be much more convenient for pocket use). The volume dial is quite sensitive, so often when I reach in my pocket to adjust its position, the volume shoots or down. Finally, the reception can be inconsistent when in my pocket, because the antennae is sensitive when jostled (which often occurs when walking). However, when I hold it in my hand and walk, the radio works great. Overall it is a great radio. I don't walk around with it much, so my complaints don't really affect me. But when the radio is stationary or held while walking, I have no complaints. Plus the price is perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"For this price?

It worked well enough for several months, but now I'm having some of the same issues as other consumers. I find myself having to stop what I'm doing and try to tune in the station I'm listening to, as it doesn't get a clear signal. Sometimes the sound cuts out altogether and I have to play with the volume control. When I'm wearing earbuds and if I'm not careful, it blasts into my ears. But when I listen to it without earbuds, the sound at top volume barely comes through. The most recent problem is with the antenna, which is very loose at the screw where it is attached. I tightened it and it seemed OK for a couple weeks, but now it has loosened again, and frankly, tightening it doesn't seem to make any difference. Maybe this is all I can expect considering what I paid for it, but I did figure it would be more durable."},{"rating":"2","title":"definitely good for the price","review":"got it in a very prompt manner. reception was good, and the volume was much louder than anticipated. overall, good radio for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for what it is.","review":"Sounds good, great selectivity and the batteries last a long time.

I had been looking for a good, old-fashioned am/fm radio that had good reception. I did not want digital..I did not want junk either. I just wanted a simple, good-quality, radio. It used to be that you could buy such a radio anywhere...but this is no longer the case. Most non-digital radios (if you can find them) are simply junk that have poor reception and sound. Most radios are digital, which is ok...but these tend to be fussy....you bump them and the station scan starts and one loses the station one was listening to. I wanted a radio I could put under my pillow and listen to late night talk radio shows....this one does the job...pulls in distant stations....is lightweight...simple to use...and is frugal with battery power (the battery lasts a long time!)

It is what is is and is quite good for that.It sounds great for a little radio. There is a speaker in the front and back. The antenna lifts out and up and folds back down.

It arrived today and I had 2 \\"AA\\" batteries ready to try it out. What a letdown!! I tried the AM band first and all I could hear was a strong static hash clear across the AM dial.. I tuned around and found six stations that were strong enough to punch through the hash. This pretty much eliminates searching for weak stations. To be fair, I considered that there may be some local interference and I drove out to the City park, away from all buildings and wires. It was the same situation, hash across the AM band. The FM is fine, stations come in clear and no static, seems to pick up a lot of FM stations. The little speaker does a good job for its size. I will keep this radio for emergencies, but that is it.

As soon as the radio arrived, I popped in the batteries, turned it on, switched it to AM and tried so very hard to listen to AM680. My heart dropped. Not only did this radio not pick up AM680, it didn't pick up *any* AM stations. Not one single AM station would come in. I tried and tried. A coworker tried.

Interior is well-padded, which does make it a little thick (approx. 1-1/4\\"), when compared to just carrying around the GPS, but does provide good protection.Only reason I did not give it 5 stars, is that I'd like a carry case to provide enough room for the attachments, as well as the GPS. This case is sized specifically for the GPS only. Will be perfect if you're just using around the area - if needing to take the GPS, mount, etc. with you on trips, this case is not large enough.That being said, I'd highly recommend this - great price point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product great price, quick service.","review":"I bought the Garmin that fits in this and this case.

I know it did not cost that much for actual shipping but I don't think I should have to pay to return an item that was sent to me incorrectly.By the way, I found a great set at a locally owned hardware store for only $7.

I would recommend this book to anyone, and ask only that you read it at least twice, because it has too much to absorb, to just read it once.

This movie is based on the true story of the relocation of these incredible horses at the end of the 2nd world war (1945. They were transported from Vienna to Austria so as to save them from the air raids. The copy of the movie is clear, the sound track is good, the human factor is excellent, the demonstrations of the abilites of these magnificent dancing horses are mesmerising. The insights into the breed are enlightening. This is one of Walt Disney's best factual movies and can appeal to both young and old alike.

If you are looking for Tommy Sands and Annette in this one, forget it cause it has an adult cast starring the Legendary Robert Taylor and the beautiful international star Lilli Palmer, who once was Mrs. Rex Harrison, and Eddie Albert and German star Curt Jurgens.. Although there are nazis and one battle scene at the end, this is not a bloody war film but it does have a fairly adult theme but there are plenty of beautiful horses.. And for sure some scenes in the Spanish Riding school in Vienna with these famous horses doing their dressage routine.. Not a kiddie film but all ages can enjoy it and filmed on location in Europe which was very rare for the Disney Studio at the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"White Stallions","review":"After seeing the White Stallions live, this is a great companion item.

The base of it is so large that it heats up really fast. The only thing that I think could be improved is the lever that opens the spout. What is there is a simple switch type of mechanism.

I got this for my wife to replace another brand that had become warped on the bottom. It whistles when the water is boiling. The spout opens by pushing down on the spout lever under the handle and closes by lifting on the spout lever. It's a small thing, but one of our favorite things about this tea kettle is that the spout will stay open or closed without having to hold the spout lever. That makes filling and pouring easier.The only very minor annoyance was that the tape holding the lid in place during shipping leaves a sticky residue that has to be removed with something like orange oil, \\"Goo-Gone\\" or some other mild solvent.The quality seems to be excellent as I have come to expect from Faberware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to reach inside to clean","review":"I had this product for 2 months before I ran into trouble.

It had been used only with filtered (reverse osmosis) water, but somehow the inside surfaces were lined with crud. I needed to clean the inside with some fine steel wool to remove the crud.

Unlike other people, I didn't have to go through 10 different kettles to find it! This is it! well priced, very clean and simple. No bells, but it sure does whistle...quite loud the longer you let it go, which is good because I seem to forget I turned it on sometimes.It fits perfectly over the gas burner and the handle never gets hot. Easy to fill and empty. The only thing I wondered is why you have to push the little lever down to pour your tea water instead of flipping it up. Only thing I found a little unnatural.One thing I was told helps to keep it looking nice is to take it off the stove top whenever we're cooking, so that it doesnt get splattered with food and grease."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 1/2 quart whistling tea kettle","review":"This tea kettle has such a large handle it is hard to get your finger on the trigger. Also the trigger is hard to push to open spout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Safety Issues","review":"I've never written a review of a product before, but this one poses a safety hazard. The first time that I used the kettle, the metal piece that causes the kettle to whistle flew off when I opened the spout. So the super-heated disc flies across the kitchen every time I use it. Quite simply, this kettle is a piece of junk. Don't risk burning your fingers or someone else's--buy a different kettle. This one's going into the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five stars","review":"I looked several places on line for a tea kettle. I ended up here at amazon. I have purchased several items from Amazon before. I read some of the reviews for this tea kettle. Majority of them was good. But I am very satisfied with this tea kettle. And I do believe that if you take care of it, it will last you a long time. Some people left negative comments about the whistle and it rusting out. But so far I haven't had any kind of problems. I don't use it all the time. But I am sure that it will last me a long time. I rate this tea kettle five stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing special","review":"I paid $19.99 for this kettle in July 2009. The first time it was used to boil water, the spring which comes as part of the whistle-lifting mechanism fell off. The whistle sound is neither soft nor loud. It's not much of a whistle (imagine a person with no teeth whistling). Pouring water into this thing isn't convenient. I expected better quality especially since the retail price is quite high.

I did read the reviews of the low whistle sound but decided to try it b/c it was such a cheap deal at the time...Well, needless to say that I burned the pot after the second use b/c I did not hear the whistle. My other teapot, a stainless steel... is really loud. But I liked the Tiburon for the heat resistant handle. Anyway, I did not get enough use out of it even at the bargain price.

This book starts with the chapter to set preferences in the software and then the interface in depth, later on this book will make you understand the main operators of combustion (Particles, paint, text, edit, composite) quite easily, though all the operators are not discussed in the book such as channels, RE vision plugins used for morphing. Gary Davis knows where u can make mistakes and he pointed out that quite well. I found it \\"easy to follow\\" kind of book. If anyone who has passed the intermediate level of combustion and advancing to higher level then they should not opt for this book, as this book lacks in profesional techniques kind of theory. Overall this book is designed for Beginers and people at intermediate level of the software. I recommened this book 100%."},{"rating":"2","title":"Schubert's unknown side","review":"I'm writing a review because if others hadn't done so and turned me on to this fine work, I would have missed out. Like me, you may find this Schubert opera to be a head-scratcher. I never heard of it, period. Too bad. The music is endearing and the performance is \\"Sundays in the Park/Putting It ALL Together\\" arty, clever. Some may find the staging odd, but in this particular situation, the folks in Zurich get high marks for making it a psychological portrait. And now, Jonas. Wow. I have two CDs of Jonas and none floored me like this performance. Not sure if it's the miking or what, but he sounds fantastic here. I have one recording of Bjorling that I covet like this because it too turned out so well. Ok, now, any flies in the ointment? Yes. Polgar has sounded better elsewhere. Also, occasionally the lighting is weird. You want perfect? You'll never own anything. This is darn good."},{"rating":"2","title":"What an incredible read!!!!!!!","review":"Ms. Wells has a thorough command of her universe. She skillfully threads the reader through the streets, alleys and catacombs of her world. The \\"people\\" in her story are diverse, very interesting and very fallible. The only regret I have is that I finished the book too damn fast! I wanted it to last longer but I couldn't put it down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Characterization","review":"Ms. Wells has a real gift for creating a large number of terribly likable, flawed, intelligent, witty characters. Even the minor \\"henchmen\\" have motivations and history, as well as singular personalities. Great attention to detail is also apparent, but not at the expense of the story, (a la \\"The Alienest\\")."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding World-building","review":"Martha Wells' novels have been uniformly excellent--imaginative, detailed, exciting, strange. This book might be described as a Sherlock Holmes novel, if Holmes were a ruthless criminal, used magic, was a member of the royal family, and had a sex life. Wells' skill in narrative, pacing, and snappy dialog make this an outstanding novel that most scifi and fantasy readers will want to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I was Hooked","review":"This was the first Martha Wells book I read, but I immediately became a fan of her writing. This story, set in a fictional yet very familiar setting, is a welcome change from the typical sword and sorcery fantasy fare. Ms. Wells' writing is rich in atmosphere and detail while moving along at breakneck speed. This was one of those books that hooked me into reading far later into the night than I could afford. Months later, the characters and settings stay with me as thought I had just fininshed the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my perennial favorites","review":"I have a list of book s that I like to reread and I truly enjoy them when I do. Just to name a few:Talion: Revenant by Michael a. StackpoleNaked Came the Sasquatch by John BostonThe Wheel of Time Series by Robert Jordan and Brandon SandersonAny thing by Dick FrancisThe Dresden Files by Jim ButcherStories about Clan Korval By Lee & Millerand The Death of the Necromancer by Martha Wells.I have bought multiple copies of all of these over the years and I will continue to do so as people \\"borrow\\" them or they wear out.The one thing in common that all of those listed above is that the author(s) all Show the reader as opposed to Telling the reader. Read this for yourself and make up your own mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best!","review":"I found this book at the recommendations amazon showed me and bought it immediately. I never regreted it for a second! This book is wonderful! Death of the Necromancer is placed in a city in which all comes toghteher. Light and darkness, virtue and decadence, love and hatred. The main charakter, Nicholas Valiarde, seems to be all these things. On the onw hand a minor noble, on the other the underworld leader Donatien. But of course he is not the only fascinating person in this book (and he IS fascinating!). This was the first thing I read, where I liked the policeman.I think I don't want to give too much of the book away, after all, it lives from the unexpected, but it tells more than just a story, as so many other books, it allows deep insight in the charakters of all the people in it. This is, what in my opinion makes any book good. This one I would even call great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good.","review":"This book was good reading. I didn't realize that it was a sequel while I was reading it; it's not one of those where you have a hard time following the story unless you've read everything that came before. I'm going to pick up her other books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tons o Fun!!!","review":"I loved reading this book - a great combination of fantasy, mystery, history, romance - i loved the entire cast of characters. I love reading \\"team\\" books, and this team, led by Nicholas Valiarde, is one of the best. Fantays is my favorite genre, and this was a great and unique spin on that genre. I'm going to check out the rest of Martha Wells' books, and i would love to read any further exploits that Nick and his merry men and women get themselves into!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting thriller in a belle-epoque city","review":"Completely different from the author's previous \\"City of Bones,\\" but even more exciting as she interpolates magic and mayhem into a belle-epoque European-style city. Since the occult was a popular fad in our real world at that time, it's not hard to make the leap to the fictional world of Ile-Rien. The references to a university city much like Oxford and other parts of that world that bring to mind visions of India or the Arabia of the 1001 Nights with all their mystery and intrigue added to the complete naturalism of the fictional world of this book. I used as a bookmark a postcard of Caillebotte's \\"Place de l'Europe on a Rainy Day\\" which matched the atmosphere perfectly. The combination of magic and technology was fascinating, and for a reader not a big fan of sorcerers and elves made the story all the more credible. Fast paced action all the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"What great book!","review":"If your like me when reading a book, the first few pages have to grab your attention in order to finish the book.THIS BOOK WILL GRAB YOU ON THE FIRST PAGE!!!It is a must read for any one who loves to read!I can see this book becoming a movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Night Prophecies","review":"I couldn't and didn't put this one down until the end.And the end!

I used to work with him and were friends. I am currently only on page 35 but form what I have read it has been a very good book. That is why I have given the book 4 stars, because Im not very far into it. The opening will grab you right off the bat, and then the story begins.

I would recommend this to anyone from a trained mechanic to a novice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not to me","review":"I had some major problems with it. I love the X-Files and I had huge expectations for this game. I was also excited that you could finish the game with both Mulder and Scully probably adding to the game's replay value. The story also appeared to be loyal to the show. I add an extra star only for the game's desire to be entertaining at most.The worst problem was the cheap graphics. You only have to compare it to any Silent Hill games to know how bad the graphics of X-Files were. Most of the times, I tolerate poor graphics if the game is intriguing enough, but that never happened. Frankly, I couldn't believe the zombie on wheels. I can't believe that was the best they could come up with after a long list of bizarre monsters filed up after so many X-Files seasons. This wasn't the X-Files. This was just another videogame.But I had to pass the first stage at least. Couldn't give up so easily. What I saw terrified me. I had never witnessed a Playstation game with Nintendo graphics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now if they'd bring back the show it be perfect","review":"Fabulous that they were able to get the stars to agree to do the voices for the Game! This game isn't perfect, but for me it was just what I was looking for in a new game. It had a little Resident Evil(Zombies), Silent Hill (Eerie Surroundings) and then the X-files storyline! After I got used to the controls and what the game was about I was hooked. The main complaint for me was it wasn't longer! If they do a sequel I will have it on preorder as soon as I hear about it.It has the bit of mystery of the X-files but is basically a combo game with shooting/puzzles and even a few Autopsy's thrown in. They really have a place to go with this game if they choose to.I know that doesn't answer all your questions about the game, but it's worth trying. If you don't want to buy it check it out at your rental store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great way to still have fun with Mulder and Scully!","review":"I am not your usual \\"gamer\\", but was sooooo glad I had previously bought my son a Playstation 2 so that I could get and enjoy this game! Now that the series is over, and we are all waiting for another movie, there is a great way to still enjoy our favorite FBI agents! The game was difficult in some spots for me (really makes you think about the clues), but even someone like me can maneuver through and get through the game. Having the game played through Mulder's point if view and then again through Scully's point of view was a neat addition to the fun. THIS GAME IS A MUST-HAVE FOR ANY SERIOUS X-PHILE!!!! I would not hesitate to recommend it to any player of any age!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I has teh 1337 karate moves! w00t","review":"I think it's a fun game.. xD In my opinion the graphics are very good and I think it's pretty neat that you can choose between Mulder and Scully as being your main character of the story. Overall it's very creative, though the first episode kinda reminds me of parasite eve or something (*cough* I've never played that game but I remember seeing trailers for it way back when). Yeah but still.. It's fun kicking zombie-butt..! Literally sometimes. ^^;I especially recommend this game for all ze wonderful X-Philes out there who happen to own a PS2. =D It's fuuuuun..."},{"rating":"2","title":"x files resist or serve is better than ever!","review":"This game is the best game I have played. In fact it should be the best game on ps2. of course this is my opinion. Some of the weapons and stuff you get on this game are, a pistol, shotgun, pills for healing life, a flashlight,and some other equipment. If you are a resident evil type fan, then this is the game for you. I would say that everything in this game is great. Especially when the monsters pop out of nowhere. This game is usually hard unlles you knew what was going to happen. This game is tight and cool.(very) if you play this game have a great time. I know I did when I first started. I played from 12:00am to 3:00pm because it was so fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY FUN GAME!","review":"This game is a must for x-files fans!The great thing about this game is that you can choose to play as Mulder or Scully, there are 3 different episodes to play (must unlock them, though), and the music and graphics are excellent!There are many different options and ways to beat the game (depending on whether you are playing as Mulder or Scully) and can be played over and over again!The bad things about this game are the view (when you are walking, it is hard to change views), the constant darkness (this game is best played in a dark room or at night, the glare from light or sun can get quite annoying, and your character must constantly hold a flashlight), and the fact that you cannot run when your character is holding a gun and flashlight at the same time!But other than that, this game is very fun and has a number of outcomes! There are some very funny Mulder/Scully moments that fans will appreciate!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool....for x-files fans...","review":"first and formost, this game is great, but only if you enjoy survival horror and the x-files. Nice controls, cool story and the dark, moody graphics are just icing on the cake. However, if for some alien reason you don't like the x-files, you should probably pass on the game, not because it is bad, but because there are simply better games in the genre. For x-files fans, (like my self)I would recomend that you at least rent the game, but for the rest of you, try the Resident Evil remake for Game Cube, or Silent Hill 2 for PS2, or even (If you have A LOT of patcience) Siren for PS2. For those of you unfortunate enough to be fooled into buying an x-box, sorry, but there are no good survival horror titles for this console"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fresh start on Resident Evil type genres","review":"Resist or Serve may be probably one of the best first person horror games i've played since the great 1998 edition of Resident Evil of the Playstation. By far, the gameplay is the same as other vivendi developed horror games, graphics look great but not quite polished, and the story mode is worth playing. If you like horror games, which is actually based on the hit show 'X-Files', then consider buying this. It's ok, not bad, still may be the same like other games but it has a unique story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best X-Files Game","review":"This was an excellant game. Being able both Mulder and Scully was a great idea. It's cool to see the other characters from the show and how it went back to an espisode from the X-FIles. Even though it took me a while to play it, it well worth it. It was challenging and fun. I highly recommend this game to anyone who loves the X-FIles. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game!","review":"I enjoy the game!!,,is scary, and really look like the real XFiles...The only less favorite thing is the eyes of the characters, they are kind of spooky, anything else is very good done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mulder & Scully go to silent hill!","review":"I will say this is a great game. It's basicly taking the silent hill formula and putting Mulder, Scully & crew in it. A bit unrealistic for the x files, but get over it and just enjoy the game"},{"rating":"2","title":"X-Files: Resist or Serve","review":"I'm a fan of X-Files. I bought PS2 X-Files game. It is fun.

My wife, who is not techy at all, set it up in 5 minutes with no instructions and it worked perfectly the first time. The ease of switching between devices without having to climb over the TV every time is well worth the cost. It also doesn't require any power, which is an added bonus. No complaints."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sent it back","review":"It didn't even come with a power cord to plug it in and although they advertised it would work with all televisions, it did not work with ours.

I am a very satisfied customer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like it should, and made my life easier","review":"My boyfriend and I have about 6 game systems between us, and until we bought this they were all ignored except the xbox, which was always plugged in. Since we bought this, the other systems have been played again. The signal is good and it works exactly like you'd expect. I only gave it 4 stars because it didn't come with the cable that goes from the box to the tv, and I think it should. I would buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeping Up With The Old Technology","review":"This unit works great. I use it to switch my turntable, VHS player, cassette tape deck and laserdisk player into my new HDTV A/V system.

I recommend this switch as value for the cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"It works well - solid switch","review":"I bought this \\"Component Selector\\" to connect all my existing peripherals to a new TV that only had one Composite input. It has a solid metal case and solid feeling push buttons. The connectors are clearly labeled and only took a few minutes to install. (I had run all the cables in advance.) There is no degradation of the signal. I realize composite connections are \\"old school\\" but new TVs are being manufactured with emphases on HDMI connections and I don't have a single peripheral that supports HDMI.

What do you suggest I should say?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Teakettle problems","review":"This teakettle arrived promptly and the return was handled appropriately so I have no problem with the vendor. However when we opened the original packaging, it had some problems. There was black stuff around the seams and even after cleaning it several times it smelled of something chemical. Also, the mechanism that worked the spout cover was awkward and didn't work very well. So it was a Farberware issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great lever for small hands","review":"I tried some others with the spout lever on the handle but with my small hands it was awkward and I felt unstable pouring the hot water. This design is perfect. The style looks great on my ceramic cooktop. And you can't beat the price. The whistle is loud enough to hear if I'm upstairs, but not piercing like my old one was."},{"rating":"2","title":"good but not great","review":"A well constructed stainless steel classic. I am not very happy with the handle and trigger (which opens the spout) design. As you're tilting the tea kettle to pour, it makes for an unnatural wrist twisting experience with steam rising into your hand. You won't get burnt, but it ain't fun either. I like the designs with copper or aluminum clad bottoms for quick heating better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"After a few weeks the mechanism on the spout of the kettle fell off. The kettle no longer whistles. I am going to buy anelectric tea pot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feels cheap... and steam hits my fingers.","review":"This is a product that I've slowly learned to hate. When I first started using it, I was a bit concerned about the weird sputtering noises and the way the metal creaks. It seems like the metal is just really thin and I keep thinking it's going to burn through or something. That might be crazy, but I like when a product has a solid feel to it. I could live with that, though. You get what you pay for right? What I can't live with is the spout positioning. It's just too short, in relation to where the trigger to raise the cap is. Every time the water comes to a boil and I pull the trigger and tip the pot, the steam goes straight to my fingers and hand. Ever seen that movie Office Space? Think of the scene with the static electricity on the door knob. I need to find a new kettle with a longer spout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Whistle","review":"I got this tea kettle because I was looking for one with a strong whistle so I can hear it from my office two rooms away from the kitchen. If I'm standing in my office feet away from the boiling pot, I am barely able to hear the whistle. I'm not sure if mine was defective or just the product had a poor whistle. Either way, I returned it shortly after buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"You gotta have strong fingers for this kettle","review":"I don't know if I'll buy a tea kettle again online. I'm new to Amazon and probably should've read the reviews first. I just read a few about \\"black goo\\"!? Uh oh, I didn't notice any black goo or particles. I did however notice that the little finger lever on the handle you need to pull to open the lid to pour your hot water is very hard to operate and you must have very strong fingers to open this thing. I have a hand like that of a young kid though and it is hard and annoying for me open this one. I am too annoyed to send it back and start over again. I make tea everyday multiple times a day and this is not ideal. Poops product. Other than that it's pretty good....but if you can't open it that good, that's really the whole thing! I'm wondering how long this lever is going to last, it barely opens for me now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Styling trumps ergonomics","review":"It does what it's supposed to do - it boils water, and it has a loud whistle. And Amazon's price is quite reasonable.But the handle isn't quite up to snuff. First, it gets hot, hot enough that I need a hotpad when it's been filled to the fill line. The finger latch also gets hot, and it's very awkward to operate with a hotpad.Second, when I'm pouring boiling water, holding the spout cover open with the finger latch, as I tip the kettle forward to pour out more and more water, the position of the spout moves UNDER my hand, so that hot steam rises and hits my hand. I'd move my hand further back on the handle, out of the way of the steam, but then I wouldn't be able to reach the finger latch to hold the spout open.Don't the people who design these things ever USE them???I'd return this, but, sad to say, its ergonomics aren't any worse than other, more expensive tea kettles that I've tried."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bargain kettle for smooth-tops","review":"Unlike many similar but more expensive kettles, the rolled seam at the bottom of the kettle does _not_ hold the bottom up off a smooth-top range. It heats water quickly, handle stays cool, and is the right size for a full pot of tea. There may be better kettles for gas ranges, which apparently can heat the handle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good little teapot","review":"Its a nice little teapot, nice stainless coating.

It makes a funny noise the moment I turn on the heat to boil water and it ROARS and sputters water if I allow it to whistle, no matter how much water I put in it. There is a lip around the bottom of the kettle that collects black 'crud' and has to be cleaned on a regular basis. I would not recommend this kettle even though it has a nice appearance."},{"rating":"1","title":"diappointed","review":"Handle is hot to touch. You would need towel to hold handle.

Check it out and don't waste your money on this rubbish.Happy shopping.JB"},{"rating":"1","title":"complete waste of money","review":"Oh my God, it took less than 4 months before the inside was all rusty and our tea water turns all red. rust keeps coming back despite cleaning, no matter what you use. And the return window conveniently expires in one month. I've had kettles last at least 2 years. Cheap isn't always cheap, I wish I'd bought something of better quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product for a Good Price","review":"The Tea Kettle works great. Looks nice and is easy to handle. The one small thing i would change is that the lever to lift the pour cap does not stay up on its own. you have to hold the lever down. Not a big deal, but other than that, all is great. And the price is not too bad either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shall I put the kettle on?","review":"My husband really wanted a whistling tea kettle one year and this was the best priced one I came across, to make things even better the stainless steel design matches our other kitchen items.Its lightweight but seems built well, the handle doesn't get hot, like the little handle that you push to open the lid in the front to pour the water. The one bad thing about it is that after a couple of years of using it now and it constantly sitting on the stove its not shiny anymore, its got more of a \\"brushed\\" stainless look, still works fine so I guess that's a minor detail. My husband and guests still use it fairly often so its holding up well.Think you'd be pleased with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black particles","review":"I have washed this several times with soap and boiled water several times. There are several black particles that have been washed out which should not have been there in the first place. If I wipe the interior with a napkin in certain places, I get a black residue. I am afraid of it never being completely clean so there is no reason to risk one's health on a crappy or defective product. This one is going back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"This kettle looks very nice in my kitchen, however upon using it for the first time I burned my hand as the handle gets extremely hot. I now use a towel when pouring hot water for my tea, but I am incredibly unimpressed with this kettle and will soon buy another one that does not need a towel or pot holder when handling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"Fast heating, easy to keep clean.

I purchased the first one at a discount store. When it rusted, I decided not to shop there anymore.

It's my absolute favorite self help book. Its an easy read and impossible to not provide any reader some true insights. By any measure its great. That is when compared to most psych books its better and cheaper. When compared to therapy, at a cost of five minutes with a shrink this will give you more knowledge than five years of psych-talk. And even when compared with the cost of Zoloft its a steal. No kidding, its the only thing costing under $50.00 that ever even began to change my life. I love this book! If you can't afford it get it from the library...or get a job and buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleaa","review":"Wasn't at all what I expected . . .

He has to save the maiden who will be sacrificed by the evil king, of course.This beautifully unlikely premise, unfortunately, is undercut by the somewhat slow pacing of the film.

Russia is a destination for many. So, any information about adopting from Russia and therefore its orphanage system, might be helpful and useful for those considering the country. However, this is not the book to offer any insight or educated, integrated, defensibly researched understanding of what you will be facing. Or even of what the book purports to explain. Unfortunately, this is a text compiled at about a B- grade level of a sophomore level research paper at a third tier university. Written by a diplomat's wife in collaboration with two others, I can almost see the disjointed quotes, on the index cards. Certainly not the \\"pioneering work on child abandonment\\" it purports to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought at thrift store and still a waste of money","review":"I picked this up because it's set in a ghost town, and I thought I would enjoy that setting. The setting is the only enjoyable thing about the book. It is the most poorly written published fiction--poorly written in every aspect--that I have read in years. Its worst flaw is that it continually violates what is possibly the first rule of fiction: show, don't tell. But there's more: the characters are cardboard, the dialogue is unbelievable, the descriptions are pedestrian.To top it off--though this is NOT the writer's fault--the cover depicts a ghost town in the desert, and the setting is actually in the California Gold Rush country."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect for boys","review":"My son loved this book when he was little (he is now 20!), and I am sad to see that it is not available new, as I would have loved to give it as a gift this Christmas.

The art work is nice and exciting but the text is awful. The kids in the book often hit the \\"smart\\" kid for his comments. I had to edit the text on the fly as my kids could get a little worked-up about hitting each other. Also, the environmental message is pretty shallow and doesn't really make much sense. They are on a river with sea turtles, dolphins and crocodiles. Huh?In a world of so many wonderful kids books, skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Richard Swaim","review":"This audio book really got to me. It started out slow, with Nick, the main character trying to sort out how to deal with the death of his father in a car crash, and hearing a variety of \\"voices,\\"as he seems to wander in and out of reality. I found myself wondering where this strange beginning was going, but very quickly I was caught up in Nick's predicament. Several things take place later in the story that will break your heart. It is masterfully told by an outstanding narrator and I found myself wiping tears from my eyes on several occassions, as the story came to a close. Although the two-tape audio book is an abridgement, it is very powerful. I also like the way animals are strangely \\"drawn\\" to Nick.

As someone who has suffered through hardships of their own I know what a difficult task this can be yet Shawn pulls it off effortlessly and with grace.

You simply gotta admire a guy with a sense of humor staring constantly into the face of death...and making you laugh along with him.

Is it as well made as the old ones from way back...well no it's not. Metal is a bit thinner, especially the basket and stem, but by today's standards it pretty well made. My only real issue with it and why it only got four stars is the plastic percolator/viewing cap. For such a nice pot I would think it would have a glass cap.

We were happy with it for two years, which is why I give it two stars instead of one. Still, I would once have expected a near-lifetime of use from a Farberware product.The handle is not bolted or screwed to the body in any way, although there is a bogus bolt there to persuade you otherwise. The handle is held on with four tiny spot-welds, which started to wiggle loose after a few months. One morning, the handle just gave way (in a luckily non-tragic way) when the last couple of welds let loose.The plastic bubble on top, that other people have had trouble with, was fine for the useable lifespan (two years).Now, while we're shopping for a replacement, my wife suits up in asbestos pajamas to pour scalding coffee from a handleless pot.

She's also, as one would expect, a little old-fashioned. She won't try anything new. So, when she finally needed to replace her coffee pot, she asked me to take her to the store to get one. But you can't find these coffee pots anywhere! I explained to her about the drip coffee-makers we all use \\"now-a-days\\". But she refused to try one & wouldn't even consider an electric percolater. Said she had received one as a gift, but it's still in a box in the basement. So I went to amazon, where I find just about everything I can't find anywhere else, & got her this coffeepot. My Grandma'a pretty fussy so I wasn't sure this coffeepot would pass the test....but she loves it! So this product has my Grandma's stamp of approval on it! That's really saying something!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Farberware Perculator","review":"Everything about it is good . . . EXCEPT - - - The clear plastic cap is JUNK. It should be glass and is already stripped. We have had to improvise by using aluminum foil to hold it in place.Why would anyone make a product out of Stainless Steel and use a JUNKY plastice part for a critical item ?It makes excellent coffee but our friends thinks its CHEAP JUNK when they see the foil inserted in the top.If the top piece were glass, we'd rate it 5-Star"},{"rating":"1","title":"Perked Off","review":"There's only one thing I like about this coffee pot, the lid stays on nice and snug and coffee doesn't leak all over my burner/camp stove like my previous two pots did. Three reasons I don't like it: (1) I can barely read the water measurement marks on the inside of the pot and it is therefore very hard to fill, (2) there are lips on the inside top and bottom of the pot and after washing it, it never completely dries out and a few grounds are always left stuck inside the bottom lip, and (3) it has a plastic cap on top and I would prefer glass."},{"rating":"2","title":"Granddad Bentley's Coffee Pot","review":"I noticed recently that my coffee just wasn't that good. Oh, it was passable, but not great. Then I remembered that my granddad make his wonderful coffee in a metal coffee pot on top of the stove. When I spent the night at his house in Paris, Texas, that fantastic coffee aroma would waft down the hall and straight up my nostrils, just like in a cartoon. I wanted to duplicate this experience so I purchased this coffee percolator. Sure enough, it lived up to my expectations and makes a great cup of coffee. It is a little on the strong side but I like it that way. In my opinion, coffee brewed this way is much superior to the wimpy drip coffee maker I had before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like old times","review":"I had been looking for an old fashioned percolator for some time that didn't rely on electricity. Having a gas stove, if power goes out, I wanted to still be able to have my coffee in the morning but I didn't want that sort of white-speckled, blue enamel campfire look. This seemed to be a good quality piece of merchandise at a fairly reasonable price so I bought it in anticipation of Hurricane Irene. Well, we didn't lose power but I gave the percolator a few tries anyway and I have to say that it makes a pretty decent cup of coffee. The unit itself seems pretty solidly put together, has good capacity, and is dishwasher safe.Keep in mind, though, that this is not your auto-drip machine, so put that sort of thinking out of your mind. Follow the directions and keep an eye on it, because as long as there's a fire under it, it will keep right on perking away, burning your coffee as it does. You'll like the results if you handle it properly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Percolator Coffee Pot","review":"As soon as I received the coffee pot, I washed it and did a test run. I am happy to report that the coffee flavor was much better than my existing Cuisinart coffee maker. Just followed the directions and the flavor was so full. I believe the percolating process renders a fuller flavor than the drip of the my old coffee maker. I would highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect","review":"I've been using this pot for a few weeks now and I must admit that the taste of the very same coffe I was using in a drip machine, is so much better. Also, I need use less coffee, though I would recommend anyone using it to either buy a coarser ground of coffe or grind it yourself.The only thing wrong with this pot is what I consider a design flaw: the pour spout looks normal but on the inside one can see that it is only a small hole. This ends up with coffee in the top (cover) of the pot, causing one to miss out on at least a half cup."},{"rating":"2","title":"Faberware Coffee Pot","review":"I am extremely happy with this purchase.

CHEAP! Unfortunately it leaks without this little black ring.. so into the trash it goes. Lesson learned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not \\"A\\" Coffee Pot, \\"THE\\" Coffee Pot","review":"I got this for a better tasting cup of coffee than my drip coffee maker, which is pretty good. I know that the coffee/water ratio is different but I tried using it with the same amount as the drip and it was too weak the first time. I doubled the coffee and it was delicious. The coffee was so much richer tasting and hotter. I can't wait until cold weather gets here. I also bought the glass top and am very happy.*Update*It's been 3 months now and I still LOVE this coffee pot. I have used it EVERY SINGLE DAY with different brands of coffee. I have found that my favorite is \\"Eight O'Clock\\". My pot now has that brown tinge from use and was wondering how to clean this. I found one suggestion to scrub out with baking soda and then boil it in a water/baking soda mixture and this worked pretty good. I am now sending one of these pots to my aunt. She has always used an electric one, but I have a hunch that she will love this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stove top percolator coffee pot","review":"Attractive pot but I was disappointed because it is very light weight. For the price I expected something heavier and more sturdier. Coffee comes out weak so be sure to add extra when brewing. The great thing is that the coffee comes out nice and hot so it is not necessary to heat the milk first in the microwave as I had to do with the old plastic Mr. Coffee maker. The only two negatives is that the top is plastic and should be replaced by glass. The other thing is that when you dismantle the pot to clean it watch out that you don't lose the spring because it easily falls out!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"very nice","review":"My wife wanted this because it takes up less space than the drip coffee makers, we have a very small kitchen. The percolator is very solid and well built, event the insert is very sturdy made of stainless steel and not aluminum like other percolators that I have owned. makes good coffee but heats up quickly and perks vigorously. I heat mine on medium heat. I use a reusable metal filter, works very well with this and no coffee grinds get into the coffee. I would recommend this to anybody who doesn't mind waiting an extra 4 minutes especially at this price (paid $22)."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!","review":"Coffee Makers seem to break and the fancier the quicker it breaks, so going old skool percolator style is the way to go for me. :)This one is exactly what I needed. I also purchased the reuseable filter [...] and it works perfectly with this percolator to keep even the smallest grounds out of my cup.This percolator is a 4-8 cup percolator so it's not super large, not SMALL either, but rather a very nice medium tea pot type size. Fits nicely and looks attractive enough to hang out on the stove top. I love that it doesn't take up counter space like the coffee makers did.The coffee actually stays hot in it for a long time before I need to consider some sort of re-heating option. (ie: microwave or just re-percolate for a minute or two) And a cup of coffee from a percolator is SO MUCH better then from a coffee maker.UPDATE: Oct 2012 - Still LOVING my perk!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality....","review":"I liked the design and size.But, when I boiled water, I found some metal pieces in the water. Of course, I washed with hot water before using it.I spent about an hour to clean it, especially, the spout part was very difficult to clean. But metal pieces are still being taken off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes a wonderful cup of coffee","review":"I purchased this wonderful percolator recently to replace my Mr. Coffee that gave my coffee a plastic aftertaste. I LOVE this percolator! It makes a wonderful tasting cup of coffee. All the parts are stainless so I don't have to worry about plastics ruining my coffee. I suggest this to anyone who wants to save some counter space and move away from plastic coffee makers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Reviewer Fred Brack obviously didn't examine this coffee pot before reviewing it. The knob is PLASTIC not glass! A few months ago I purchased a Martha Stewart percolator which looks almost the same as this one. It was fine until the plastic knob became discolored and no longer stays screwed in the pot. The stainless steel pot will last forever and become a permanent part of the environment while the knob only lasted a few months. What ever happened to the great corningware (I had a great one in New York but I accidentally forgot it when I moved to California) and pyrex percolators? I guess there's no such thing as a quality stovetop percolator."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perk is the best!","review":"I always wondered why certain restaurants served coffee that was better than what I brewed at home. I spent lots of time trying different coffees, a Chemex coffee maker and a top of the line 14 cup Cuisinart coffee maker. Who would have thought the solution would be the lowly perk pot?Granted, the restaurants use big coffee urns, but the results can be duplicated with this little pot, so if you've been to a restaurant that somehow makes the most delicious coffee, soon you will be doing so at home :)Resign yourself to buying a glass top at the time of purchase. Just immediately throw away the plastic one... you're still saving money over a drip coffee maker. Also, wait till the pot cools down before you wash it, otherwise the glass top will break. Additional replacements can be found at your local Kohl's, and they're inexpensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to Use and Makes Good Coffee","review":"We searched through a lot of coffee percolators until we settled on this one. It worked great on the gas stove in our camper, and makes more than enough coffee for 4 people. Good quality, and I like that the inside is finished making it easier to clean than some other models. My one complaint is that there is quite a bit of guesswork involved in deciding when the coffee is ready - the instructions give a range of minutes when it could be done. We basically waited until the liquid bubbling in the clear bulb on top is coffee colored, and then gave it a few more minutes to make a strong brew. It would be nicer if there was diagram for how long to leave however many cups and on what heat level. However, we are generally happy with it, and of the choices available, I would say this is the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Little Coffee Pot","review":"Always loved the smell of perked coffee - This pot works great on my electric range - I use coffee filters and never have a ground in any cup - makes coffee strong or weak - more versatile yhan drip - never going back to drip - drip is dead"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Retro Treat","review":"It's excellent.

I really liked the coffee. However, today when I was washing it, the handle came loose from the body of the pot. Fortunately, it held only warm water and was in the sink. If it had been straight off the stove with a hot pot of brewed coffee in it, it could have caused a very bad scald when it fell. The handle is only spotwelded and the screw in the handle does not go into the pot. Beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"High maintenance!","review":"Purchased this instead of a big coffee contraption. It is terrible. Or maybe it just requires more time and patience than I have, prior to my first cup of coffee. I couldn't really tell when the coffee was done. The directions say to remove the grinds before pouring... huh??? The pot is very hot and impossible to remove the grinds. I ended up with a bitter cup of coffee. I definitely don't have the patience for this thing - although I'm sure I could figure it out through trial and error eventually. I'm going to get a French coffee press instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"R.I.P. Electric Percolator","review":"After going through 3 electric percolators (1 Farberware and 2 GEs) this past year, I decided to make coffee the old-fashion way. Boy, am I glad I bought this pot several months ago. Here is how I make our coffee: always use one tablespoon coffee per 1 cup of coffee, bring cold water to a boil then put coffee basket into pot, perk 7 minutes, shut off and leave on burner until coffee settles.

This plastic insert is held in place by a very small plastic nib that screws into the metal lid that is relatively sharp on the edge. After removing this plastic part a couple of times to wash the pot, the plastic nib shears off,(with little or no effort), leaving the plastic insert loose in the lid. In addition, this plastic insert is what is used to remove the lid from the pot. After the nib is sheared off, when the plastic insert is grasped to pull the lid off, the insert and plastic ring under it come off in the hand with the additional possibility of scalding oneself with hot coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"The plastic top keeps melting and breaking, returned 4 times and counting","review":"All Stovetop perculators are good coffee makers but this one is not worth buying. Yes it makes a good cup of coffee, but the top keeps breaking. It melts and breaks within a week of use! It should be glass, but it's plastic instead. First it melts and then breaks and will not tighten onto the lid. You can only imagine trying to pour hot coffee when the top is not fastened correctly.I have returned 3 pots and gotten a replacement part from Farberware 2 times, all failed within a week.
