They were a common opening act in the midwest and, b/c they always were paired up with harder rock acts, they were always underappreciated or booed off the stage.They were fine musicians, wrote decent songs and were a very capable live act. \\"Shine on Brightly\\" is a good, hippy, prog song. While they were good musicians, their songs did lack the drama of Yes, Genesis or Kansas. I actually enjoyed their \\"Reel to Real\\" album.This is a quality album but it's really only for the devoted fan. If you remembered them from the 70's, was wondering if you can get Starcastle on cd, and are elated to hear this obscure music once again, then this is for you. Otherwise, no teenager will like this.

Now, moving on to the cd-I really am enjoying this album. No, it is not the same as Throne Room, but it's not supposed to be. I think that the purpose of this is to really encourage all people and give them hope-we need more of that in our world today. I love all of the songs, but the ones that stick out to me are 'Pray', 'You Will', 'A Place Like This', and 'He's Concerned'-she really ministers on this song when she sings it live.

Not it isn't 'One Theory for Dummies'. It is a deep deep and praiseworthy mathematical embodiment of real phenomena. Could be wrong. But that's OK. Maybe, if somehow missing a cog on a gear, it will evoke the better formulation in someone else's head. The point is that Terry's work is hugely evolved and argued stepwise through all facets of real world physics.This book, on the other hand, is like a bar room rant from somebody who better not have his keys to the car.

Not only was it boring and unrealistic, it also had no point. The ending was horrible-- if you could consider that an ending, and the characters were underdeveloped. There is no central idea to this book, and the ideas do not progress logically. This book reads like a diary (A few chapters actually are a diary), and there is rarely any action or meaningful events. The ending leaves the reader wanting more-- like an ending! Though I did not enjoy this book (And I don't think you would either) I gave it one star for effort. It probably was hard for Jean Ure to fill 180 pages with garbage, without passing out from the fumes of bad writing.

It's supposed to have piano and bell sounds and also voices of cat, duck, and dog, but those sounds and voices are simply annoying. I mean, they don't sound like what they are supposed to sound. The cat voice is the worst--it sounds like you are braking glass window or something.

We're still training our puppies, so these are a great low calorie snack that they seem to really like the flavor of.The only downside for me is the size of each one, they're about dime size. If you have a lab mix with a big mouth you better have a good size handful or she is going to have a handful of your hand in her mouth.Packaging was great, ordered on Prime. They arrived next day which was a relief. It's hard to find anything worth the money with a good value to it.

They're dry little crackers, so perhaps it's the consistency - who knows. I've tried putting them between her food, wetting them down, pretending to eat it myself before giving it to her, etc. Nope.

They have a shocking 3 calories each, twice as many as a lima bean which has about 1 1/2 calories. No, I am not suggesting that you feed your dog lima beans - just making a comparison based on size. I have a Dobie so it would be insulting to offer him just one of these tiny treats. However, because each of these tiny treats has 3 calories I can't give him very many or he would gain too much weight. If you have a teeny tiny dog that would be satisfied with just one of these teeny tiny treats then go for them. If you have a big dog as I do then you can find a much better treat without all the comparable calories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me","review":"I went with the reviews on this one, and unfortunately was disappointed. I have a 9 pound corgi puppy, and he seemed to be ok with the flavor of these.

Did the director not do his homework? What's he seen? One WIP flick? Unbelievable.Yes there are 2 women in a shower with 90% shot above the shoulders. The director hasn't got an exploitive bone(r) in his body. What a joke--oh, and don't forget to cut the scene right before the camera gets a good shot. This sleaze-less piece of trash doesn't deserve to be called a WIP flick. I don't care if Jack Hill made a guest appearance--it only tarnished his name.Anyway, this plays like a shot-on-video movie. The plot's okay, but it's not very engaging. The directing calls attention to itself (and away from the movie). Not recommended.The other 5 stars are probably written by the director's family or friends or something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gimme Some Sugar!","review":"Sugar Boxx is a good women in prison movie.

If it's the latter, it's a classic. All of the characters are either unlikable or stupid, sometimes both. The \\"plot\\" is predictable. The pace is turgid. Not to mention the details -- does she not know the difference between \\"blond\\" and \\"blonde\\"? Does she not know that England might have village greens but Italy has piazzas? Is the Italian's name Franco or Gianfranco? Why does she use present tense throughout?

For this one, it sounds like a mix of all three, and the mix doesn't work.One thing that's significant about Bread is that their songs are perfect. For the era, the song, and the setting, Bread did the best job ever of matching soft vocals with tender instrumentation to make love songs that put you in love with the person they're singing about. This doesn't do it for me. None of these songs improve on anything from the original tracks.

Also, always get the dirty wheels on our dress while loading in the trunk.Overall, We're disappointed & will not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I bought this stroller 2 Years back and it is still working, it is very light and comfortable, would recommond this to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Happy","review":"We were looking for a smaller stroller than the \\"Betsey\\" design we had, because it was too big to fit in the trunk of our small car. I am very pleased with the size of this stroller although there are a number of features I don't like as much as the larger version. The snack tray snaps in on both sides (allowing you to completely remove it) where the other one we had it would snap into place on one side. I don't think this one folds up as easily because the seat can't be in a certain spot or else it won't go down and you have to make sure it snaps into place on the sides to secure it.These are just nit-picky things that were a difference from the other one we had. For someone who is purchasing this stroller for the first time I think you would be fine with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good for the price","review":"This is very good stroller for the price, durable. We are using for 3 years and still in good condition. Easy to assemble as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"So easy and light!","review":"This stroller is a dream come true.It has all the storage space of some of the larger bulkier models without the weight.I can easily assemble and fold it with one hand, which is a huge plus in my book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice stroller, could improve on the way it folds","review":"I absolutely love this stroller. The only thing I don't like is the way it folds down. When its folded down the stroller's handle is facing to the bottom, so if you have it sitting on concrete or any rough surface, it will ruin the handle, since its made of foam. I have had a different Graco stroller (part of a travel system) and it folded completely different. Other than that, I love this stroller. VERY light weight, doesn't weigh 20 lbs, I don't have to lug it out of the trunk of my SUV, can be picked up easily. Basket has a good amount of storage space. It's basically a full size stroller that is very light and easy to maneuver. I love the fact that the Graco snug ride car seat can snap right in as well. Would definitely recommend. Just wish Graco would change the way it folds down, to make it similar to their other strollers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stroller, esp for price!","review":"I recieved the matching carseat free from the hospital when I had my third baby, but the Graco carseat didn't fit in my old stroller so I needed a new one. I decided to get one to match, and this is the one I found. I love it. I know they say it's lightweight but I think it is just as nice as my old stroller (which came as a travel system). I actually like the slightly smaller size.I do caution you on one thing... when you open the stoller from the collapsed position it sounds and feels like it just clicks into place, but make sure it is LOCKED too. The one handed release that folds it has to be turned back to its original position (rotated back towards the parent). I found this out the hard way, I thought it locked open but it didn't and it collapsed when I was pushing it... luckily baby wasn't it in it then. Overall a wonderful stroller for everyday use."},{"rating":"2","title":"100% worth for the money","review":"I really satisfied with this product..pros: comfortable for parents, Moderate weight, good material, BASKET is EXCELLENT.

Our toddler (9 months) had a great time at the street level in the stroller and we had good use for the large space under the stroller for our purchases during the days.We brought it home to Sweden and it is now a preferred choice for short walks over our more than ten times as expensive baby stroller.The only negative is the cup holders in combination with the rather stiff construction. Liquids will not stay in the cup for sure if rolling on anything else than a very smooth surface.To the price we paid it is certainly very good value for money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for on-the-go","review":"I hadn't purchased a stroller since my first child was born over 6 yrs ago, so I felt the need for a new one for my last child. They've come a long way in 6 yrs. This stroller is perfect. It's light weight, easy to fold, comfortable for my daughter, fits in the back of the minivan easily, etc. I had toys from my other children that I could attach to the spaces provided on the stroller, so that keeps her occupied sometimes. There's also great space up top for 2 drinks and other misc items, and the basket underneath is a great size to fit lots of stuff for on-the-go. Would highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value Stoller","review":"We were trying ot find an inexpensive stroller for our visiting grandchild. This was perfect. Folds away for easy storage. I would recommend this to other grandparents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Cheaply Made and No Adjustability","review":"I bought this stroller for my first baby just because it is compatible with my Graco carseat and the low price. However, after installing it, I figure that there's almost NO adjustment can be made to the seat nor push-handle. The only adjustment is the storage basket on the bottom and folding it down for storage. I'm really sickened everytimes I look at this stroller. The back angle is either too low or too upright, NOT confortable at all!! I can already foresee that my baby will have the tendency to fall forward due to this stiff back angle (too upright). It is a pain in the butt to follow through the crappy instruction pictures, and now that I'm not completely satisfy, I can't return the item back to Amazon due to it being too big to fit back into the box.\\\\PLEASE, if you love your baby, don't spend $60+ on a stroller. Get a GOOD one!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this stroller","review":"After doing a lot of research to find an affordable, lightweight stroller with the \\"perks\\" of a bigger stroller, we bought this stroller and are very happy with our choice. It folds up very nicely and I love that it reclines allowing our 13 month old to nap if he wants. The basket is huge and I love that you can still get to your diaper bag even when the seat is reclined. I definitely recommend this stroller! It's GREAT! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super stroller","review":"We love this stroller.It folds one-handed, it has a decent parent and toddler tray, the basket is huge and easy to get to, compact when collapsed....Only reason I don't give it 5 stars is that it is a pavement only (no good on dirt trails etc) and therefore is limited in it's use."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"This stroller is super lightweight.

Easy handling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try Another Way","review":"I always look forward to Bond soundtrack albums, but this one misses big time. David Arnold's score is loud, boisterous and, with a couple exceptions, completely interchangeable with the scores of the previous two movies. Add to the mix, the worst Bond song in years and you have a very disappointing soundtrack. It may sound better with the movie images it supports, but as a stand alone work, it lacks a lot. The highlights of the CD are the Oakenfold remix and the track \\"Welcome to Cuba.\\" It's better to dig out the John Barry albums and listen to true musical scores."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wanna Be","review":"David Arnold is nowhere near as good as John Barry. I know John Barry recommended him to the Broccoli clan, but do they listen to the music? Have they tried playing it against Barry's?

And do so in non-predictable fashion: No \\"names\\" unless they can back it up with a good score!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!

You will just listen to once or twice, hoping to find a few great tracks, but you won't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shockingly bad","review":"David Arnold's score for TND was brilliant, TWINE was less so but still extremely good, but this is truly awful. To say Madonna's title track is the best thing on the album should give you an idea of how bad it really is. It seems like Arnold couldn't be bothered to write any new material and instead has spent his time rehashing the themes from his previous scores using the new toys he has obviously aquired since the last film. He seems more interested playing with his equipment(!!) than writing music and he clearly hasn't got the hang of it yet. The production is poor (sounds like his computer has got an ongoing clocking problem) and to top it off they just had to get Paul Oakenfold to ruin it even further. Perhaps its time David Arnold passed the mantle onto somebody else. As long as it's not Paul Oakenfold!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun score.","review":"It took me a few listens, but I actually ended up enjoying this album a lot. The techno assistance was a bit jarring at first, but it compliments the orchestra well and makes for some wildly fun music (\\"Hovercraft Chase\\" and \\"Whiteout\\" being the standouts). This one stands out from the rest, and that's a compliment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck.","review":"Actually another word came to mind but need to write a G-rated review. Starts out in severely distorted mangling of song such that only a few notes each time play then stop, wham, restart, second track is full of scratches of needle across grooves or tape equivalent of running a nail across mastering. Then degenerate rendering of usually beautiful Bond theme. Could get no further into this. Among the 5 worst of several thousand CDs I have heard. Now I do not even want to stream the flick."},{"rating":"2","title":"It slowly gets to you","review":":)) I liked the song, but that is way too much of it.

I found this a more satisfying read than 'The Detainees' as, although the bulk of this book was quite gloomy, its ending is uplifting. In any case, I generally find Hughes' work more 'realistic' than 'depressing'. And, as always, Hughes delivers with insightful comment on everyday life and the best one-liners around. If you have found yourself to be 'on his wavelength' before, then I thoroughly recommend 'Its What He Would've Wanted'."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny British farce!","review":"We love this actor from the excellent British detective series, \\"The Last Detective\\", in which he plays the sidekick to the equally fine Brit actor Peter Davison (of \\"Doctor Who\\" and \\"All Creatures Great & Small\\" fame), so we were pleasantly surprised to find out that he is an author of several books as well. Good, funny farcical writing that reflects his comic Irish sensibility!"},{"rating":"1","title":"thorough yet aimless; detailed yet unclear","review":"This is a tough book to finish because it isn't clear where the story is. The research is thorough, as you might expect from an author who is \\"Professor of Renaissance Studies\\". But the book touches on all kinds of scientific advances and technology that would be interesting if explained. Jardine mentions the introduction of the ruby bearing for chronometers. But she doesn't explain or illustrate the jewelled watch movement. By contrast I've watched Gerry Sussman, an MIT EECS professor, hold an audience spellbound with a clear explanation of what the 17 jewels in a 17-jewel watch movement do. Next time Jardine writes about science, I hope that she collaborates with an engineer or scientist and an illustrator."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fail","review":"This book is at best a tolerable essay on selected efforts in science in northern Europe in the last part of the seventeenth century. The author is capable of competent research but a complete failure at storytelling. There is nothing about the title of the book, the introduction, or anything whatsoever to warn you that whenever the chance is presented to move forward, the author moves backward. The same boring and pedantic details are presented again and again. How many times do we need to be reminded of something that was barely print worthy the first time? Finally, in place of any kind of summary or conclusion, the author presents the most useless information possible about unimportant persons, and then randomly jumps forward 300 years to something totally unconnected and prays in the manner of Newton that the reader will make some leap of faith and find reason. Also by the way, there are only passing references to Kepler on a few pages so don't trust everything you read either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fact checking?","review":"I'm pretty disappointed by this book - as other reviewers have said, there are many interesting facts, but it's quite incoherent. And then I start wondering how many are facts. On p.29 of my paperback edition, we learn that Charles II hid in an oak after the battle of Northampton, and then on p. 101 that someone used spectacles for short sightedness for magnifying small objects. This sort of thing is so lazy and sloppy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incoherent","review":"Awful. The book is simply a large collection of facts and quotations stuck together with overblown generalizations. It looks as though she collected her research on index card and then insisted on using each and every one regardless of its relevance or interest. She does come up with the odd interesting fact, but they aren't worth the effort of having to wade through all the rest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two smart guys talking","review":"Conversations with PicassoI knew Brassai was a great photographer of Paris at night but I had no idea he was really well educated about literature and art, painted and drew, and met with Picasso as an equal discussing both their art works, art history, styles in painting as Brassai photographed Picasso's paintings and sculptures. This book is just like hanging out with the two of them, before, during and after WWII -- a really fun time with two very smart guys -- the book will send you to the internet looking for some of the artists they are talking about, like Hokusai, a Japanese painter I had never heard of -- Brassai told Picasso he had done some very large paintings, which was news to Picasso. Relaxed and fascinating reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Self-contained and instructive, read the TOC first!","review":"Compared to the slightly overrated Jurafsky and Martin's classic, this book aims less targets but hits them all more precisely, completely and satisfactory for the reader. That is, just to give you an idea on what to expect, instead of attacking 200 problems on 2 pages each, this book attacks only 40 problems on 10 pages each.So, read the TOC before you buy the book: if you find your topics there, you're done, you are saved, buy it and be happy. In contrast, you can buy Jurafsky's book without caring to read the TOC: your problem is likely to be mentioned there but it's quite unlikely to be detailed enough to satisfy you.Some introductory chapters take too much space and some advanced topics are missing. But the book is actually named \\"Foundations of...\\" so it seems to deliver precisely what it promisses, which is a precious and rare accomplishment by itself.

In the prior batch I purchased, it was as expected. In the new batch, purchased 04/07/09, they reduced the amount of pulp in the paper so now its so thin it is like an onion skin. You can literally see all the airholes. It also now has a weird texture and doesn't 'bunch up' the way it used to. It is cheaper than the cheapest toilet paper I used 20 years ago when visiting a communist country. I am switching brands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something is different (and wrong)","review":"I've been ordering this bulk pack off Amazon for probably 5 years or so. I actually preferred this tissue to regular tissue (maybe because i have to change the roll less and feel like i'm wasting less and it was reasonably soft and seemed to be good for getting the right amount).Something has all of a sudden changed. It is actually rough now and hard to handle (it used to be soft despite what all the haters said). I literally can't touch it it feels so rough. I have been using it and although it's function to some extent it's highly undesirable. I had a big pack of these and someone thought i had ordered it by mistake (since single ply cheap tissue) and put it in the trash and i laughed at them and said why would I waste perfectly good toilet paper.

More money for less product -- isn't corporate America wonderful?I'll go to the store from now on.

But I can get it at the local grocery story in a 12 roll pack for around 8.00 when it's not on sale. When it is on sale I can get it for around 6.50 for a 12 roll package. That means I can get 36 rolls for 24.00 and change at the normal price, and 36 rolls for 20.00 and change when it's on sale. I'm not about to pay Amazon 15.00 more for 4 more rolls, even if it's shipped to my door! This is way over priced, even if it is good tissue paper.

I bought it after seeing it hit one of the deal sites at a decent price with Subscribe and Save. On that particular deal site there were many posts about how one ply tissue could result in tragedy but I thought that I could overcome that by simply using additional sheets. Well... yeah... not so much.I will have to buy additional tissue for general use and try to use the remaining bulk of this to blow noses or... well, I don't know.

This company pays minimum wage to their workers, forces them to work overtime for no pay, hires people for part time mostly so they don't have to pay any benefits and destroys every community they go into. Our town used to have a flourishing downtown. No more. The family that owns Walmart are disgusting, greedy people.

It's wasteful.I am giving this product 2 stars for the following reasons:- Poorly marketed.

A once proud name should be ashamed.","review":"Sad to say, Scott toilet paper has been downgraded and is no longer a premium product, it just still has its premium price. A premium product is meant to offer a choice for the consumer who would rather spend a little more to get something better. Scott has done a \\"me too\\" downsizing on their toilet tissue to 4.1\\", \\"to align it with the market\\" or some such nonsense (this is what their own reps say). The purpose of a PREMIUM product is not to be aligned with everybody else on the market, it is to be better. Sadly, Scott toilet tissue is no longer better and is not worth the extra money. Like Maytag, they just continue to label their product with the name even though what's behind the label is me-too.

This was the only brand I would purchase for as long as I can remember. No more! The less expensive 1000 sheet store brands are now of better quality than this Scott product. The width of the \\"new\\" Scott product has been reduced considerably. The sheets have been embossed to make them fluffier, and the spindle has been made larger, resulting in a roll that is the same outer diameter but with less paper. Like the \\"new improved\\" Coca Cola that failed miserably, I hope that Scott comes out with a \\"Classic Scott\\" with the size and quality their premium price demands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredible Shrinking Rolls","review":"I never thought they'd do it, but Scott has resorted to the same cheap tactics as it's competitors.

I'm gonna bring my measuring tape to the store to find a replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"They made the rolls much much smaller now","review":"Due to the economy they have decided that cheating the customer was the way to go. I used scott bath tissue for years then I noticed the rolls were much smaller, much more narrow they were not fitting on the holder as well and we were going through many, many more rolls much faster than usual, so I called them and yes indeed they had the rolls smaller however the price is still through the roof for this product. They are saving money making smaller rolls we are paying the same amount yet getting smaller rolls. Not cool.

Thankfully it was free and I will be able to move on to something else. The story was way too long, utterly predictable (to the point I wanted to reach into my kindle and strangle Theda for a variety of reasons), the characters were very one-dimensional and it completely lacked humor. Theda is quite possibly the most boring 30 something I've ever read about. It seems like she was written by a conservative 50 something wishing she was 30 again with no concept of what it's like to be in her 30's. When the cats are more interesting than the human characters, it's time to move on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catfox","review":"Not too bad. I did not guess the killer until close to the end, which is good, as you can often tell who is going to be the bad guy in the first chapter or two. But the action was slow.

OK bit not great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mew is for murder","review":"An updated version of the \\"cat who....\\" series. It was interesting that the story took place in the Boston area.

This is a story that is hard to put down once started. The characters are interesting and well developed. The garage and music scene is not a usual subject but the author captures the seting in an authentic manner. There are several focal points that are unexpected but interesting. Cambridge as a community, the bar scene, magazine publishing, and the real estate market. The writer brings youthful spirit to the writng that is refreshing. Reading this is a fun way to spend a few hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mew","review":"Well, we all make mistakes and this was mine for 2012.

We were so excited to discover Pure Dead Brilliant was coming out that I pre-ordered it in hard back (something I never do). Unfortunately we barely made it through a hundred pages. Ms Gliori is, indeed, brilliant (!) but we had two major problems with this book. It's darker than the others in the series (too dark for a 9 year old?) and, despite the wonderful characters, is horribly over written. Where was her editor! The long flowery sentences, packed with adjectives and adverbs, killed the humour and our interest in the plot. I struggled to read them, and my son struggled to listen. It seemed every few minutes one of us was saying \\"wait a minute, what was that?\\" Or, in our less intellectual moments, \\"huh?\\" Finally we gave up. Despite the $18.

Another, the Math section is completely irrevelent when comparing to actual ACT. The reading is not intellectually written at all, and the answer choices are so close that ALL the answers can work if you think about it. I wouldn't recommend using Barron's for ANYTHING.

The connects are so tightly fitted that you literally have to use a pair of pliers to pull them from the female plugs. I removed them and one of the plugs broke off in my hand after only a day of use. As for sound quality. Things sound somewhat muddy with these compared to the, much superior in quality, moster cable that I have.I'm not really one to nit-pick over cables. Not like some audiophiles; paying $500+ for cryogenic steel cables, but these cables really are much worse than even $5 cables as far as construction goes.

It clocks in at just under 90 minutes, which makes it the shortest version released so far, including all those funky PD companies. The U. S. theatrical release of this film ran 15 minutes longer.

I was able to listen while doing the poses and stay in the relaxed flow that the DVD inspires without getting confused or having to come out of the pose to look at the TV in order to follow along. Micheline guides the audience like we are her own students. She explains the movements and reminds the viewer to breath and surrender to the movement. Also she asks that we challenge ourselves to go deeper, meet our edges of resistance and move past any obstacles to our health, vitality, strength and inner radiance. Micheline herself executes the poses and is an example of proper alignment, poise and grace. I recommend Liquid Asana to serious yogis as well as those just starting on their yogic path.

Although she doesn't shy away from challenging poses, and no serious beginner should, she explains everything clearly and slowly, and yet is never boring. On the contrary, her seductively hypnotic voice and impeccable taste in music get us through full series of sophisticated sequences almost imperceptibly. You get in a groove and, when you notice, you've already done all kinds of twists.The chapters are clearly labeled, so you can pick and choose depending on your time and disposition. And at the end she gives you time for meditation. No more, no less, all you need from a yoga practice, from an unassuming teacher with deep knowledge of the subject.

Just expected better quality from a Melissa and Doug toy. Bugs should be painted on the wood. They are just paper pictures and the edges started to wear and curl the first day my grandson played with the toy.

The wood shapes will be there but pictures will be very tattered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun Idea but hard to use","review":"The concept of this puzzle is great and would be very fun but the wooden pieces of the puzzle fit too tightly. My 3 year old can get the magnet to stick to the piece but it then detaches while trying to pull it out. To put a piece back in she has to use her other hand to tap the piece into place.

We tested several placement locations before affixing the chime, and high provided the best signal reception. After the installation, we find the chime does not always pick up the signal.If the button is pressed several times and held, the chime tends to work. But when was the last time UPS or FedEx took so much time to ring the bell?The unit works when the distance is short, such as described by the other raters.

Compression is supposed to push your signal more toward the middle of the sound spectrum, but the effect is pretty subtle, really. According to an article I read, the compression pedal should be the first one in your chain. I didn't have it set up that way at first, but when I reconfigured my pedal board like that, the guitar signal really came into focus no matter what other pedals I was using. A few reviewers have stated that this pedal is noisy. I don't find that all. There's a little hiss if you max the output on the pedal, but I only keep it at about 60-70% and there's no problem. The hum from my Fender amp on a good day is louder."},{"rating":"1","title":"DIstorted","review":"Sorry folks, but this ain't a Dyna-Comp by any stretch. My mistake was thinking that this unit would be but a little more control. The attack control on this thing goes from full-squash to almost nothing.

They are not in white, which I know is trivial, but I do like sporting the white earpuds and wire.The speakers fit at your ear and not necessarily IN your ear, which was nice. My ear drums will thank me later. As for staying in place, after I got them set behind my ears they weren't a problem.

The hinges become loose, the earhook slides to a larger size and becomes unstable with any tugging on the wire, and there is minimal contact between the earbud and your ear, which also lends to instability. The only thing that kept me from giving them one star is that they surprisingly had descent sound. Its funny, but i'd actually compare them to stock ipod earbuds as far as sound quality goes.

I have only heard one other singer that comes close to his level and that is Eros Razzotti. When he sings Voglio Andare a Vivere in Campagna it feels if you are there and can smell the air. It's amazing that so many people love his music even if they cannot understand it. I understand the language and it makes it that much more enjoyable.

My son is 13 months old, and had played with similar sand toys on a playdate, so I knew he liked them (which is a prerequisite for me to buy any large amounts of plastic). These are great-- they keep him away from the more dangerous gardening tools around in our garden, and together with the garden hose, the bucket and watering can provide hours of play for him.

I couldn't read past the first twenty pages or so. I was looking for uplifting; something affirming me as a feminine ball of creation blessed by the divine. Reading this title from the very beginning felt like walking through quicksand... in the dark. I don't know how else to explain it. I couldn't bear to read another dreary dream.

Born in 1828,dead in 1905,he wrote best-sellers like \\"From the earth to the moon\\"(1865),\\"Around the world in 80 days(1873). \\"From the earth to the moon\\" is a science fiction novel,at least it war at that time.It is a story about three men who invented a space craft wich shoult take them to the moon.It had no motor ,they weren't invented at that time,so they used the power of a huge canon to shoot the craft into the air,twords the moon. Verne has a great way to discribe things.He succesfully combined his imagination and reality toghether in this novel.

The only good thing is that the rings are all different, some are like rattles, and they all float which makes a good bath tub toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth re-reading today","review":"This is a book was provocative enough to send me to graduate school for more intensive study. Though dated, it is worth re-reading in light of more recent developments in international relations.Payne's book was written at the height of the Cold War, with the Soviet nuclear threat in mind. His thesis, that vigorous use of American military power increases the credibility of the so-called American threat, improving the odds that an opponent will take our deterrent power seriously, deserves reflection in this day of suicide attacks and other \\"non-rational\\" quasi-military tactics.Does the rationality of deterrence work against a suicide bomber? If not, what does it say about the nature of deterrence, of military security, of our concepts of rationality? Does the invasion of Iraq make the United States safer? Payne's recent comments suggest not. Why?Always an independent voice, Payne's work should be examined closely, as much for its assumptions as for its policy implications."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fast moving mystery with entertaining characters","review":"An art gallery used for a movie set is the stage one for this fast moving mystery.

Will Barnes claimed he witnessed the gunfight between Owens and the Blevins brothers, but he was not called on to testify at any of the subsequent coroner's inquests. More likely, Barnes distilled his manuscript from the eyewitness accounts of others who were there on that September afternoon in 1887. Still, the story is factual and fairly accurate. Of special interest to historians are Appendix A, the story of the gunfight as it appeared in The Apache County Critic and Appendix B, the Coroner's Inquest interviews. Neil Carmony's editing is quite good. Recommended reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Insightful and articulate thoughts but the book tends to be repetitive and bland.

My book still hasn't arrived and it's been over a month. The customer service department never informed me of what was going on until I pursued them. They said they ordered another and it would be up to 14 days before they got the book from their supplier. So I waited patiently and 15 days later still no word. These guys are a sham and are truly absurd when it comes to customer service. They constantly wanted to give me the refund so I would get out of their hair but to me thats hardly the easy way out.

This time around he takes the reader to the Wild West, a period he has only once explored in the past in a short story that can be found in the collection \\"Peacable Kingdom\\". \\"The Crossings\\" is a first-person narrative, the account of a journalist who recalls his violent encounter with lawless criminals who force women into prostitution and whose sinister leader has a connection to an old native religion that most thought extinct. No it isn't and while this novel, like most of Ketchum's books, is not supernatural fiction, there is plenty of nasty stuff crammed into its few pages.

The plot is convuluted at best and silly at worst; this is definitely not a book for anyone new to the X-Men or Colossus. While I had high hopes for the art based on the penciller's past performance, it comes off as amateurish.

It works fine with ONE set of six lights, but as soon as I connected the other string of six, only the very first light was bright, and the others were orange, and the second set would not give off any light at all.

When I wiggled it, that section fell into the transformer and I can't open the box to even take a look. An expensive heavy black brick in the trash - that still receives the power, but won't put any out (I tried a new wire and a brand new light to make sure). I don't know if a big spider was able to short it out since I've seen them drive my electric fence nuts, but this was a big bummer and I am having a hard time figuring out if I should order it again or the new model that's more money... for what... and will take much longer to arrive.

The compositions are great, the arrangements are multi-layered and dynamic, THE BAND IS GREAT, and his voice takes the whole mix even further. This is a superb record. A real record in the sense that it's meant to be listened to from begining to end. The thing about Bunbury one might not think of or expect is that he really knows how to JAM (especially in his live performances). Pour yourself a glass of whiskey, put on a set of earphones, and enjoy the magic. And the reference to Bach in the title is not out of ignorance or drama. Bach was the very first to revolutionize poliphony, the beatles adapted it to pop, and Bunbury gives it a whole new spin. Muchas gracias Quique por este fenomenal disco...es un placer escucharlo.

This may be in part due to the heavier butyl rubber surround material that suspends the poly cones.

I've had many compliments. We get some snow, but not lots; they work fine. Given the price, these are well worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Score for the company rather than the light set","review":"I got the kit and started putting it together when I realized I had several broken parts. I tried calling the company but never got a live person. There was a web address for missing or broken parts so I went to it, but it was just advertising and lists, no place to request parts. There was a place to email, so I did. I gave them the item number and the parts that were broken, my email address, phone number name etc. I never heard back from them. So, I contacted Amazon and then send a mailing label for me to return it. I haven't gotten my refund yet, but I don't expect any problems with Amazon, though I'm disappointed in Malibu Lighting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth $45. Works well.","review":"Paid about $45 shipped and got it installed in no time. Pretty simple installation. Would have loved a photo timer instead of the one that this unit comes with. So far it has been working without any problems. Could not find anything similar at lowes or home depot. When you look at the quality of workmanship etc.. it surely is worth what you pay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap set of lights - takes a long time to assemble","review":"I bought this back in May of 2006. OK, so I gave this two stars solely because of the price. I don't know where they are coming up with a retail of $112, but at $46 the price is pretty decent. First, expect at least a few of the lights to be non-functioning right off the bat. So, consider it a 15 light set, not a 20. The frustrating part of this set is that you don't know if the light works until you attach it to the cord with a one-time use alligator clip. If the light doesn't work, you CAN'T remove it from the cord. Dumb design. The power supply and timer are fine and work well. The lights are so darn cheap and break so easily, it makes the whole set suffer. It took me at least 4 hours to assemble everything and lay it out. Not sure what else can be said. Roll the dice and see if you get lucky."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Service","review":"I ordered this 20 light set (14 regular lights & 6 Spot lights) to replace an older 10 regular light set. I installed the lights and found that the sockets for the spot lights were missing. Customer service was closed on the weekend so I went to the web site and ordered replacement parts. They E-Mailed a form with instrictions to send proof of purchase. I FAXED it to them and the missing parts were shipped the next day with an E-Mail UPS tracking link.Much better service than I expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor customer service","review":"Our shipment was missing some parts upon delivery. I called customer service and it was not easy getting the replacements. Much paperwork involved. Finally, almost a month later, I received them but they were sent to the wrong address and had to be forwarded here. They were told specifically where to send them. If I would have bought this at Home Depot, I would have taken the box back and gotten an immediate replacement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bright Light At A Nice Price","review":"Lights are bright and real easy to install. Lights are plastic and kinda of flimsy. Flood/Spot lights are made the same way but with a plastic cover lens which brakes real easy and most of them came broken in the box when shipped."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids love it","review":"My kids love the DVD. It is good price and you get two for one. What more could a bargain hunting parent look for?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry that I have to disagree...","review":"Although I purchased this cookbook with great expectations, I have been very disappointed. It is very well organized and wonderful pictures, which have been the problem for me because they are so tempting. I've made 5 recipes from the fish section and I've been disappointed with each one. I live on the Atlantic seaboard and have access to and purchase only the freshest fish, so I don't think it is the quality of ingredients. Although the dishes come out as pictured, they just don't have a lot of flavor. I'm going to give it one more try this weekend with the Pinot Noir sauce, but I'm not optimistic. I am going to D.C. in January, however, and I hope to be able to dine at the restaurant. For a great seafood cookbook, try Le Bernardin. I've prepared 14 of the dishes and I've been very pleased with each one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bob Toys","review":"I am a nanny to a wonderful little boy who absolutely loves Muck and all of the other Bob the Builder Brio toys that he recieved on his birthday. He plays with them constantly, and they have been great instigators of imaginative play. I do not believe that the value of a toy should have anything to do with its size, as some other reviewers may have suggested. This toy is durable and is very good quality. I believe that most of its value is in the type of play that it promotes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bob the Builder toy set","review":"I think this 'little' set is extremely overpriced for the size of the toy. The picture is deceiving. It is more in line with a stocking stuffer rather than a main gift as I had intended. I will most likely return the item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Fore-warned! Piece of Junk","review":"When I opened the package to give to my grandson, I was suprised and VERY disappointed. For the money I spent, I expected a LOT more.This thing looks like a $0.50 toy you would get from a gum-ball machine. It's a 2-inch man and a three-inch long plastic truck. I had to rush out Christmas morning to get something else. If I had given him this along with a book I purchased, he would have been extremely dissapointed and I would have been extremely embarrassed.DON'T buy this unless you are very familiar with the Bob-the-Builder rip-offs and still want to throw away $15.00."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money.","review":"I cannot believe this product is worth ($...).Fisher-Price offers a much better value.

For those of you who loved the movie I would highly reccomend the screenplay as well for some cut dialogue, additional scenes, and a slightly different ending. In addition, reading the screenplay has further deepened my appreciation for the great acting performances in this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an amazing CAT Back System","review":"Borla will never disappoint you with the quality of their exhaust systems.. This quote is very true.. However you better know what you are doing with the install because there are no explanations on how to select the 3 different sounds. The kit will come with 3 flanges with different size holes that attaches to the pipe before the muffler. Use the biggest hole for the louder sound.I have this kit installed on my '91 Z28 thr roar and additional performance is amazing. Not to mention that it looks great too.Buyer beware the picture is not correct you do not get 2 mufflers go to Borla's site direct to see the correct picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't fit!","review":"I've had installed a Borla kit for my IS300 a few years ago. That kit was a perfect fit. This kit #14888 was a nightmare to install! I had to cut the pipes and muffler in at least three differnt places to prevent the exhaust from hitting the body of the car and to get the tailpipes centered! The kit also didnt come with the correct bend for the exhaust to fit in the stock location. I had to get another pipe bent to connect the catalytic converter to the rest of this exhaust system. It does look pretty good after it was all done. 1989 Pontiac Trans Am GTA. Like the previous reviewer said, it doesnt look like the pic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, Important Book that Everyone Should Read","review":"This book is well written, informative and an enjoyable read. But so are many books. What distinguishes this one is that it also presents a critical message - one that we all should take to heart. And do not assume: \\"oh, wonderful, here's another book just bemoaning the fate of the planet and predicting its destruction.\\" Instead, Dr. Pimm's book does an exceptional job of clearly and accurately presenting a wealth of sobering information while maintaining a strong sense of optimism and inspiration. This is a truly outstanding and important book, and one does not need to be a scientist to understand and appreciate its content."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burned my scalp","review":"I bought the Natural Blond L'Oreal Mega Blonde at Sally's Beauty Supply and mixed it as directed with the 30 vol L'Oreal Mega Blonde developer. It burned my scalp within 5 minutes and left blisters that took a week to heal. I don't know who could possibly leave this on their head for the directed 45 minutes. If I had done so, I'm sure I would have had visible skull. The stuff smells TERRIBLE before you even add the developer.I am not a novice colorist. I was licensed for years, but changed careers to get off of my feet. I have colored my naturally brown hair every shade between platinum blond and jet black over the past 20 years using a myriad of brands and formulas, but I have NEVER smelled or felt anything like this horrible product. This was THE WORST hair coloring experience I have ever had."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mega Blondes mega sucks","review":"I know everyone is different, but I've been bleaching/coloring my hair for years, usually at the salon. I wanted to save some money so bought the mega blondes in lightest ivory. My mom applied it for me, she's a hairdresser. First of all, it smelled SO awful. It was runny runny runny, and burned my scalp like I've never been burned before. I am usually pretty tough but was feeling a lot of pain but decided to just let it hurt and leave it on for 45 minutes. It did lighten my hair pretty well but just was not worth the smell and burns. My scalp had blisters all over it and took a week to heal. I started going back to my hairdresser and told her about it, she flipped out saying I'm lucky I have hair after all that. So yeah, never again will I ever purchase this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great! Cheaper than the \\"chair\\"!!","review":"I really like this product. Never leaves me orange or brassy. Gives great lift and doesn't irritate my scalp. I usually just do a root touch up every 4 or 5 weeks, put conditioner on my ends before I start and my hair is in great shape. MUCH better shape then when I was paying salon prices for highlights (so much breakage) and I'm not stuck in the chair for hours on end and paying over $100 a visit! You really do need to leave on for the full 45 minutes to get the best results. I have noticed if I get it on my skin (like behind my ears) it does burn, but doesn't burn my scalp at all. I do use WEN cleansing conditioner instead of shampoo, and i'm sure that has something to do with the condition of my hair and scalp. I use MB5 Champagne Blonde."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent tutorial","review":"TASCAM says any idiot can use it out of the box. I'm not any idiot. I've used AMPEX 300 multi track recorders since my days at CHESS Records in Chicago. I was beyond whelmed when I bought the TASCAM DP 02. I could not figure it out! The manual assumes that the buyer knows a LOT about digital recording. I don't.The DVD put it all in place with a very intelligent walk through. I found out that it can do things magical that the manual doesn't even address.If you're gonna buy a TASCAM DP 02 or DP 02/CF, You gotta get the DVD even if you are experienced in digital recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must!","review":"I would not have made it to first base without the tutorial. Sometimes you will feel he is not explaining the whole process- but he is actually covering topics in the order of the manual. Do what he does; NOT what you want to do! And it will all come together.Songwriters can often have a challenge recording vocals and the instrument at separate times. I wish he had shown a bit more real life (me) kind of stuff. When you record guitar and vocals at the same time- panning, for example, is an issue. Tip: It's not as simple as left and right; because some guitar is on the vocal and some vocal may be on the guitar- you might need to pan both to the left-ish side to find the middle with your hearing! Let the Force be your guide. . .I started from scratch, technologically cursed and am having some success. I see the light at the end of the tunnel thanks to this tutorial."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely better than the manual","review":"The goofball in the video must like the sound of his own voice. His instructions are somewhat limited as he will perform a function without telling you what button he is pressing and the video shot of the Tascam doesn't show the whole unit so at times you are left wondering which button did he press."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny Stuff","review":"This DVD really has some funny stuff on it. The movie is set up in mock documentary format and is really packed with laughs. A pretty much must have for any b-movie fan. The special features are as good as any DVD out there. For anyone who is a fan of EI, Troma, or other B-Movies of today you will really get a kick out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cameos in a great comedy","review":"It's a different kind of funny from Gervais' UK The Office, but it is still hilarious and the cameos he gets are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop whining !","review":"I didn't buy the first two seasons because I knew they were going to release the seasons and the finale as a single package. When I watched the office on BBC America I purchased season 1 only to have it come out with the special and season 2. I still have the single season and the complete series.

I was disappointed to find that there was only one DVD in the first season set. Although the insert described the contents of each of the TWO DVD's there was only the first. There was not even a place in the case for a second DVD. I already had the first season (both DVD's) so I never bothered to try to send it back but was amazed at the lack of quality control."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't advise ordering this.","review":"This was too depressing to be a good comedy and yet had just enough humor to prevent it from ever being a greek tragedy. I have seen RG in other things and have enjoyed his performances greatly. This, however, will never be viewed again by me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extra cool","review":"The best comedy around, hilarious, smart and at times extremely profound. This was an excellent price for all episodes.The special features in themselves would warrant their own DVD, and are often as funny as the episodes themselves. I would recommend this to anyone with an inkling of wit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only downer is too few episodes.","review":"Of course fans of \\"The Office\\" would naturally gravitate to Gervais's humor in \\"Extras\\".

Similarites abound... a comedy sans laugh track with celebrities portraying obnoxious versions of themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good News","review":"On Ricky Gervais' website it says that he has got HBO to release the finale on its own and not just part of the boxset.

The dance mix is great. Between this and Afterglow, they are always being played and I have almost every single CD of McLachlan's. It is so refreshing that you can take your music and mix it up and appeal to another group of people. My friend is in the music business and has his own musicians for clients and he even brought this CD. I applaud Sarah McLachlan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Somehow it all works!","review":"I have recently discovered Sarah McLachlan's music and it's been a revelation. The songwriting (words and music) and the vocals are heartfelt and effective. Most of her songs have memorable lines and the vocals are hauntingly beautiful. The thought of a \\"Remix\\" album of her music didn't sound like a good thing at first but I was pleasantly surprised. Most tracks have been remixed fully understanding the real emotion/feel behind that particular song - resulting in an album that is deep and sincere yet produces some good, upbeat tracks. Overall, very good fusion of singer-songwriter type songs and modern electronically produced music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy if you plan to play on computer or portable device","review":"I LOVE Sarah and was excited for the CD. I'm very disappointed that it skips on my computer, despite the fact that my system meets the requirements detailed in the CD's software. While I understand they must combat piracy, they need to find a way that works. I PAID for the CD and I still can't listen to it! I'm also disappointed that Amazon does not indicate when a CD contains this garbage, so that I'll know what NOT to buy in the future. This CD is being returned to Amazon tomorrow!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time!","review":"Sorry... but this album is just not going anywhere.I was looking for some good dance mixes having heard Delerium's version of \\"Silence\\".

For anyone expecting the non-stop electro beat of the first Remixed album, originally released in '01, this is bound to be a major disappointment.Don't know who conceived of this project, but it cracks me up to think that somebody thought that Sarah shared a fan base with the Black-Eyed Peas. I guess anything is possible-but I just don't know whom this was targeted towards. I do confess that Vox (Tom Middleton mix)has caught my attention enough to be included in a compilation I just completed and hence I'm giving two stars for it alone. I guess if you have to own everything that has Sarah's name attached to it, then be my guest. Otherwise, stick with the original Remixed. Like the other reviewers, I'm hoping she can stop playing with her husband and the baby long enough to pen some new material. Isn't it funny how being angst-free can suddenly bring your song-writing career to a screeching halt?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Biggest Letdown","review":"I bought this cd at Best Buy today out of impulse. I love Fumbling Towards Ecstacy, Surfacing, Afterglow, etc... so I thought some awesome club mixes of some of her songs would be awesome... Well... not exactly.There is not one standout track on this compilation.Save your money and just buy her studio and live albums. A great artist but these remixes are far from enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talent wasted","review":"If you are a mainstream fan of Sarah McLachlan then you will not enjoy this album. Most of the songs are so electronic and dubbed that her vocals are wasted on the tracks. I am an electronic music fan but I felt that the songs we already so obscure by themselves it seemed odd when the vocals would come in. The cd is confusing. She really needs to start penning tracks again and quit relying on other people to produce/remix her more money from old music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Am I listening to the same CD as the other reviewers???","review":"I love Sarah McLachlin, and I don't even mind her remix albums, but this album was the worst thing I have ever listened to. When the CD started, I thought there was something wrong with it, because it was playing two totally different songs. They couldn't have been the same song, because the rhythm totally did not match. If you can't even remix the vocals to match the rhythm of your \\"music,\\" why bother putting in the vocals at all?? This was the biggest waste of $$ I made this year! It is going into the garbage!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"First a crappy 8th grade poetry album and now this","review":"I WAS a big Sarah fan since the FTE days.Some of the remixes done by RITM and the remix of Silence which is not a strictly Sarah track, but we all know that.This album is absolute crap.There are two remixes on the Album that are worth their weight.08 - sarah mclachlan - answer (talvin singh mix)09 - Fallen (Gabriel Dresden Anti-Gravity Mix)Everything else is bottom rung IMO and even these two only stand out like nickles in cow manure.I could not stand the 8th grand ryme and pantamater of the last album and this album is the edm equivilent.Let her go, shes done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who thought this was a good idea?","review":"Leave the hip hop to rappers.

It is known to crash computers and open a backdoor to malicious hackers!I love Sarah, but she has (unwittingly, I hope) had this cd released containing the most sleazy, invasive spyware ploy ever foisted by a major corporation on the American public.

Maybe soon Sarah will grace us with more original material."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something New?","review":"I agree with the other review that said this is enough! It's been almost 8 years and she's done NOTHING new. You can't release 200 best of CD's of the same album. Who wants 75 cds of the song Possssion? It's downright pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Give In!!!","review":"I love Sarah McLachlan's music, but at some point we have to say enough is enough. Her new to retred ratio is out of wack. Since Surfacing in 1997, we've had 1 studio album (Afterglow), 2 remix CDs, 2 live CDs, and 1 acoustic CD. Stop buying rehashed music and hold out for new tunes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apparently some of you don't get it","review":"The one-star reviews aren't so much for the content on this album as they are for the fact that Sarah has released another filler record. She's a joke, anyway. She can't come up with new material so she decides to offer her fans a lame remix album? Talk about a sell-out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this album","review":"As long as Sarah is on Sony I will never again purchase one of her albums. This spyware, copy protection scheme is borderline illegal, it's intrusive, and makes playing the music I paid for a pain in the behind.Some of the tracks are good, but not worth putting spyware on your machine. Just go download them.Don't support companies that violate your privacy, and don't support artists that accept fat contracts from said companies."},{"rating":"2","title":"BLOOMING beauty","review":"I absolutely LOVE Sarah McLachlan.

I feel bad for ya, folks, I really do. Because what I see here is a pretty interesting take on Sarah's music and voice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sarah","review":"Thanks to the record companies' greed and decision to include crippling copy-protection software on this disc, this is the first Sarah McLachlan album I haven't purchased. I listen to CD's at home, but at work and elsewhere I mostly use my mp3 player, and it was easier to find an illegal copy of the album than it would be to drive to a store, buy the CD, and then search google to find someone's instructions on how to bypass the copy protection just so I could listen to the album away from home.Have record company suits ever been fans? Somehow I doubt it."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT CD 10 ++ STARS","review":"This CD is the hottest cd out on the market for remixes... it is #1 in my car and home CD player..

They did not. They are moderately comfortable, yes, but so are many shoes. I would have expected at this price for the soles to hold up for at least a year of moderate use. They did not. For something so expensive that calls itself a \\"Walking Shoe\\", this is inexcusable. I walked with these shoes approximately 15-20 miles per week in good weather on sidewalks and pavement. Within 9 months the outer rubber had worn through the on both heels and under the balls of both feet. At 12 months, the holes at each section had grown to the point where dirt and water were easily getting into the shoes and walking was downright uncomfortable. I've owned shoes that were $300 less expensive than these and that lasted 5 times as long. These are, without question, the most overpriced and terribly constructed shoes I have ever owed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprise!","review":"The arches of these shoes are much too high for me.

In what direct way, for instance, are Hitler's water colors related to the circumstances of his death? This book's most important information (who found Hitler's body, how Hitler died, where Hitler was buried, something I found of particular interest) should have been summarized in a two-page weekly news magazine article somewhere. Obviously, however, the authors felt that to read their exclusive but well-padded research should cost at least $20 or so, therefore, here it is, in book form. History buffs may want this book for the inserts and for what few pages actually contain fresh, well-presented information, but the curious who just want to know more about Hitler's last days should visit their library or borrow a copy from a friend-- who, I'm sure, won't mind lending it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting, BUT...Disappointing","review":"This is a fascinating topic, a real detective story for one of history's mysteries. (Though the mystery angle is not so great, just some minor twists and turns.) There is much in this volume that has been covered before---and done better (Trevor-Roper and O'Donnell, for example). The authors' arguments are poorly stated, disjointed, repetitive, and not particularly convincing. (Though they are probably---more or less---correct.) There's a rushed, let's-get-this-one-together-fast feel to the book (it's typos are both numerous and inexcusable). Essentially, what we've got going here is a refresher course. Interesting enough, but the billing far exceeds what's delivered between the covers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of examples","review":"I guess it's an ok book, has a lot of examples, but not a perfect explanation though, I think you should only buy it if you do have the habit to look over lots of problems"},{"rating":"2","title":"More than just a PODCAST Studio","review":"This package comes with everything you need to not only create Podcasts, it's also great for starting a homerecording studio.

This product is packaged well and pretty, but that's where it ends. Support is lacking from Behringer. Literature for set up was nearly non-existent and ALL the software that came with the product was outdated. I could not get the microphone (input) to be heard by the person on the other phone. I had an extremely difficult time getting through to the company support staff for help. Once I finally got through, there were only empty promises that a representative would call me back for assistance. Money and time wasted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical & easy to use.","review":"I bought this item as a gift for my brother by December and he likes it.it has a good sound for regular rehearsal use, when recording, the sound is very clean...

When the Samson \\"plug and play\\" co1u and 3, for whatever reason didn't work for me I was so sad but thought well, I've heard good things about this product so I tried it. Although it works with my computer the sound quality is awful. The headphones, mic and stand are very cheap, which wouldn't be so bad if the sound quality was better. Sadly I cannot return it due to policy. However, I'm sure I will be able to use the audio interface and mixer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I purchased this product because of the reviews I have read. I do voice overs and I podcast as well. This set up is perfect for me. The headphones are pretty good, I like the fact that on the headphone you can unscrew the plug and use the smaller plug for other applications such as a mp3 player. The microphone works quite well! The board itself is perfect in my opinion. It gets the job done. It also came with a software bundle that is very useful. My order was delivered on time. I am very pleased with my purchase! The price is right too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended!","review":"I would suggest this product to anyone looking to do their own podcast. The hardware was easy to use and it sounds great.

I would highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product, clear sound, almost easy set up","review":"This is the first podcast kit I ever bought, if you don't count the 3 usb headsets to purchased before. A video I found online helped me configure everything. The sound is nice and clear (Stop the fighting in Gaza!) and works well with Skype. I would purchase this again. Once I get the hang of all the features, I'm sure I'll upgrade if Behringer has another model. If you are serious about Podcasting, (End the fighting in Palestine!) I recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Many Mistakes","review":"While this book is a cheaper alternative to the hardcover, there are many mistakes in the printing. There are little dots where there should be parentheses, brackets and square root signs in the problem section. It makes the problems hard to understand if you do not know what symbols are supposed to be there. If you are using this for a class, make sure have someone else's book to compare it to. I know it is not just my book because everyone with the soft cover in my class has the same problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine for School","review":"This is a fine book for learning Euclidean and non-Euclidean geometry.

Me, I like Cider House and Widow better.Irving sure can write a good story, and he never leaves a loose end; everything in his books is there for a purpose, and there's virtually no such thing as an insignificant character or event.Cider House is really a morality play beginning in an orphanage that fronts for an abortion clinic. Homer, one of the orphans, grows up there, leaved to follow a girl he's fallen in love with on 1st sight, and becomes beholden and attached to her, her boyfriend, and her family, a family that runs 'an apple business' and hires migrant workers during picking and cider time. The story follows Homer, who seems to be following nothing much (but he's sure not leading!), throughout his life until well into adulthood, and every bit of it counts.And the movie's good, too, with Michael Caine as the infamous ether-addicted doctor in the orphanage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tied for my favorite book of all time","review":"Irving makes me cry and laugh more than any other author I know. Poignancy without sappiness; Irreverance without cynicism. His characters will be your daily companions years after you finish reading this book for the 2nd, 3rd or 4th time."},{"rating":"2","title":"a book which makes you think","review":"Having been a reader of Irving for a long time, Cider House Rules srarted a real debate in me. He made the abortion issue at once heartrending, sad, and, strangely, very, very funny. Above all, I felt a compassion for the human spirit shining through all the way.It made me want to reach out to the poor women and comfort them. Homer is a very unlikely hero, but so lovable. What an amazing writer: I only hope the film does the book justice: the Garp film failed miserably. Read this book: it makes your previous prejudices about the abortion issue vanish like clouds before the sun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Well Written!","review":"This book was very intriguing, and very well written. It dealt with how hard it can be for someone to love both the men and her life and to have to choose. It also deals with an older doctor who runs a orphan and an abortion clinic at the same time; he has a hard time expressing his love for a young man who eventually leaves, and also deals with an ether addiction he's had for most of his life. It is a great book and I'd recommend it to most people. Although I think it would better suit older teenagers and adults, just to understand the entire thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Question on Title","review":"It was a wonderful, meaningful book which I intend to read again. I wonder if any of the other readers or the author would like to comment on the meaning of the title The Cider House Rules."},{"rating":"1","title":"rather boring","review":"I really don't understand why all of the other readers gave this book such high ratings. This was the first John Irving book that I have ever read, and I was extremely disappointed. I could not even finish reading it, I got halfway through, only to find myself struggling to complete each chapter. The first half of the book was interesting - I enjoyed Homer's experiences at the orphanage, but once he left, the \\"spark\\" was gone, and I found the remainder of the book to be nothing but dull and monotonous. I certainly hope this book is not exemplary of Irving's best writings. Although his writing style shows talent, the plot of this novel does not."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Irving Is God!","review":"I love Irving and have enjoyed every word of his I have ever read. Thankfully I have yet to run out of John Irving to read - I pace myself so I wont run out too soon. Anyhow, Cider House Rules certainly did not disappoint! This is a beautiful story that of course the movie just can't do justice too. Although the story told here is probably not one most of us have lived. The theme of growing up and growing away is something most of us can understand. Be sure to read the book before you see the movie - both are good in there own way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cider House Rules, Lauck's Review","review":"John Irving's book The cider House Rules is a classic depervation how random life can be. Irving uses Homer as the central player in this love is life game. Irving keeps the reader interested by using unique sexual motifs as catch points and an unpredictable begining phrase of 'abortion' to initaily draw the reader in. Along with sex being the plot of the story there are also inner theames of drug abuse, child abuse, adoption, love, death,and happiness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I had really looked forward to reading this book. I had heard many great things about Irving and am interested in the issue of abortion. I was very frustrated with the characters' inability to take charge of their lives; they were all so unwilling to change that they had no chance of happiness. Also, I thought that most of the characters lacked complexity. Also, prochoice or prolife, I don't think this book promotes a level of complex thinking on the aborition issue or could alter anyone's perspective. For me, this book became a chore to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"HUGE DISAPPOINTMENT","review":"The Cider House Rules was one of the worst books I've ever subjected myself to read. I felt as if I was not getting into the heads of any of the characters. I was not feeling, even though Wilbur was devastated of losing a \\"son\\" in Homer I could care less. Usually with any well written books I am completely entranced, turning the pages one after another, swept in emotions. With this novel I would rather watch a movie for the fifth time or a television show rerun. I would seriously suggest not reading this particular Irving novel,but rather a worthwhile book such as, A Prayer For Owen Meany, or A Widow for One Year. These are meaningful, interesting books that you will not fall asleep reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to finish","review":"I'm a John Irving fan but this book is very bad. I bought this book, in part, because of the customer reviews on this site. What in the world are you people thinking. This is Irving's worst book. If you have never read a book by Irving please go directly to \\"Owen Meany\\" at least you will be able to finish that book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree...","review":"with Valerie Barbour. This book was very disappointing. It was slow, boring, and depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star","review":"It is disheartening to pick up a book that is well-rated by so many and find that it is unendurable. I can see why a 15-year old might find this book entertaining, but why would an adult spend any time with it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The quick and the dead are identical in this book.","review":"With the exception of Dr. John Larch, Homer Wells, and Melony, all of the characters in this book are as thin as the paper they are printed on. It is a novel, so things happen, but nothing really matters or has any effect on anyone's life. Not so that you care about it. One couple arrives to take in Homer, and you know that they are going to die at the first hint of danger. They do. Once again Homer hitchhikes back to the orphanage. These three are all attached to the orphanage by some kind of umbilical cord. The nurses and the other orphans barely exists since their character developement is so poor. This book and its author have joined my list of books/authors that I will never read another word of. There are far too many adequate books to read to bother with this book. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"to me the Cider House Rules is more of Grotesque literature in a good sense. It is carnal, brutal and intense. It is straight forward as well as you do not feel surprised by the style. The feeling throughout is of involvement... Worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book! Ever!","review":"I reviewed this book after I watched the film played by Tobey. I think the book is much more interesting than the film. The story about an Orphan house always drives me crazy but this version turns out to be the greatest. I think the world Homer came to discover was only of the darksides. It wasn't fair to him that everybody considered him belong to the house, he deserved better than that. The world the Author created for him was so unfair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving...deeply human","review":"As ever, Irving's characters struggle and stumble through their lives while carrying us along with them quite willingly. I never want his stories to end, and I can't ever forget his characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book bites!","review":"Don't get me wrong I'm a pretty big Irving fan. This story just doesn't develop meaningfuly the way Owen Meany or Hotel New Hapshire does. To be honest I have never been able to force myself to finish this book in spite of numerous efforts. I guess it says something about Hollywood when someone resorts to making a movie out of this loser."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best novels ever!!","review":"Just loved Cider House, savored every word and felt the characters were alive. So, so sad to finish it. Irving is a fabulous storyteller, makes you laugh and cry. I have read hundreds if not thousands of books and this is in my top 20."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cider House a disappointing read.","review":"I'm afraid I have to disagree with the majority of the other reviews. I had high hopes upon reading the first several chapters, but was disappointed with the final outcome. The characters turned out a bit pathetic and ridiculous with the exception of Melony.Too many stereotypical, over dramatized situations were used to address the abortion issue leaving the political points to be unconvincing either way. Including ignorant immigrants, shallow snobbish wealthy people, and a eccentric prostitute, none of which, touched on the \\"everyday\\" women and men who deal with this issue. Candy who was, perhaps, supposed to represent the \\"average\\" young woman in trouble, began as independent and forward thinking but, ended up annoying and indecisive.The characters were initially unusual and colorful, but without development, did not hold my interest. Cider House Rules was a story with potential, but fizzled out half way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Brilliant","review":"This book transformed my way of thinking. I have always thought of John Irving as one of the most fascinating writers of our time. He simply describes everything! I truly enjoyed the \\"Cider House Rules\\" everything about it kept me pining for more.The character Homer Wells as well as the Doctor who saved his life was the most interesting. Homer's simple desire to feel love and wanted transcends everything around him. He chooses early on to not allow this to become a catalyst in his life. But finds minute ways to offer a minimal existence in the arms of the woman that he loves.In all good novels it is a pity when the story fails to end in the way in which you would expect. However, when I ask myself the question as to whether this was one of Irving's best works I would still have to give a resounding YES! Just like in his other novel \\"The World According to Garp\\" . . . Irving leaves his readers just craving for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"I GIVE THIS BOOK 5+ STARS","review":"This novel is by far the best of all the John Irving novels. I can say this because I have read them all. This book was incredible. I don't agree with many of the decisions made in this book but I find them to be incredibly realistic and not crazy. Besides the maybe objectionable content found in this book, I give it 5+ stars and recommend to any fans of John Irving or anyone who saw the movie and liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, don't buy the \\"library binding\\" edition.","review":"A great book and worthwhile having in proper hardcover. Do not buy the \\"library binding\\". I did, and to my dismay it is a rebound paperback edition. It is small and the paper is poor quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hated to see it end..............","review":"What a wonderful novel! I truly cried with this one! It brought out emotions that I didn't even know I had. As I read on (this is a long one), I felt like I was part of the \\"family\\" and knew everyone on a personal level. My heart ached for Dr. Larch when Homer left, and when Melony finally came back.....oh boy! This book starts out slow and frankly, at first, I didn't know if I was going to stick with it or not (I did get tired of hearing about the pony picture), but gradually, it kept getting better and better, until it got to the point that I couldn't wait to get back to it every night - there are not too many books like that for me - this is a wonderful story - you will not be sorry to get this one and begin to become part of the orphanage at St. Clouds - truly a heart warming read."},{"rating":"2","title":"You will miss the characters when the book is finished.....","review":"The Cider House Rules has become the novel by which I will judge all future novels. Its characters are written with warmth and truth, and the story has a resonance that is as bold as it is simple. You will read it over and over again, just in case you missed something the first or tenth time, and each time you read it, you will feel a sense that you are rejoining friends. Do not hesitate to buy this book. It is wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what a book should be.","review":"I can't believe that there was even one person who thought this was a poor book. It was without exception the best book I have read in a very long time. Irving's writing skill stopped me cold many time. There were simple sentences that took my breath away. I purposely limited the amount of pages I read in a day. I never wanted it to end. Like all books that I think are good, I have no plans to see the movie. I have yet to see a movie do justice to the written word."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tangy like good cider!","review":"Although I closed the back cover on Owen Meany and opened the front cover of Cider House, I found myself loving Homer with similar warmth to my feelings for Owen. Religious themes were a strong undercurrent to both books. In Cider House, the diversity of approaches to the issue of abortion was presented within the context of love, concern and respect for the participants. Refreshing!Different than Owen, I had some difficulty feeling connection to the characters who were presented in the latter part of the book. Although they were useful in fleshing out the theme that all of us have rules in our lives which we circumvent and/or change, I found myself feeling unsympathetic to some of their lives.Cider House was still a good read and boosted me on to perusing other Irving novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost no comparison....","review":"John Irving has done it again. Wow. What I loved about this book was the suspense. And the tension. The only book I've ever read that I thought had more suspense and tension than this one was \\"One of the Guys\\" by Robert Clark Young. To which Irving was compared on the dust jacket. But I would have to say this Irving novel is right up there!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cider House Rules: Inside Out","review":"John Irving's work has tantalized my imagination for ten years. He knows his characters inside out. I enjoy knowing that his empathy with every character, his poignant- omniscient-inside-their-skin point of view will give me the trip that I yearn for. I lie down at night to sleep and hear \\"Good night, you princes of Maine, you kings of New England\\" and smell apples. No writer has ever affected me so deeply."},{"rating":"2","title":"Taking On A Tough Issue","review":"Fast & Furious Book PromotionFor me, the power of John Irvine's \\"The Cider House Rules\\" is how the story has stayed with me. Irvine's characters are people I connected with and the story kept me entertained. But why the story stays with me is the theme Irvine decided to write about, mainly the abortion issue. I was brought up in a firm republican, pro-life household but as an adult I often realize how an ideal can sometimes create unsavory results. Because John Irvine took on this subject, I was able to form my own opinion about abortion, which is basically that it should be legal (pro-choice) and then we should do all in our power as a society to help men and women not to choose abortion."},{"rating":"2","title":"DELIBERATELY DETAILED!","review":"You can never say the John Irving, doesn't give you your money's worth. I just finished C.H.R and I will say that it is a heavier read,and more complex than GARP, But that is not to say it wasn't grand. I have yet to find a writer who can spread words like warm butter, his sentences roll off the tongue with ease.I haven't seen the movie yet and I will look for it now and to compare notes. I loved this novel, the characters are so vivid and real, the settings, even down to the smells are so clear in this book. It reads like a thousand page novel, but in only 600 pages. There is so much vivid and important detail that it is simple amazing. Irving is one great writer. His story's are so rich. I hope he will write more and more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prepare to be assimilated.","review":"This is the book that wrestles with 'A Prayer for Owen Meany' to sit atop the best of Irving's works. Once again, kooky characters so detailed that they seem surreal amble through life nonplussed at the insanity surrounding them.Homer Wells is the world's oldest orphan in the Saint Cloud's orphanage run by Wilbur Larch, dedicated doctor and ether addict. The story of Well's experiences growing up in and numerous excursions away from St. Cloud's is an epic one, spanning many years and a World War. Irving breathes life into his cast, and they seem to live entire lives of their own accord. You are not turning pages, but marking the passing years of existence for these amazing creations.Reading this book is like treading into quicksand. You tentatively place your foot on the first page, and are mercilessly sucked into another world you will not escape until the last word is read."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite","review":"I have read a thousand books but never before have I read such a beautiful and touching story. I loved the characters as if they were my family, I even hated them at times for the same reason. The thing about this book that is so different from all the others I have read is the fact that it forever changed me. Dr. Larch's reasons for being prochoice became mine. It depeicts a world where such a right is denied in such a realistic fashion. It is honest with every word and gives such a variety of characters to relate to. If you only read one book in your lifetime, make it this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"a masterpiece","review":"This is the best book I've ever read. I read it first in 1986, and again a few years ago after gaining some life experience (and two children). Irving's work here says more about \\"morality\\" (i.e., the \\"rules\\") than anything I've ever read. It works on several levels, and comes together beautifully . It is not for the faint of heart, nor for the close-minded. Unfortunately, nothing Irving has written since comes close to this. And a bit of advice -- read the book first!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than GARP, but no NEW HAMPSIRE or OWEN MEANY","review":"I found CIDER HOUSE to be a very entertaining, enriching novel. I did feel that classic Irving attachment to the characters, but I didn't find the characters themselves as fascinating, funny, sad, tragic, etc, as the characters Irving created for HOTEL NEW HAMPSHIRE and OWEN MEANY. Plus, I felt the pace of CIDER HOUSE tended to drag about halfway-to-3/4's of the way through. It was not as biting as HOTEL and didn't pack the emotional punch of OWEN. Still, a fantastic book. Of the four I've read, I would rate OWEN first, HOTEL NEW HAMPSIRE second, CIDER HOUSE third and GARP fourth. Can't wait to pick up another one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the VERY few books that gets full stars from me","review":"Wow. This book, and Margaret Atwood's A Handmaid's Tale, are the only two books IN MY LIFE that I simply could not put down. I finally finished Cider House Rules last night, and now my life can go on. Powerful! Insightful! Complex! Complete! As a woman, as a reader, as a person with socialist leanings, thank you, Irving! My faith in fiction writers has been restored. Everyone: READ THIS BOOK. You will not regret this one, I promise you that."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sublime view on very personal issues","review":"Not quite as charming, witty and entertaining as Garp and A Prayer for Owen Meany, this novel is somewhat distinctive from Irving's earlier books. It deals with essential issues of humanity and, thus, leaves the reader in a state of reflection. It is definitely worth being read. This novel entails a very specific tension: the gap between entertainment and the requirement, imposed upon the reader, to render moral decicions. This tension is finally resolved in the genuine, typical Irving style - magnificent."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow - overwhelming book that makes you think!","review":"I enjoyed reading this book. It really makes you rethink your ideas about abortion as the main character does."},{"rating":"1","title":"preaching to the choir","review":"Irving here waxes righteous over womens' right to choose-- a worthy enough cause, but, get serious, how many readers of fiction need to be convinced? This book, like pretty much everything since GARP, is overwritten, cumbersome, panders to the kleenex-toting audienceship, and it lacks almost entirely the vital, exciting, effervescent imaginative wildness that blazed through GARP, appeared in, oh, 50% of HOTEL NH, and has since been AWOL in Irving's writing. Once again, popularity and wide readership diverge from lasting literary value, with Irving and his ardent devotees taking the road more traveled by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious","review":"I managed to get through the first 300 pages and decided I could not bear to go on. I did not care what happened to Homer or anyone else. I have placed this book in a box labeled \\"In Case I Ever Go To Prison\\" or get stranded on a barren island. Then I will be able and more than willing to finish this and other tedious books I have tried to get through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother reading this book","review":"This was one of the worst books I ever read. I really enjoyed Owen Meaney and thought I'd give Irving another shot - what a mistake. The mind-numbing repetition of the same theme over and over for 600 + pages and the obvious plot development were pure torture. None of the characters were sympathetic - it was hard to care about any of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pro-Choice Classic","review":"I'm pro-choice because my working-class family lost my grandmother's sister to a backstreet abortion during the thirties, and my mother is named after her. I loved this book because it captures the stories of women who lived through that dark period of western history. I liked the deeply human characterisation of Doctor Larch, flaws and all, and I found it interesting that Homer changed his mind at the end when his anti- abortion viewpoints collided with reality.I'm glad that some anti-abortion readers liked the fact that the book was well-written, which it is. I can't wait for the movie, either."},{"rating":"2","title":"a delightful Irving novel, but not his best effort","review":"Plainly put, John Irving writes delightful fiction. His characters are interesting (and quirky), and invariably he finds something funny about everyday people, places and things. The Cider House Rules has all this. It also has a way of disarming the very contentious abortion/pro-life issue without taking itself too seriously.However for John Irving newbies I suggest proceeding directly to Owen Meany. That (later) work of Irving is much more moving, and is considered by many to be his masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"What is isn't what always what's right","review":"I am reading TCHR for the 2nd time (before I see the movie) and I have been reawakened to the wonderfully layered characterizations and world of John Irving's Maine.This book is one of the most meaningful pieces of fiction I have ever read.Abortion (and its 'rightness or wrongness') is just a piece of the story. Even though I am for choice, I recommended the book to friend who is staunchly against abortion. We both loved it.The story is about the choices and rules we set for ourselves and how they, occasionally, conflict with the ones we actually follow.Most readers can identify at some level with this and feel sad and redeemed at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ironic Irving","review":"What an imagination John Irving has. In his short story 'Trying to Save Piggy Snead' we get an inkling of an idea as to why and how he can write the way he does. No doubt this book will be repopularized by the movie version. John Irving has done his best to 'protect' the story line and characters as he has written the screenplay. Notwithstanding the fact that it is easy and entertaining to just lean back and watch it on the big screen... the Cider House Rules is better told in the novel. You will not be disappointed by the movie or the novel...but by far the novel is a richer and more rewarding story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Plot, No Strong Characters","review":"I started out with much anticipation but was disappointed with this novel. The novel starts out with strong characters and a strong plot but weakens miserably by the end. It's as if the author could not finish the story and did patchwork on it. The only character in the book that is strong is the old doctor's. The story is completely unbelivable in any age and time. You do not feel for the characters (except for the old doctor). In this era of discussion regarding abortion, the only thing the book accomplishes is highlighting the plight of women who could not make their own choices due to the government rules. Other than that it is a complete disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Whew! I finally got through it!","review":"I found this book literate but boring. I felt nothing for the characters. I thought the whole medical descriptions part unneccesary and gimmicky. I found it repetitious and predictable and and cliched. I felt it needed a good editing, so I will rent the movie when it comes out to see what the editors did with it. Oh well. I bought it on a little island in Greece where there weren't a lot of choices for English language novels. Next time I'll be sure to bring along enough reading material so I don't get stuck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully written and a soon to be classic","review":"John Irving has such style in the way he invents his characters and makes them come alive. After A Prayer to Owen Meany, The Hotel Hampshire and others, I was particularly moved by this book. So much that I went to see the movie, and was hugely disappointed by it. This book goes in such detail, that no good movie producer could ever recreate the atmosphere and creativity John Irving managed to brilliantly produce for the reader. Whether the reader is for or against abortion, Irving doesn't go into the politics of deciding for us; on the other hand, the book lets us decide for ourselves, reflecting in a neutral, colorful tone that makes other books in 'mass-market' today pale in comparison. It was a truly delightful read, and an eye opener."},{"rating":"2","title":"New to Irving","review":"This book is wonderful (I have 50 pages left). I am new to John Irving's novels, and am curious to read more. While the book dragged at certain points, overall it was a heart-touching tale of orphans and the only man who devotes himself to them. As for the abortion theme, it was definitely an apropos subject to touch upon in this novel. With Dr. Larch as the \\"master\\" and Homer as the \\"student\\" they still remain quite their own persons (notably in relation to their views on abortion), and have stark differences which makes their relationship compelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one will move you!","review":"This book is a roller-coaster ride of emotion. It will make you laugh and cry. John Irving has this uncanny way of taking you off your gaurd, and then shocking you with some enlightening tid bit. The main character is an orphan, and if you've read many of Irving's novels, this is no great surprise. However, this particular story of a monastic young man, and his growth into adulthood is inspiring. It lends hope to the hopeless and security to the insecure. It's plainly a good story... we need more of those."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fabulously unexceptional effort.","review":"John Irving succeeded at writing a miserably mundane work that fails at creating three dimensional characters, a dynamic between said characters, and anything beyond the revelations a typical child has on a slow day. The only saving grace of The Cider House Rules remains to be the author's notes that grace the end of the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Irvings best one to date","review":"I never thought that I would enjoy reading a book which centers around abortion but I more than enjoyed it. This disturbing but poinent novel made me think. And that's all you can ask."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book with deep topics","review":"This is no light read. If you like to read books that address topics like abortion, lesbian relationships, incest,and violence then this is the book for you. The characters are very well done. All of the characters are interesting and you can't help but care what happens to each of them. The graphic medical details I could have done without but like another reviewer said, this book will stay with you. It will also make you think."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Good Read","review":"One of the most entertaining and vivid books ever written, you'll actually feel a sense of regret realizing it has to end. Memorable characters and vivid descriptions are on every page. Irving's second best creation next to the timeless The World According to Garp (another modern classic). The equally excellent movie adaption covers less time than this (Melony and Angel are absent in the film), but the book can be savored for a week or two like all fine works of literature. Try to drag the experience out for more than 6 or 7 days to fully feel the story and the people. You can almost see them sitting next to you in real life. One of the strongest arguments out there to keep abortion legal. Just have any pro lifer read this a few times to make the point that women should never be told by law what to do with their own bodies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Irving","review":"This is my favorite of Irving's novels, thought Owen Meany is a close second. I couldn't put it down when I read it. As for the movie, from what I've heard, it's probably a textbook example of the movie being nowhere near as good as the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cider House","review":"My latest Amazon bookSeveral years (no a long time ago} I saw the movie of the same name.It was truly a great film and won several awards.The book which I just recently read is far better.No writer has the knack of giving you details that are as interesting .I have started to reread his other works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought Provoking","review":"I enjoyed this read very much. Lots to think about here - beyond the story. Highly recommend. Look forward to reading more by John Irving."},{"rating":"2","title":"No sugar here","review":"I chose to read this novel because a professor thought it would fit my literature tastes. He couldn't have been more correct. Irving tells things how it is. It's not sugar coated and it's realistc to it's era. One can't help but feel sympathetic for the struggles and roadblocks the characters face. I also enjoyed the element of stunt journalism the novel hints at. At the time, doctors weren't allowed to perform operations that occur in the novel so from the beginning it's a risky plot and naturally draws you in because you convince yourself you HAVE to know what happened. If one wants a sappy, cliche novel this isn't the one for you. But for an avid reader, this is classic I would expect one to be able to reference."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"I read this book right after OWEN MEANY. What a wonderful read. I could not put this down like OWEN MEANY. I will most definitely will read this again. Both main characters will be remembered. READ THIS BOOK!!! The movie version is to come out this fall I believe. It is to star Toby Maguire and Charlie Therez, directed by Lasse Hallstrom. AND...the screenplay is from the author himself. I can't wait to see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating, Sincere, Heartwarming","review":"This is the first John Irving novel that I have ever read. I thought it was fantastic. The subject matter, characters, and setting were able to grab my attention immediately. I fell in love with all of the characters, especially Melony and Dr. Larch. There are several surprises along the way, and a fulfilling end to the story. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong Race, Slow Finish","review":"This was a beautifully written book I would recommend as a good read to almost anyone. Most of the time, I couldn't put it down. Even so, it had one of those endings that leaves one rather dissatisfied. I suppose that is somewhat like life but it felt a bit as if an editor was pushing him to finish. For all the detail throughout the book, I felt like many storylines were wrapped up hurriedly and without good resolution. Another 30 or 40 pages would have done it, I think. Even so, it's a very good read. The characters stay with you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enough!","review":"I found it t e d i o u s to get through this book. The character and plot development were so s l o w. Homer's choice at the end was inevitable. The abortion issue was fairly presented and well-developed."},{"rating":"2","title":"For another reviewer","review":"Another Reviewer below mine said that being an orphan 100 years ago was tough. The book did not take place 100 years ago and the scenes in the orphanage did not take place 100 years ago. Besides that, your review was good but I just wanted to clear that up. By the way I thought this book was very good. If you have read the book and not yet seen it I suggest seeing it, but it isn't nearly as good as the book. I saw the movie before I read the book and it is one of my favorite movies. I read the book, and thought it was so good that I read it again, and again. John Irving is a terrific writer and I suggest reading his others novels. Specifically, I suggest A Prayer for Owen Meany and The World According to Garp. Those are my favorites. Thank-you"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Refreshing Read","review":"This novel leaves you hungry for more. The Characters are believable and realistic. I wanted to cuddle and shield them from their reality. A senitive story with a lot of chooses. I wanted to help them.

Highly Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great source of information but...","review":"There are numerous typographical and historical errors (mostly typos) in this book that make it difficult to read. There is an Errata page provided by the author with the book that clears up the largest errors but there are still so many errors that I wonder how the editor and publisher of this book are still in business.

So I searched here on Amazon and found a great deal. When the CD arrived (pretty quick to) I threw it in the shop stereo and cranked it up. Don't know why but I was expecting a whole album of hard driving tunes, but it really wasn't. Don't get me wrong, it kicks butt. The slower songs are well composed and well played.

I'm not sure how well it would be at full speed though. I dont like to risk burning fast so i go at 2x or 2.4x most of the time. though i do have a 8x drive my max write is 4 for any media. my logic is that if it cant read faster then 8x how could it write as fast?

When received, I was concerned because one of the album covers pictured on the CD indicated that it was a MONO recording. Playback, however, was in STEREO. I was thrilled to hear the tunes from the Golden Greats album. It is a spectacular improvement over my old album that suffered through my teenage years. The only song I knew from the volume two album was The Night Has a Thousand Eyes. Even so, the quality was again excellent. I recommend this CD to all lovers of Bobby Vee Music.

The album was released in November of 2002 off of polyviny records. Although it contains only seven songs, they are well constructed. Sure the album leaves you wanting more...Kensilla's voice is completely refreshing. All of the songs on the album are slow and inspiring. If you like coldplay or travis, Owen isn't far behind. Kensilla writes and performs all of his music on the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"quit whining already and make some more good music!","review":"If it weren't for Mike Kinsella's talent and the first Owen album, I would only give No Good For No One Now a single star.

I am so disgusted with books that claim (which this one does) to provide \\"Expert Insight\\", \\"Authoritive Advice\\".... so in closing, if you're looking for a book that teaches you the wizards upside down, inside out and unsat *.txt files (for the source code which I must add are useless), then this book is for you!

Instead it is a book which aids in making the transition from VB5 to VB6. Vital information is also missing. How can a book be titled VB6 Unleashed, without any info on WebClasses and IIS Applications? A technology new to VB6. I feel this book was pushed onto the bookstore shelves early (it was one of the first) and suffers because of it. I feel \\"tricked\\" into buying a book I didn't need.

One of the many things I loved about the show was that its story arcs, its episodes, its characters all had an ebb and flow to them. Sometimes it was an action packed adventure, sometimes a far subtler intrigue, sometimes comic relief, sometimes just relaxing and enjoying themselves.This CD does not reflect that at all. Every single song except \\"A Little Less Conversation\\" assaults the senses with uptempo, loud, in-your-face music. You don't get a break! Even Wayne Newton's \\"Suspicious Minds\\"--Newton sang that song during a guest appearance in one of the early seasons, a nice, slow, soothing lounge number--well it's not that slow, it's got a fairly quick tempo, but it's something you'd want to tap your toes to while sipping at your drink.

No more, says the author, who shows step by step how to develop positive attitudes and produce wealth through careful Real Estate investment anyone can do.

The form is shown twice, from different angles, once with weight distribution information and the other time with breathing instructions. Then the form is taught, step by step, with a student and sample self defense applications of each movement are shown. Near the end, basic, beginning push hands is shown just to give a taste of the next step in T'ai-chi training. People have told me they like this video because the self defense applications are obviously not rehearsed and they give you a clear sense of this aspect of T'ai-chi."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad print","review":"While the movie is a nice, slightly absurd little noir (3-plus stars), Sinister's print is the worst I've seen.

I am surprised that more spot reviews have not been written on this group. In fact, a search of the web will find nothing but discounts on household appliances. On the subject of originality- to me there are two gigantic, but pleasing similarities. Vocalist Don Ralph must be holding a very large torch for David Byrne (Talking Heads), and to a lesser degree Fred Schneider (B-52's). Ralph possesses that dark, keening vocal style reminiscent of Byrne, and perhaps even uses a few of the other expected stylistic tricks. Other times, his natural voice comes very close to the plaintive barking of Schneider. A bit darker than much of the Heads or B-52's material, but these factors alone make this band in instant must have for any fan of those seminal 80's groups, The Talking Heads, or the B-52's.

Bought them to replace broken rails on our aging Copenhagen Office Desk. New rails were far superior to the original rails. Simple installation - rails are stamped either L (Left) or R (Right) to make things really simple, and mounting holes are all slotted. The screws they provided were small pan head phillips - I didn't think they would hold up in the manufactured wood so I replaced them with something better. The bearing slides are very smooth and when pushed under the desk the keyboard tray will latch into place resulting in a little extra force being necessary to extend the tray. On the down side, the slide extension is a bit less than I would have expected, but nothing to be concerned about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but a little pricey","review":"These are great slides. I ordered a pair of them to make some under-desk drawers for a work desk I have in the garage.

These are much sturdier, slide smoother and even look better. Plastic bumper-guards are at the end of the rails. The rails glide smoothly and \\"lock\\" into the closed position (but not the extended position). The rail height is larger than others, which makes them quite sturdy, but they do not match the width of standard 3/4\\" wooden boards. This is not a problem for me, but may bother someone concerned with aesthetics. (Confirming what another low-rated review said, there are sharp edges behind the bumper-guard that could still catch on something. For my particular desk and location, this is not a problem, but I see how it could catch on loose clothing, for example. This should be easy to fix with pliers or a little hot glue or something. Really, other keyboard sliders have all had similar sharp edges, and these rails seem much less likely to catch on something than others that I have used.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid.

I like these stands better than the \\"stand them from the bottom\\" type stands. They grip the headstock and do a great job.They are heavy duty in construction, but do fold down quite short. The guitar comes out of the stand quite easily, goes back into the stand again, quite easily. But the guitar is very stable while in the stand. I'm very protective with my guitars, and these stands are great. I don't fold them every day so I can't talk to the longevity of the clamp, but I'm very happy with them.

After more than a year they are holding up well and have never caused damage to a guitar, yet allow the players to store their instruments and retrieve them easily. The only problem we've had using them is with a guitar with a very narrow headstock (narrower than the neck). I will probably buy a few more for my personal use and for our stage as we need them. There are several models with different configurations, so check to see if it will work with your guitar if yours is unusual."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect stand for gigging","review":"OK, this stand: a) is *not* the cheapest guitar stand out there; b) doesn't fold up into a tiny ball for packing; and c) doesn't weigh something ridiculous like 52 grams. So, why do I like it so much? Because it's super sturdy, and the 'grabber' head that Hercules makes is fantastic. I'm a keyboard player as well as a guitarist, and when I switch to/from guitar, I'm usually in a hurry. These stands are well padded, and they hold the guitar neck securely.

If you're a person who loves reading and/or literature, it is impossible to consider this in the same noun-group.

Cudos to the mailing company.Next... assembly was actually pretty easy. All necessary tools are included except a screwdriver, which most everyone owns. The pieces fit together snugly.The craftsmanship is incredible. The finish is a great color that can go well with most medium to dark tones, and some lighter ones.Everything about this set reeks of quality. It is pure wood... not pressed wood or particle board.Comparative values are in the $500 to $1000 range depending on where you shop. Buying here from Amazon..

It fits perfectly. There is no way you can entertain more than 4 people at the table but I rarely have more than 4 and when I have the nights I entertain for 15 or more, I set up fold up tables. A little tacky, but no one minds when they taste my food :-).The quality is amazing for such a cheap price. I willl say the wood is very soft and dents and scratches a little easily. But, the finish, the sturdy-ness, the color, the look, and the value are all 100% top notch! Excellent piece of furniture for someone not looking to break the bank.

It starts off strong with Keep On Sailing, but the next two tracks aren't too very provocative. Satellite, the fourth track, is the best on the album (my opinion), and just about everything everything after that is (at very least) decent. The overall concept is rather Fu Manchu-ish, but at the same time there are some more technical aspects that are reminiscent of bands like Acid Bath and Agents Of Oblivion... or even Soilent Green, though never that heavy.

The acting, costumes, and set designs are stellar so the cheesy 70's TV FX can be forgiven.The thing that annoys me the most is the DVD forcing you to watch the BBC previews in the beginning.

BBC has chosen to insert some advertising for other BBC videos at the start of the DVD -- and there's no way to skip over it.

This is without question the best Dracula movie I have seen. Louis Jourdin is so perfect for this roll. The man is poised and unflappable. He radiates self-confidence and power without ever raising his voice or pulling faces. The limited special affects are nothing by today's standards, but they work really well.

There are some interesting gaps. For example, the character of Arthur Holmwood, is removed. Yet the atmosphere and landscapes used brings a chilling and yet beautiful feel to the work. Louis Jourdan gives Count Dracula a polite but slightly upsetting manner. He seems like a gentlemen yet also makes you want to keep him in front of you at all times. Over all the story holds up, even with the changes, and the only issue I have with this version is the brides of Dracula being so clean. I don't mind them being lovely but I would think their outfits would be dirty or more dated.Get it used if you are a fan of vampires or of Dracula."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Movie is True to the book as much as possible","review":"I am not into vampire movies but having insomnia during Easter Sunday ( yes Easter Sunday ) I was swamped by vampire movies all night even the so called good ones are pretty awful .

And (to echo another reviewer) I also deeply resent the BBC's practice of forcing home-viewers to sit through endless promotional commercials for other BBC series before watching the film they paid to see.

New Order's \\"version\\" (I love when people refer to the original as New Order's \\"version\\" of the song, as if Orgy originated it) was revolutionary.

IMHO, clearly they didn't improove it....they changed the instrumentation, that's all...they certainly did not add anything to the song. Even Orgy's version sounds pretty nice, but from my perspective its because they started out with a song/concept that was so brilliant to begin with, even butchering it to the extent they did still leaves something pretty good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diplomacy relevant to our times.","review":"Mr. Bban has done an excellent work on the practice of diplomacy. As one of the most promient diplomatic minds of the 20th century, he presented the current dilemmas of diplomatic community with great clarity and insight. For example, Mr. Eban makes an excellent point about the necessity of secret diplomacy. Although we value the virtue of transparency in government, diplomacy should be kept secret so that negotiators from different nations could proceed without domestic interference. Good works in diplomatic history are hard to come by in the recent decade and \\"Diplomacy for the Next Century\\" should definitely be an addition for anyone with an interest in international affairs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Halls of Me Me Me Me Me Me Me!","review":"If Halls of Fame is what publishers are calling literature these days, then I don't want to read another word of contemporary writing. This book is ugly, self-centered, immature, and complicated just for the sake of being complicated. It's as if this writer was trying to make sure the world was paying attention to him by being as obscure as humanly it is possible. I think Graywolf better go back to printing the books they used to print instead of all this name-dropping. And the author's new book, an anthology, is just the same. An anthology that's all about the person who edited it! Wow, how interesting.

It seems only fair for a book that is not only unreadable but that has copied better efforts by better writers, which has been camoflaged with lots of \\"experimental\\" techniques that are neither experimental nor very technically able.

I am a student of the Writer's Workshop at the University of Iowa. Before I came I made a point to read everyone's books. I haven't had John D'Agata as a teacher and haven't even seen him yet because he's a freak and a hermit. But this is what I think about his \\"brilliant\\" book. Halls of Fame is D'Agata's first book, and you can tell it is. Now that the love fest with him seems to be over, I hope people will be willing to think about this book intelligently. It is a waste of paper. And definitely a waste of money. His \\"essays\\" ,if that's what you want to call them, are just hodge podges of bits of information and \\"observations\\" that are about as profound as a bowell movement.

HALLS OF FAME is one example. If one tendency of postmodern texts is that they promise coherence but then, in the end, intentionally fail to deliver on that promise, what John D'Agata does is not promise anything in his essays, but deliver anyway everything we could have hoped for in an essay. If you love essays and want to know what's happening right now in the form, this is a wonderful mix of the traditional and alternative in nonfiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Genre for Generation X","review":"This is an intense and urgent new kind of literature, not entirely self-reflexive but not ignorant of the self either. In John D'Agata's _Halls_ we witness the collision of the world and writer, the heart and the mind, poetry and nonfiction. It's been said that these essays reflect on the work already done by Anne Carson, I think instead though that they are actually breaking new ground, for instead of imagining antiquity like Carson, D'Agata is imagining a world that already exists but which we seldome visit. Like all of those roadside attractions whose billboards amuse us but which we never bother visiting on our way to our real destinations, D'Agata's destinations always seem to be the dallying few of us have the patience for. Thank goodness for this too. Down the paths D'Agata's takes in this first book is a world of new literature waiting to be mined."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did D'Agata ask all his friends to put reviews online?","review":"Did I read the same book?This is pretentious and trivial writing. Nothing in it is fresh or new. Oh. A list of all the things in one Hall of Fame. How clever. Just a list. And, wow, he tells us how many degrees it was every day when he was somewhere that was hot. How original! I spent most of the time reading the book wondering what the point was. Alternately disorienting, self congratulatory, and often simply repetitive, I found this book to be hinding behind the label \\"experimental non-fiction.\\" Any criticism of it--like this review--gets dismissed as being a bad sport or not being clever enough to understand the mastery of the experimental writer. Form is hard; doing anything you want is easy. The only people who will like this book are fellow experimental writers, D'Agata's family and friends, and the entire circle of elite who think that everyone else is too dumb to get what this book is \\"about.\\" Whatever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly Enjoyable Read","review":"In my mind Whispers at Midnight is one of the best I have read from Karen.

Several days later after reading several reviews I picked it up again and bought it and I'm so glad I did. An all around fun and enjoyable read for me. Carly Litton and Matt Converse excellent main characters, but what drew me in were her secondary characters Sandra and Matt's younger sister I enjoyed all of them. The animals were excellent and I'm so pleased that she took Marcia's little dog in. My only quibble was Donkey-Man I wish she could have explained his history a little more.

I will be looking for more of her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"By chapter 5, I was in a coma.","review":"This book could have had a plot. It did have a plot-for the first chapter. But then it took a way-wrong-turn and disintegrated into one continuous self-centered whine.Can't remember when I disliked a character as much as I disliked Carly Linton. I started to hate her because of the way she treated (or mistreated) her poor cat. Negligence in the extreme. Cat lovers won't like that.Matt Converse did her wrong twelve years ago. So she hates him, but she wants him, but she hates him. He's a creep, but he's a hunk, but he's a jerk, but he's a hunk.

There was one where a pig was a comic element and helped the main character survive an attack by the bad guy. Very clever use of the animal there. Whispers however starts out with a bad guy slashing a knife through a small helpless dog, leaving him bloody, etc. This I just don't need in my mind's eye. I would have thought Ms. Robards a better writer than to need to use animals in this way. Sadly I had already purchased it on my Kindle. Maybe I'll try another one of hers from the library, maybe not."},{"rating":"2","title":"I would like to meet Matt","review":"I am a very big fan of Karen Robards, so I thought this book was really good. Matt seemed to have a 6th sense that Carly, \\"Curls\\", was in trouble, and things would be good. It would have been nice for Matt's deputy to start a relationship with Carly's friend. This would have added more romance to the story. I would get tickled when the dog would bark, and give the mystery man away. Thank goodness for animals. If you want a book with sex, romance, humor, and mystery, then give this one a try. I have read all of Karen Robards books and have not been disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"whispers at midnight","review":"thoroughly enjoyed this crime thriller, the twist at the end is unexpected and shocking and as appropriate the male lead character is charming and helpful and in uniform in times of crisis"},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit disappointed.","review":"I am a huge Karen Robards fan, but first came across her books about a year ago. I saw this book, which is one of her earliest. She must have gotten better at her writing skills as she wrote more books. This reminds of a first or second try.

The first fourth of the book deals with a cat and a lady chasing it. The plot is difficult to understand, what is the real conflict? She hates Matt, she is so rude. Then she loves him desperately, and then he proposes, and so naturally she says no, because it's our of pity. WOW, really.

Carly was the worst heroine that I have ever had a pleasure of reading. She is immature with the intelligence of a five year old. Matt wasn't much better because he was attracted to this dizzy woman. And if I had to read one more time that he was a dirty rotten SOB I was going to scream.

Carly Linton sounds fiesty, pretty, and hard headed. I just loved the scene where she pours the lemonade over his head. i couldnt stop laughing! usually the heroines are submissive, quiet, and annoyingly pretty. Carly actually admits that she's not a supermodel, and that she got plastic surgery (i doubt she'll ever tell that to matt!) his sisters were HILARIOUS! they were also so sweet! the tease Matt mercilessly!

You can read Fatal Vision, which may be somewhat more one-sided. However, by now the case seems clear. The DNA-evidence that has been asked for by the defense team showed that the hair in Colettes hands was 1. her own 2. that of Jeffrey MacDonald, the defendant. None of the hair found at the scene belonged to the so-called \\"hippies\\". Making this case clearer than ever.

What I read was very one sided, and full of lies. I found a website which shows all evidence from the case and matched Macdonald's book to Fatal Vision on the website. The website showed more evidence that matched Fatal Vision to Fatal Justice in fact there was no evidence supporting Macdonald at all. He points fingers to innocent people who left no sign of ever being in his apartment in the first place, and shows no mercy to a woman who can't even recall what she did that night and was tormented by it for years!

The writer makes lots of money just as McGinnis did with the first book Fatal Vision(which by the way is more entertaining to read.) But the facts of the matter are that MacDonald's appeals have all been turned down and every bit of new evidence has been rejected by the courts. And now his attorneys are trying to get a new trial based on what they say was a threat to MacDonald from a prosecutor. Sounds like grabbing at straws to me. The courts decide and they have found him guilty. Of course there are people who will cling to their belief that he is innocent. But then there are people who believe that Scott Peterson is innocent too. But they're not the courts so it doesn't matter.

My conclusion is that the \\"reinvestigation\\" while interesting is a pathetic attempt by MacDonald to pin the murders on some really sad individuals. Bad enough he killed his family but to try and convince everyone that others ( of course all now dead) were responsible is appalling. He really is a sick man and it is always shocking when some people will believe his lies. He even remarried a woman who visits him in prison and speaks out on his \\"truth\\". This case was always fascinating from a forensic standpoint. His story never added up to what the blood left behind told. His lies and behavior just added to all the evidence . Interesting that there are people who may read this book and actually believe it. They must want to believe everyone else is wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be brainwashed!","review":"This book is full of twisted logic, outright lies and misinterpreted evidence. One could say that just watching Jeffrey Macdonald talk about his family speaks volumes of his guilt, which I agree with, but of course hard evidence in necessary to convict, and there was plenty of it against him. Some \\"evidence\\" this book includes is just plain ridiculous. Like candle wax being in the house that didnt belong to any candles they could find in the house. What do you do with candles when they melt down to nothing? Throw them away!! Candles burn rather quickly, and once they get too low, you toss em. Probably what Colette did a week or days before her husband killed her and her innocent children. Only gullible or completely uninformed readers of this book will believe a word of it.

The book misconstrues the facts of the case, while ignoring the real evidence that showed MacDonald to be the killer. I find it hard to believe that anyone would buy into this, except perhaps MacDonald groupies who refuse to see (or choose not to see) his guilt. Reading this book was a complete waste of time, and it angers me how the authors try to manipulate their readers into believing MacDonald's innocence.

That book does have it's faults, but \\"Fatal Justice\\" is simply the rants of a convicted murderer (who is holding on to the hope that someone will buy into his story, and one day he will be free) combined with info on \\"errors\\" made and the conspiracy against him. Macdonald was convicted of three counts of murder nine years after the murders took place. While his wife and kids sustained brutal, fatal injuries from the \\"acid crazed hippies\\" Jeff claimed attacked all of them, he sustained nothing more than minor injuries- no fatal, major wounds were found on the man. Luckily the sociopathic cold-hearted doctor has waived his right for parole hearings since 1991 (his next chance is in May 2005) so that as of right now he is exactly where he belongs- rotting away in prison."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Money and Time!!!!","review":"This is an update to my previous review which stated: There were two major problems with this video.

By using only her own material she offers us a comprehensive view of the Lady as a Songwriter Nonpareil! Listen to that voice, at times so vulnerable and at other times so selfassured, always fitting the mood! Joni is at the height of her long career, and this can only terrify the rest of her pretenders out there because they will yet have to come near to that unbeatable quality of poetry in the words to her songs. The orchestral arrangements by Vince Mendoza stress the underlying quality of Joni's compositions and if anything stress the feelings emanating from the original versions. Bravo, Joni!

I've always \\"appreciated\\" Joni Mitchell, though I've never been a rabid fan.That ended when I heard these treatments of her songs. Her voice, a little ragged, but with so much emotion and wisdom. The orchestrations, striking and sometimes strange, but so comforting.Travelogue is wonderful record with so many musical and emotional facets. I hear something new and thrilling with each listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"Never thought I'd hear it. After listening to Joni's work since 1970, I am bemused at this offering. While the lush, smooth sounds from the orchestra do a fine job of interpreting Joni's work, they are simply that. It's not just Joni's words or music, but her arrangements that make her music what it is. This offering looses that Joni essence - regardless of her obvious influence in the production. I almost suspect that someone else could have recorded this CD with similar results. If Joni's voice, or any of the lyrics on this CD touches you, I can only suggest you listen to some earlier Joni (Blue, Ladies of the Canyon, Hyjera, and one of her most profound - Mingus). They'll change your life, this one won't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Mitchell","review":"To tell you the truth,I did'nt really like my initial hearing of this recording, but I did continue listening and slowly started to appreciate it more and more.I now believe it is among her best work .It does at times feel a bit like her swan song,however it is never too sad.\\"Song To a Seagull\\" floors me though.It is Joni's ability to recapture the essence of her older material with a naked stark vision of now that I truly find compelling.......\\"and the dream of a baby\\"......whoa,straight to the heart.Joni Mitchell is an amazing artist.I hope she continues to make music for many many more years to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lugubrious","review":"Lugubrious.'Nuff said!It's gorgeous, but it's also just dog-dreary mournfully overblown.Sometimes that's what you want, though, so give it a listen. ...But...it's gorgeous.It might be just what you need.

Wasn't anyone around to tell Joni that less is more? The best thing are her paintings, reproduced in the insert. They are spare. The musical arrangements are unbelievably pretentious and self-indulgent. The lapse of her characteristic taste is astonishing. For that reason, the CD has some interest, perverse interest. This is a side of Joni that maybe we really didn't want to know about. Unlike what some people say about her music in her early singer-songwriter days, this recording really is embarrasing to listen to. Graceful retirement, please."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Unfocused Mess","review":"I love Joni to death, but find this album just plain unfocused and messy. Many of the obscure and \\"undiscovered\\" tracks revisted her from Don Juan and Mingus remain as contrived and just plain weird as the original recordings. Also, instead of enhancing the material, the orchestral arrangements tend to suck the life out of the songs, the result being great classics such as Hejira and The Sire of Sorrow feel weighed down and hampered. Also, I don't feel Joni's sincerity on this release. Only on the last song, \\"The Circle Game,\\" did I connect with the music, and feel she had truly \\"recreated\\" one of her songs. Not worth the price of admission, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"As a fan returning to Joni Mitchell after a long time away, I was looking for what amounted to a greatest hits type of album. Not being aware of \\"Both Sides Now\\", I was caught unaware when I played the album. This is not the same singer (figuratively) who sang \\"Yellow Taxi\\" thirty or more years ago. In comparison, this album is over orchistrated and overdone. At times, you can barely hear Joni singing over the orchestra. Folk music doesn't take well to symphony orchestras. I was very disappointed. PLB"},{"rating":"1","title":"Droll Joni Orchestrated","review":"I was so looking forward to this album. Orchestrated Joni Mitchell. Should be exciting, no? NO! Mitchell's voice is no longer the smooth, lovely sound it used to be due to her excessive smoking habit. It's just painful to listen to this and then remember what was. Her singing has not grown in the least; her voice has just deepened and gotten husky. The orchestrations do nothing to enhance her songs or her singing. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak and unspirited","review":"An outstanding selection of songs performed with none of the zest and vigor you might expect. Some of the performances are quite good, but there is a prevailing flatness to the recording as a whole. This is made worse by having two discs to get through rather than one. This is mostly pop music, and like even the best pop music, it sounds silly when orchestrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost without merit","review":"Listening to your own press releases can be a disastrous hobby.

Here was an opportunity for Joni to breath new life into her past body of work, but instead she has created a very morose and maudlin affair that has induced serious yawning and boredom.Since about 1994, there has been a campaign going to convince the public that Joni Mitchell is a genius, a misunderstood artist whose work, like that of Van Gough, will only be appreciated after her passing. Like with previous recordings, on Travelogue, I've valiantly tried to convince myself of her genius, to really see into the music, but I just don't buy it. I'm tired of digging for buried treasure, when there probably isn't any to find. A seriously overrated artist who fills the niche for people wanting to believe they are listening to inspired music. Sammy Davis Jr. is more inspired than Joni mitchell"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lush, Rich, Beautiful","review":"This collection of orchestral arrangements of some of Joni's classics demonstrates the scope of her talent.

All of the short programs for all events were shown in bits and pieces, rather than in full form. In previous CBS-produced videos (92, 94, and 98) the short programs for most of the medalists were shown in their entirety, at least the American skaters.Buy the combination competition/exhibition package for a better deal, both in terms of price and content.Note to NBC - WHERE IS THE DVD?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"Please don't buy this product.

Only brief comments were made about their programs and certain maneuvers which were a few seconds in length were shown.It does not bother me that Ina and Zimmerman were shown. If they had included Shen and Zhao's long program and the American pair IN ADDITION to the medalists, that would have been fine with me.

Her displaying of the multiple facets of this multiethnic island (Euboea is the Latinized name for Evvia, which in turn was known during the 273 year long Lombard and Venetian rule as NegroPonte, and then during the Ottomans as Egriboz) brings justice, finally, to Euboea, prior known rather as a narrow unadulterated Greek outpost.She describes also the Arvanite (Mediaeval Albanian) community of Southern Euboea who stubbornly clings to their archaic patois.

City Navigator Map software is expensive and it contains strange anomolies in some regions of the maps. The ability to plan your route on your computer and download routes is a real plus for this GPS Unit. The integration of XM radio and Weather maps is a useful feature.

It was obvious the author put a great deal of time into research and had considerable knowledge of the historical figures he used. Unfortunately the novel was full of simplistic characters, impossible situations and numerous historical errors. Hitler comes off as a raving luny (fair enough) but every other Nazi is so obviously evil that it is impossible to see how they ever stopped slobbering long enough to take power.The trial scene in particular was painful to read. It is in an American Military Court, headed by Admiral Nimitz as I recall. It isn't even really a trial just a series of well meaning polemics against fascism.

Agree with other review - the cup casing to connect to the rotor on the machine unit and the machine rotor is made of cheap plastic.

When you go to their web site, they have a link for \\"Contact Us\\", which does not work. If you want to purchase a Small Personal Blender for a low price and that will not last a year, then I recommend the Bella Cucina Rocket Blender. The motor is powerful and works great.

I kept it anyway, and after less than 10 gentle uses, the cup got stuck in the base while it was blending. I called Sensio Customer Service and was told that sometimes when you're blending ice, a vacuum is created. (Isn't ice blending one of it's major uses?) They suggested I heat it up with a hairdryer to break the vacuum. No luck. Then they suggested I break the cup (no suggestions on how) to break the seal. I drilled a hole in it and still no luck. Then they suggested I return it to Amazon (though I was past the typical return window). Amazon was more than kind in accepting it. Bottom line is this - the blender is nothing special when it works, it breaks easily, and Sensio Customer Service is a joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Recommended","review":"This little unit was GREAT for the first two months we owned it, making smoothies and margaritas in a jif.

It's quite reliable and easy to use-- I drink straight out of the cup that I blend with, which makes it pretty clean and minimizes the number of things I have to wash. I make 2 smoothies everytime I use this and haven't experienced burnout or other probs. I thought I'd write a review for this as I was making my ~1000th smoothies (I've had this for about a year now) because I had a friend who bought it too and for some reason hers didn't work when she plugged it in for the first time.

It's perfect for that purpose. There is really nothing like freshly ground coffee.It's also convenient for making breakfast shakes and smoothies very quickly.My only gripe is that the clear plastic cups it comes with are made of a very fragile plastic.

Then the other chapters provide not only the background for the production of different products but provide with very valuable formulation approaches and formulas. The manufacture of cosmetics chapter is specially useful. There is very little in the market when it comes to industrial production and the scale up process and this chapter is very instructive. A remarkable work as one would expect Dr. Rieger to render with the contribution of more than thirty world experts in different fields.

All the deep sockets are 3/8 drive SAE.I know those could be determined by reading the description closely, but I read it and didn't notice. I would have rather they just omitted the 1/2\\" ratchet and sockets and included metric deep sockets, a universal joint, and a longer extension bar for the 3/8\\" ratchet. Then it would be a complete 1/4 and 3/8 ratchet set. Well, complete up to 13/16 and 19mm.However, what is here seems to be well built and I can still recommend this set.

You can imagine how annoying it is to organize almost 100 little pieces.I CAN'T STAND THIS CASE. I am going to give these to someone and buy another brand.

They are really well made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Socket Set","review":"I've only had this socket set for a few days, and I've used it once. It seems very well constructed and should last for quite some time (hopefully for life, it seems solid enough to achieve that). The case doesn't provide enough resistance for one of the extension pieces, so it falls out easily. It's not that annoying, so I can live with it, especially at this price for a set with so many sockets. They used a cheap foam to keep everything in place. I can see this falling apart within a couple years. I'm not sure that it's completely essential though. I may throw it away long before it falls apart. The plastic clasps that hold the case together seem solid enough for now, but may prove cheap in the long run. Overall, a good set at a great price that should last for years to come. I would definitely purchase this again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life saver!","review":"Just used this set over the weekend to replace the headlight housing units on my 02 Acura TL.

Suspend your disbelief for a fun ride as Kurt Austin, his beautiful female sidekick and his pals track down evildoers, discover the details of their nefarious plot to take over the world, and prevail against all odds to defeat the bad guys while dodging mutant zombies, robot submarines, flooding tunnels and other videogame obstacles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Running out of ideas","review":"Old fan as I am, this one (and quite a few of the later ones) was a huge disappointment. Badly written, obvious plot, even more cartoonish characters than usual. Time for Cussler to retire methinks....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bye Kurt Austin","review":"I have enjoyed all of Cussler's Pitt and Oregon novels. They are exciting, surprising and well written. I began this series with the first book written and have read all that follow up to Lost City; I'll not be reading more, this was my last effort to like this series. The writing is tedious, the characters are always the same and the female is always the ultimate beauty and love interest of Austin. All I know of Austin and Zavala are that they are womanizers and miraculously get in and out of unbelievable situations all for the apparent motive of getting the girl and not \\"saving the world\\" as other more intriguing Cussler novels. It's undoubtedly perfect for some, not for me...give me more science and action! FYI...I am a female suspense/action reader in the order of Clancy et al and will continue to read Cussler's books; hoping to find other plots, action and characters as good as those in the Pitt and Oregon novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cussler does it Again","review":"Another exciting book from Clive Cussler, don't miss it, All the characters are so real and you feel you are enjoying the adventure with them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Same plot but STILL great read!","review":"Lost City follows the same, typical storyline as always -- good versus evil, boy meets girl, good guy saves world. I guess that's why I love Clive's books so much. Although Lost City is not as good as most of his books, I still enjoyed the read VERY much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't even follow its own formula","review":"The story started off OK with the first two short chapters. Then it falls apart. The template is used but isn't filled out. The love interest isn't, the bad guys did it but we don't have a clue how the good guys know that. Getting into the clutches of the bad guys was done by following the script from the (imaginary) Scary Movie series for action fiction. Getting out of the clutches of the bad guys relied entirely on the stupidity of well-trained mercenaries (who could not have been trained to the level of Scoobie Do if they were really that stupid). There were a few interesting tidbits on history and historical paraphenalia, glaciers, old planes but the biology was 70's. A very disappointing read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his Best by a Long Shot","review":"Hard to put your finger on it but this book just does not hold up to the 5 star Cussler books in years past.To start off we have almost 100 pages with our first threat that becomes a bit boring.Couple that with action/horror/bad guys/ and a central theme that has been played many times in the past. Different twist but the same old, same old.Suggest that if you MUST read this, do so at the library and save your bucks.It is only out of respect for Cussler that I give this 2 stars instead of 1."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely Movie Making Material!","review":"Clive Cussler along with Paul Kemprecos has done it again. Another story from \\"The NUMA Files\\" and it is filled with suspense and adventures along with a few other surprises as only Cussler can do.Admittedly a Cussler fan, I was a bit disappointed when he started teaming up with other authors. Little did I know at the time is that the teams produce stories nearly as good as Cussler himself. The advantage - more Cussler stories.\\"Lost City\\" features Kurt Austin and Joe Zavala, the two main characters in all \\"The NUMA Files\\" stories. This one has it all from suspense to adventure plus exotic locations around the world and even monsters. This story is definitely movie making material.If you enjoy Clive Cussler's style of writing, the \\"Lost City\\" is for you. I still enjoy the Dirt Pitt adventures the best but this is highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"See storyline above.A well rounded and extremely entertaining novel which you come to expect from Clive Cussler. You get action on the high seas as well as on land and ice.Kidnapped scientists and an elixir based on ocean enzymes from the Lost City are just some of the problems Kurt Austin faces. Its seems that Kurt Austin will be Cusslers main protagonist now that Dirk Pitt is the head of NUMA. I have no problem with that.Excellent entertainment thats fast, furious and fun.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Severely lacking","review":"Cardboard characters, cartoon villains, plot written by computer -- not recommended for anyone above the age of 12. I got this on CD to listen to in the car, but what a disappointment! The story rolls along with one or two good ideas, but you get the same miracle escapes every few pages when the bad guy wastes time gloating or plotting improbable tortures instead of just shooting the heroes when they had a chance.The one start for this review goes to the programmer who wrote the code that wrote the book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kost City gets lost","review":"Having read almost every Cussler since \\"Raise the Titantic\\", perhaps I've come to expect too much. The difference is that now Kurt Austin is nothing more than Dirk Pitt redone, and the storylines are well worn, the action has been done to death and the bad guys are cartoons. The writing moves along, but is uninspiring. Maybe a book a year is too short a deadline, and more time between books would help the authors to develop better plots and stronger action and characters who are not the same old stereotypes, or maybe Clive should go it alone again. This is the second in a row that has disappointed this much, and I'm not looking forward to anymore as I once did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"If you're looking for a good story with plenty of action and a great plot and you're not really concerned with the difference between so-so writing and good writing (this book is so-so), then this is an excellent book. I couldnt put it down.I gauge the rating of a book by one thing; Am I able to truely come into the story? I am able to do this if the writing and word usage is at or above a certain level. I was able to \\"come into the story\\" when I read this book and to me, that provides for a good read. Bad writing can prevent this experience but I didn't think this book was too badly written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Designed for the Air Force","review":"I work in the Air Force and we use this stuff all the time. We call it \\"F-4 tape\\", referring to the aircraft that the tape was originally used on. The tape is great - it makes an airtight bond within seconds after applying it. The product description is accurate, but it can also be used as a replacement grip for tools or sports equipment (like my racquetball racquet). The only problem is that it doesn't use an adhesive, so sealing things can be a little more tricky than expected. Overall a great product, with many uses around the house and garage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"This tape is touted as being able to repair plumbing among other things.

There will never be another dog man star, until Bernard rejoins. Get that through your head, and you will discover that A New Morning is on a par with if not better than the better than it should have been comeback album, Coming Up. The tracks here are infused with an energy and yes, \\"positivity\\"that was so sorely lacking from the tepid and terrible Head Music. In fact, Head Music was so bad it nearly put me off Suede for good, but I decided to take one more chance... I'm glad I did.This album has taken the Suede formula and injected some nice new flourishes, like the bleating rawness of Bretts voice, the harmonica on \\"Obsessions\\", the accoustic interlude of the title track. The tunes are solid, and yes it may be familiar, but in a comforting way rather than a repetitive one. Ignore the naysayers! Skip this one and you're doing yourself an injustice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suede offer up a decent but disappointing final album","review":"In the wake of their late-2003 break-up, this is Suede's final album. And while a solid album, it's rather weak and certainly their worst effort. Anderson's voice no longer has the coked-up whine and snarl of old, which works on the more polished songs but sounds rather thin on other songs. Overall Suede seem to have been going for a more mature sound here, and it shows. However, some of Anderson's lyrics are almost self-parodic, such as the \\"beat of the concrete streets\\" and \\"you belong watching CCTV\\"...topics he'd written about many more times and much better in the past. However, there are some great songs on here, such as Positivity, Beautiful Loser, Lonely Girls, the suite of Untitled......Morning, and the near-perfect Astrogirl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived and boring.... mostly.","review":"There is no use comparing one album to another (i.e. this album is not as good a DogManStar). What's the point? Each album is individual and needs to be regarded on its own. Unfortunately, ANM is weak. For the most part, ANM seems contrived, cliched, and boring. There are a few tracks that are quite good (Lost in Space..etc) and some that surprise (..Morning); however, most are painful (all the singles so far and the awful When the Rain...). Personally, I'm fond of the song Streetlife. ANM is worth a listen, but do not expect too much. Listen to Suede's other albums - or treat yourself to one of last year's best albums: Pulp's We Love Life."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to Suede?","review":"I think everyone who has actually ever listened and loved any previous Suede album cannot possibly appreciate this garbage. From the truly original and uncompromising band that Suede once was, they have become a below average pop/rock band. The last album wasn't so hot, but this one is complete garbage. Brett has forgotten how to sing and the songs all have the same sound, which isn't the Suede sound may listeneres have come to love. Brett's voice isn't stronger on this album, he sounds like he's struggling through every bar on every track. Aside from the palatable \\"Positivity\\", which sounds like a re-write of previous material, I couldn't even listen to the other songs to the end. After a lot of anticipation, this album was a huge dissapointment. It's the first Suede album I ever returned, and I hope it's the last."},{"rating":"1","title":"lacklustre","review":"One word for this album... crummy. A pretty lousy record, really. ... Brett Anderson sounds like he smoked and entire carton of cigarettes before every take. I mean, the last album certainly had some limitations but this one is a straight to video effort. ... A couple listenable tracks are worth mention. 'Astrogirl' 'One hit to the body' and 'Lost in TV' recall a once great Suede but fall short of saving the album from abysmal failure. Tracks not worth mentioning include 'When the rain falls' 'Beautiful Loser' 'Lonely Girls' and 'Positivity', especially the latter. I thought 'Elephant Man' was bad. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"FAR WORSE THAN ANYTHING I COULD'VE IMAGINED!","review":"What has happened? I started asking myself that after the last record. Being somewhat tolerant, I gave the boys another chance to enhance my cd collection, they took that chance and embarassed themselves with a record of drab, boring and childish babble. This disc is so bad it deserves no stars. Some advice to Brett and co. would be to stop putting out thoughtless dribble and revisit Dog Man Star, or even Coming Up. The comparision thing is the worst part of this being a horrid record. Suede were at one time a GREAT BAND, full of amazing charisma and skillfull songwriting. They are now a bunch of babies not capable of writing an inspired tune if they had to to. It has now become time to fly over to the UK myself, and hand-over my Suede discs to Brett and say ciao, You have officially lost it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great swan song","review":"I was skeptical of this, I must admit, after the disappointing Head Music. Like most Suede fans, I view the first three albums and Sci-Fi as absolutely stellar perfect music. But Head Music really hit bottom (had a few bright spots, though).But I was not ready for this. This is absolutely excellent. It doesn't try to retread areas they should no longer be in and hits a more adult-oriented feel, to be sure. Sorta like what happens when the 90s party wears down and you're left alone. Songs like One Hit To The Body and Lonely Girls are excellent, while Obsessions, Positivity and Beautiful Loser manage to take their quintessential Suede sound and bring something new to it.Highly recommend this. I'm not a fan of The Tears, BTW (that went too far over the line into boring adulthood), but this really hit it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Different Type of Suede","review":"I was sitting in a hotel room in Shanghai fighting jet-lag when an 'acoustic' Suede hit my TV at 3am in the morning. It was Suede performing this album to an Asian audience. The songs were a different Suede than I was used to but showed a growth and indicated that a calm had finally decended on the head of Brett Anderson. I immediately went out and bought the album. It is an album of songwriting maturity, beautiful melodies and warmly delivered. This album is better than good with stand out tracks 'One Hit To The Body', 'When The Rain falls', 'Lonely Girls' & 'Positivity'.If you like acoustic bliss, you will like this album...Not just for the Suede-heads.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for kids, too...","review":"This book has hundreds of drawings and photographs that trick the eye in one way or another (color, perspective, hidden pictures, illusions of movement, etc). After every 20 pages or so there is a page that has a one or two sentence blurb giving background information or commentary on each illusion.My kids (ages 5 and 7) love looking through this book, and it's a great mental exercise for them, pondering how the effects are achieved and discovering what exactly the illusion is that's presented on each page. Note however, that some of the illusions are too cerebral for kids this age, or require too much patience to see.I would have liked the book even more if it had a section that discussed the concept of illusion and how the biology of eyesight and psychology plays it's part.Overall, an excellent book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's fortunate that this is out of print...","review":"It's been said that the relationship between the Duke and Duchess of Windsor was the \\"Romance of the Century,\\" and that their love was \\"deep and true.\\" If their romance was based on the prattle in their letters, then it was definitely sophomoric and banal.

I have all their other CD's and like every song with many being considered great, others being real good, while just a few are considered to be merely good. This latest CD though has 4 songs that are flat-out bad. The remainder of the songs, compared to the other discs, do fall into a range between my merely good and real good categories. So, if you're looking to purchase the Levellers for the first time, I highly recommend you follow through. But, choose one of the earlier releases. Although 'A Weapon Called A Word' and 'Levelling The Land' are the first ones I ever heard and fabulous, I'm kinda partial to 'Zeitgeist'. If you're a diehard fan and don't yet have this CD, do consider buying it.

I didn't believe the other Amazon reviewers who said the hat and overalls weren't durable, but I was wrong. Just by simply holding it in your hands, you feel like it could break at any second.

It was very simple and I think the hardest move in it was a deep lunge. After 40 minutes I did not even break a sweat or have a single sip of my water.It also moved very fast so you never really felt your muscles stretch or burn from holding the position. Also, it was filled with somewhat cheesy workout expressions like: \\"c'mon, you can do it!\\" and \\"look how hard you've worked!!\\" Which I find annoying.Lastly -- it was based around yoga moves, such as downward dogs and lunges, but it did not have any of the yoga mentality. If you are looking for peace and calmness of mind (which yoga often brings) along with a good workout, I'd suggest looking elsewhere. If you are looking for a quick, low impact workout and you aren't flexible or muscular (and maybe have bad joints) then you might like this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great 30 minutes workout","review":"I'm surprised at the fair to midland reviews that have been given to this tape.

I have been attending yoga classes for the last 6 months and wanted something short to do at home and thought this might fit the bill. The biggest flaw is that they don't name the positions. If you are in \\"cobra\\" say you are in \\"cobra\\" so a beginner can associate the position with the name. A beginner going from this DVD to a class might have a hard time because they wouldn't know the names of the positions. Also they spent an awful lot of time in the \\"downward dog\\" position for my taste and the flow from one position to the next was awkward at times.

It's an excellent introduction to The Raindrops (Jeff Barry and Elaine Greenwich)--who have an almost garage band/protopunk energy. Given the lack of choices, it's an excellent start on the Brill artists, although it may move you to try to collect other songs and artists from those years.

I believe that the raised lines in the rubber make it difficult to dry properly and that a hard plastic handle would be preferable. In my view the materials used for the handle which is an integral part of the design do not stand up to normal bathroom use.

Except for the lack of a short 1-second pause in brushing action every 30 seconds to tell you to move on to the next brushing quadrant, I don't feel or see any difference. The battery keeps a charge for at least 3 days of brushing so it's good for weekend trips (the charger is very small so extended trips are not an issue). What a bargain at $12.00.

I would strongly recommend this product. Did I mention? It does a heck of a job cleaning your teeth too."},{"rating":"2","title":"how did i live without it?","review":"How did I go so long without owning an electric toothbrush? I always thought they were pricey, so I was surprised to find how affordable this model was. My boyfriend's dad is a dentist, and this was the toothbrush he gave him when he started developing sensitive teeth. I was skeptical, the last thing I thought you would want to do is give your teeth a good scrubbing when they're already sensitive. Now I'm no professional, but from personal results- my teeth are feeling better and it's amazing how clean they are!! Almost like having gone to the dentist for a deep clean. I wouldn't substitute this for regular visits to the dentist though. I highly recommend this. Totally affordable (although the replacement tips can be $$$), but for what it does... it's worth it!!!!! Do it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"Does the job well, I can feel a difference in my gums after I use this vs. a regular toothbrush. The one I bought from Amazon.com broke: you have to be careful not to drop the brush or hit the head of the brush on anything. The head of my brush started coming off and eventually came off completely (it fell in the sink once and then it just started getting looser and looser). The good thing was that Oral B sent me a new one, free of charge, after I called them. I'm being more careful with my new one, and so far so good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toothbrush","review":"This toothbrush is just as good as the Sonicare one it is replacing, and for a lot less money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dental hygiene fun","review":"This works really well - although it cost less than $20, it seems indistinguishable to me from one I used to have that cost close to a hundred. One great advantage of a power toothbrush is the built-in two-minute timer - I suspect just brushing longer probably makes a big difference in your dental hygiene, even without the power aspects. When we got away we find we miss brushing with it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I've been using this for about a month now, and I absolutely love it. Took this with me on my 4 day weekend getaway to California, and it held a charge for the entire time (I brush twice a day). My teeth feel cleaner and I actually enjoy brushing now.

The grip gets filthy really fast. The place where the brush head connects to the handle gets filthy fast also. The bottom which sits on the charger and the charger itself get moldy if you place your brush on it after you brush. You have to let it completely dry, but then it dies and you have no charge for brushing. Some major design flaws."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not charge to 20 min worth even after 24 hours","review":"Even after leaving it to charge for more than 24 hours, brush does not last more than 40 secs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad design, would not buy again","review":"While this toothbrush does what it is supposed to do and the 2-minute timer is a nice addition, the design is flawed. It is impossible to brush your teeth with this brush without drooling all over the place. I believe it has to do with the width of the brush attachment. Brushing your teeth with this toothbrush is quite messy, no matter how hard I try, and I would not buy this item again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where do you get refills","review":"I love this tooth brush but where do you get refills.

This package, worse than others of its ilk, had difficult to reach edges so be prepared for a real battle to get it open...Also look very closely to locate highly camouflaged battery direction indicators...Once you get the toothbrush in your hands and batteries installed correctly it works quite well.

Maybe there's a technical reason that is not obvious but the change precludes using earlier charging bases that provide for brush storage. The brush unit itself is fine and I would recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great buy for the money!","review":"If you can't afford a toothbrush in the triple digits, then this little guy is a powerhorse for your buck. Power toothbrushes are soooo much better for your oral hygeine than manual toothbrushes and the oral b Vitality Precision Clean has a small head, so you can actually get around the back of the teeth, and you'll get that \\"slick, just out of the dentist's chair feeling\\" all over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems with Power Dying","review":"Bought two of these on Sept 23, 2009. One for my wife and one for me. Recommended by my dentist who said it should be as good as more expensive models.At first, my wife had problems with her unit holding a charge but it seems to be running OK now. However,two days ago while rinsing my unit and cleaning the brush under the faucet my power unit simply quit. I tried recharging it but all I get now is a little whirring sound but no action of the brush.I think the Braun Oral-B should hold up a lot longer than that, even at the low end price. I'll probably end up tossing it and purchasing a highly rated higher end Braun model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oral-B Vitality","review":"Was hesitant to purchase an expensive rechargeable toothbrush without first trying one out.

By early summer we both noticed a strange metallic taste and the toothpaste in our mouths was gray instead of white. Black drops started coming out of the handle and it became clear that metal from inside the handle was mixing with the toothpaste and getting into our mouths. Other than this problem I thought the device was great but this is just not acceptable so I am buying a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Died after 6 weeks","review":"The brush died after 6 weeks of light use, alternating with a manual brush. In the meantime, the metal melted and caused noticeable taste and probably can be attributed for some metal accumulation on a tooth.

My old one just died so I bought this one thinking that the price had come down a lot in the last 3-4 years. Apparently not. This one's a lot less expensive but you can tell. I *LOVE* the Oral B line of electric toothbrushes, but don't waste your time with the $20 version. But the $80+ ones - they really are that much better. This one spins so poorly; I know I'm not getting the cleaning I've enjoyed for years. I returned mine and bought the better version and am now very happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"good deal","review":"It's OK. I just turned to electric toothbrush and feel good about it till now. It can keep powerful for about one week or less once full charged (16 hrs). And it's safe for charging even in the bathroom, because you cannot see any metal material under the bottom of the toothbrash and the surface of the base."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oral Electric Toothbrush","review":"This is a great toothbrush. I initially bought one for myself. So pleased, got one for my husband. Then ordered three for my daughter and her two children. Then ordered two more for my other daughter and her son.

Sorry Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oral-B Vitality Great Inexpensive Replacement","review":"I have been using Oral-B electric toothbrushes since before they added the 2 minute timer, or at least on models where a person could afford it. I have only needed to replace them once the battery would no longer hold a charge, and that is after many years of service. I was very pleasantly surprised I didn't have the pay the big bucks as in past purchases.This model uses the same heads as my last ones, still has the 2 minute timer. Can't ask for more. When using Oral-B the dentist has always complemented me on how great my teeth are. Once I started using Oral-B my checkups improved remarkably.I highly recommend getting this model, unless you want to pay more for the other Oral-B models.

Good cleaning action; hopefully it lasts as long as previous one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"This is an interesting workbook. I definitely enjoyed some of the selections. However, I think it needed more notes. I often was left with questions about the grammar or syntax that the notes didn't answer. Without good notes, these workbooks are nothing more than reprints of Latin texts that one can find for free at one's school library or online."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good introduction","review":"This is not a good introduction to Avid editing software. All sorts of important little details are left out of the explanations and examples, making a sophisticated interface fairly incomprehensible. I have begun the tutorial several times, and have not been able to go through even the \\"basic editing\\" sections.I suggest looking elsewhere.This is a great disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not useful for experienced editors","review":"I bought this book because I was having several technical issues for a long form project and I was hoping to get some insight into solving those problems. However, there was no pertinent information for trouble shooting my issues.This is probably a great book for a beginner but if you are experienced at all, you won't find any useful information here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"This book is suprisingly bad, considering that it's put out by Avid. I agree completely with the other reviewer who compared this book unfavorably with the Final Cut Pro books put out by Apple's Training Series. Those books have clear exercises and go through the processes you're learning in a thorough step-by-step way. This book doesn't even explain the interface clearly. Then, suddenly you are instructed to hit keys that have never been mentioned before. The writer doesn't even tell you what footage he's working with most of the time. A real disaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Four out of five isn't bad","review":"I read all three books in the trilogy over a year ago and have recently come to pick them up again. The best feature of the book is the idea, I love reading sci-fi books that don't actually feel sci-fi - the books that I enjoy explaining the plot to friends and family. The reason I didn't give the book five stars was because there wasn't enough romance, and there is always room for romance - where are we without it? Also I would have loved to have more information about the way of life that far ahead into the future, on a more day to day level. The last reason is because i didn't like Raven, although i know why she was cold and heartless I think hope goes a long way but i never felt she would change - it is definitely a first for me to love a book and not love the main character. Despite this the book left me wanting to find out more so it definitely earned four stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mas Queridos","review":"Los Tucanes son los mas queridos cuando tiene que ver con su musica - me justa todos su CD's - pero 2 cansiones que la verda me justa son \\"Clave Nueve\\" y \\"Clave Privada\\".

Because I really liked this CD, I bought Volume 1 (not easy, because it was recorded in 1984 and is no longer being made) and it's a big disappointment.

Written by his father, this book gives a new perspective on a story that hit everyone hard along the border. Only the faith and love of the Kilroy family could sustain the Kilroy family through Mark's kidnapping during spring break and past the grisly discovery of the bodies at the \\"Devil's Ranch.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"that ineffable feeling once again","review":"Yes, I'm quite liberal with the five stars when it comes to Creatures' material - primarily because each release is highly unique and so far superior to other music. This one is a mysterious and lovely bit of audible Zen koan that transports the listener to other magical places.As in the case of the recent release by Lisa Gerrard, words are ultimately inadequate in describing or capturing the marvelous essence that these seminal artists create.You truly must sink your neurons into the sound and decide for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hai!","review":"This new Creatures CD is almost their best yet, falling not far behind the superb \\"Boomerang.\\" Like \\"Feast\\" (Hawaii) and \\"Boomerang\\" (Spain), \\"Hai\\", recorded in Japan, undeniably evokes the mystery and strength of the country (contrary to what another reviewer experienced). At first listen, I wasn't too sure that this CD was worth the buy, but after the second run through, paying more attention to detail, I was blown away. Strongest tracks are \\"Around the World,\\" \\"Seven Tears,\\" and \\"City Island.\\" Siouxsie and Budgie have definitely produced a work of art with this CD. Essential."},{"rating":"2","title":"surprising and satisfying","review":"I've followed the Banshees and the Creatures for a long time, but I didn't necessarily have high expectations for this. Not many artists can make engaging and challenging music 25 years into their career. I've enjoyed the Creatures pop material too, but I was pleased to see this return to roots. When they began The Creatures offshoot, it was always about Budgie banging the hell out of his drums with Siouxsie singing sweet nothings. On this new release, Budgie sounds like a tribal, gothic drumeline and Siouxsie has rarely sounded better. No hit singles, but what struck me was how well this album flows and how enjoyable it is to listen to in its entirety in one sitting. It fades in, rumbles along, turns dark and sensual and then ramps back up again at the end. An unexpected treat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Siouxsie!","review":"I want to love the Creatures, but this anti-melodic, leaden album doesn't help. I was hoping Hai! would deliver the promise made with Anima Animus...great electro-rock songs with goth flair. Wrong. This is more akin to their tribal Feast album than any other Creatures material. It's an okay album, but a disappointment if you like pop. Very thumping, chanting stuff here, not much song structure, and hopeless at yielding a viable single. Sorry Siouxsie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed Experiment","review":"I don't understand how anyone could give this a 4 or 5 stars. I've tried to appreciate it several times, but its torture to try to listen to all the way thru. Not all experiments can be successful. I don't believe they should have realeased this one. I gave it 2 stars instead of one because the drumming at the beginning of the album is very interesting and well done. The singing is almost non existant and seemingly nonmotivated when it does appear. The music is kind of sparse too, other than the drumming. Budgie could get one good drum solo out of this album to put with 12 different new songs for a new album. If this was Budgies showcase, well, artistic ego got in the way of good musical sense. Yes monotonous, uninspiring, fit the bill I had to pay. The only Siouxsie connected project ever, that I did not like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother with the sample.","review":"I may eventually get over my irritation and buy this book, but I just wasted time downloading and opening the \\"sample.\\" It consists of the cover page, credits to Google for the digitizing, the names of other involved entities, and a one-paragraph comment by the author.

The three unreleased cuts that comprise the bulk of this promotional disc hail from the same sessions, and certainly deserve a better fate than appearing as throwaways on record label swag -- that they didn't pass muster is perhaps the ultimate tribute to Hollywood Town Hall's overall quality and cohesiveness. \\"Leave No Gold\\" is particularly effective as a showcase for Gary Louris' scorching guitar leads, while the gospel-inspired \\"Up Above My Head\\" is a stellar vehicle for Louris and Mark Olson's beautiful harmonies. Only the jaunty \\"Keith and Quentin\\" feels slight, even as it evokes small-town Americana with painterly grace."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best retro outfit of the retro 90's","review":"The Minstrels have been in California for a couple of years now and have been a major factor in bringing the west coast sound of the 60's back to the west coast.Great live too.

This novel is a true story about an event in history where 12,000,000 people (6,000,000 of them Jewish)were tortured and murdered by the Nazi's.

It is one of those books that makes you think, to say the least. Better still, it is just 100 pages or so. I read it in one night - no kidding. It does not make any sense at all to read the Cliff Notes version; in the time it takes you to purchase the Cliff Notes and read it, you could have read the actual book in its full 100 page glory. (and still had time to contemplate its profound implications) Now if we were talking about Jane Eyre or Dickens or Anna Karenina it might at least be understandable. But with Night, do yourself a favor and read the real thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous!","review":"The book is only like 120 small pages -- read it! Having cliff notes to something like this is stupid -- a) because it is so short to begin with and b) from a practical point of view, anything that you are going to be asked to write based on this book is going to be rather emotional, or at least intense, as the subject is, and getting the facts and dates without FEELING it is not going to help you write a decent essay anyway. You would be lucky to get a D on an essay on this book written on the basis of these notes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What?!?","review":"OK, 72 pages of cliff notes for a 144 page book?

I guess if you have a bright screen color you may not notice, but with Black, the bleed is all the way around. Very poor. I hooked the LG L226WT back up and it is again a very nice picture.

No more Gateways for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont waste your money or time with Gateway","review":"My warrenty expired 1 month and 2 days ago, and Gateway says Tough Luck. It worked great, and then all of a sudden nothing. I have since found quite a few postings online that all sound like the same exact problem I am having, and with the same attitude from Gateway.Go with another brand of computer. My old Dell lasted 7 years with no problems ever, and before that I had a Compaq that lasted about 9 years. Gateway was obviously a bad choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead after 15 Months","review":"Avoid this product! This monitor will die after 13-15 months of usage. The screen will turn solid white.

I have one on my bench right now for repairs; they are insanely hard to crack open but simple to fix. Just need to replace a few caps in the power supply, and I have seen bad ones on the video board before as well.I am giving this two stars because while it has good picture quality, it is not a reliable product and the average person would not be able to fix it. Gateway won't stand behind their garbage, either.

The SAT program crashed 3 different computers upon attempt at installation, so we can't find out if the program is good or not. Our time is more valuable than this. The ACT program disk seems to work fine, but that was not our primary interest. What can I say. This kind of thing is unacceptable in a computer program disk these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible program","review":"Words can't express my hate for this program. Intros that you can't escape (especially when you don't have the time to listen to those dumb people) games that have no relevance with SAT matching and such, rather it is a test of your hand-eye coordination and clicking skills. It really is designed for little children. Slow menus, goofy games, makes this product a 1 star. Just because you get 5 in 1 doesn't mean that quantity overtakes quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Child like","review":"When I bought this program I wanted software that would allow me to comfortabley study for the SAT.

The Scharwanka, alone, would 'sell' this CD. A big but not sprawling Romantic Concerto that should be played more often, it is in the league of the Brahms 2, Tchaikovsky 2, and Dohnányi 1. The Sauer is almost a 'filler', but so ideal, that disc is just perfect! I've heard Hough several times in Concert: Hummell A minor; Rachmaninoff D minor; and this very Scharwenka 4 -- all with the Philadelphia Orchestra. The Orchestra was its sensational self, and I wish we could 'return' to the days when pianists such as Hough could record with the very best: Philadelphia; Boston; Chicago; London SO; and Berlin, on a regular basis. Just listen to the better playing of the Dallas SO in Hough's Rachmaniinoff set, for a 'taste' of what could be even better! So, Five Stars + for this wonderful CD!

The author did her homework on Islam and AI. In particular, she accurately conveyed a sense of how some Muslims practice Islam without resorting to the usual stereotypes, an approach I found most refreshing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr. Asaro did lots of research for this one.","review":"While reading the Veiled Web I was amazed at how many religious, cultural, and technical references are made by the novel's wide variety of characters. The story's pace (like all of her books) flows quickly, and her characters are enjoyable. Like the main character in Catch the Lightning, Lucia is a young innocent girl who becomes involved with an older mysterious foreigner. The book at times got overly sentimental and sweet for my taste at times, although I didn't mind since I got my share of haunted, brooding war veterans in her Skolian stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting genre blend","review":"The Veiled Web was the first book I read by Catharine Asaro. I was so impressed I bought her other books (which I also enjoyed tremendously). She deftly handles elements of romance, suspense and science fiction. Other writers, take note! We need more like Ms. Asaro in the field. Lucia was a well wrought character, familiar and likable, leading us on an exploration of the issues of religion, unity in diversity and the roles of the internet and artificial intelligence in the unfolding human society. Her conclusions are inspiring and thoughtful. I was also impressed by the author's treatment of Islam, presented informatively and with little bias."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer beware!","review":"This is a romance novel disguised as a cyber-thriller. Not to put down romance novels as they are one of my guilty pleasures but if I see a book jacket picturing Fabio in a pirate costume getting jiggy with a bosomy woman I know what I am buying and how I am going to be spending my time. The hero and heroine were too beautiful to be believable and the plot too tidy. I felt as though the author owes me for the hours I spent reading this piece of fluff, thinking that I was going to learn about the morals of creating artificial intelligence, and along the route learn more about Islam. She could have spent more time there, she didn't -- my loss. For my next read I'll look for a historical romance (with or without Fabio on the cover) that doesn't pretend to be any more than it actually is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't compare with her Skolian series","review":"It's hard to believe this is the same author who brought us into the fascinating world of her Skolian series. This novel is romance with just a dash of scifi/cyberpunk thrown in. Disappointing, at times even trite. But don't let this book turn you off of her other gems."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Failed Attempt at Romance, Adventure, Sci-fi","review":"While I have enjoyed most of Ms. Asaro's novels immensely, I felt that The Veiled Web attempted to bring together a number of genres, but succeeded at none. The romance (the primary genre of the novel) felt unbelievable, since Rashid was absent during most of the period during which the Lucia's romantic feelings allegedly developed. If anything, the heroine became enamored of the lifestyle, rather than the man himself. The attempt to bring action/adventure elements into the novel through the element of the kidnappers felt similarly half-hearted, since only the first and last attempts had any crumb of excitement, and the characters (particularly Lucia) barely reacted to the attempts. The science-fiction elements succeeded perhaps better than the romance or the adventure - but anyone interested in reading about the development of consciousness in artificial intelligence would be better advised to re-read Robert Heinlein's _The Moon is a Harsh Mistress_."},{"rating":"1","title":"an enormous disappointment","review":"I have all of the Skolian books, which I really enjoy but this book is going straight in the trash. I am also a big fan of romances and this is one of the most stilted, uninvolving stories I've read in a long time. The artificial intelligence part was really trite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"We bought this bar stool about two months ago. It took considerable time and effort to fix, as some of the holes were not properly aligned. We really liked it once it was fixed. The bar-stool was lightly used during this time. Now, the screws are coming apart and the bar-stool seat is wobbling. It has now become unsafe to use. I would recommend buying a better quality bar stool. It is not worth the money we paid for it. I will never buy products from this manufacturer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice collection","review":"I like this compilation very much but not enough to rate it a classic.

A sampling of various artists keeps this play list from sounding homogeneous. \\"Autumn Leaves\\" is my favorite track within the four albums to date."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Book on Smith","review":"This book is an uninspiring analysis of Smith's work. Nobody who has even a cursory knowledge of Smith's writings would be surprised by what Muller has to say. The basic point that Smith was not a philosopher of unbridled greed is unsurprising. It is not that the thesis of the book is wrong, but it is simply something that could have been said in an article or less. Obviously a lot of hard work went into the book, but it is the product of a mediocre mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"The rewriting of history","review":"I was hoping this would be an unbiased look at this remarkable time in history, however it was just another attempt to undermine the Bible.

I found myself dozing off by the time they got to David and Bathsheba.Unfortunately, one of the weaknesses of this DVD, beside its long length, is the fact that we're told shockingly little of Jewish history after about 100 A.D. Therefore, not only does this DVD fail to entertain, it also maintains silences about current Jewish history. No Maimonides and Jewish Spain? No tales of Russian Jews? No Jews in the United States?I think \\"Empires\\" certainly failed with this edition. Definitely one to skip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Historical Reductionism. A piece of junk","review":"Rather than sharing what the biblical authors claimed happened, from the very get-go, the Jewish scriptures are assumed to be made up with no evidence supported to substantiate that claim. From that foundation, Scripture is acknowledged to be \\"morally edifying\\" but not \\"authoritative\\" nor even \\"accurate.\\" Theories trying to get behind the Biblical authors' intent in writing these fabricated tales are treated as totally true, though they are just unsubstantiated theories. Meanwhile, the claims that the biblical authors were writing an accurate history of past events is dismissed out of hand and those who might believe such a thing are laughed out of the room as childish, not even given a hearing.This is pure propaganda. Historical documents are dismissed as fiction while modern theories seeking to undermine Scriptures claim to authority are treated as fact.I do not recommend this series in any way whatsoever."},{"rating":"1","title":"pathetic.biased.boring.revisionist.","review":"the Empire series really wandered off into the bushes on this one.i watched one so-called 'biblical authority'after another reduce the Bible to simply a fabrication of folk tales for 4 hours!.there is so much wrong with this sophomoric effort to take itself seriously it would be laughable were it not such a sacred subject.run do not walk away from this mess.the Medicis,Queen Victoria and Martin Luther are 5 star Empire sagas worth their weight in gold.if you take the Bible, Judaism or Christianity seriously avoid this leap into nonsense.you will thank youself for it.a total trainwreck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of This Fact","review":"I purchased a pilates reformer and then looked for instructional material. I found this product on Amazon. As this product had good reviews and because I thought I was getting five dvds as pictured with the item as it is presented on the Amazon page, I ordered it. I thought this would be a decent value - $40 for 5 dvds. If you are considering buying this go ahead - it may be a great product - but you will not be getting the pictured 5 dvds - just one. It still may be a good value and may be an excellent product but $40 for one dvd seems expensive and I only ordered it thinking I would receive 5 dvds. So I am thinking about returning it.

It was just so lovely, no huge drama, just good acting and a solid story. I am slightly obsessed with Egypt and felt transported to the bustling but fascinating Cairo.

Scented, touching and gratyfying movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"As a Travelogue It's Fine","review":"A beautifully photographed travelogue of modern day Egypt superimposed on a rather flimsy love story that lacks any semblance of interest or suspense. As a result, this film is long and draggy. The female lead is physically unattractive and a tad too old for her role. The male lead is grizzled, sweaty and underweight. Although it presents a few cultural insights, this movie is not a very good use of your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deplorable sentimental pap.","review":"A total waste of the talents of Patricia Clarkson and the others involved in this project. As a travelogue, it makes me want to visit Cairo - perhaps it was financed by the Egyptian government? I have been to Cairo, and it is nothing like this - this is the sugar-coated version, a little like the image of Tokyo one gets from Lost in Translation. Cairo is teeming with homeless, poverty-stricken people, as is all of Egypt. But all we see here are genteel sophisticates. The plot is predictable and emotionally detached - we never really care about these characters, only their clothes and their luggage seems to matter to the director. This is trash of the first order. Don't believe the hype. It's not worth $18.99."},{"rating":"1","title":"SKIP THIS MOVIE!!","review":"I traveled to Egypt early 2009. The entire movie I couldn't not get over how stupid and naive this women is for traveling in the middle east.First she walks alone in downtown Cairo, then she goes in a male cafe, then she takes a bus to who knows where. She seems to know NOTHINGabout traveling at all. Even though the love scenes (plus you know he only likes her since she is white and blonde) she is even more naive.If you have traveled to Egypt, and think this would be a good one to watch.. FORGET IT!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Less can indeed be more","review":"Not being a big fan of love stories, I went into viewing this with some reservation, having chosen to see the film because of Alexander Siddig's part in it. I've since learned that the writer/director Ruba Nadda actually wrote the part of Tareq just for him. Its a lovely film and to me, most of the love affair is with the city of Cairo itself, although the subtlety with which the two characters attraction is portrayed does nothing to minimize it. Its a nicely crafted tapestry of characters and environment, and sensual without obligatory steaminess. The two actors are wonderful, especially Clarkson, who is in every scene, and I'm glad that Sid finally got a leading role. I hope there are more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Photographs of Chicago during the early 20th century","review":"I have been to Chicago many years since I lived in IL from 1933 to 1963.

I would suggest this for beginners who are fairly strong and fit, for a change from running, weights, or another yoga method.

I was pretty disgusted to watch and see that an evil stepmother to be plays a key role in the plot. Aren't blended families hard enough without reinforcing this stereotype in another movie? I'm not sure how the drama with Polly's dad getting remarried made the movie better and in fact really made my daughter question what would happen if her father got a \\"new wife.\\"The rest of the movie is fun and has lots of shopping, sugary sweet pop music and all the other girly stuff...just be aware of the weird dark cloud hanging over the plot ~ we could have done without the drama and seeing my daughter worry about a stepmother was a little uncomfortable - too much for a 5 year old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended for the younger crowd","review":"Although this movie is not bad, I think they missed with their target market. This movie would be appropriate for the 9+ market. It has been my observation that the biggest Polly fans are in the 4-7 age range.My daughter (almost 5) LOVES Polly Pockets, so this was a must have for her. After watching it with her today, I wish I had read more reviews before purchasing it.The plot of the movie centers around Polly's father's fiancee wanting to get Polly off to boarding school so the fiancee can have the dad all to herself. The second theme is the competition between the good Polly and the bad Beth.The subject is just above the comprehension of most young kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"(Very) Well Written","review":"I really like this movie and the storyline is great!

So you better buy/rent this amazing movie for your kids who like Polly Pocket!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not appropriate for young children","review":"I was both dissapointed and extremely upset by the plot of this movie. As has been stated in other reviews, it casts a very bad light on blended families. What is more, it represents school as a competetive, social climbing atmosphere. The polly pocket toys are aimed at 4-7 year-olds. My daughter, who is just entering kindergarten, plays with them all the time. So I was flabbergasted by the negative portrayal of in-school relationships (good girl/bad girl stereotypes). Not a healthy introduction to what school is supposed to be about. Kids will experience bad by other children soon enough. There is no need to present it as part of an acceptable school environment.

The dolls are cute and they seem innocent compared to other toy options. The movie was not what I expected. Is Polly a teenager? The movie had many inappropriate topics for little girls. In my opinion, little girls are the ones that are actually playing with the dolls. So why make a movie that is more appropriate for girls that are 8 and older? I was annoyed with the mean characters, stepmom issues, focus on materialist things. The scheming and phony stepmother? The nasty classmate? Not good.

The GRE states this is high school math, I checked and for me it was 5th grade through 9th grade. No wonder I was so rusty.

I do have to say the company gave me a choice to return the item or not and said that it's comp-able to an Epson's cartridges. That's fine and good and perhaps some day I may want to buy their product, but I purchased two other actual EPSON ink cartridges for less money. Why can't they state in the product name that it's not an Epson product. Amazon should take a better look at their policy on how they list and describe their items. Don't hide the details somewhere although the company stated it was clearly listed correctly, if you call putting your name after the color's name. If their product is just as good as Epson's, then why not use their own label on the product listing, what are they afraid of. It may even be better than Epson's, just have the nerve to list and show your own product not Epson's."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much talk","review":"i dont like how its full of so much written information, most of which is opinion and somewhat offensive. seems like he wants you to read more than play"},{"rating":"1","title":"Author is \\"clawless\\"","review":"I have only been playing a few months and wanted a simple method to follow.

But with early Gil Evans arrangements, Lee Konitz on alto sax, and the intense beauty of Fran Warren's vocals, this CD is a must. Evans' swinging arrangement behind Gene Williams' vocal on \\"Sorta Kinda\\" breaks me up. And then there's the \\"everything-but-the-kitchen-sink\\" version of \\"Oh, You Beautiful Doll\\" with Thornhill having great fun playing speakeasy, stride piano.

Will there be another episode in Atrus' adventures?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A perfect accompaniment to a great game","review":"This is a beautiful and colorful soundtrack to go with the beautiful and colorful worlds of Exile. I love the addition of wind and strings to the usual synthesizer music, which was great by itself but better with real instruments. It always fits the mood of the environment perfectly, and is noticeable without being obtrusive. It's one of the things that I love most about the game itself, and I love having the soundtrack to listen do while I draw. It's quite inspiratinal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not in the same league.","review":"Before I begin critizing this score, let me point out that it has extreme depth and immersiveness when compared to the music of any other game. That said, it has the misfortune of being compared to Robyn Miller's legendary music for Myst and Riven. The problem isn't skill - the music for Exile is masterfully and professionally written - but THAT's the problem. Robyn Miller had the advantage of being a game designer, not a composer, and as a result his music was utterly free from any stylistic conventions. It was completely original; completely timeless and placeless. Exile's music, however, has a tendancy to become too ethnic. You can hear when he is drawing upon Oriental influences, or Mideastern influences, or pulling out the traditional western orchestra for traditional dramatic emphasis. It is beautiful, but it breaks character. It becomes anachronistic. The worlds of Myst shouldn't be recognizable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes me back...","review":"This soundtrack really takes me back and puts me in the world of \\"Exile\\". I just bought the soundtrack to \\"Myst\\" after hearing the quality of Exile's soundtrack.This disc is more of a score than a soudntrack. You won't find any danceable tunes on this disc, but this music makes GREAT background/hold/relaxation music."},{"rating":"2","title":"I miss the eerie quality","review":"The Myst and Riven soundtracks, conducted by Robyn Miller, created an outstanding ambiance of eeriness and mystery. Riven was absolutely haunting. Unfortunately, when Jack Wall took over, he took the Myst series' soundtrack into more traditional grounds. Myst III sounds more like traditional classical music. It's a fine listen, but it lacks that unique quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Champion Jack's Best Stuff!","review":"Me sez \\"One Of The 10 Albums To Take To A Deserted Island With Electricity!!! \\" I first heard these songs in the 70's and laughed for days.

However I find I enjoy the lesser hits even more. Tracks like \\"Dreaming\\", \\"Hanging On The Telephone\\", \\"Sunday Girl\\", and \\"Atomic\\" are all great songs. The one thing about \\"Blondie\\", is that whether they were doing punk, disco, new wave, or almost rap, they excelled at it, and at the time, \\"Debbie Harry\\" was HOT! Truth be known though, I'd actually get the \\"Greatest Hits\\" over this. It's remastered, and has 7 more tracks, including \\"Maria\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dreaming...of a better collection","review":"Not quite an all-inclusive collection.

The same could be said for the sciences as well - that a science historian or teacher is not necessarilly a scientist. Gilson argues, however, that an education in the history of philosophy is essential to a well-rounded education, if for no other reason to show how unalone people are in their thoughts and supposed first thoughts. It would be useful to discuss even those philosophers who were wrong, just to obtain the full-spectrum of thinking and its history. Gilson is, of course, an avid disciple of Aquinas; as well as an admirer of Aristotle, Plato, and Augustine.

She reaches out to each listener with total sincerity and passion.As an avid Naess and female singer/songwriter fan, I highly recommend this album. It speaks in a language that everyone can understand and relate to.

Listening to his music now takes me back to those days and reminds me that in today's modern era they do not compose music of this complexity or deeply moving beauty. If you are not in a reflective and somber mood when you start listening, you will be in short order. To put it another and less elegant way; this ain't dance party music. It's music for the ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album","review":"You could get this anywhere but the autorip at Amazon means I could listen to it immediately after purchase & still have the CD for the player in my car.

Given his status/reputation I thought I should get this CD and learn what all the fuss was about.Having had no preconceptions, I have to say I was quite disappointed. I think the music has not aged well and is pretty unremarkable. Perhaps the style liberated others to pursue new directions but the work in and of itself is ho hum at best. Specific example that speaks volumes: listen to Cohen's singing of his \\"Hallelujah\\" and then listen to Jeff Buckley's cover of that song on \\"Grace\\" which was recorded in 1994. Sorry, Leonard, you cannot hold even a birthday-sized candle to Jeff Buckley's rendition of your own song. It is a very unflattering comparison that pretty much put the first and last nail in the coffin for my appreciation of Cohen's legacy. \\"Tant pis, vers le bonheur.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"An essential collection of cringe-worthy tunes by a hack","review":"Leonard Cohen, often known as \\"the guy who Jeff Buckley covered\\", proves in this 2 CD collection that he is nothing more than an Al Pacino lookalike who has nothing exciting to bring to the table; listeners can expect to be bored to tears with a monotone reciting of bad poetry over an acoustic guitar- terrible.

Does Your House Have Lions?, which was nominated for both the National Book Critics' Circle Award and the NAACP Image Award in 1997, is a poem in memory of Ms Sanchez's brother, who died of AIDS in the 1980s. It consists of short, electric bursts of anger, bitterness, fear, and ultimately love and reconciliation, from the voices of Ms Sanchez, her brother, their father, and his stepmother, along with the voices of African ancestors. My only regret is not hearing Ms Sanchez read this poem; if anyone is familiar with this book and knows of a performance or audio book of it, please let me know!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool album!","review":"This album spawned more hits than its predecessor,HASTEN DOWN THE WIND. Memorable tunes include a cover of the Everly Brothers' hit IT'S SO EASY,a cover of the late Warren Zevon's personally penned POOR POOR PITIFUL ME,a cover of BLUE BAYOU,first recorded by the late Roy Orbison and the Jagger-Richards classic TUMBLING DICE. Linda Ronstadt must be a fan of the Everly Brothers since she previously covered WHEN WILL I BE LOVED which was first recorded by the EB. The follow-up album,LIVING IN THE USA would become a hit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second to Fleetwood Mac's, Rumours as best album of 1977","review":"Another five star from Linda. The album is loaded with hits, five top 40, but it is not the hits that standout on this album. One listen to \\"Sorrow lives here\\" and you will know what I mean. With just a piano to back her, her voice will send shivers down your spin and make you wish some one hurt you the same way. The simple straight forward way she sings the country standard, \\"Old paint\\" right next to the Rolling Stones raucious \\"Tumbling Dice\\" will be sure to give you a wip lash. This album is lots of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple Dreams - Fantastic Album","review":"Now this is a definitive Ronstadt album. 1977 was a time when the west coast sound was huge and groups like Fleetwood Mac and the Eagles were on top.\\"Simple Dreams\\" was also huge, it was in the Australian top 40 for well over 52 weeks, the top 10 for over 12 weeks and really set Linda Ronstadt's fame for decades to come.Great CD, I especially like the title track \\"Simple man, simple dream\\", slow but just listen to that beautiful voice, it's enough to make you melt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extra Ordinary & Certainly Not Simple Album","review":"Quite easily I can say that this is one of my best sounding cd's ever.

The steel could use some improving, and the lock isn't the best. As for the factory edge, it is nice, but doesn't hold. I gave mine a coarse micro-serration. It is only good for light use, and I do not trust the lock. The only thing good that I can say about the knife is that it looks great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great daily carry knife.","review":"It's a buck, what more can I say? Okay I'll say a bit more. It's very lightweight, the blade is extremely sharp and so far (1 month) has held it's edge nicely; based on the steel used it should take a new edge nicely and hold it, but I don't see that needing to be done for some time. The locking mechanism is very tough. I can't unlock it with my index finger when it is full locked. Working it a 100+ times has loosened it up some, but fully locked it is still difficult to unlock. I have found that you can leave it halfway between locked and unlocked. It keep it from springing open in your pocket, but is loosed enough to be unlocked then flipped with one finger.Overall a great knife, it's not a 5\\" hunting knife or a personal defense knife; it's small, lightweight, has a pocket clip, opens one handed easily and extremely sharp.

The low impact cardio is similiar to Leslie Sansone but without the obnoxious chatter. I loved the upper and lower body workouts as they have short reps on each exercise - each segment is only 8 minutes long. I wish I could create my own workout and play it, like in Denise Austin's latest walk DVD. Instead I have to play each segment, go back and pick out what I want next from the menu and then play it, or I can just pick the \\"play all\\" choice.

Live album from last few dates of European tour before they broke up (again). Amazingly, they sound better (and rougher) live than in the studio.

Vinyl version comes with extra songs, limited edition poster and artwork."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Live Album","review":"You couldn't be there, so hear it like you were. This is a warts and all document of two shows before Hank's breakdown. For a band so close to the edge, they were sharp as a knife. Fantastic recording of a fantastic band. My only complaint would be that Euroboy is not loud enough in some parts, so the solos don't slice like they should. If you've already got all the other albums, there's no reason you shouldn't have this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why RBX? Why didnt you bring the skills you have?","review":"RBX is one of my favorite rappers, he has a dark, sinister style. Instead of dropping a unique, straight hip hop album(which is what I was expecting). He decided to make a g-funk album co-starring his whole muthaf@$#ing family.This is more of a compilation because RBX only does a small handfull of songs solo, and predictably, those ones are basicly the best tracks with the exception of the snoop and daz collabos. So RBX I ask you, why would you try to make an album featuring mostly talentless artists on your record label, when you could have done a REAL DOPE solo album (how do I miss Heatmizer) and package a compilation of your artists with the album? I could not be more disappointed. I would rather spend my 11.99 on anything but this cd, Sorry X, you wasted your talent on this album, dont be mad at me."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Ripp Tha Game Bloody\\" Review","review":"Average album from West Coast veteran, RBX, released from Daz Dillinger's independent imprint, Gangsta Advisory. RBX, who came up with Snoop & Tha Dogg Pound during the Death Row era of the early 90's, never really had a breakthrough solo effort despite a ghastly flow and an ominous voice. \\"Ripp Tha Game Bloody\\" has a few decent tracks but is far too guest-heavy to be considered a solo album. All-star appearances by Snoop on \\"Tell It! (The Remix)\\" and Daz on \\"Jus... Murda\\" are pretty underwhelming but his collabo with former Doggystyle artist, E. White on \\"They Run\\" is the highlight here. There are some other worthwhile tracks like \\"Summer In The City\\", \\"Crime\\", \\"RBX\\", and \\"Picasso\\", but for the most part, the album is nothing special. Another problem I had with the album is that it has no production credits, thus all of its young unknowns continue to go unknown. \\"Ripp The Game Bloody\\" should have been more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps the tummy feeling good.","review":"I am so happy with this product.

Very difficult.It was much easier if I unsnap the sides and the bottom, making more room within the carrier, but then it became such a hassel to snap them back on to make it snug for my baby.Then I tried Baby Bjorn, and oh boy, what a difference!!I found that you can adjust the Bjorn while I have my baby inside. But with the infantino carrier it was really hard due to a poor quality of buckles and straps (the kind you'll find on a cheap backpack).This also primarily uses snaps to adjust the size of the carrier and this is inconvenient.The price is affordable, but better to invest some $ and buy Bjorn or Ergo, or buy a moby wrap with just about the same price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Crap","review":"Got as shower gift and used all of 5 minutes.

Clean and direct."},{"rating":"2","title":"A devious little treasure","review":"_Nightmare's Disciple_ is a delightful piece of suspense building off the premise that the Cthulhu Mythos is real and its cultists are active here and now. That being the case, how might the creatures of the Mythos manifest themselves in the modern world?Like with many of Lovecraft's own stories, we are left unsure how much of this nightmare is a product of the characters' own madness and how much is \\"really\\" there. Especially striking are the characters who own the horror shop, who gradually come to realize that their hobby is more than just fun and games.I don't want to say too much more, lest I give any spoilers. Mr. Pulver's novel doesn't perhaps have the *cosmic* feel of Lovecraft's best mythos stories, but it is an admirable (and I think successful) attempt to suggest how near terror may be to what we naively think of as our everyday life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost a total loss","review":"The idea might have been good, but the execution is staggeringly inept. The entire \\"novel\\" consists of conversations between uninteresting characters, and the conversation consists almost entirely of recitations of lists. These lists, which can go on for pages, are lists of mythos- influenced authors and artists (some fictitious), imaginary mythos books, imaginary artworks,etc., etc. And when the author runs out of mythos steam the characters endlessly list pop music groups and their compositions (some fictitious), obscure horror movies (some fictitious), obscure classical works (mainly fictitious), and so on... you get the idea. The author, Pulver, has apparently been a music critic for most of his professional life, and he never leaves the day job far behind. With no characters one can give a dump about, no action, really no plot, and a text consisting almost entirely of irrelevant padding, this is one of the most unrewarding reads I have ever suffered through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hot Air","review":"I cannot truly express how let down I was by this book. While the idea behind it sounded quite interesting, the execution was terrible. This story could EASILY have been about 200 pages shorter and the story wouldn't have suffered, instead the reader does. The book is stuffed with volumes of dialog that just seems to be Mr.Pulver showing off how many obscure bands(movies,books,etc.)he can name. The whole thing comes off as an amatuerish vanity piece, with no sympathetic characters at all. Poor editing, poor writing, this book has it all. Save your money and buy ANY of the other fine books in this series. This \\"Nightmare\\" is one you'll wish you never had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterful!","review":"I'm not giving five stars to this book because, for me, five stars is something to give to Poe's \\"Cask of Amontillado\\", or, in a Mythos-related reference, to Lovecraft's own \\"Shadow over Innsmouth\\" (ok, those are short stories, but you get the point). And Joe Pulver's work is not there. At least, not yet. But, gosh, it hits VERY CLOSE! It's a Cthulhu Mythos novel? Yep. It's entertaining for those who dwell in this specific literary ghetto? Sure. But it's more than that -- it's a suspenseful novel, masterfully written... Pulver manipulates time, scene and space as a maestro comanding an orchestra. At one moment, you know more than the characters, and fears for them (a beautiful hitchcockian touch). In the next, all you knew seems to be nothing... If you like horror, read this book. If you like suspense, read this book. If you like just a good, good read, read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"murderkaleidoscope","review":"Joe Pulver's malicious, long-awaited crime novel is a protracted, gripping duel between a driven detective and Marsh, an equally driven killer without a conscience, whose murders are only the beginning! \\"Nightmare's Disciple\\" is replete with Lovecraftian references, but situates itself outside of the mythos looking in, making the facts of Lovecraft's stories and the cults that have sprung up in his wake - real and (one would hope!) unreal - as much the object of investigation as Marsh himself. Readers will thrill to the unostentatious variety of Pulver's tone, the ease with which he slides from crisp, businesslike prose to more delicate, visionary prose-poetry. Although this is a first novel, Pulver writes with all the self-assurance of a seasoned, mature professional.

The technique is there, but it transcends technique. This guy has been around. I've always dug Jackie Mclean, and especially enjoy the very nuanced artistic changes he's made over time. I think he's lost some of the edginess (which was never a bad thing), but that great, distinctive, tart tone is still there. I'm tempted to give it five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wha?","review":"The title of this review was my reaction as I listened to this CD. To appreciate this album it may help to be unfamiliar with Mr. McLean's work. Perhaps I will grow to love it as much as I like every other Jackie McLean album except \\"4,5, and 6\\". However, this is still a better album than the great majority of jazz albums, which is why I gave it 4 stars. Mr. McLean plays unadventurously (which is, of course, highly uncharacteristic), but I did not get the feeling I often get when I listen to other players that he was just running scales. The other players are also excellent, which would be expected. I particularly liked Cedar Walton. This is a fine album even though it may leave long-time McLean fans dumbfounded for a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uncharacteristic ballad set surprisingly succeeds","review":"It's true that Jackie's tart tone doesn't seem ideally suited to ballads, and he's best known for fiery uptempo wailing, but hardcore Japanese fans enjoyed his ballad interpretations enough to encourage him to record this set. Although there are a few moments where he sounds unintentionally strained trying to hit the melody notes, he generally achieves a mature and satisfying bittersweetness. While not representative of his strength, this is a set his fans will enjoy. David Williams' takes several melodic, compelling solos, and Cedar Walton gets ample opportunity to display his highly-refined technique. The late Billy Higgins sparks the mellow groove as much as possible, particularly on \\"What is This Thing Called Love\\", where he really pushes the beat and gets in some potent drum fills."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT the Book.

In a church of 1000+ people, I have not found one person who liked the book.The author makes it seem as if we are all cripped by some common phobias and that we are paralyzed by fear. While some of his premises are fine, most of them are just generalizations and pure grabbing at straws.Maybe this has some applicability for those who live in the Bible belt and who aren't too worldly, but for those of us who have been around the block, it's just another feeble Christian self-help book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Howe's best","review":"Steve Howe is one of the finest guitar players there is. He is also the worst singer of all time. It is bad to such an unbelievable level that surely his producers, friends and fellow musicians have told him not to do it. And yet here again is a CD with about 8 or 9 tracks that are almost unlistenable because of his vocals. The other 8 or 9 tracks are instrumental and very good. While there is some singing (fortunately less than this CD)on \\"Not Necessarily Accoustic\\" , it is a much stronger collection of guitar work and is the live Steve Howe CD to have. \\"Quantum Guitar\\" is probably Howe's best studio work and, no surprise, has NO SINGING bogging down the great guitar playing. The Steve Howe Album is also excellent. The beauty of CD players is that you can program in the good songs to hear without having to listen to a whole album. On this CD you need to program in the instrumentals and leave out the cuts with Howe singing."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the same crap that comes with the product","review":"Dont buy this.

For those who actually care what Science really has to say about the global warming/climate change scare, I can assure them that this documentary is the real thing.

However, the story did not have a continuous flow and too many ends were left open. The book trudged along, not really sparking much interest. Not to mention that the spelling and grammatical errors were appalling, and that was a major turn-off for me. You can't hope to be in the ranks of \\"bestselling author\\" if you present your readers with the work of an 8-year old, and even then, an 8-year old would easily be able to spot the errors before the manuscript went to print.

The second book in a trilogy is rarely the best, and this one isn't either. It gets a little stuck in motion in the middle, but I didn't mind because I so enjoyed being lost in this fascinating world of Seyonne. The writing is fabulous. I gave books one and three five stars. I highly recommend the series, beginning with \\"Transformation.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A successful book two","review":"This is the second book in Carol Berg's Rai-kirah trilogy. Somewhat darker than the first book (but with a very intriguing storyline), the plot involves treachery and redemption, the phantasms of reality and of the spirit/demon realm, and perhaps most importantly, the issue of separateness and wholeness (to avoid a spoiler, I shouldn't say much more than that). The author has sustained the complexity of her plot, settings, and characterizations -- and I'm very much looking forward to reading the final volume."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough continuation to Transformation","review":"I really liked Transformation, and I found myself disappointed that Revelation didn't turn out better. It was still worth reading, and a fine book, but when compared to others of Berg's... it was a bit lacking. It doesn't ruin the trilogy, it just takes it from being one-of-the-best-ever to yeah-that-was-pretty-good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seyonne's Progress","review":"Seyonne's return to Ezzaria, promised at the end of book 1, is not quite the happy ending which Seyonne hoped for. For all that he longed for Ezzaria in exile, he finds that he chafes under the rigid thinking and the clear distrust he faces among so many of his former people. When he encounters a demon which is not evil (something that his people hold impossible) he is exiled again. This time he is sent into a captivity of the soul rather than one of the flesh.Revelation is a strong follow-up to the extremely promising debut Berg made in Transformation. The world of the Rai-Kirah is vivid and heartbreaking and the ordeal of Seyonne captures the attention and the imagination. I was impressed enough to run out and buy the third book right away, something I almost never do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, a little juvenile","review":"I don't know about you, but I remember in junior high hearing about a gay boy who was stood up by a guy, and was consoled by a bunch of hot girls. My friend and I thought, \\"Why not pretend to be gay and try to tap into that?\\" Obviously, it would have its drawbacks, and it was never something we tried. But this movie puts that premise into action, with some fair comedic value. The guys pretending to be gay are sometimes too \\"flamboyantly homosexual\\", the girls are too \\"condescendingly female dog-like\\" and the straight guys they hit on are too \\"aggressively male reproductive organish\\" in their refusals. Also, the parents getting romantic... I could have lived without some of those scenes. It'd be worth a rental one night, or come on, it's just 3 bucks to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A one-trick piggy","review":"Don't get me wrong. I love Sandra Boynton's work.

I bought many copies of the Chocolate book and give them to new friends when I hear they love chocolate.I bought this Pigorian Chant book/CD when I heard about it. But for me, the joke extends too far. After reading the cover and hearing about a minute of the CD, everything else is repetition -- more of the same joke."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ah...the joys of a placid farm life!","review":"The project is a joy to behold. The book, though short, gives us a clear look into a normal day for the farm animals, while the cd provides a musical version of the same. Pigorian Chant is as enjoyable as the Gregorian version. If you have a room that echos you may find that it will enhance the experience.All-in-all, this was quite enjoyable, and the price is unbeatable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"This CD was kind of boring. Didn't interest my daughter as much as Sandra Boynton's other works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funniest thing ever!","review":"My Mother first shared this with me and it is one of the most cleverly funny things I have ever experienced. I belong to a medieval reinactment group (SCA) and I really love putting it on as background at meetings and seeing if anyone catches on. It works both as normal music (if you arn't paying attention it sounds just like regular chant), and as a fabulous IN JOKE.I think you have to have a certain kind of twisted humor to really enjoy it though... and don't buy it if you don't enjoy chant. You'll get bored otherwise... but I love it and hope to share it with many others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Allemoolia!","review":"Grunt is an absolutely delightful sendup of the various popular \\"Chant\\" CDs. Boynton skewers the superficially spiritual with deadly aim, and tosses in some great sounding chant at the same time. She manages to do this without being in the least offensive (and this from someone who learned her first Latin chant more that 40 years ago -and still sings in the choir.) The polyphony of the chickens is not to be missed. Gopher baroque, Sandra! Don't let the turkeys get you down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grunting chant is a hit!","review":"I bought this because I am a Boyinton fan. I enjoy Gregorian chant, so this fulfills that desire.

What was different it was that it really addressed the problem with babies sleeping; it started out on side one with actual sounds from the womb and gently, slowly introduced classical music toward the end. Side 2 continued that until by the 1/2 way mark, it was all classical music, thereby helping the baby get used to sounds other than the heartbeat & pumping of blood while in the womb.

Well, it just happened again and to my horror I noticed a drop of blood on his bib. This toy somehow gave him a cut on his lip, poor thing. Maybe it got caught between the elastic bands or between a band and one of the balls. I now realize that it must have hurt him the first time, too.

He was able to grasp at it in only a month or two, due to its narrow rods, strecthy bands and light weight. My daughter still plays with it.

I think they're great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected..","review":"I bought this toy for my 5 month old, she is now 7 months old and has MAYBE played with it twice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toy","review":"My 7 month old has been playing with this toy for about 3 months now. The design makes the toy easy for him to hold, making it a favorite for the car. He likes chewing on the ends but also likes practicing holding it in different ways, passing back and forth between hands, turning all different ways. It may be normal development but his coordination improved steadily as he played with this toy. As an added bonus Manhattan Toys makes quality products that are safe and made to last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Awesome!","review":"Worth every penny. My 5 month old loves this. I love it, very creative. Makes sound, he likes to hit, shake, bite, kick, and stuff this in his mouth. I don't have to worry about it being too small or dangerous. He was talking to it and everything. There are multiple hand grasps, and alternated with several other toys, this one is highly educative while also entertaining to the parents. can't wait to try this on his fussy days. I think this qualifies as a must-have. I think I also recommend supervision because it has beads and might, on the slight chance, break ending with beads in the baby's mouth. Otherwise terrific concept, it looks like a geometrical puzzle and he acts like he likes it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good toy for very young infants","review":"It is much lighter than I thought it would be. I think if I had gotten it when my son was younger, possibly even when he was a newborn, that he would have been able to play with it. I bought it when he was 5 months old and he loves it. The paint is durable and has survived many dropping on hard floors, lots of chewing, and repeated washings. Attaching linky dinks to this toy doesn't work, but pacifier clips do work. It is one of my favorite \\"take along\\" toys for the diaper bag and for attaching to his stroller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Concerned About Choking","review":"My 3 month old loves this toy and is very interested in it, but I am worried it might be a choking hazard. He immediately puts one of the toy's wooden balls in his mouth as soon as he picks it up. I am concerned that one of these balls could come loose and cause him to choke. I closely supervise him when he plays with this toy, but as he gets older and stronger I may have to retire it. I bought the Skwish after I bought Manhattan Toy Co.'s Winkel. My baby loves the Winkel -- it is all plastic and appears to be much safer -- it does not have balls that could come loose. I would recommend the Winkel over the Skwish. My fear of choking might be unfounded -- as my husband said, Manhattan Toy Co. has been around since the '80s, but in my mind, it is better to be safe than sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"phtalate and BPA content?","review":"We were given this toy and the Winkel as gifts. My daughter loved both (I've put them away). That said, I've looked at the packaging and the Manhattan Toy website, and cannot find any reference at all to pthalate and BPA content. I've emailed the company, Manhattan Toy, twice, asking them about the pthalate, BPA and paint content, but I've received no response, which makes me think they would rather not say. Their website says they comply with all laws, etc., but that goes without saying. Some toy companies voluntarily keep pthalates and BPA out of their toys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed.","review":"I read all the great reviews, then bought it. Very disappointed. My 9 month old can't \\"squish it\\". Its colorful, but not very entertaining for her. She investigates the two sliding beads, but then runs out of ideas for manipulating it. Not fit for children under 12 months, in my opinion..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Father more interested than 6 month old baby","review":"My son liked the toy and bought it for his 6+ month old son. My son plays with it more than baby. Toy looks dangerous as it could be used as a hurling weapon. (My other son chipped my front tooth with a baby rattle he hurled.) Tiny fingers could get caught under the beads when the black links are stretched. I personally think this is a toy designed by well intended geeks who do not realize babies are want to chew on things. This is not a proper chew toy. This toy should not be used without 100% supervision. This toy offers nothing more than looking like a fun toy for parents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected...","review":"I got this toy for my 9 month old, thinking it would be a fun addition to her other gifts under our tree on Christmas morning. When I looked at the picture and read the initial descriptions of the item, I was picturing something that both expands and contracts... That is not what this toy is/does. My daughter seems to enjoy it a little, though most of the play she's done with it has involved her trying to use it as a teether. It is a squishy ball (as it's name implies), but I think it will hold very little appeal to her for very long. My only consolation is that I purchased this toy on sale for only $4.99. Had I gotten it for full price, I probably would have returned it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elastic Gives Out Quickly","review":"It's a great design, fun to look at and handle, but the elastic cords connecting all the components wore out pretty quickly, completely ruining the toy. I wouldn't buy another one. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"warning - major choking hazard","review":"My 5 month old, teething baby pushed this into her mouth and choked.Those strings are stretchy, so if you shove one of the sticks into the mouth, it can go all the way to the throat.We were lucky I was right there when that happened. She gagged and vomited, that was all. But if I wasn't there and she pushed it harder,.... I don't even want to think about it.Please be safe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware Poor Quality","review":"I am really, really disappointed and unhappy - with this toy and with Amazon. I ordered this toy about 7 weeks ago and received it 6 weeks ago. My now 6-month old son has played with it - gently, I might add. And it broke this morning ... \\"snap!\\" went one of the flexible black bands, without any warning at all. The toy is broken and part of the educational appeal - the \\"skwishiness\\" - is gone.Add to that the fact that Amazon will not in any way refund or exchange the product because it's just beyond the 30-day mark, and I'm one unhappy shopper.The worst part is that this was our whole family's favorite toy, so we are of course compelled to buy another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks pretty but does not provide much play and fun for my baby","review":"This is a nicely done and durable toy that provides little opportunity and creativity for play and does not interest my baby at all. The only thing it does, is bending according to the strings and bouncing back into its original shape. I bought it for my baby when she was six months old and now, two months later, she has maybe played a total of 2 hours with it. Save your money and invest it in something more useful, e.g. wooden building blocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"For a 6 month old this toy rocks!!!!","review":"Very durable, and my 6 month old loves it, can be shaken, banged, thrown, squished, and the colors are awesome. A very basic toy, easy to clean, and apparently entertainment for hours. Was the best Christmas present she got this year. I will be looking for more Manhattan toys as she grows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"Both my babies absolutely loved the Skwish! I have purchased many over the years for baby gifts and have heard many wonderful reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, Unique Toy - Very Impressed","review":"What I love about this toy is it's colorful, lightweight, interesting and makes a pleasant chimey type of sound when the wooden beads go across the sticks. It's easy for my baby to hold and it keeps him interested. I know that the recommended age on this thing varies and I would just encourage parents to judge whether or not their baby is ready for this toy. I would expect it would be difficult for a toy company to decide when your particular baby is ready for a toy since babies develop at very different rates."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty, but not safe for infant play","review":"This is a neat looking toy, but seems dangerous with all the little balls, not fit for chewing on. Most importantly, it seems to hurt my baby - she has handled it twice with interest and both times ended up with her crying out in pain - I am not sure what happened, but this toy has been put away for now. it is also pretty heavy/clunky for a young child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic toy","review":"I purchased this toy for my cousins children after seeing how much fun my own baby and other babies love it.

Mellencamp's pedigree would leave one to assume he will not release substandard material, but frankly John's lyrics on this album sound like he's never written a song before in his life, \\"...I'm an American.....from the Midwest\\" feels like he was forced at gunpoint to write this lyric. And many more. The album succeeds only in its consistent starkness, but is in no way the first to arrive to the funeral...The reason why this album fails so miserably is because it's a Mellencamp album and I've come to expect more from him and I'm surprised he let this one slip through the cracks in the record company. So sad.Bernie, Calgary"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best release from John Mellencamp in a while","review":"Freedom Road is a surprising delight from John Mellencamp.

Although not a Scarecrow or Jubilee, this is a solid CD which definitely harkens back to these other works. We've definitely missed him and his music.

His music is here for a great reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"this defines 5 stars","review":"For the past 25 years John Mellencamp has consistently put out great work. With Freedom's Road he has just put out his greatest work ever! It's a retro (60s) sound but yet modern...refreshing, unique, and rock'en.

Im sick to death of hearing \\"Our Country\\", everytime I turn on the TV that song is playing in a Chevy commercial, i think hes beating a dead horse...enough already, we get the message. good song but we dont need to hear it every 30 seconds. I think John Mellencamp is a great songwriter but this CD is just another way of saying, Hey everbody, let get together and eat apple pie and be like the old days in the 60s, sorry but those happy days are long gone. In todays world thats not going to happen. anyways, good CD but seems to repeat a message he gave us back in the 80s..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another soon-to-be Classic Album","review":"You either love John Mellencamp or you don't. I do and have since I watched the old \\"Friday Night Videos\\" on NBC-TV way back when.

I truly hope John will continue to provide us with his talent and keep the spirit of America alive and well in his writing and lyrics. The music will flow naturally from him and his accomplished band members.If you are a fan of John Mellencamp, get this album now and start enjoying it.

Many times there are complicated foot movements that have left me \\"marching in place\\" as I try to bridge my confusion. This can get very frustrating, but I have found this to be the case with many, many DVDs. You put the thing in and five minutes later you are expected to perform a complicated, choreographed dance routine!

It's the only song on the album that's worth listening to, unless you have a higher toleration for cheesy pop music than I do. \\"The Boy Next Door\\" is an absolute joke, as is \\"I Kissed A Boy.\\"The only thing that would make me want to listen to any new Triple Image material is for the girls to sing about more mature topics, instead of repeating \\"I miss you, boy\\" a gazillion times.

I had purchased 2 small reproduction terracotta Chinese warriors at a local flowershop for a gift and simply wanted to know more about their history. When I found this little book, my curiosity was more than quenched. It provided me with a wealth of information, not only about my 2 little terracotta figurines, but about the emperor's whole army. I discovered that more than 6000 life-size terracotta warriors in battle formation were unearthed...and, these were were only a part of an enormous find. (The emperor's death was in 210 BC...the discovery was in the late 1970's). The book is packed with high quality color pictures and bring to life these ancient dynasties. Now, I would love to travel to those sites to see these discoveries in real life.Yes, I was very pleased with the book and have purchased 2 more of the warriors (for myself) and I am now purchasing a 2nd book to give along with the earlier warriors I purchased as a gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"A museum in a handbag","review":"This tiny, heavily illustrated book is packed with info. and curated like a mini-museum of early Chinese history. It's good as a handbag companion for tours of China for amplifying the context of museums or sites. The writing is tiny, and curves around pictures all over the pages. It gives a tour around the country, but partly in the order of when things were discovered.

It does pretty good for the pet fur and some of the dust and dirt. If you have serious clumps of dirt forget it and even dead grass gets clogged in the end. I am still using it for the after the kids go to bed because I do have to give it that it is quiet. So as an inbetween it is good but not as the main source of sweeping. Definatly was disappointed in the commercial it showed it picking up pet food that is a NO! Won't pick up any food except the really small crumbs. Won't even pick up cat litter. So for the price if you are looking to replace your broom don't waiste your money. I wish I hadn't paid that much for it.

I keep it plugged in when not in use. I have a 600 square foot studio. After the initial charge it works well but in about a year's time it will not hold a long enough charge to run through my entire studio (like it used to when I first purchased it).Honestly I would be happy with a corded version of this device so that I would not have to worry about dwindling power as time goes on. If this item came with an electrical cord and the power was consistent I would give this product 5.5 stars. I do not need to spend $35 on a vacuum sweeper that will wind up in the garbage in about 12 months. It really is wasteful and unnecessary dumping of plastic and metal materials into our landfills."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORKS GREAT, BUT WEARS OUT QUICKLY","review":"First let me say that I LOVE the way this product works on hard word and tile. I have 2 shedding dogs and nothing picks up animal hair and dust the way this baby does. The problem is, after about 3-4 months of daily use, the charge begins to hold for only a few minutes which is barely enough to get through one moderate sized room. Eventually it doesn't stay charged at all no matter how long you leave it plugged in. I am sorry to say that I am on my third sweeper in a year and a half. When the last one goes I will probably look for another solution to the dog hair problem.

This product is disappointing at best!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly a substandard product","review":"This is the second Swiffer vac I've purchased. The first one quit working, and I was hopeful that the newer model would be an improvement over the first. Unfortunately, it was no better. The suction is weak, so if your reason for purchasing it is to pick up any more than dust, pet hair, or other very fine particles of dirt, don't waste your money. My biggest complaint is the extremely short battery life. If for just a small room, it's probably O.K., but the battery dies quickly, and picks up less and less as the battery wears down. Another drawback is the long recharge time required, which is approximately 12 hours. All in all, a very poor design!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this product","review":"I bought one after the recall when they came out the second time. I was excited about buying one.

Here are the reasons:1. It takes 18 hours to charge for less than 20 minutes of usage. If you have a house that has more than one room, it'll take you a few days just to vac the entire house.2. It barely picks up anything. I think the picture on the box is misleading. The picture shows the vac sucking up cereals, but it doesn't even pick up cat litter.3. The filter gets filled easily. You'll have to clean out the filter after 10-20 minutes of usage.I guess if you have a small apt and you're purely using it for the purpose of sucking up pet hair.. then get it. Otherwise, this is pretty much junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't last","review":"This would be a great product if it worked longer than a few months.

I was hoping to find a product to sweep the floor and a vacuum cleaner in the same time. First, I had to charge the battery for 24 hours (which is way to much for 10-12 minutes of use) then, when I start to use it I saw that the vacuum is not powerful enough and after few minutes almost stop working. When I cleaned the filter I noticed I had to breath all the dust which was stick to the filter, plus hair and all the dirt and I paid a huge price for it (I bought it in Jamaica and it was around 100 USD). When I bought it I looked on the box to see how many minutes is working and didn't see any information about it. I'm very disappointed!

It eventually died-would not hold a charge, so I replaced it. The first thing I noticed was that the power button is no longer on the handle.

My old version one would visibly pull things into the vacuum, crumbs, cheerios, dog hair, etc. This new one just pushed it a long and then when I am done 'vacuumming' I have to get out my real vacuum and suck up all the stuff it left behind.

As you can imagine this is very disappointing. I will be returning this as soon as I can and will be on the look out for something that will be able to clean my house without having to recharge for 15 plus hours in the middle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"Product is okay. The duster does pretty well with picking up dust and pet hair, but the actual vacuum does not suck up larger items like dirt as easily as it claims, which was the main reason why I bought it.

Not worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality down","review":"I loved the vac. Noticed I put it in past tense. It would be a good vac if only the battery would last longer and it would have more suction. I have the original one that first came out. I did have an issue with the short battery life even with that one. I wanted a new one thinking maybe the new one lasted longer so I bought one from Walmart. I was shocked the quality is lower yet. The battery is very short lived, the suction seems to die out sooner. The on/ off switch used to be located on the handle where you grip it but now it is on top of the motor which is a very inconvenient spot. The rubberized tip on the handle now catches on my clothing as I move the vac. The quality went way, way down. I hope another company catches on and makes a vac with the same concept worth buying. This one is not. I'm keeping my old one until I can find another one which I hope is very soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not care for it","review":"The item will be in the charging mode, more then in use.

After 6 months the charger would no longer charge the Sweeper Vac. So instead of finding out whether it was the charger or the Sweeper Vac unit that went bad, decided to invest in a better hard floor vac and ditch the Swiffer Sweeper Vac.

This duster/vacuum is basically meant to clean/dust the floors and then pick up the little stuff that doesn't stick to the pad. It is not a huge sucking vacuum cleaner. I only turn on the vacuum part to pick up the excess that isn't grabbed by theh pad. I keep mine plugged in at all times when not using it. I have wood floors and and they have never been scratched.

On my second one--the first one lasted 3 months, just under Target's 90-day return policy (whew!), but I thought that was fluke. All these positive reviews can't be wrong, right? Well...I've had my second one for the about 8 months and it's already dying! This baby's had an easy job in my house. The hardwood floors are relatively clean, except for crumbs, hair, etc. Besides a short life, the problem with this stick vac is that you have to keep buying disposable wipes and filters, amounting to an on-going expense, which is wasteful both in more ways than one. Unfortunately, this didn't occur to me at the time of purchase. The pros are that it's easy to operate, fairly sturdy for its weight and does a fair job when it's new...before it starts to lose suction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not last","review":"I was happy with this sweeper when I first got it, but I've had it less than a year and it's now in the trash.

It was after about 4+ months of use that the battery began to hold less and less of a charge. Even in the beginning the battery ran out sooner than I would have liked.

However, Swiffer should have used Lithium Ion batteries on this product. The battery life is unacceptable and this is due to nickel cadmium battery, which no one wants anymore. I will not buy any more cordless tools or devices that do not come with Lithium Ion batteries. Swiffer....use Lithium Ion and charge another ten bucks.

It works very nicely for both my linoleum and laminate flooring.I recommend this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good enough","review":"We had the old swiffer and it worked pretty good, it would pick up virtually anything from the floor.This new on is not at all like that. It's not strong enough.If you have dust or vey light dirt on the floor, you have to pass through very slowly so it can pick it up, and sometimes it doesn't even do that consistently.Another step backwards is the on/off switch. It used to be in the handle, so with only one hand you could do the whole thing.Now is is down where the engine is, so you need to hold it with one hand and turn it on with the other. It's a minor thing, but when you can compare with the old one which was really good, then you see the difference.The concept is very good, wireless and very light, but I think they went back a step with this new model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"Great for laminate and hard wood floors, light weight and easy to use!

I use it every day on my Linoleum \\"plank\\" flooring, which covers almost my entire home. It's amazing how much pet hair and other debris I pick up, each time, even though I had vacuumed the previous day. You see, I have three dogs and eleven cats, all indoor/outdoor, and, out of necessity, the carpeting had to be replaced with new flooring--a fantastic decision, I might add. The SweeperVac is a cleaning product that I would never want to be without. I can't tell you how many other vacuums, floor-cleaning machines and tools that I own--an endless list. However, in truth, the SweeperVac is my very favorite. Scouts honor!

The new one that I just received is every bit as good as the one I replaced. I have a big expanse of tile in my dining room, den and bathrooms.

It was just what I needed: a lightweight vacuum, unencumbered by a cord, that I could run around every day and pick up cat fur and cat litter. It made it really easy to keep my floors clean. Unfortunately, over time the motor became less powerful, even when fully charged. Eventually it just died and it wouldn't recharge.

I noticed, after purchasing, that it needed replacement filters. I would not have purchased this if I had known this. They need to be ordered from DirtDevil, where the charge is $6.99 plus $4.00 for shipping. That is $11 for a tiny filter. I only paid $24 for the whole SweepVac. Also, I didn't realize that this product is made by DirtDevil. My experience has been that DirtDevil products never last more than 6 - 12 months. It has become quickly obvious that the real purpose of this SweepVac is to keep Proctor & Gamble and DirtDevil in business with the continuous purchase of relacement parts. At this rate, the SweepVac should have, at the very least, been given away for free. It is going back to the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wore out Too Quickly","review":"I bought this to tide us over while we were waiting to have our central vac repaired (and as it turned out replaced). It worked fine in the beginning, but quickly deteriorated to the point where the battery barely lasted long enough to vacuum a room. The combination of the Swiffer cloth and suction did work nicely together to pick up dust and cat hair, but it took so long to recharge that it became virtually useless in no time at all and I went back to sweeping the floors. It might be adequate for short spot cleaning, but for that a dust buster (IMHO) does a better job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great.. AT FIRST","review":"I bought this product a few months back as i saw it advertised and thought what a great idea, i have a big vacuum and it is awkward to use and really loud so i don't like using it on my vinyl floors (kitchen and bathroom), so i thought the swiffer vac looked really handy. When i first bought it i put it together and charged it and tried it out, it worked great, sucked up spilt cat litter in the bathroom and little dry food mess in the kitchen etc, it was great. Then a couple months on i noticed it start to lose suction, then it would only work when it was fully charged (like the instant i took it off charge and only for like 10 mins and then it would lose suction again) and now a couple months later it will hardly suck anything up, and i'm talking like some bits of dry rice etc, it wont suck it up, and some things it does suck up just fall back out again. I am very disappointed in it as it seemed like such a great product, i have emailed swiffer about it but am not expecting much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great until it died...","review":"I thought at first this product was the answer to my kitchen floor issues.

I now own a small upright vacuum with optional rotating brush.

I typically use it once a week to clean the floors of my room. At first, the vacuum worked very well and picked up everything that it was supposed to. However, as time goes on, you'll notice that the power of the vacuum is not as good as it needs to be to pick up dust and pet hair. It got to the point where I was basically just spreading the cat hair around under my bed instead of vacuuming it up. It doesn't matter if you follow Swiffer's instructions on how to maximize battery life and power. The battery just plain gets weaker very quickly over time. In conclusion, unless you absolutely need the portability offered by this product or if you just need to do some light vacuuming, avoid it if you can.Pros:LightweightCons:Battery lifeLimited power"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't last long","review":"I loved the swiffer when I first received it, but after only a few months it won't hold a charge.

The problem I had with the original swiffer was that I felt I had to use the broom and dustpan for crumbs and big stuff before I swiffered and that was a pain. Now the Sweep+Vac deals with the big stuff and the dust. This may be so convenient I'll be inspired to clean everyday. It's so light, too. It's easy to bring upstairs to my bathroom.

If you have a much bigger area to clean, or have carpet or pets, it might not be worth your while -- the vacuum motor won't pick up large bits, and a full charge is only good for 10-12 minutes of vacuuming, so if it takes you more than 10 minutes to cover all your surfaces, you'll have trouble.

The TV does have some peculiar behaviors, like the fans running all the time or the occasional no antenna signal for HD channels (yes, over the air). We paid $2400 back in 2006 for this and it's still a relative bargain for the size to cost ratio. In short, it's a great 1080i TV for the size, cost and function.

After speaking with Toshiba Customer service, the part is back ordered. The best they could give me was an estimate of 2 - 3 weeks for the part to come in... then they would ship it out 2nd day shipping.After reading the other reviews, this back order problem has been an issue since atleast October of 2005 and is still not rectified.

As far as the quality of the material itself it is pretty good though I would have like it more if they would have slipped in some songs from their Beast from the east album which is by far their best.

But possible the contents could then be shrinked to 10 hours which might not amuse the sales agency.To be fair, I'm using a windows version of The GIMP - the book deals with the linux version.To give a background - i worked for years with corel, etc.I think i will download the GIMP help documentation and help myself.Sorry guys, but this is the worst book I've read in the last few years!"},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars for Bar to Bar 2002","review":"I recently got Bar to Bar 2002 and if your an avid supercross fan this is for you.

It was similar to a gas model except it weighed less, had easier handling and blew away the competition. These models like 41ACT45P966 have a clunky, heavy rotor area at the end which makes it difficult to hold up and see what you're doing. Why Troy Bilt discontinued the TB50 is beyond reason.

Along with a particular brand of coffee we prefer, the DeLonghi makes the best cup of coffee we have ever drunk anywhere in the world -- and we have traveled widely. The only problem is that we are now \\"coffee snobs\\" and need a fix of the good stuff twice a day! Several of our friends have bought a DeLonghi ESAM3500 too, after drinking our coffee, so the population of snobs is growing.It is important to keep the machine as clean as possible throughout or there will be problems.

Experiment with the strength of the coffee to suit your taste. Turn it on (think you can program it to come on also, just haven't gotten that far in the manual - stopped once I read latte section), it warms up while you are doing the morning routine and stands by to make your coffee. Takes me maybe 5 minutes in the morning to make 2 to 3 large latte's, (thermos two) and take my mug to work. Ahh caffeine - now I can save some time, money, and be primed for the day at the office.

If you look through the contents, it obviously focuses on using preconstructed databases, not building them. With that in mind, I had never used Access before, bought this book, used it from cover to cover, and based on what I learned got a job that doubled my secretarial salary. I do hope, however, that the authors of this book create an advanced version, because it is only beginner to somewhat intermediate level, but I just loved the fact that the authors did not assume any knowledge on the users' part and still managed to keep me from feeling like I was using one of those awful dummies books."},{"rating":"1","title":"By a good book","review":"If you want to learn something about access 2000, don't by this book.

I should have done that in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total disappointment, a worthless book","review":"After trying to teach Access to my students with this badly written book I had to give up.

I did not know if I would still enjoy it (I loved it then). To my delight I found it just as entertaining as before. Now as a retired professor of sociology I enjoy the spoofs of the early \\"soaps\\" that this series makes.

Norman Lear wasn't the first to bring the soap opera to night time, but this ingenious spoof of Peyton Place made it much more fun to watch. You really have to get into this crazy quiltwork of characters to enjoy the show, otherwise it will test your patience pretty quickly. MH2 may have been the creation of Lear, but it was the writing of Gail Parent and Ann Marcus that made the show so memorable, creating a cult following. Marcus had a chance to let lose after writing for Search for Tomorrow. An amazing number of episodes were produced, but these 25 episodes are about all most people will be able to take. MH2 sticks to the soap opera format, whereas Soap, which came out a year later, treated the material pretty much as a sitcom. Great cast! In addition to Lasser and Mary Kay Place, there was Martin Mull, Dabney Coleman and Doris Roberts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mary Hartman Mary Hartman","review":"Wonderful!! We had forgotten how terrific the show was. We did not have color a TV back then so we are seeing for the first time in color.

Cannot wait for my adult daughter to watch it for the first timeand see her reaction."},{"rating":"2","title":"At last, at last: Please keep the sets coming!","review":"One of the exciting things about Mary Hartman, Mary Hartman getting released on DVD is the possibility that a new generation of viewers can discover this beautifully strange satire for themselves! I first caught a couple rerun episodes when I was in high school in 1990, and from that moment on I was hooked: by the great blend of surreal comedy and heartbreaking humanity, by the excellent performances of Louise Lasser, Dody Goodman, and the entire cast, by the fact that there has been nothing like it on television before or since. I'm convinced the group who fell for it in 1976 will revisit it with glee, and the group of young adults who never had a chance to see it because it got buried and forgotten in the 80s and 90s are in for a major cult comedy treat. FINALLY indeed. May Sony release all 325 episodes in 13 volume sets. Us MHMH fans will rejoice with every new addition. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well the local library had a copy....","review":"and when I asked my mother what were some good sitcoms from the past she mentioned this one.

The whole town is strange, I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outrageous","review":"I hope that all the episodes will be released soon. I had forgotten about the chicken soup episode until another reviewer mentioned it. This show really holds up well; it is well written and the cast is very talented and versatile. There are a lot of innuendos and references that the viewer doesn't catch the first time, so someone can watch these episodes many times and can always see something new.

In a nutshell, his reasoning is that, long term, stocks are no more risky than fixed return investments like bonds. Yet, because earnings tend to grow, they have higher rates of return.

Strong lead characters and equally delightful supporting characters. The dialogue is fresh and enjoyable-the various quips and retorts exchanged by the different characters are a delight to read.Plot-wise though, the novel fluctuates between alternating degrees of predictability and implausibility. In the romance vein, for the most part, the future love matches are so obvious that one will definitely not be surprised by the author's attempt to give everyone a happy ending (and let's face it, we like it better that way anyway). In the other aspects of the plot, however, certain developments or elements were simply too improbable and unlikely to have occurred.Basically, this novel is an extremely fun read-just go along with Kylie Adams' flight of fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sassy and Hip!","review":"FLY ME TO THE MOON is an action packed, off-the-wall love story riddled with quirky characters and a hilarious, screwy plot.

This chronicle of the first thru-hike of the AT is highly factual, and quite literal. Shaffer did an excellent job of describing the varied terrain and geographic route of the trail.

Its a promising subject matter that could have been interesting, but instead was dealt with in a slightly ridiculous and melodramatic way which left no room for character development or further exploration of the key ideas. It would have been nice if the writer had gone deeper into Sam and his East-West conflict, or the real reasons behind Tracy's obsession with exoticism.

One wonders if he knows any women at all. Remember, he is supposed to be writing about Western women agreeing to be part of a harem (where the second wife is taking on the man who accidentally killed the love of her life!!) -really, what is their motivation to do this? The book is a long, drawn-out male fantasy, with glaring inaccuracies about Islam as well.

The alternate version is a perfect song for eggs benedict at a bay window on a lazy Sunday morning. The Lizards reprise their classing Tarantella here. If you're tired of that same old jazz, and you go for the unusual rhythms of Dave Brubeck you'll dig the Lizards.

The \\"safety\\" feature makes this unit utterly useless. The problem is due to the fact that the mandoline slider has to be attached to the base at all times while using the blades. As the slider passes over the blade, it pushes down 2 spring loaded levers on each side of the blade. This raises the blade for cutting, but lowers it flush to the base when exposed. Due to this design, all items for slicing must fit inside the hole at the top of the slider which is far too small for most items. In other words, unless you are slicing cherry tomatoes, pearl onions, or other very small foods, you must first cut the it into smaller chunks.

Buuuut, that's because I can't use it for anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad little \\"Safety\\" cutter","review":"I was hopful, but found the safety feature of this mandolin made it nearly useless. I wanted to make french fries, but everthing has to fit it the little oval hole. Anyone want 2 inch fries with their burger? It's also hard to get the last of the item you are slicing sliced. I think you have to unprong it and hold the handle just right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"As others have said, the item to be cut must fit in a little hole about 2\\"x3\\", and even then the holder won't let you push down enough to cut the last 1\\" or so of thickness.This is one of those items you'd give zero stars to if Amazon permitted. And we got it free! Imagine if you'd paid for this turkey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ultimate Mandoline is the worst","review":"My wife purchased the Ultimate Mandoline for me. I do a lot of cooking and this seemed like a good idea......until I used it. The system looks clean and appears to be easy to use. I first attempted to cut potatoes with it. We wound up having really awful looking slices. It continuously jammed up. The base moved al over the counter. I tried to use it over a bowl, which was useless.Next I tried to cut firm tomatoes. What I got instead was tomato mush. Onions were next (I wanted this thing to work.....I did not want my wife to be disappointed with her purchase). Needless to say I have gone back to knife. The previous negative reviews are pretty much on the mark. I contacted the rep that we purchased it from and she contacted P.C. and told her to have us send it back for a refund. They said they were coming out with an improved version....I think I will pass on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of garbage and way over priced","review":"What a piece of garbage!I had one of the old Pampered Chef slicers that worked great. But you had to be very careful not to slice your fingers.I guess to prevent law suits some bozo came up with this system to keep the blade covered.Problem is, you can't slice a large onion in it only small tomatoes.You can't slice a medium size tomato in it; only small tomatoes.You can't slice a large potatoe in it.Very clumsy when slicing things like carrots."},{"rating":"1","title":"So safe it is useless.","review":"We have had this mandoline for over a year and have never been able to slice on it. After reading the reviews here we now know why. You HAVE to use the food holder to make the blade come up. So much for slicing tomatoes, onions, potatoes. These items do not fit in the holder. Even if you could get something sliced in it you only get 2 thicknesses."},{"rating":"1","title":"trash","review":"I purchased this a long time ago and kept bringing it out every so often to try to figure out why it wouldn't work! After reading the reviews I am furious that thing has such a stupid 'safety feature'! If you don't know how to use a knife you wouldn't have purchased this thing to begin with!

Ill stick with my trusty Feemsters slicer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think twice before ordering, it's dangerous!","review":"The first time I used this thing, I was in the ER a half hour later.

I tried slicing potatoes thinly for chips, and after fighting with the mandoline for an hour, I gave up. It required a significant amount of effort, and a precise application of pressure, to get the potato to slice uniformly. I have never been more frustrated, I gave up and used a knife.I do have to say that when I contacted Pampered Chef, they were very gracious, and allowed me to return this for a full refund - they even issued a call tag to pick it up. I'm impressed, I was expecting (at best) a merchandise credit.Pampered Chef is a great company with gadgets that I love (their garlic press, for example, is the best I've ever used), this particular product does not live up to the Pampered Chef name or reputation."},{"rating":"1","title":"P.O.S.","review":"I have been trying to use this for a year now. Different items and such. It's crap. In fact I am finding that most Pampered Chef gadgets are all crap. The mandoline doesn't even slice. I have tried cucumbers, potatoes and tomatoes. The only thing it's even remotely useful at is shredding cheese. Seems like a lot of work for shredding cheese though when I can just pull out my trusty old stand up generic grater.

However, once I had watched a video review so I understood that you need to get the food carrier right up to the top of the mandoline so the safety levers will disengage, it was fairly easy to use. I haven't tried tomatoes or other veggies yet, but I'm looking forward to using it again. If I were to do it again, I'd use it before the day I needed it so I could call my Pampered Chef consultant. But I really like the safety features and the fact that it's ALL DISHWASHER SAFE!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous","review":"Tried to use it with big onion, did not fit.

I'd love to live in her brain. I've read romances for years, and I cannot think of another writer who managed to surprise me as often as Mulvany.

Soon, they are engaged in cautious conversation and Cat begins to formulate a plan to get revenge on Alex.Run No More is listed on the 2004 Best Contemporary Romance list by Romantic Times and won a 2005 Prism Award in the Time Travel Category.

Really unusual, to say the least, and when i say it's a great CD I'm assuming that you've found this page intentionally, in which case someone or something must have peaked your interest. I would think that that something is Gainax's OAV FLCL, for which most of the music is by the pillows, and is the most likely way for you to find out about this japanese punk/rock band. Nothing like the j-pop that you normally see get imported, which isn't a bad thing.

The story songs are still present, but the overall tone seems to be even more upbeat (perhaps his recent marriage provided inspiration?) than on past recordings. As always, his way of passing on God's message seems to be exactly what is needed for the time.The title track on Broken & Beautiful will end up becoming a worship standard. My other current favorite is Until I See You Again...what an amazingly positive message about God not wanting us to let life pass us by!My only complaint is in the mastering...this album has much more of a pop sound due to the overly increased bass.

This man is the BEST Christian artist out there!! The thing that appeals to me about Mark the most I have to say, is the way he writes his songs. Some Christian singers (and other types of recording artists, too) have a knack for singing about things that either don't make a whole lot of sense, or that just don't strike anyone very emotionally. Mark is different. I was just discussing his music with my mom the other day, and we were both in agreement about how it's his simplicity...his genuine feelings for those who have gone through pain, joy etc. that makes him different.

The Highest highs are dropped a bit, and the bass is boosted. The low frequency reproduction is spooky. They beat my my expensive Sennheiser's and my big AKG's in the bottom. I dont mean volume either, I am talking about frequency. These just go lower. How does a tiny little driver manage to reproduce what sounds like 100 hz? While the highs are turned down a bit, they are still transparent and bright, it is perfect for those Sony op amps that have the highs boosted till it hurts. They are super efficient as well, any little player will drive them loud and clear. No they are not something you match up with your 3000 dollar tube amp.

I wasn't too rough with them or anything.Reading the warranty more closely, I discovered it said \\"Invalid in the United States and Canada.\\" This is a European company so apparently the product is not warranted in the US.I am going to try sending them back to a service center here in the states, but I would never buy these headphones again. They are too cheaply made. If you spend $50, your headphones shouldn't break."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"I was looking for a compact, reasonably priced, decent sounding closed design. Looks like I got it:Pros:- Compact and foldable. Much smaller than most isolation 'phones.- Good overall sound, much better than many cheaper 'phones.- Bass is boosted but sounds good in a \\"loudness\\" sort of way- Closed design provides some noise suppression- Wife can sleep while I'm tuning out before sleep.- About as comfortable as any other closed headphone.- Just enough inward pressure to stay secure on the head.- Decent quality/value for the price.- Replaceable cushions.- Good efficiency.Cons:- Reasonably sturdy, but probably won't stand up to lots of abuse.- Springy headband makes mounting a bit more challenging than a fixed headband.- Not as noise suppressing as active cancellation or ear canal style 'phones. But less bulky and easier to mount also.Other 'phones I currently use:- Koss Pro4A studio and Sportapro, Grado, Shure and tons of crappy earbuds going into the dustbin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Affordable and Comfortable","review":"So, I've read the rest of the reviews and how critical they are. I mean a pair of cans at this level of resolution and comfort for fifty bucks and everyone has a gripe. Come on people.Here's the bottom line: I'm a bald guy nearing 60 and comfort is paramount. When I first put these guys on my crown I thought \\"too tight\\" only to find that it was a secure feeling and actually quite comfortable. A tad snug, but sure to stay in place whilst on my bike or walking.My primary is the Grado SR-125 and I can say that the AKGs do very well when compared via a Creek amp, so when used with your portable - look out.. The bass is quite good and fun whilst on the move and the mids are full. Treble is exceptional in this price range.If you're looking for something to replace all the crappy 'buds' out there or to sneak something into work or your workout - stop searching.

The steel band may not look very comfortable , but suprisingly it is. It provides a nice snug fit. This is critical for proper coupling to get all the bass performance. Also contributing to this are fairly thick cushions, compared to the sony's and senheisser's, which I felt were flimsy and prone to shifting and misalignment. It gives a good amount of isolation from the outside, which is great for my subway commute."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheaply Made","review":"These headphones were really great. Much more affordable than noise cancelling headphones, I used these on near weekly flights for roughly eighteen months and they completely drowned out the noise of the plane, snoring passengers, and bawling children without destroying my ear drums.Unfortunately they recently broke early in a three hour and half hour flight back home. As I was removing them the left earphone popped off the casing which hit the guy sitting next to me and woke him up. I spent the rest of the flight holding the earphone up to my ear, which was a pile of suck. When we landed, the casing was nowhere in sight and I was too tired to go searching under the seats for it.I got $50 worth out of them, but I'm hoping I'll be able to send them back under warranty."},{"rating":"2","title":"great commuter headphone","review":"this headphone has great bass and seals out external noise. folds up and stores in a bag. highly recommended. also recommended by headroom the headphone amp people, check out their web site."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent sound, reasonable price","review":"This is actually my third pair of AKG headphones. While I wish I hadn't broken or lost the previous pairs, I had only one thing in mind when disaster struck: get another pair!

They are lightweight and therefore easy to transport and block out a very high percentage of outside noise.

However, since it's also on Radiohead's latest album, Hail To The Thief, there's absolutely no reason to buy this single unless you're a completist like myself.\\"Paperbag Writer\\" (is that title supposed to be a joke?) is a typical Radiohead b-side (a lot like the stuff they put on their albums except not as grandiose), though quite a bit below par compared to the b-sides from Amnesiac's singles. \\"Where Bluebirds Fly\\" begins, ends, and runs throughout with THE most irritating percussion loop I've ever heard. The echoey, ghostly vocals have also become a bit much by this point. It's obvious that they didn't put a lot of effort into these songs, and that worries me since this is the lead-off single for the album. Hopefully, future singles' b-sides will be a lot better, but I'm not holding my breath."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer, BEWARE!!!!","review":"No need to review the movie here, HOWEVER, the Blu-Ray is sub-standard.

Nice compilation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Put on the Second Half","review":"I agree with the reviewers who find Tom Scott and the L.A. Express to be a detriment to Joni's sound -- compare this band to the superlative band she toured with on Shadows and Light (Metheny, Pastorius) and the deficiencies are obvious. But then I've had a grudge against Scott ever since he mucked up George Harrison's Extra Texture (Read All About It).Turn out the lights and put on the second half -- Joni lights up the acoustic, sparsely-accompanied set with her incredible voice and spirit. I love her delicate, committed versions of \\"Circle Game\\" and \\"Both Sides Now,\\" the beautiful \\"Real Good for Free,\\" the aching version of \\"People's Party.\\"It's worth picking this up for the acoustic set. Also, the inside photos of Joni are precious -- we love you, thank you for your art."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great talent, disappointing concert","review":"I'm a huge fan of Joni Mitchell -- few in the history of recorded music have approached her prodigious talents as both a singer and a songwriter. That said, \\"Miles of Aisles\\" -- both the LP and the concert tour, was a disappointment. Her collaboration with Tom Scott and the LA Express worked poorly, despite the great sound of Scott's band. I actually attended the concert -- at Tanglewood in Lenox, Mass., about 500 years ago, and I remember feeling the same way back then."},{"rating":"2","title":"live joni","review":"this is a great album live joni backed with tom scott and the LA express.

Backed by the Tom Scott's horn section, there are parts of this disk that really rock. Unfortunately, even with the impressive cast of supporting musicans there is a lack of consistency. Some of the songs do not translate well in the live format, leaving me wondering if lies in the recording or the artist's live personna. The LA Express does save some of the arrangements and punches some life into these tunes, but still there is a lack of energy for a live release."},{"rating":"1","title":"...my ten-year old's a more sensitive editor...","review":"I only enjoyed half of this album on vinyl ... the latter half.And if the performance had been transferred intact from the vinyl version, I'd give it three stars.There's some terrific music on this album.BUTThis 'transfer' from vinyl to CD is a SUCH a hack job. One can easily hear the crude edits. The intimate dialogue from the original recording was completely removed.Truly, my little boy could have done a better remastering job.For shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Joni album","review":"I have always loved this live Joni Mitchell album. There is just something about the performances that really appeals to me. A few of the songs are done quite differently from the studio versions. That doesn't mean they are better or worse, just different. But this is definitely my favorite version of Both Sides Now. And Tom Scott and his group are a wonderful complement to Joni. I know that some people have complained about a certain loss of atmosphere because some of the in between stuff that was on the vinyl was edited out for the CD. But the songs are still there and this is one album I will never tire of listening to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book, eye opener on the US Special Forces","review":"I read this book after being a long-time fan of \\"The Unit\\". Haney gets straight into how he came to selection with Delta then spends the rest of the book giving generally matter of fact no nonsense descriptions of his time in Delta. Having read a number of books on the special forces world it was interesting finally reading something about Delta Force and I really enjoyed Haneys book. The most memorable thing is how much of Delta Force is taken directly from the SAS. I knew they were inspired by the UK's finest but I didnt realise they were a direct copy! Most of the component arts of Delta are lifted from the SAS - and they rarely even bothered to change names!!!Good Book though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"How Delta Came to Be","review":"I read a few other reviews of this book before buying it and find they were accurate. Haney tells about how Delta force came to be in interesting detail. The people that submit themselves to the Selection process really can only truly truly want the job. If you watch or have seen any episodes of \\"The Unit\\" you can see where story plot lines came from, but don't expect any detailed past mission stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great work describing these warrior soldiers","review":"This book is by far one of if not the best book that I have read in the past year. Haney writing style is great and you don't want to put the book down til you reach the end. Which you will dread coming to, because you wish the book would go on and on since it is so good.

Haney's INSIDE DELTA FORCE is a real eye-opener, which makes the reader appreciate what the men and women of our country's armed forces sacrifice to keep us safe in our beds on a day-to-day basis.I found the selection process while Delta Force was being formed to be particularly interesting. Haney made the reader step into his shoes and want to press on: he on the field and us by the page.Having said that, some parts of the book after Delta Force was formed were a bit slow and I did lose some interest at times. But I will say that I am glad I read the book to the end. The detail and emotion Haney uses to describe various battles are incredible. I commend him and the others for having fought for us, I commend the families for supporting our men and women to do so, and I commend Command Sergeant Major Haney for being brave enough to relive each battle - sharing them with us through his book.J.R.

Haney comes in for some pretty heavy criticism in a just-published expose by Richard Lardner in the Tampa Tribune. Lotsa ex-Delta guys are quoted in the report saying Haney exaggerates shamelessly and fabricates events. They say the command ranks he claims to have attained while in Delta actually came after he'd left the unit. They feel he sold out his former comrades. I read the book. I found it entertaining, but so was Mission Impossible. Two thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok here it is","review":"Interesting book. I recently saw Haney on CNN so I read the book. Light in details, a lot about Haney. I can see why Haney admits to being kept in the dark regarding operations. On CNN Haney stated that terrorists should be reminded that they could be turned over to their governments for harsher treatment (i.e. torture), plays well for the revenge seeking public no doubt. For a professional soldier to advocate releasing a HUMIT asset to a corrupt foreign government that in the end will only tell us what they want us to know is foolhardy. Once we have a terrorist in custody I say we keep him and interrogate him using our sound methods. Furthermore, then (80's) COL Bill Garrison was the true architect of the accomplishments of SFOD.

Unique in that the narrative is nearly a moment by moment account of the grueling selection process coupled with all the details able to be printed about the first decade or so of missions. Colonel Beckwith's dreams and vision of the Unit have all come true and likely exceeded any of his wildest imaginations.

Also compelling are the various Delta missions he describes in behind-the-scenes detail - something you don't read in the newspapers.

I've always been fascinated by the secrecy of the unit and with this book I have become very knowledgeable about it's roots. Even though there wasn't any current info on Delta, this was still and outstanding book that documents Haney's time from when he was with the Rangers all the way up until he got selected to CSM and left the unit.

Haney's description of it's formation and his participation is nothing short of breathtaking. Written like a first person journal, it meets all the requirements of a fine read. I thank God for men like Haney who are willing to do the dirty work and rise above the politicians and their indecision.

I know a lot of people are disapointed by the lack of mission details but it has to be acknowledged that the Delta force isn't even officially/publically recognized by the government due to its sensitive and top secret nature. Undertsandably this makes details of missions not appropriate for public consumption. But for anyone who ever wanted to know more about Delta operators, how they are trained and what the force is SUPPOSED to be used for (counter-terrorism), this book is a must read.

Mr Haney gave the reader a look at what it takes to enter, survive and operate in the shadowy world of special operations. This is an excellent book for anyone interested in knowing more about the warriors that protect us and while making great sacrifices."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Truth Hurts","review":"I just finished the book which I got for Christmas. I feel like I know Eric Haney after reading it and want to call him up just to thank him. It could've been obnoxious. It could'be been sensationalized to feel like a James Bond movie. It could've been cynical and critical of goverment agencies, foreign governments and the like. The book was none of those things. He tells it like it is (I think). And it is about training, selection, purpose and daily life (and death). The first half of the book is about the training which made me tired just reading it. The second half is the application of that training. So it's a nice mix for the reader. I had no idea they have their fingers in so many pies. Seemingly minor events in the news over the years like Grenada, El Slalvador, and Lebanon come to life because they are far from minor. It's a thankless job. If he reads this -- thanks for enlightening me.

There were a few songs that I didn't know, and I definitely think there were a few that should've been here that weren't. Like, \\"It's a little too late\\" and \\"You better run\\". I think whoever put the album together was probably trying to get something on there that was more recent as Pat has still been recording.I was never a huge fan of hers back in the 80's, but i always liked her music. I recently saw her on VH1's Behind the Music, and decided to get this greatest hits. This is definitely worth getting for the casual fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is essential Pat Benatar","review":"This is a great collection of great rock. Everything is here that fans would want, especially those like me that might not have the inclination to collect every album. The only thing that I felt was too much was two versions of \\"Hell is for Children\\". Personally I like the live cut better, so maybe they could have lost the studio version and fit 1 or 2 other songs on this album. But don't let anything keep you from getting this record.

Most casual fans and the idle curious will probably be well satisfied - with \\"Hit Me...\\", \\"Love Is a Battlefield\\" and \\"We Belong\\", how could they not be? As usual with best-of packages, there are several \\"what-th'-heck?\\" items, including \\"One Love\\", and most notably a live version of \\"Hell Is For Children\\" (in addition to the studio version!). \\"Little Too Late\\", \\"Looking for a Stranger\\" and \\"Treat Me Right\\" would've all been better choices. But the balance of the disc holds up. My faves are \\"Promises in the Dark\\", \\"We Live for Love\\" and \\"Shadows of the Night\\", but why not pick up a copy and find your own faves?"},{"rating":"2","title":"OPERATIC VOICE IN A ROCK WAY!","review":"It's obvious that this collection reunites records of the best commercial rock ever made in history. Pat Benatar was a well produced artist, that took advantage of her vocal range that felt like an angel singin' hard rock pop gems. This collection is missing \\"nothing\\", yes, is true that some singles that were release are not included here, but those singles for example \\"Sex As A Weapon\\" or \\"The Ooh Ooh Song\\" are not Benatar's best, and those singles failed to reach even the top 20. \\"Best Shots\\" fullfill anyone's crave for Benatar's highlights from fans to casual listeners, this collection was well crafted and recolected, without a doubt, Pat Benatar represent an era were love could be portrait is rock music, without making the last sound corny or out of place. The highlights are \\"We Belong\\", \\"Hit Me With Your Best Shot\\", \\"Heartbreaker\\", and \\"Promises in the Dark\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"great cd-could have included more.","review":"Pat Benatar was the rock-chick of the 80's.

What can I say, MXR makes a great product, the fact it has both volume and gain on it really help shape the sound of your instrument.I have not gigged with it yet but since it has a metal body I imagine it will hold up well.Hope this helps, read my other reviews on various products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best EQ so far","review":"This is the best EQ I have used for guitar so far. I previously had a Boss pedal but I like this more. I have it in the effects loop of my amp and the tone is so much better. If you aren't getting the exact tone you are looking for this is the way to go. Also built like a tank and comes with a power supply."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect. Just what I needed!","review":"You can't go wrong with this pedal. With 10 different bands to control your tone, you'll definitely find an use for it. I usually set the base tone on my pedals then shape it around with this pedal as a master control. It actually comes with an 18v adapter so don't make the mistake that I did and order an extra one. This pedal actually cleaned up my sound a bit. Maybe the tone it gives out is just that great but it definitely gives you a lot to play with."},{"rating":"2","title":"MXR 10band eq","review":"This is yet another stunning piece of MXR equipment suitable for live performance. Ten designated bands of EQ adjustment with easy to use LED-lit sliders. Volume and gain faders, foot operated on-off push button control, all in MXR's typically rugged housing. Clean, effective EQing. Great for bringing out just the right frequencies on guitar, bass, keys, etc. Requires 18v negative center power. At $100 a perfectly functional to-the-point piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Improves your tone dramatically","review":"When I was putting together my pedalboard I needed something that would not only help shape my tone but that would boost my signal. I am not a fan of distortion pedals as I prefer to get all the overdrive from my amp. That is why the MXR 10 Band EQ fits so well. This thing makes such a huge difference in the overall sound of your guitar and amp. It is easy to use, well built and a must have for any gigging guitarist."},{"rating":"2","title":"So very happy!","review":"I bought this watch at Sam's Club in the Spring and wore the pink band first - it reflects the mother of pearl in the face best. I gotta buy another one so I can always have a pink band! I switched out to the blue band to keep the pink one in good shape. I thought changing the bands was EASY because on the back of the bands is a little cut out part that makes it easy to get to with the little tool included in the set."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice watch, good value!","review":"I purchased this watch at a great price at a Friday sale. The bling was a perfect match with a belt and shoes that I already had. The face is large and easy to read and very pretty with the mother of pearl background and the crystal accents. My only complaint is that the bands are a little difficult to change. It would be much easier if each band came with its own set of pins. I may head to Walmart and buy some extras so they're already inside the bands. For the price, I'm not so concerned about a warranty on this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't keep time","review":"This is such a beautiful watch, I fell in love with it as soon as I got it. But unfortunately I had to return it because before the end of the day, it was already off time and would not keep time no matter how many times I set it. I took it to have the battery looked at and they said the watch was fine. So I asked for a replacement from Amazon and the next one I got had a huge gash in the back, looking like someone tried to open the back with a screwdriver and messed up horribly. So it's a beautiful watch, but buyers beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy","review":"When I first received this watch I wore it and it occassionally would stop so I replaced the battery thinking that would solve the problem.

The bookRelics & Rituals Olympus (Sword & Sorcery)is a much better fantasy role-playing guide to the ancient Greek mythos, to be certain. OGL Ancients replicates too much material right out of the d20 SRD (at least half of the pages are of that material) that you probably already have if you own the PHB or have access to the SRD online. The classes are not well thought out. If you play a non-magic or low-magic campaign you may like some of the materials presented in this book. Don't get your sights set too high with this one. If you can pick this one up for under $10 it is not a bad deal. At the very least it has some material in it, that can provide you with a few interesting ideas, and the timeline is a good template.

It's not a studio recording... it's a live recording. As much as I enjoy Jackson Browne I felt cheated and decieved into purchasing a live recording. No where on the packaging does it indicate it's a live recording. Frankly, I'd rather listen to nothing than listen to fans in the back-ground! I don't care how much I enjoy Jackson Browne's music... I'll be damn if I waste another dime on another of his CD's untill I can be damn sure it's a studio recording.I'm so angry I'm tempted to dig the pieces of the discs out of the trash and mail them back to Electra/Rhino along with an accompanying nasty-gram regarding deceptive marketing/packaging!As it is I personally feel a total refund is in order!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great music - disappointing DVD","review":"The music is great, but the DVD is nothing more than a collection of pictures (i.e., STILL IMAGES) from the concert tour.

It is no coincidence that his later albums became more overtly political as that became the new grid by which he saw the world. Here we have the lost and wandering Browne, who even gets help with the writing of his songs, and using other folks songs as well. The result however, sees no loss of quality or production. This is another excellent album from Browne. One other note, the next time you watch the movie Forrest Gump and hear the song \\"Running on Empty\\" while Forrest is dealing with his loss by running from shore to shore, know that it's not that different than what Browne himself was doing when he wrote it (except Browne used a tour bus).Five Stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Truly Great Live Album","review":"This is the album that was my introduction to Jackson Browne back in 1977 and listening to it now in beautifully mixed 5.1 surround I am hearing details in the music I had never noticed before.This is a live album though some of it was recorded in non conventional settings like on a tour bus or backstage but every song fits together so seamlessly that even those who don't like live recordings would have no problems here.Other reviewers have covered the finer details so for those that are wondering whether it is worth getting this DVD Audio version I can only say yes do it while it is still available.For me it is a huge improvement on the standard stereo mix in not only musical detail but also in how \`big' it sounds.It really is an immersive experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"OneOfMyAllTimeFavoriteAlbums","review":"I played this record so much,I had to buy another one untill CD's came out.Not a day goes by that you don't hear \\"Running on empty\\"or \\"Stay\\"playing on the radio,but there are so many other great cuts,\\"Rosie\\" being my favorite.\\"I got to Hand It to me\\"GREAT LINE,and GREAT CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sandi on Jackson Browne","review":"Love this album.

Jackson Browne doesn't exactly hit top notch with Running on Empty, but as others have stated, Jacksons lower levels are still on a par with the higher levels on any other artist of today or his day.

It was part of my late sister's LP collection - she was into Jackson Browne long before he became popular in Australia. I couldn't wait to tape it after I first heard it. To me, it's a balanced mixture of country, R & B with some heart wrenching blues.With songs like \\"Rosie\\", \\"Shaky Town\\" and \\"Stay\\", Jackson Browne just swung open the door on his life to me and said come on in. The songs have lost nothing in 30 years and it re-kindles some wonderful memories for me - Cheers Neil Plevey Brisbane Australia"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sound, packaging great! But...","review":"There's not much more positive to say about this release that others haven't already said. The sound is crisp, packaging great, the bonus tracks on the DVD-Audio disc are fun to have after all these years.However, I have one major complaint that I'm surprised no one else mentioned: this remaster edits out the first 29 seconds of the lead-off title track. Why on earth would you do that? For those who know the album those 29 seconds are of a restless crowd waiting for Browne and his band to start the show. On an album whose goal was to give a vivid picture of a musician's life on the road, that intro was a crucial lead-off. I can assume the edit was to make the track more immediate; but it strips the power out of the opening for the sake of pandering to America's increasing short-attention span.If you can live with that edit, this version of the album is well, well, worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"voila pour toi,\\" said stephan","review":"you're in your late twenties.you used to be a chorus girl.you know your husband is into something shady, but you don't ask.you like the money, and he is kind. so when he's arrested and you're left to fend for yourself alone in paris, without any money, you take comfort in an older married couple, who open up their purses and home, allowing you to get a bit comfy.the husband wants to sleep with you & the wife says it's cool. you protest, half-heartedly & do it anyway.the husband's a cad; the wife is passive aggressive.you don't leave.you don't get a job.you get depressed.it just keeps getting worse.you can't seem to pull yourself together.you drink a lot& cry& act irrational& ultimately the whole thing is cool & disturbing,although you'd never say that,it's your life after all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quartet by Jean Rhys","review":"I love all her novels despite their grimness.

It's not the same old cr@* here! Gitomer made me realize that I do make dumb mistakes like spend all my marketing money selling to new prospects instead of old clients. I learned dozens of ways to change my sales efforts--thank goodness Gitomer doesn't charge a commission."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy, buy, buy!","review":"Evidenced by its own selling success, Gitomer's \\"Little Red Book of Selling\\" is a sales sensation that deserves to be a part of every salesman's professional library. As a firm believer in different sales styles, though, my one negative comment on this book is the supposition that only one style--i.e. \\"my way or the highway\\"--disenfranchises the reader and begs the question as to whether alternative selling-styles might be more prudent, and perhaps situationally more effective. Nonetheless, Gitomer has become the Yoda of this caffeine-laced selling strategy, definitely a winner with the depth and breadth of his selling techniques. A strong 4-Star rating!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs work... a LOT of work","review":"This book is poorly written, poorly formatted, poorly laid out... that said, there are some good things (else he gets 1 star) but they are few and far between and almost not worth searching for.Mostly a self-aggrandizing tome to himself. Not worth the money or your time as he makes the reading of it fairly painful..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time and Money Folks!!","review":"This book is by far the worse sales book I have ever read! On second thought, it's the worst book I've have ever read, period. Not only is the tone condescending it's insulting as well. No business professional uses the saying \\"you suck\\" about 50 times within one book! Just the thing a person who wants to get better at their profession needs to hear more of \\"you suck\\". Jerry talks in generalities the entire book with the exception of the voicemail and networking part. As other reviews mentioned, this book actually has very little about selling at all. Trust me, you will thank me later do not waste your time or money on this one. Don't let the red color book fool you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read!","review":"Gitomer could probably sell ice to an Eskimo or sand to a Bedouin. His \\"12.5 Principles of Sales Greatness\\" are right on. The entire book, from the words on the pages to the petite hardcover format to the funny illustrations in the margins, are impeccably done. This book is a bargain which should be read not only by salespeople, but anyone looking for self improvement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible read...","review":"I'm convinced the people who gave this book a five star rating either didn't read it or are related to the author. The book has no substance, and the author is constantly advising you to buy all his other products that will help you become succesful. This is ironic, since he's claiming to know all these things about sales, but pushes these on you before he has even had a chance to prove the value add of the book you're currently reading... Crazy? The author never even convincingly validates himself as any type of sales expert - credibility is vital and there just isn't any here. I had high expectations for this, but in short this is a book filled with cliche and ripped off mantras...

The reviewer said the book would help you make those 10 additional sales calls in a given day. This is old school thinking and so is this book. This is the very reason many people dislike sales people. They waste your time. Modern sales is about thinking first. Thinking where you fit. Thinking where you bring value. Thinking specifically what that value is. Then stay there. By doing that, you will no longer allow yourself to think of success as making 10 more sales calls in a day. It's about results. Count results, not sales calls or hours. \\"Did you get it done?\\" is all that matters. I'd rather make one meaningful call with a prospect that I know provides me with a ninty percent chance of success than 100 calls, hoping I'll find one opportunity for success.

Here's my only beef. Gitomer is \\"all about value.\\" And when I looked at this book I thought, \\"gosh, he really practices what he preaches by giving all this extra stuff at his website.\\" Then I went to the website and the first four times I put in the words he put in the book for accessing extra info from his website, all I got were the material that was right there in the book. Word for word.Of course, he doesn't have to give anything away but having offered to do so, I think he should follow through on his promise. So now I'm wondering about the value of what he did provide. Is this really good info on how to sell??? I'm not sure anymore.

Do look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rah Rah without substance","review":"This book is one of dozens out there that should go in the motivation section rather than the sales section. If you need motivation, this book is great. But if you are looking for solid advice on how to improve your sales technique, don't waste your money. The book is littered with cute phrases like \\"Kick your own ass\\", and \\"the more you love it, the more you will sell\\".I bought the book because there are small nuggets of good information in it. I kept it because I know someday I will need motivation. But I quickly became tired of \\"Rah-Rah, I'm the best salesman ever, and you suck unless you work harder.\\" Don't get me wrong, everyone could stand to work harder.

I struggled greatly at that time with my own journey from just practicing again to truly starting to live my faith.

This book offers so many alchemical and hermetic diagrams and illustrations, it's hard to choose where to start. From the musical and mystical illustrations of Robert Fludd, to William Blake, this book has it all.Nicely organized by numerous categories such as \\"Light and Darkness,\\" \\"Serpent,\\" and \\"Divine Geometry.\\" The only drawback is that the descriptions for the illustrations are sometimes difficult to understand. I'm not an expert on alchemy, and at times I became a bit frustrated since some of the concepts are not easily grasped.But perhaps it is not necessary that just our intellect comprehends these phenomenal drawings since many of the illustrations visually send messages our subconscious minds receive and interpret. For that reason alone, this book is a must-have for anyone seriously interested in learning and experiencing more about alchemy and hermeticism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wouldn't expect anything less from Taschen","review":"This is an awesome book for those interested in visual representations of gnostic, qabbalistic, masonic and rosicrucian mystic philosophy. Well written and thoroughly explained, this book is an excellent visual aide for people who like to study the development of hermetic philosophy throughout the centuries. Would've liked for some more 20th century content. It might not appeal to someone who is new to the subject, since even the essays make quite obscure references. Its content is beautifully reproduced (wouldn't expect anything less from a Taschen book) and even it's highly symbolic, metaphoric and allegorical, it's a must for neo-gnostic studies of the school of Samael Aun Weor. I used to own the 700+ page book with the same title by the same author, but it was misplaced. I don't remember the other book having so much text explaining everything, then again, I didn't mind the essays or explanations in this one at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST for anyone studying alchemical imagery","review":"This book is fat and loaded with color plates of pretty much every major example of medieval/renaissance alchemical artwork. It seems impossible that such a book would be so inexpensive! As such it is an invaluable reference guide. There are textual explanations of each plate included in the book, some more detailed than others, though the text won't help you understand the emblems or the subtext if you don't already know about it.

This book is nothing less than one of the finest paperback image and short quote encyclopedias on alchemy and mysticism produced in recent times.Do not miss it!

The combination of brass, black and wood grain is very nice. The blade is extremely sharp right out of the box. The sheath was so well form fitted for this knife that I wasn't sure if it was real leather or not until I sniffed it, yup, it's leather and when the knife is in the sheath and the sheath is snapped closed the upper part of the sheath raps around most of the handle for protection from scratching. Both the knife and the sheath are very well made. MADE IN USA! I'm not sure if I would call the finish on the handle semi-gloss or satin but it does not slip in my hand and it just feels right, well balanced.I really like this knife...get one for yourself, you will be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love my knife","review":"I highly recommend this knife.

The knife is of great quality and appearance. We were able to use it to clean up one deer. Time will tell of its durability under field use.

This review should not be taken as a shot at the product itself, rather my very unpleasant experience with this seller's product. I had the item overnighted to me for a camping trip and was given a USED knife with clear wear marks on the hilt as well as machine marks on the blade. There was no paperwork in the box accompanying the knife, no warranty card, no packaging...just a knife and sheath. This was either a factory reject or, as I most strongly suspect, and outright counterfeit product. I have a hard time believing a genuine Buck knife could have left their factory with machine wear marks on their blades.Buyers beware of this seller!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly well made knife","review":"This Buck knife is extremely sharp and the looks are nothing short of incredible, I can't believe what a value for the price this knife is.Even the sheath looks great and has a functional design, holds the knife in place but also allows for easy/quick removal.I have carefully inspected this knife and it appears to be flawless, the handle is the nicest looking of any knife I have owned (I only purchase USA made knives).Buck obviously has a competent quality control process in place at their USA facility."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best knife I ever held.","review":"The first impression I had holding this knife was \\"This is a substantial knife.\\" The sharpness of this knife is scary, it is literally razor sharp. I am happy to have spent the extra money to get the cocobola handle version of this knife. I have seen the black plastic handled version locally, the blade may have been the same, but this version is like an heirloom piece. This version also has an impressive sheath made of supple leather. The one at local store has a nylon sheath.This is not the cheapest knife, but it offers a superior level or value. I have no negative things to say about this knife at all. There is a rivet on the sheath that look like it can rub the wood handle, I think I will cover that up with a piece of tape or a band-aid, just in case."},{"rating":"2","title":"hunting knife","review":"hunting knives do not get much better then this knife.

(In a slower way though) I don't know what's the best about this concert, Johnny Rotten's voice, the distortion of Steve Jones guitar, Paul Cooks massive drum style, or Sid calling everyone in the audience a fa**t. Seeing Sid bust his face was a little disturbing but that is what was so great of him. The concerts only around thirty minutes but it is still worth it. At the end of the concert the Sex Pistols perform \\"God Save the Queen\\" at the Sex Pistols last concert in Winterland on January 14, 1978. It's not such a great performance but it takes up time.

(I already have the first 2 LPs,so I already have the LP version). Around the same time in '94 I also bought Elvis Presley Gold Records Vol.3 only to see it re-released several years later with more hits that should have been included in the first place.

There is some really cool stuff in it: In most of the songs the singer have a cool jazzy-smoky voice that gives a jazz spirit to the song, in others, mainly the romantic ballads, the singer (A different person) have a sweet voice that makes you listen to the songs again and again.

You cannot argue with the fact that this reissue has some really great music, and most of the band's best!We expect them to rock the house with songs like \\"Spinning Wheel\\", and \\"Lucretia McEvil\\". The in-your-face horn section does not overplay the band on their gentler hits found here, like \\"Somethimes in Winter\\" or \\"I Love You More Than You'll Ever Know\\".I must disagree with another reviewer with regard to the jazz interludes which appear here in some songs (as opposed to the A.M. radio versions). They positively make songs like \\"Spinning Wheel\\" and without the interlude, \\"God Bless The Child\\" would not be half the song it was.This is a fine fine piece of music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why cut out the solos?","review":"One of the greatest horn sections of the seventies was basically raped by the re-issue of this greatest hits compilation. I have the earlier version (with original album cuts), and the songs are just amazing.

You will find that this book not only hits the mark it will open your eyes to a new understanding of bible prophecy, and help you to share the gospel of CHRIST.

It is very unlike Joni Mitchell's other albums and it also is not up to the same standards of jazz performance that Mingus' other albums are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Embarrassing","review":"According to the liner notes, Joni Mitchell was asked by Charles Mingus to put lyrics to some of his tunes. That's what she should have attempted to do; she should have attempted to put straight lyrics to them, NOT lyrics ABOUT Mingus, and she should have attempted to sing them straight and not sing \\"jazz\\". I don't say she's hopeless as a jazz singer, but if she wanted to sing jazz, she should have recorded an album of standards (standards that already had lyrics, that is).The musicians here do a fine job, especially Jaco and Herbie (some great horn arranging by Jaco, by the way), but that's the accompaniment. Joni's lyrics are embarrassing and her singing seems pretentious and phony.In any case, this record simply doesn't work, and it ain't a-happening--which is why it was received unfavorably in its day and continues to be received unfavorably (except by Internet fetishists), to the extent it isn't ignored completely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it!","review":"Seldom I listen to this Cd, most of the songs are boring, slow ballads.

Don't buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated this record","review":"I hated this record. It was nothing at all like I expected when I heard it. I really dislike the jazz style of Mingus (give me Miles ANY DAY) and Joni did not make this music \\"hers\\". While I applaud her bravery in making this record, the results are a mess. As a Joni Mitchell record, this is not good. As a Mingus record... let the Mingus fans judge that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mitchell meets Weather Report","review":"This CD is the result of the request of Charlie Mingus to Joni Mitchellto write words for four of his songs. Mitchell supplied the music and wordsfor two of her own songs and then hired half of Weather Report, Jaco Pastorius and Wayne Shorter, plus Herbie Hancock, Peter Erskine, Don Alias, and Emil Richards as side musicians to record this CD. The result is a nice blend of Joni Mitchell and Weather Report.

I was never into \\"Police And Thieves\\" punk reggae and they went crazy here on this album with \\"Revolution Rock\\" and \\"The Guns of Brixton\\" and \\"Rudie Can't Fail\\" (although the latter is more ska-ish). Throw in the mixes of sounds from what sounds like lounge hitting the pub sounds of the '80s...well, \\"we\\" (as in the collective punk us) absolutely thought the Clash had sold out.Boy, was I wrong! Years later it is my fave Clash LP because it's varied unlike the first two which are straight punk (still great LPs but come on!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful and Diversified Must Have!","review":"The bass smashing cover photo sums up the theme of this release of mass distruction. At a time when the English youth were troubled by a failing economy, mass labour strikes and disenchantment with the Monarchy, the Clash's journey through reggae, rockabilly, punk and rock showcase the edgy emotions of the struggle. The staccato guitar and drum that begin \\"London Calling\\" cut through from the onset. Their version of \\"Brand New Cadillac\\", with the caustic lyric rework of \\"balls to you baby, I ain't ever coming back\\" rival the original version. Two albums in the original vinyl release are worth listening to every second. It is a great representation of punk angst."},{"rating":"2","title":"Far and Away the best of the 70's and 80's","review":"This album is a quantum leap from Give 'em Enough Rope. Others have said Rumours and the Joshua Tree were the best of the 70's and 80's respectively. WRONG!!!!!!! Those albums were not major leaps like London Calling. 4 white punks make a double album with punk, rockability that makes the stray cats and the reverend horton heat jealous, ska as good as the Specials and reggae that smokes the wailers. Fleetwood Mac and U2 never came close to doing that. Most band will never make a piece de resistance like the Clash did with London Calling"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Punk movement's best album","review":"At the end of the decade, Rolling Stone magazine tabbed \\"London Calling\\" as the best rock album of the 1980s, despite the fact that it was released in late 1979. Nevertheless, the title is well deserved, for this is rock and roll at its best. The Clash still had the raw edge and the angry politics that mark the best of punk rock, but they had also developed a strong songwriting ability that overflows this disc with nineteen blasts of pure pleasure. What is surprising is how diverse the individual songs are, with reggae and jazz influences, among others, evident. Despite being twenty years old, the album is not dated in the slightest and ranks as a must own for the rock record collector."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest albums ever made","review":"I'll keep it short. But this record is in that \\"rare\\" category for me simply because the lasting effect it has not only on me but the world. Joe Strummer and Mick Jones collaborations are at their peak. \\"London Calling, Spanish Bombs, Train in a Vein, Lost In the Supermarket\\" are all pop/punk classics. The rest of the album is just as amazing. If you haven't listened to this yet, you have to. It's an essential piece of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOW CAN YOU NOT OWN THIS ALBUM?","review":"London Calling is the best album from 'The Only Band That Matters,' and that says a lot. Instead of becoming cliche and just reproducing the same type of fast-paced punk songs that they wrote on their first two albums, The Clash actually improved on two of the best punk albums of all time. Every song on here is excellent (except for maybe Revolution Rock...I think that one gets old) and they cover all sorts of musical genres (punk, ska, reggae, rockabilly). These songs can make me smile, get me ready for battle, or make me a little melancholy. And the hidden track! Woe to those listeners that turn off their CD player before Train In Vain comes on. London Calling is easily in my ten best albums of all time, and would be the best ever if it weren't for those four fab lads from Liverpool."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best music of all times","review":"My first impression of this album was disappointing. I expected some their White Riot brilliant punk sound. First song I liked was Hateful, and then the song after and before etc. Now, after 20 years I know that this is the best music ever performed. Every song is the masterpiece, every song is completely serious and attitude of the band is completely serious. No compromises. Every song on this album is better than the best song from any other band or composer. It is too good to be made by human. It is too good to be made by God. Chaos was mercyful and it happened."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best punk album ever","review":"London Calling is The Clash's and Punk's best. This album isn't just for punk fans. It contains many great songs such as London Calling,Brand New Cadillac, and Lost in The Supermarket."},{"rating":"2","title":"the only album that ever mattered...","review":"At any given time, I can pull this album out and be blown away by the raw power of it. My stereo volume is never able to go high enough to do justice to Death or Glory, Guns of Brixton, Hateful, I'm Not Down, Rudie Can't Fail, Clampdown... and all the rest of the songs on the CD. Not a clunker in the lot.I bought the CD almost 15 years ago to replace the vinyl (one of the few vinyl pieces I've held on to), now I've bought the y2000 remaster to replace the poor original CD release. The sound is great, but for me there's no need for the reproduced lyrics that will remain in my brain till I'm dead. Essential of course for the uninitiated. Top 5 of all time, no question."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is punk's \\"White Album\\"","review":"I must admit to being only a recent devotee of The Clash, but I must also take issue with the incessant shoehorning of the group into the \\"punk\\" category (especially prevalent in every news story following the death of punk pioneer Joey Ramone). While their debut LP may certainly fit this label, it should have been quickly shed by this, their third release. Like The Beatles' \\"White Album\\" jack-of-all-pop-trades before it, \\"London Calling\\" defies typecasting, offering a glimpse into The Clash's future of weaving even more musical styles into their music. Here, we get the new wave/Elvis Costello-ish \\"Spanish Bombs\\" (my favorite Clash song); \\"Lost in the Supermarket,\\" which sounds like a page from the Difford/Tilbrook Squeeze catalog; the pure power pop of \\"Train in Vain (Stand by Me)\\"; Marley-ish reggae (\\"Revolution Rock\\"); as well as good ol' under-two-minutes (1:48 to be exact) punk like \\"Koka Kola.\\"THIS is the true sound of Radio Clash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect Album","review":"The Clash is arguably the best Punk band of all-time. Much more talented musically than The Ramones and The Sex Pistols. Dont get me wrong The Ramones and Sex Pistols Kick [...], but The Clash are special. Real Special. They had the courage to not LIMIT themselves in the very restrictive Punk world at the time. Punk music didnt need musicianship in the 70's. The Clash beg to differ. They incorporate Reggae, Jazz, and Rockabilly styles with their political lyrics beautifully. The Clash are Special indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"An album twenty years ahead of its time","review":"I watched VH1's Top 100 Rock Albums and was disappointed to see 'London Calling' placed only at number 25. The Clash were one of the few British punk bands that didn't have to depend on controversy and outrageousness. They possessed truly great musicianship and great eclectic tastes, and 'London Calling' is direct evidence of this. The songs on here fall into all sorts of genres; punk (title track, \\"Koka Kola\\"), hard rock (\\"Clampdown\\"), reggae (\\"Rudie Can't Fail\\", \\"Revolution Rock\\"), rockabilly (\\"Brand New Cadillac\\"), and the list goes on and on. For a truly unique listening experience, I would recommend purchasing this album. I would also highly recommend The Clash's other great albums 'Sandinista!' and their first self titled album."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album changed my life.","review":"When this album came out 25 years ago, I was 17 and listening to whatever crap they played on the radio. This album, more than any other, showed me that there's a lot more to music than what the record companies tell the radio stations to play.This record is so good, it's hard for me to talk about it without sounding like an ineloquent dufus, so I'll let others describe the music. (I know that doesn't make this review very \\"helpful\\".)I had a chance to meet Joe Strummer in the summer of 2002. I just shook his hand and said \\"thank you\\". Now, two years after his death, I am very glad I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sony / Epic Strikes (out) Again","review":"Once again, we are left with the same crappy remaster as the 25th anniversary edition. Something so easy to fix is apparently beyond the morons at Sony. A minor detail to be sure but, the bell at the beginning of Koka Kola is screwed up. Instead of the \\"ding\\" of the elevator bell, we get \\"dowing\\", the sound of some idiot that bumped the tape during transfer. Buy the old, un-remastered version and boost the volume up yourself.I would give it only one star, but the music is just too good. Sony rots, don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Honest opinion...","review":"I don't know why this album is so highly praised amongst these guys' other CDs. Spanish Bombs as well as London Calling are very good songs, however, most of this album is quite BORING. No speed, no pissed snotty vocals, what gives? Hearing crap like Lovers Rock makes me go ape$H*t."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing!!!!","review":"this is the album that convinced me that the clash was no group of wanna-bes. my personal favs on here are Rudie Can't Fail, Brand New Cadillac, Jimmy Jazz, The Right Profile, Clampdown, Train in Vain, Lost in the Supermarket, and guns of brixton. but really this is like a greatest hits of the clash because it contains so many GREAT songs. of course you'll either love or hate joe strummer's vocals - i personally thought that he's really got a unique voice! really cool guitars as well (mick jones of course). this is my favorite clash album. ahead of its time fer sure as another reviewer mentioned earlier! very awesome album from one of the best bands of the 80s!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best rock album ever!","review":"In my opinion, London Calling is tied for best rock album of all time with the Rolling Stones' Exile on Main Street. People say this is the album that brought punk into the living room, but it's not really punk. It's rock with an edge that includes hints of punk and a lot of reggae influences (Rudie Can't Fail, Revolution Rock). It's also full of intelligent writing and satire of the times. (\\"In the gleaming corridor of the 51st floor, the money can be made if you really want some more.\\" - Koka Kola). And I know several people who would rank Train in Vain among the top five rock songs of all time, if not No. 1. This album is a work of art. And it has stood the test of time. I will never get tired of playing London Calling."},{"rating":"2","title":"virtually flawless- great album","review":"anyone who has ever heard a guitar, drums and vocals together in the same song MUST OWN THIS ALBUM. Every song is super from the doomed title to the hidden train. The one stand out for me though its saloon piano ode THE CARD CHEAT. Joe Strummer and the boy sure knew how to rock. Now only if they could be in the same room together"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yet another review","review":"Alright, I'll keep in short.First, this isn't really a \\"punk record.\\" The Clash is a punk band, but this isn't their punk album, \\"The Clash\\" or maybe even \\"Give 'Em Enough Rope\\" is/are their punk album(s). This album belongs to the entire genre of rock, not just punk. It's that good.Second, this is the greatest album of all time. It takes the punk ethos and translates it into reggae, rockabilly, funk, ska, and well, just draws from a lot of different genres. It is an incredible rock record that remains poignant and influential to this day.So if anyone was disappointed by it not being a great punk record, bummer, get \\"The Clash.\\" For now, listen to \\"London Calling\\" again with an open mind and I think you'll hear why everyone praises it.

However, if I were to introduce someone to just the Clash, purely focusiong on the band itself, I would deffinetely start here. This is undoubtable the single most recognizable album of their career. I mean personally I honestly can't say this is my favorite album but it's a very good one at least and it would only rank behind their self titled album, and Give Em Enough Rope. An awesome album in not Punk Rock history but history of Rock N Roll. I think it deserves 5 stars at least."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of punk's finest, most eclectic records!","review":"This (former) double-album is one of the greatest achievements (besides the first album) from the greatest punk band of all time.

Since it's still sampled at 44.1 kHz, I didn't really see how or why it would be any better than the redbook version. Now that I've compared the two, I can tell you Blu-Spec is a striking improvement. My redbook of London Calling always sounded tinny and thin like an FM signal. The Blu-Spec has much fuller dynamics and permits actual imaging. The analogy that comes to mind is comparing a postcard of a painting to seeing the actual painting in person. With the Blu-Spec, I could hear the brushstrokes."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Clash at their best, and rock at its best","review":"Pete Townsend once said [I'm paraphrasing] that punk wouldn't get far if it refused to acknowldge its past. On this album, the Clash took up the challenge and came up aces. Here, the Clash pays homage to their influences in ska, jazz, punk, blues, pop, and reggae without imitating them. As usual, they pull it off with a combination of intelligence, humor and passion that was rare then and even more so now.London Calling is one of the most important albums ever in rock. To call it a \\"punk\\" album or a great 80's album is to diminish its scope. This album easily ranks up there with the best of the Beatles and the Stones and continues to be far superior to the product that's available today.If I could give it more than 5 stars I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Is Dreadful..","review":"Perhaps my musical standards are too high, but this such a dissapointing LP words can hardly describe my disgust. The title track is passable but the remainder is a jumbled,ametuerish mess!Joe Strummer and company were crude, sloppy, untalented 'musicians' who couldn't carry a tune with handles and their attempts at incorporating dance, jazz and reggae into this waste of disc space is laughable at best. Why this is heralded as one of the greatest rock/punk albums of all time is truly a mystery to me. I just wasn't impressed or moved at all. My favorite part of \\"London Calling\\"?

Half of it is cruise ship in hell reggae. There's no real tension in the songs (like on the best ones from their first album), and Joe Strummer is one of the worst singers in the history of recorded music. Kids- this is what smoking will do to you! Throw in the Clash's usual muddled politics and you've got an undigestible messy sprawl of a double album set that really should have been whittled down to a single album. There were so many great English bands during the period- Sex Pistols, Wire, Buzzcocks, X-Ray Spex, XTC, Elvis Costello, Pretenders... and yet the Clash made it bigger than any of them in America.

After hearing London Calling and Sandinista I realise I wasn't missing ANYTHING. A vocalist who cannot sing to save himself, non descript riffs, weak melodies, silly Kajagoogoo worthy backup vocals. And none of the members rise above competent when it comes to playing their instruments. How this album managed to attain it's status is a mystery to me. I'm not averse to punk...but this isn't punk. It's guitar pop. And not very good pop at that. It's like The Sugarcubes, only withtout Bjorks wonderful voice you're left with that talentless moron Einar singing. Amazon hates low reviews because it means potentially less money for them so for their sake I could reccomend that you buy the \\"Garden Gnome Catching Butterflies\\" in the Kitchen & Housewares section for your auntie as a Christmas present. All in all it seems much better value than this tripe!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it really THAT good?","review":"I've heard my share of punk rock albums, and I'm definitely skeptical that this one actually lives up to the hype, even though I've never heard any of it. Haven't you people ever heard of Green Day and Nirvana? What about Blink-182? Shan't they count for something? Let's get into the modern age, folks.I just remember this band's dumb song from 1982 or something, \\"Rock the Casbod.\\" Man, that song was annoying!! So was the dusky video!! What did any of it mean?No disrespect to the Clash, for I know they are highly revered, but I feel the Meat Puppets and Journey were much better.Hope this helps..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"I bought this album about last year. I'd been told for years that this album was a masterpiece and so on. When I heard it I kind of liked the opening song, except for the disrespectful remark about the beatles. But when I heard the rest, I had never been so dissapointed in my life. This is [...] music for [...] new wave fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Clash Don't Fail","review":"The Clash are called the only band that matters and on London Calling they come close to living up to that moniker. The 19 songs range from the fiery punk of the title track to the ska-inflected \\"Rudie Can't Fail\\" to the pop of \\"Train In Vain\\". The band plays with a passion and energy that explodes out of your stereo. \\"Brand New Cadillac\\" is sleek and menacing, \\"Spanish Bombs\\" floats, \\"Lost In The Supermarket\\" is pensive while \\"Death & Glory\\" & \\"The Right Profile\\" explode. The songs are more polished and cleaner sounding than on their first two releases, but they retain that punk bravado in their lyrics. The band never compromised their integrity and London Calling should be part of everyone's collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry but it is kind of overrated","review":"I bought this album because, well, I heard it was one of the hands down best rock albums ever produced. The Clash even had the title \\"The only band that matters\\". I dunno. I won't launch into a diatribe of what is or what isn't punk rock, but I just don't find London Calling a very meaty offering, and I like my music to have meat.There are some good songs, but this album is 19 TRACKS TOO LONG and many of the songs are forgettable, fast forwardable filler. Its nice that the Clash were doing something different other than the straight ahead three chord punk bands, but musicianship wise, they just sound so timid.I dunno, just my opinion"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Bargain for Classic Album","review":"Awesome \\"double\\" album for cheap $. There is not a weak song on here. Love London Calling, Clampdown, Death or Glory, I'm not Down, etc ... too many to list here. This CD Rocks!! Buy it, you will be happy you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good Punk!","review":"This is a very creative, and rockin album. The guitars and drums and vocals are all good. Also look at the cover, is that like not the coolest cover to a rock album ever??? This band helped kickstart punk music in the 70's along with the Ramones and the Sex Pistols. The influence of this band on current bands can be seen, especially the jazz and reggae influences seen on Sublime could easliy trace their inspiration back to this ablum and the Clash in general. Highly reccomended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Goodbye Joe","review":"I just can't say enough about London Calling. I still remember ripping the shrink wrap off the LP back in the cold winter of 1980 anticipating yet another great Clash album. Then I was shocked. It was even better than my lofty expectations. I played it until the grooves were worn. ... I had never seen a band play with so much passion. ... Upon hearing of the tragically early death of singer guitarist Joe Strummer, I pulled the CD out for a spin. Twenty two years have done nothing to dull the luster of this monumental work. From the ominous opening strains of London Calling to the pub-skank of Rudie Can't Fail, to the final fade of Train in Vain I was reminded of the sounds of a great band hitting their stride, filled with passion, humor and conviction. This remains one of my all time favorites. Rest in Peace Joe."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest UK punk album, ever.","review":"So, maybe their first album fits more into what is commonly known as \\"punk,\\" but I think this album is much more important. On this album, the Clash was able to bring the rage and anger of the punk scene far beyong the barrage of noise & three fast chords that characterised the scene.The music here is hard to define. The band took all of their influences and put it into one distinct sound. It isn't so much rock, punk, blues, dub or rockabilly, but a mixture of it all.And even if you already own the old CD copy of London Calling, you simply MUST get this new remastered cd. The sound quality is much better, as the bass & drums have been moved up in the mix, making it feel more punchy like the original vinyl. The insert is really cool, but I wish they had made it a bit bigger, so you could actually see the pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Doesn't Get More Classic and Influential Than This","review":"I'll keep this review fairly brief. This album is definitely one of the greatest of all time, every song rocks, especially Hateful, Lost in the Supermarket, Revolution Rock, and London Calling. I cannot think of a (good) rock group today who doesn't owe The Clash a dollar. Joe Strummer is one of the most complete musicians of all time, and The Clash were an amazing group. The Clash obviously influenced today's punk groups like NoFX and Rancid, but also had large influence on rap/metal bands like 311, Primus, or Korn. This album is a masterpiece. A great thing to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my favs","review":"i beg you to buy this. it is so good. it's much better than the commercial crap of today's music polluted by pop acts like rage against the machine, korn, blink 182, nsync, backstret boys, juvenile, and britney spears. those bands are fake. this is music coming from the CLASH's heart, not some rich business men behind the aforementioned bands. buy this now or you will never experience good music."},{"rating":"2","title":"So many good songs....","review":"Few albums have ever been released with so many amazing songs.

Pepper","review":"This album is by far the best album ever made by any punk band. The Clash kicked their way into a new breed of punk music with this album and opened the doors for every band that has followed behind them.

I had disregarded punk rock several years ago as my teen angst subsided and decided that there was more to life than three chords. But \\"London Calling\\" is on of those classic albums that really doesn't fit into any genre. I was blown away by it and it hasn't left my cd player since I got it.

No matter what I am doing when I hear it, I have to bounce like a pogo stick!! I can imagine if I played this song in my sleep, the bed would be bouncing!! It was used to great effect in \\"Grosse Pointe Blank\\" (John Cusack is obviously a Clash junkie). Some of the lesser known songs are my favorite ones, such as \\"The Card Cheat\\" (Phil Spector would be proud) and \\"Death or Glory.\\" The lyrics are also a treat to have with this remastered edition, since The Clash have always been a little tough for us Americans to understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Punk album ever...","review":"In the Punk scene we had two major names: The Sex Pistols and The Clash. If \\"Never Mind The Bollocks\\"(1977) is, indeed, a revolutionary Punk album, a classic and a great record, \\"London Calling\\" is, problably, the masterpiece of Punk Rock music.From the self-titled track hit single \\"London Calling\\" to the last song \\"Train In Vain\\", The Clash offered a superb mix of styles beyond the basic Punk sound of the whole record. We have the \\"jazzy\\" \\"Jimmy Jazz\\", the great glamour-pop of \\"Hateful\\" or the close-to-Bowie \\"The Card Cheat\\", reggae titles like \\"Rudie Can't Fail\\" and \\"The Guns Of Brixton\\" or the reggae/ska sound of \\"Revolution Rock\\", simple Rock N'Roll in \\"Death Or Glory\\" or the pop-based \\"Lover's Rock\\".Above all that we have a superb production work by Guy Stevens and, of course, the pure Punk Rock interpretations that give to \\"London Calling\\" the title of \\"The greatest Punk record EVER\\".

I love \\"Werewolves Of London\\" #21 as much as anyone, but he has much stronger tunes on this album. You get \\"Roland The Headless Thompson Gunner\\", \\"Lawyers Gun's And Money\\", the psycho \\"Excitable Boy\\", \\"Accidentally Like A Matyr\\", the discoish beat of \\"Night Time In The Switching Yard\\", the scorching \\"Johnny Strikes Up The Band\\", \\"Veracruz\\" and \\"Tenderness On The Block\\", are very good songs, the latter written with Jackson Browne. \\"Bad Luck Streak In Dancing School\\", would be released in 1980."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Zevon smash","review":"I've long been a Warren Zevon fan.

Several other covers, such as \\"City of New Orleans\\" and the Jagger-Richards song \\"Salt of the Earth\\", also show Judy to be the fine interpreter that she is. Her own excellent compositions, \\"Houses\\", \\"Song for Duke\\" and especially \\"Born to the Breed\\", a song she wrote about her teenage son, all add up to make JUDITH one of Judy's best lp's, her last classic album to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh, and those eyes...","review":"I agree with what other reviewers have said here about the songs, arrangeements, and Judy Collins' crystalline voice.

The three different sizes are versatile, and they do stack nicely. They are clear glass, no bubbles or imperfections, and appear easy to clean.A few of my friends are concerned about their stability stacked one on top of the next. I gave this a 4-star review because I think that there are some improvements to the design that could help the stacking be a little more stable.

And it probably remains their rawest and hardest CD.I wasn't old enough to get into the Clash while they were at their peak, but I cannot get enough of their music now. Although their music probably appeals most to fans of 70's punk, I think that people who like more modern groups such as Green Day or Sum 41 will probably also really like this CD. I don't have the original US version of this CD, but the song selection is so different that I would suggest that people purchase this UK re-release even if they have the US one.

A must have and a classic for any fan of Rock n' Roll"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sony Music = CHEAPSKATES!","review":"The one-star rating has nothing to do with what Mick, Paul + Joe were doing in 1977 and everything to do with the avarice shown by their record label in 2000. I have no intention of debating whether the US or UK version is better, either (although personally, I'll take \\"Clash City Rockers\\" and \\"...Hammersmith Palais\\" over \\"Protex Blue\\" and \\"Cheat\\" any day). The fact of the matter is, Sony should have put out one disc with all the tracks on it, rendering all such arguments moot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Play It Loud...Even Louder....","review":"Everyone took notice (by 1979 it became the biggest-selling import album of all-time)! This was in your face, rebellious and defiant, and no one sounded more anti-establishment in 1977 (except maybe the Sex Pistols) than The Clash on their first album. Here we had politically charged lyrics that burned into a new generation of socially conscious youth. All songs on here, are worthy of continuous play. (Especially on a jukebox in a dive bar or pub) My favorite tracks are - \\"I'm So Bored With The U.S.A.\\", \\"White Riot\\", \\"Hate & War\\", the excellent \\"What's My Name\\", \\"Deny\\", the brutal honesty of \\"Cheat\\". Get the U.K.version and play it as loud as possible! Joe Strummer was the real deal, he is sorely missed!Love and Peace,Carlos Romero"},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome to Punk Rock","review":"With this album The Clash made punk rock a real form of music and moved it out of three chords played fast. The Ramones may have started punk music but The Clash ruled it as kings. With songs like \\"I'm so bored with the U.S.A.\\", \\"White Roit\\", and \\"Career Opportunities\\" they made songs with a middle class meaning, where \\"Hate & War\\" and \\"Police & Thieves\\" brought reggae beats to a new breed of music.Joe Strummer and Mick Jones have spectacular vocals and killer guitar riffs. Nothing before this album can stand up to this album after it. The only band that has been able to top this album is The Clash themselves with the albums they put out after it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Not at all what I was hoping for. I'm big on single player, first person shooters that follow a deep story line like Quake did. This is all mission based with no save or game story progress to follow. It's basically like playing an online multi-player game by yourself. Aside from the fact that this ruins it for me, those who like this kind of game are in for a treat. Lots of controls (every key on the keyboard and mouse are bound to some function, selection or action) and the graphics are very good while not over demanding on your hardware. I'm using a G-Force 9500 GT and was able to crank up all graphic settings to their maximum values while running at 1920x1080 deff. It is however a very nice collectors box for those of you who like to collect PC games. Just don't expect a good single player/story based experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad product","review":"Cheap and worn out too quickly, cheaper and better quality can be purchase at local walgreen, CVS, HEB and kroger stores.

His ego sometimes seemed bigger than the whole of Europe, so it's appropriate that he would be the Roller to come out with a book like this. I didn't know just how humble his beginnings were, and I have a lot more respect for him now. Leslie has a very natural, humorous style of writing and is a born storyteller. This kept me reading until I finished it in only 2 days. Even if you weren't a BCR fan, Leslie's book gives a good look into the realities of being a pop star in the 70s."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has aged poorly","review":"First the good: Soupy Sales was good in front of the camera. He was relaxed, fun loving, consistently upbeat, and seemed to be having a great time goofing around with the characters on this popular children's show. Now the bad: this show has not aged well. The low resolution black and white looks very crude today. Were these remastered? I think not. The jokes fall flat. The ultra-low budget was apparent throughout. It looks like it was thrown together with a few wooden crates and two hand puppets. It isn't entertaining. It drags on forever. I fast forwarded through most of the episodes. It is that boring.If you had fond memories of this, remember, you were probably age 5 - 12 when you first saw this.

Soupy Sales was a guy who looked funny and acted funny. Also, Now I know the jokes were not just for kids. He didn't need a lot of expensive props to be good. The unique delivery of a joke, the stunned look in the camera and Frank Nastasi's hand in some kind of puppet. I realize now how important Nastasi was on that show, too.The quality of the video is as it should be, old, beat up and black & white. It just felt good to see one of the funniest guys in television.

Now, after 20+ years, it is one of my favorites. I agree with previous reviewers, \\"We're So Close\\" is a classic. A few weak cuts, but overall, a great LP, well, CD! The rarely shown video for \\"Vengeance\\" is a visual treat."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS ONE FOR THE HISTORY BOOKS!","review":"For those of you that are not familiar with this disc, Ms. Simon recorded it at the time of her break-up with James Taylor. Each song is filled with emotional sadness. Notably the track \\"We're So Close\\" sums up the destructive relationship she had with Taylor. In \\"Vengeance\\", Carly belts \\"just because you're stronger and you hold it over me; I'll put the peddle to the floor to prove to you I'm free, though you've stopped me once again, it's not the end of the war, it's \\"Vengenace\\" she said, that's the law!\\" Perfection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simon Says","review":"When this first came out, it was one of my favorite albums from Carly. Now, 20 years later, I see many flaws my youthful exuberance didn't notice. While the disc certainly has some great tunes, there are some that just manage to irritate me now. For instance, I used to really like \\"Memorial Day\\", but on listening to it now, it seems to make little lyrical sense, and it is just too long. Even the drum solo at the end now seems so pedestrian and ostentatious. I never did care much for \\"Coming to Get You\\" with its feminist bravado and irritating melody line. Carly seems like she's screaming on this one. I dislike it even more now. However, thank God, the other tracks still stand tall. \\"Vengeance\\" uses a feminist motif too, but it is quite different. The vocals are earthy and the metaphors work so well. \\"Love You By Heart\\", \\"We're So Close,\\" and \\"Spy\\" are also still top-notch Carly. Definitely a must for Carly fans, just not as good as some of her other releases."},{"rating":"1","title":"whiteness of a different color","review":"The book constantly repeats itself along the same line.

Jacobson mentions in the preface that it is his hope to move into the foremost rank of immigration experts with this book, and I think that he accomplished what he set out to do. Eloquently written and thoroughly researched, Jacobson, who is obviously very liberal, argues his points in such a way that any person with common sense would agree with him, given the evidence and excerpts included in the book.

I am a MCP, using several resources to reach MCDST certification in route to MCSE certification. This book is amazing! The reference section on how the exam is structured is exactly right. The chapters are well laid out, and track the sections of competency Microsoft tests in the 70-290 exam. That makes it very easy to focus your attention on areas where additional study is necessary. The glossary at the end of each section provides additional study opportunities. In addition, the exercises really give a grasp of the materials.

I would rather listen to an Anthony Hamilton CD; a 4 Tops CD or even Bob Marley. But Praise & Worship is different. Praise and Worship is unique because it is THE only music genre that is truly dependent on the Spirit of God. By definition, it CAN NOT be Praise & Worship apart from Him. Shalom Jerusalem is Praise & Worship. From beginning to the end, the Spirit of Messiah wraps you up and reminds you of who Messiah is; who the Father is. Press play and listen.

In other words those planning to retire (primarily White workers)must depend on their coworkers of color.

It teaches all minorities to view white people as oppressors and full of hate towards all minorities.We should love our neighbor as we love ourselves. We should not be teaching this ignorant trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Racist Text","review":"I was shocked that educators are allowed to use this text, since it is blatantly RACIST. The logic of the authors for promoting racism and hatred against \\"whites\\" appears to be a poor understanding of history, and an unjustifiable excuse, similar to a wild west challenge: you're either with us or you're the enemy.

Definitely a good book to work through one's own culturally-bound views and perceptions that may or may not be conscious.This is definitely an important concept for any practitioner, and especially any practitioner who is white and does not believe there is racism in the world any longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Counseling for diverse cultures","review":"This book is long overdue, at last some cultural sensitivity to counseling and the issues around dealing with other world views. Pathology does have a cultural element, but not all perspectives are considered pathology. Being an individualist in an American society is a disability if you have no experience or sensitivity to persons who think in a collective way. For a Hispanic or Native American, the idea of the community has a deeper value to be considered as far as counseling is concerned.This book examines the cross sections of diversity and explores the limitation of counselors and the need for cultural education for counselors.I had to read this as a textbook, but I like the book. I think that is it certainly time to research these perspectives in order to become better counselors for the culturally diverse population at hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insidious and Dangerous","review":"This text is required for a course in Cross Cultural Counseling for a Masters Program at NYU. I find it deeply disturbing that a book filled with stereotypes of all races, ethnicities and cultures is being used to allegedly foster a deeper consideration of culture in counseling situations. The only positive thing I can say is that it is equally offensive to everyone - no race or culture is spared. The \\"culturally incompetent white counselor\\", the \\"powerless\\" african american, the \\"family-oriented (and always late) Puerto Rican, the \\"confused\\" multiracial, the \\"collectivist\\" Asian American... the list goes on and on. Many of the studies cited are dated, while others are recitations of other work done by - you guessed it - Sue and Sue. I urge anyone who is required to use this textbook to challenge their professors - it may lead to some productive dialogue about race, ethnicity, culture and counseling. Otherwise, this text is an insulting waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow","review":"We have been using this book in our Cultural Diversity class. Although I find some very useful information in this text, one has to sit through the material couched in Ultra liberal bias and anti-White propaganda. I admit that much harm has come from the past American generations, but this book seems like it wants us to be ashamed of being White. All other cultures presented in this text are allowed their bigotry and racist (one culture believing it is superior to another--unlike Sue & Sue's definition that you can only be a racist if you are of the majority culture) agenda; however, the White culture cannot have theirs without being viewed in a negative light. We need solutions on how to be more accepting of all cultures within the borders of these United States, not a book that segregates and blames White culture. I was hoping to study a book that offers information on differing cultures and how to appreciate them more instead of a book that tries to make me feel bad about my heritage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Have Been Better","review":"I was disappointed with this text.

This text does have some extremely interesting & helpful information. The horrible thing is that if you are White, you are automatically a racist among other things. Certainly there has been horrible happenings even from our founding fathers BUT the book clearly has that same ancient mindset. This book should be more open-minded in its own right and treat the \\"White\\" culture as equally as all other cultures. As a Hispanic-American, the book was offensive even to me. Instead of studying about different cultures and maybe even becoming more acculturated, all this book did was try to get me to dislike \\"White\\" people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ironically, this was written by a racist","review":"The author of this book approaches the subject of \\"cultural diversity\\" with extreme prejudice and racism towards western beliefs and, specifically, an apparent dislike and disguist of anyone with European heritage. This serves to diminish the value that the subject should serve.

This is a collection of transcription recordings (done in 1943), roughly split between vocals and instrumentals. Monroe was once quoted as saying that it was RCA which forced him into recording so many vocals, and that he preferred the instrumentals.

Which, here, can only be described as wretched. There cannot be any question that this represents the nadir of Orbison's recorded career. Though his mid '70s efforts for Monument were nothing to write home about, at least they remained several steps above dismal. This does not. Roy was in the midst of recovery from a heart attack when this was recorded, and one has trouble imagining what might have \\"inspired\\" him to hop back on the recording track for this dreck. Bad songs, lousy performances, hideous cover photo. This album manages to do just about everything wrong.

It's wonderful to see these episodes in the original, uncut version! I am so pleased to have purchased this collection as well as the other collections of his show that also contain complete episodes.

Alas, I cannot speak of the Clash when writing these words. For the debut album from these modern day legends forshadowed their greatness but alone only has slight nuances from other Punk Rock and British 2Tone albums being released at the time. This is not to say the album is not worth buying for one cannot forget it is stil a Clash album and like every Clash album it is full of songs which pierce your skin and make you feel honest and true.

It may be not as groundbreaking as London Calling, but straight up punk. Some reggae influences are present but not as much as on London Calling. I own the U.S. version which includes their classic version of I Fought the Law, which is one reason to get this album. Favorites include Clash City Rockers, I'm So Bored with the U.S.A., Remote Control, White Riot, (White Man) In Hammersmith Palais, London's Burning, I Fought the Law, Career Opportunities, Police & Thieves, and Garageland. Highly Highly Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"raw emotion is a powerful mistress","review":"Anger, defiance, intelligence, the Clash supplied them all on their debut. They had some justifiable rage against the political situation in the 1970s, and they showed it in their songs (Career Opportunities, White Man in Hammersmith Palais). They kept up a tremendous pace throughout the album, while paying homage to their blues and reggae roots. The mastery of their instruments may not blow you away, but the sheer amount of raw emotions makes this one of the best punk albums ever. It is more emotional and intelligent than the Sex Pistol's \\"Never Mind the Bullocks,\\" and has more potent lyrics. If it weren't for \\"London Calling,\\" it might be the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic, '77 Punk Rock","review":"This album came out roughly ten years before my birth, but still, this amazing album is definitely one of my favorites. The Clash's debut is a very raw, gritty sounding punk rock, much different form the experimental but quite good \\"London Calling.\\" This is classic 70s punk at its best; heavy guitars, gritty british vocals, and great drumming. My favorite track is definitely the extremely catchy \\"White Riot,\\" but Clah City Rockers, I fought the Law, and Garageland are close seconds. Many of the so-called punks that like Blink 182 and Sum 41 won't like this cd, but any true punk fan will eat this record up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music; Punk Attitude","review":"One of the great myths of punk rock, dispelled on this CD, is that punk rockers were lousy musicians. The members of The Clash would have you believe that they just picked up their instruments on Monday and recorded this album on Tuesday. But listen here to the great guitar work on \\"Clash City Rockers\\" and \\"I Fought the Law\\" or any number of other cuts. The guitars still sound fresh and out-front more that two decades later. Beyond that, The Clash were not just a bunch of guys making noise. A song like \\"I'm So Bored With the U.S.A.\\" is both rocking and melodic. Naturally there is plenty of punk attitude to go around; witness songs like \\"(White Man) In Hammersmith Palais,\\" \\"London's Burning,\\" and \\"Career Opportunities.\\" Epic records has re-mastered and re-released this CD with up-graded sound and packaging. There are also two versions of this CD-The U.S. version and the U.K. version. Check the song selections of each to see which one you prefer."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best punk album ever","review":"When people hear the word \\"punk\\" they may first think of The Sex Pistols but this Clash album is the definition of punk. With this album, the Clash combined stripped down rock and roll with social unrest.

Most of the songs are of a moderate length for performance, around seven minutes. The only reason i didn't give it five stars is that a couple of the tracks (one or two) have what i find to be an annoying synthesizer beat at first.

Everything had an order and only once or twice did you feel like you were jumping back and forth between years(which is what I think is the problem with most books on history). I really enjoyed the time the author took to describe things like the sidesaddles themselves or all the stages of syphlis. The Whitmans were portrayed in a completely different light than what most children are taught in school. In a time when the women were all but ignored; I find it amazing that this author could find so much information about them so that we could finally read about who they were beyond the wives of missionaries. Thank you Laurie Carlson for all the hard work you put into this one. It was worth your time and dedication."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frontier Women","review":"If you enjoy history, especially frontier history this book is a great read. I've always wondered what it was really like to travel west, and about the discomforts or unique challenges women faced. I appreciated that the book was well-researched. This book also gives a glimpse into the faith of the missionaries, but it is not so much centered on their faith, as their personal stories and challenges in their journey and in their lives with the Indians."},{"rating":"2","title":"well thought out manual","review":"Haynes manuals are generally well thought out and illustrated based on a complete tear-down and expert rebuild. Haynes has been doing this for many diverse vehicles from cars motos and tractors for many years and have developed an excellent formula for presenting this information so it is useful to all owners from never get your hands dirty to expert mechanics.

Some might find the format a bit \\"tight\\" compared to a Clymer or factory manual. However all the required information is there. Electrical diagrams are in colour. Photographs and diagrams are clear - if a bit small. Instructions are easy to follow.Some may find the Haynes physically easier to use with its hard cover and more compact format than a Clymer.I prefer the Clymer for its layout and its diagrams and photographs. There are simply more of them.It is a great manual for the price. If you can afford it - get both manuals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Readable, and right on","review":"Hersh's book is an excellent primer on the U.S. intelligence community. (In fact, I recently read it for an intelligence class at American University taught by the genial and wise Professor John Macartney.) Hersh, through hundreds of interviews with people involved with the U.S. response to the KAL007 shootdown, pieces together a workable theory about why the Soviets would shoot down the plane. And most of his thesis was redeemed when the Russians finally handed over the black box from the plane after the collapse of the U.S.S.R. The book presents complex ideas clearly, and no matter what else you think of Hersh's writing or his politics, you will find this book valuable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bit of Cold War History","review":"Wow, some of the things that took place in the cold war were catastrophes. The difference between this incident and the American shoot down of the Iranian plane is that this was done on purpose it would seam. I think if you would read more about this era you would find that the USSR did finally discipline the Commanders that made this mistake, but in typical Soviet style they did it in secret thus eliminating any public good will they may have gained. I think the biggest error made by the Regan administration is that they did not immediately release the tape, which one could argue that the gathering of the information may have lead to the 007 shoot down. The book is an enjoyable read that moves fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Target is Destroyed","review":"Seymour Hersh did an excellent job investigating, down to the Air Forcepeople sitting at their racks and their \\"nicknames\\".

Perhaps the most important thing we know is that, when the fighter pilot shot it down, KAL 007 was already outside Soviet airspace.The fact that all the other reviewers don't see fit to mention that is very interesting.If Hersh were to go back to this story, comparing what he thought then with what we know now, the result might be an interesting, important book.

Two months later, Congressman McDonald dies in 007. False intel leaked to the soviets about a SPY plane flying over their sub base during a secret exercise resulted in the soviets being on the prowl.

It is absolutely brimming with Mr. Hersh's usual fare, which includes (but is not restricted to) lies, hypocrisy, shameless pandering, and intellectual flatulence.

I recomend it for anyone who is looking for that special piece to the puzzle of a well rounded collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD - Love Joe","review":"I think this is a great CD. I love Joe Walsh's guitar playing and I enjoy listening to the entire first 4 songs straight through uninterrupted. \\"At the Station\\" \\"Indian Summer\\" and \\"Second Hand Store\\" always make me think of summer time when I was a kid and we used to hang out at the fishing hole drinking beer. Of course, this contains the classic \\"Life's Been Good\\" and there's also a great catchy tune called \\"Tomorrow\\" and a couple of cool intrumental pieces.I am a huge Joe Walsh fan so I have to say I am probably playing some favoritism but why not - I think the man is underrated as both a guitar player and lyricist. He may not write mind bending philosophical lyrics 24/7 but he sure knows how to construct a good piece of humoring lyrical content and he has the ability to make you forget about your worries and draw you to another place and time. And isn't that what music is supposed to be about sometimes?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Entire Album/Cd is a hit ...","review":"I'd just re-purchased this CD at Walmart, in their $5.00 bin!! I couldn't believe it. I've had it on tape, and maybe vinyl in the past. From start to finish, all the songs with lyrics, in my opinion, could've been hits back when this was released.

Since none of these songs are on iTunes, I purchased the CD and I am glad I did. I was particularly glad to be able to hear Second Hand Store, Indian Summer and Life's Been Good again as the cassette I have is well worn. The CD arrived right on time and was priced well; can't argue with that."},{"rating":"2","title":"A gem","review":"This album is a throwback to the days when listeners expected most of the songs on an album to work together, instead of simply being a couple of singles plus filler. Certainly music still is made that way by a few artists today (the last couple of efforts by the White Stripes certainly fit the bill), but it has been the exception rather than the rule since the mid '70s.Not every song on the album is \\"great,\\" but there are no weak links, including the radio hits \\"Life's Been Good\\" and \\"At the Station.\\" Like some other reviewers, I wore out my LP version of this one within a couple of years and am glad there is a good quality CD available.It always seemed odd to me that Walsh's fame peaked during his time with the Eagles, but his contributions and influences there show through, even among that group of monsterous egos."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joe proves he could do it again...and again,and again. 4 1/2","review":"Production on this CD is phenomenal,musicianship is unreal. Joe is a true rocker and is very humorous,too. While he didn't take himself too seriously,he DID take the music and his talent seriously. Guitar lovers will totally dig on this one.

But much to my surprise, reading all the comments related, most of the reviewers seemed very well aware of Joe's work with The Eagles, here and there a comment about his tenure with James Gang, his previous albums \\"The Smoker You Drink\\" and \\"So What\\" but..not a single word or comparison of \\"Seriously...\\" with his MASTERPIECE \\"Barnstorm\\" .

But this release has one redeeming quality for those who are collectors and completists, and that is the cover art. Except for the header, it is the original 1969 Album cover from the 1st US release (on A&M Records) of what is now generally known as \\"What We Did on Our Holidays\\" (it was just titled: \\"Fairport Convention\\" here). Probably not worth the full price (especially to those of us who still have the original vinyl version), but might be worth it used.

I am not conflicted about having children at all, just a bit indecisive about the timing. I didn't find much in this book that I hadn't read elsewhere. If you or your partner is truly conflicted about whether or not you want children, this might be a great book to help you articulate what your concerns are, or help you realize that maybe you are prepared, and just understandably nervous. if you're looking for peeks into the lives of parents, I'd suggest \\"Mothers Who Think\\" by the Salon.com editors, or \\"Breeder\\" by the editors of hipmama.com."},{"rating":"2","title":"First baby book","review":"FIrst off this book was published in 2006 so I thought it was going to be a little out dated.

In fact, I am perplexed as to why Christian radio has not picked up on this gem. Evans is perhaps one of the best songwriters in the Christian genre and this album is proof of that. From uptempo, Spirit-filled songs such as \\"Trading My Sorrows\\", \\"So Good To Me\\" and \\"Freedom\\" to stirring emotional ballads such as \\"You are My Portion\\" and \\"Your Love is Extravagant\\", Evans has something on this album for everyone.

The ending is also very unbelievable, aside from the \\"can't we all just get along\\" theme that is very facile, there is the fact there half of NYC's police are called out and then quietly disappear without a peep just on the say so of a police Lieutenant whom the police spend half of the book thinking was a victim of a kidnapping.This is what those Star Wars and Star Trek series potboilers must be like, (his among them) and the reason why I avoid them like the plague.Zahn may not be the greatest writer of Science Fiction, but he can do much better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Limp","review":"West Side Story with aliens instead of working class whites and Puerto Ricans.

In my opinion, he is a musicial genius. When he does a song, It makes you feel you know what he is talking about. You can find more of his work in various places, but another CD with some of his work is gloria! by Gloria Estefan. The third reason why this CD is wonderful is that it has a true Latin flavor, and not the neo-latinism that surrounds todays \\"Latin\\" music. As the title says, this CD is a treat!

It keeps your car much tidier, and avoids things rolling around on the floor (which is basically where you'd have to put rubbish otherwise). Even if you only travel a bit, this thing will make your car cleaner.We hang the bag from our centre glovebox into the rear passenger area. It also has a velcro stick-on attachment but we've never used that.The elastic aperture at the top is the perfect design for keeping rubbish in but allowing you to push rubbish through without having to take your attention off the road.Plus it opens from the bottom very easily with a rolled-up velcro flap. I'm also amazed at how much rubbish it fits. I often push more and more rubbish into it from the top and I've never had the bottom velcro flap open up from the pressure.All in all, very impressed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Small Car Trash Bag","review":"It works pretty well. I have no complaints. I like that the top has elastic that keeps the opening closed--helps to keep stuff inside when I'm driving like a maniac.

I didn't think I was going to like this one because I generally enjoy the more straight-forward killer-with-a-razor type of Italian thriller. But this was really good. It's probably more of a 3.5 out of 5 instead of 4 but I think that one-starred review is uncalled for. Though THE PERFUME OF THE LADY IN BLACK is not a classic, it's still creepy and unsettling.. especially the ending.Recommended for Italian horror fans.-Jordan Krall, author of the spaghetti western/giallo FISTFUL OF FEET"},{"rating":"1","title":"so slow and boring","review":"it took us about 4 sittings to get through the entire movie. it is very slow and not alot happens until about 3/4 of the way through it. a couple go to a party where a scientist tells them a story about driving people crazy then using them in a ritual. then while the couple is playing tennis with the scientist who told them the story the girl gets pricked by a nail in her tennis racket. all of a sudden the girl starts seeing things. so is the girl really going crazy or are the people driving her crazy is the question...what is real and what is an illusion. this is nothing new in cinema but the way it is done here is very boring and drawn out. the music used to indicate a suspenseful moment was annoying and yea they needed music to indicate it or the viewer wouldn't have know it was suspenseful. the acting was also lackluster. the actors seemed bord with their roles and the main actress appeared wooden throughout most of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"SONY NPF70","review":"Bad battery, defective, not good at all for MicroMV Cameras like SONY DCR IP5 or IP7, go fo NPF-71 InfoLITHIUM as a replacement"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad quality - you get what you pay for","review":"Got it FAR thanks giving day.

Just a group of musicians getting together to make a joyful noise unto the L-RD.I can tell you that this CD is going to be a timeless classic.

I'm getting a copy for each member of my praise team. Worship leaders will find an unusually high number of songs that they can use for their own praise teams. The music is solid biblically and resonates with a true spirit of worship. The music emphasizes prayer, opening with a lovely rendition of the Lord's Prayer. My two year old sings the chorus from \\"Sing for Joy\\" repeatedly. \\"As We Worship\\" tells how that worship can lead people to Christ. \\"Lord, We've Come to Worship\\" would be a great opening chorus. \\"Lord, You're Good\\" is introduced by a moving narration from Habakuk, saying that whether or not we get \\"things\\" from God, we will praise Him.

Mr. Waits has an incredible voice, throwing raw passion and soul into your senses and forcing you to deal with it. The ragged fury of his voice reminds me of an old alley cat soaked in gin and whiskey that's been run over by a Mack truck. Twice. Heartattack and Vine and Mr. Seigal are prime examples of his hoarse, ragged voice, and On the Nickel is a morose, sorrow filled tune that moves anyone that listens to it. Overall, as a blues artist goes, Mr. Waits is topnotch. This album NEEDS to be in any serious blues fan's library. Don't even think about it, just buy it.

As a category of creative fiction, Franco-Belgian graphic novels have a very good reputation. Hermann is famous as one of the better known author/illustrators. But in the final analysis, the three books of this series are not really novels. They are more similar to not very well thought out short stories.

After a lecture in Vienna he gets in contact with the former personal servants of Hitler and via them he finds out that Hitler and Eva Braun had a son and that this son met an untimely death. He thinks that through these revelations he has also gotten a better insight into the being of Hitler, but in the end this insight proves to be fatal.This book covers an intriguing subject, Hitler. The brilliant Rudolf Herter radiates his brilliance a little bit too obviously and this makes this alter ago of the author rather irritating, especially in the first part of the book. As the story develops, the book becomes more intriguing and more pleasant to read. But in the end the question remains whether Mulisch succeeded in explaining Hitler and one can wonder whether anybody will ever be able to explain Hitler."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"While it might not hold up to today's politically correct world, I think this book has alot to offer.

She sings with all the emotions in the classic country style of joy, sorrow, tragedy, hope and redemptions of love gone wrong. Much of her material is autobiographical in nature, but not so personal that it gets in the way of our own appreciation of her as a vocalist. \\"Hank (Williams) Did It That Way.\\" Give her a listen and you just may find a new voice to warm your heart and kick your imagination into high gear!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you aint got it.......

The book starts at the electrical (Manchester encoding, NRZ, etc.), and gradually builds until the networking process is clear, top to bottom.

These guys have the amazing ability to take traditional rockabilly and roots music and make it relevant and vibrant today. One listen to this cd and you will immediately throw out all of your Straycat music. This is the real thing: hiccupy, outrageous, on-the-edge, makes you get up and dance rockabilly.

They rock harder than pop punk, and with the exception of the single \\"I Feel Fine,\\" the punk edges out the pop. Some songs reflect the positive aspects of relationships, but most deal with failed relationships. These go beyond simplistic recounts of events and recognize underlying patterns and emotional impacts while still maintaining a rather positive view, all of which helps to give the band more lyrical depth than a lot of their punk-ish peers. \\"Wasted Away,\\" about a lonely and isolated girl in a small town who dreams of something better and is \\"praying for a time when she doesn't hate her life,\\" is one of my favorite tracks. Overall the album is upbeat, full of energy and made me a huge fan of the Riddlin' Kids.

Songs like Blind, I Feel Fine, and the R.E.M. cover of End of the World are some of the highlights of the CD. The Riddlin Kids gear away from the poppy Blink 182 sound and the mainstream Good Charlotte persona and perform underground new century punk rock at it's best, but they're no Ramones of course!

With so many pop-punk bands these days, there are plenty that are doing thier own thing. There are plenty that aren't, but manage to put together a disc that's worth listening to. This cd does not fit either category.

I love it. It is fun and full of cardio with light weight training. I especially loved the kickboxing segment and the music. I have now tried several of the new firms and this still holds at the top as one of my favorites. I like Allison as an instructor and think she does an excellent job in this workout. I am a Firmie and have the other step systems and while I think those are probably a little better of a workout due to the step; it is a nice change in my routine to not use the steps everyday. I hope you all like this workout as much as I do!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not too Bad","review":"I have several Firm workouts, and purchased this because I was a bit bored with the ones I have (I use them regularly). It didn't require any new equipment, and on days I don't think I can climb that step one more time, this fills the bill nicely. If you already are familiar with The Firm, you'll follow along with a fair amount of ease the first time.I did think it would be a bit more of a workout, but I still work up a sweat. That may be relative though, depending on your level of fitness.Her cueing is OK, and she layers it nicely. Like most of the videos sometimes the camera work could be better, it's pretty but when you are transitioning from one move to another & trying to learn the move, it is not the time for the camera to move or pan anywhere.It's a a nice change of pace, and a good addition to your workout collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite possibly the worst workout DVD ever","review":"As a loyal follower of The Firm, I was excited to find a cardio-centric DVD under that brand name. Well, that's where the love affair ended. Instead of the \\"typical\\" Firm techniques of easy-to-master and effective strength training exercises this DVD is 40 minutes of what amounts to a cheerleader doing her best to show everyone her routine...which is repetitive and delivered at a (almost literally) breakneck pace.

When I graduated and saw my developed graduation pictures, I nearly cried over how heavy I looked. The next day, I went out and purchased this DVD and started doing it daily, along with a lean diet, and ended up losing 40 pounds over that summer. I looked absolutely wonderful. My arms were toned (because of the weight training) and my legs were lean and muscular from the series of squats done in this workout. Everybody commented on how great I looked! I really enjoy this workout. Not only is it short enough for even the busiest person, but it is extremely effective. I actually just started doing it again a week ago and have already lost 5 pounds in a seven-day period. If you are looking for quick and lasting results, this DVD is for you! Completely recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great over-all workout","review":"I have been working out with Firm VIDEOs for 20 years (specifically, Firm Workout with Weights-Vol 4. and Firm Crosstrainer-Cardio), and was hesitant to try a new one. The Ultimate Fat Burning Workout is a good combination of both cardio and weight workouts. Although the cardio could have been tougher, this DVD offers a great overall total body workout in a reasonable period of time. (40 min.) Alison is an excellent instructor and very easy to follow. I would highly recommend this DVD to anyone who is looking for a comprehensive workout in under one hour."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It!!","review":"This is the first \\"The Firm\\" workout I have bought since basically collecting videos for my workouts.

I am not terribly uncoordinated, yet I find these moves and transitions so awkward. The sequences are long yet with only about 2-4 reps of each move so you don't get much of a chance to get into a rhythm. And as I said, the transitions are awkward, with arms moving in a different direction that would logically come next. I also find the instructor to be very stale and overly rehearsed. Between the frustration of flailing all around the room, and the robotic tone and smiles of the instructor/models, it's a very unmotivating workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Repetitive","review":"You better watch out or you might fall asleep during this workout....it is soooooo boring....the moves repeat and repeat and repeat. I felt that I got hardly any calorie burn. I was yawning all the way through this really!

It is very easy to follow thanks to Alison Davis. This is a great tape to use on days where it is hard to get motivatied. It is short, but fast paced, and I break out in a great sweat every time. This is a good one for beginners and intermediates and all you need are light weights. I have to admit, sometimes after finishing this tape I want to restart it, and have. I recently had another baby, and this tape along with some other firm tapes are definitely working once again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great workout to alternate with other FIRM videos","review":"I use this dvd to alternate with the other FIRM videos I have and use. This is a great workout to use when you want to take a break from the FIRM workouts that require a step. I will continue to use it when I want a FIRM workout with light weights and no step.Also, I like the variation in exercises it provides. I enjoyed the kick-boxing moves and standing ab work. At the end of the workout, I had a good sweat going! This one is a keeper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just ok...not thrilled!","review":"I love the Firm fitness video's and am an advanced exerciser. This FIRM video did not do it for me. It appears they are just trying to make the moves more original but it's not very effective from perspective. It gets boring after a while and the moves just get confusing after a while and I lose interest as I'm trying to get a workout. I just want a good workout...it doesn't have to be this complicated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the uncoordinated","review":"I picked up this DVD looking for something new to add to my weekly workouts. As soon as I started this workout, I felt like I was always 3 steps behind! My major complaint is that there is absolutely not enough time to get down the moves. During the second cardio segment, when she was \\"sashay-ing\\" around, I must have looked like I was having a seizure trying to keep up with that little blonde. I admit, I gave up about 25 minutes into the video and did another workout. It just seems to me that if you're going to try a workout like this, failure for those who can't pick up the moves right off the bat shouldn't be a consequence. The weight training segments I did like, but overall this workout is not for those as uncoordinated as myself. For all of us who like having time to learn the moves before doing them, I would suggest tryLeslie Sansone: Walk at Home - 5 Mile Fat Burning Walk."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Way To Get Back Into Shape","review":"I haven't worked out for over a year.

The more I did it, the easier it became. It's fast enough to get the heart rate going. It's a combined cardio aerobics/taebo video.Start with the 3lb weights and work up to the 5lb.In a month, I noticed my thighs loosing inches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout","review":"I've been doing The Firm workouts since they came out in the eighties. But now that I'm pushing 50 and had knee surgery, I was looking for a low impact workout that would still push up my heartrate. This does it. Allison uses The Firm's trademark lunges with weights and also uses some fun dance steps and kickboxing moves. Kicks do a nice job of pumping the heart without pounding the knees. The workout is fun and Allison cues well. So I heartily recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick and tough workout","review":"This is not my favorite workout video - but it is a good workout for a \\"40 minute quickie\\". I find this instructor somewhat difficult to follow. There are, however, some fun sets of cardio. I also appreciate not having to drag out all my Firm equipment once and a while. You only need one set of weights for this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for fat-burning, but trying on my patience to learn...","review":"I've never been super coordinated or a fast learner when it comes to memorizing or adding on more and more steps in a workout.

Other than that, it was certainly kicking my butt in gear, so it does what it claims!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Boring, Boring","review":"Not worthy of The Firm name, this workout was repetitive, boring and doesn't belong in a Firm lineup. If you're a true Firm believer and LOVE the originals, DON'T waste your time with this one, it will only disappoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very unprofessional","review":"The changes are too fast. I had to put it in slow motion to get the choreography right and even then... You will spend more time on trying to figure out what to do than doing it. She does not give you any clue ahead before a new move is introduced and does not explain how to properly position your body. Instead of repeating the same move again and again so you can get comfortable doing it, she assumes it is your 50th viewing and that you know the routines 100%, she keeps changing the routines at an insane pace. She could never teach a beginner's class in a professional gym. This DVD targets experienced aerobics students only that already know all the basic and intermediate classic moves.

But don't misunderstand...it's still a great workout. Some creative, unique moves that work muscles in new ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for over 50","review":"This workout is VERY difficult to follow and keep up with, especially for the over 50 ladies. Try Leslie Sansone (LOVE the 3 mile walk with weights and the 2 mile over forty workout). This Firm workout is not worth the money if you are not ready for a fast-paced, young crowd dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good For Beginner to Intermediate Level","review":"This video is a solid workout for beginner to intermediate level exercisers. If you are advanced, it will be a good choice for light days. No equipment required except for a pair of handweights, which are optional. The workout alternates moderate cardio segments (i.e. kickboxing, aerobic dance, etc.) and toning segmeents (i.e. various combinations of lunges/squats coupled with a bicep curl/lateral raise, etc.). You can make the toning segments more intense by using heavier weights. The workout ends with some ab work and about 16 or so straight-legged push-ups (sorry, I don't remember exactly how many, but I could do them all military style, so that tells me it could NOT have been more than 24 since that is my limit!).Overall, a solid and fun workout - 4 stars. I will probably purchase the FIRM Bootcamp Maximum Calorie Burn DVD next."},{"rating":"2","title":"fanny kicker","review":"this is a WORKOUT! besides the incessant dialogue, the workout itself is solid - roughly 40 mins. long - and you'll DEFINITELY feel this one! would recommend to anyone looking for something less aggressive than, say, P90X... this is one routine and one routine only but great for starters to intermediate exercisers."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT WORKOUT","review":"I must say, I didn't know if the video would deliver it's promise to see results in ten sessions. Then I realized the EVERYTHING usually works if you follow the instructions and hold up your end of the bargain. After three sessions I could feel myself becoming stronger and gaining endurance--which turns up the dial on your level of confidence. People were asking me what I was doing after only two weeks because they noticed my body trimming up. Since weights are involved I decided not to weigh myself every week, so I just took my measurements. Inches were just peeling off!!! I'm happy to say that I've lost over 30 lbs., and several inches! I'm stronger than I've been in a LONG time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Awful","review":"I think this toy is complete garbage. It is essentially a cardboard box with a plastic front. The cardboard is so flimsy. The box it shipped in was actually thicker. This toy is also really small so none of my daughter's other dress up clothes would fit inside. Because it is cardboard with plastic doors, it tips over very easily. Assembly was a little difficult because I was afraid of damaging the cardboard. I also had to reinforce the seams with clear packing tape as there were big gaps after assembly. This is a really cute idea but poorly executed. I don't see this toy lasting long because of it's quality, or lack thereof."},{"rating":"2","title":"Individual recipes are served up with an on-air wit","review":"Chef Claud Mann has turned cinematic cuisine into a television art form on his popular TBS Superstation weekly program, \\"Dinner & A Movie\\".

In July 2012, our 5 1/2 year old tv caught on fire. When the technician came out to look at it- he told me that they no longer coat the part that caught on fire with plastic for this reason. Samsung apologized for our tv catching on fire and was glad that noone was hurt, but that was the extent of their compensation for our tv catching on fire. The tv had a 5 year warranty and it was just out of warranty. I think it is horrific that they knew there was a problem, but did nothing to recall the tvs that were out there. It is extremely scarey to have your tv catch on fire and I am extremely disappointed in the way they handled it. We dealt with their ECR, which is the executive customer relations.

About 3 months after purchase It developed a hum in the audio on the component connections. Called Samsung and they sent someone out who took the TV away and repaired it. Came back and had it now had a hum on the output side (going to the receiver) and 4 months later it also developed a problem with the screen (blue spot on the bottom left hand side). Called Samsung again. They sent out yet another (non Samsung Authorized repair center). They've had the TV now for over 15 days and no update from them. My advice to you is don't count on Samsung repair. They are worthless. Also, it should be known that this TV does not support variable output on the sound so you'll always have to adjust at the receiver (just a note). If the TV worked correctly, I'd probably give it a better review. It is nice, but if you have problems at all, you'll be in trouble. Buyer beware!!!

No question the picture is extra crisp in HD (though I can't really compare it to but a 20+ year old Sony 27\\" near flat screen trinitron). The menu controls are pretty well laid out. The component plugins in the back and sides were a little difficult to figure out, but trial and error eventually saw me through. The (universal - nice!) remote is big and the only thing that bothers me so far is that to change the channel, the enter button is 3-4 inches below the number buttons, or you can just wait until 1 or 2 seconds later as it accepts your button presses. The speakers pretty much tops out at the 50% zone. If you have a livingroom with 10 people who are talking, your TV will lose out to your guests' volume. Also on a side note, the lettering on the bezel was scuffed a good bit when I received it, though has nothing to do with performance of the TV."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great TV while it lasted","review":"Beautiful tv for 31 days.

In my opinion, doing covers of well known hit songs is best left to those with incredible singing voices - M.

Those of you, like me, who frequently dive in the Northeast, have had a fascination with the Doria. Mr. McMurray's fast read, high intensity work, has urged patience and caution to all divers who have even, in passing, thought of diving the Doria. This work is compelling, real and unbiased from my point of view. McMurray does what few ego-divers will ever do, which is admit his limitations and mistakes. Refreshing from a diver's point of view and humanistically a plus.An excellent read from a sport, historical, heroic, tragic and entertainment point of view. A nice trip into lives taken too early and unsatiated ambition running rampant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"This is an interesting read for a person that has no diving background at all.

Not just a diatribe, this book offers a broad and literary tale of our massive shift to automobility. Both more eloquent and factual than similar books (e.g. \\"The Geography of Nowhere\\" and \\"Fastfood Nation\\") it is a a good read and influenced my outlook on current events from global warming to farm and forest destruction to being just plain stuck in traffic. I heartily recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Muddled Mess","review":"Let me first say that I completely agree with Kay's main point: Our car culture has huge costs, costs which are way out of whack with their benefits.Having said that, this book fails to convince the skeptic, which ought to be her intended audience. It's a long series of disjointed arguments and statistics and bizarre examples of planning mistakes carefully picked from history with 20/20 hindsight. Far from its other \\"Nation\\" namesakes (Suburban Nation, for example, seriously changed my outlook on how we build cities), it fails to follow some narrow trends or examples, and instead in every chapter tells the same story over and over. This book has great potential, but it feels like the sentences got all mixed up in the publisher's word processor so that no coherent story is told.If you're a fanatic, it's worth a read, but the skeptic will walk away confused and will not be inclined to buy the downtown row house Kay might admire."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little more of this, a little less of that...","review":"Less a book than a book-length sort of reportage, Asphalt Nation builds the case against the automobile to almost absurd heights. After reading the first half of the book, you wonder why cars are even legal in this country! Cars pollute, pollution is toxic, OK, we get that. Enough already.I was more taken with the second part, where Kay reports the history of how automobiles, and specifically traffic planners, conspired to create the sprawling, pedestrian-hostile multilane disaster we call the modern American city. This portion of the book was fascinating, and I would have liked twice as much of it.At the end of the day, however, I was hoping the author would have a more nuanced and thoughtful point of view than, \\"Cars are bad, walking is good.\\" I already knew that. Still and all, a great book if you're inclined to think that maybe what your city needs is NOT one or two more left-turn lanes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new to make this worthwile.","review":"This book is very thorough about describing how cars became ingrained in our lives, but it didn't offer much insight. I'm guessing most people who read this book have some notion of how urban sprawl leads to car dependency and lack of inner-city. This book does little more than re-state that.Additional weak points:- No presence of counter argument.- Repetitive- Not enough attention was payed to the 'taking it back' portion of the title. Roughly 4/5 of the book were taking over America, 1/5 taking it back. No new ideas were presented in the 'taking it back' section."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to find a printing caluclator","review":"I have been looking for an inexpensive printing calculator, and finally found it in the Sharp that I purchased.

The title track is solid, and the single \\"Jimmy Mathis\\" is a great club beat and fun fresh spirit. Bubba really taps into the country side of his style, giving it a banal feel that more people seem to get into. \\"Nowhere\\", feeding somewhat off of Justin Timberlake's \\"Cry Me a River\\" is a slowed down track in which Bubba matches the tone of the song excellently in what is the best track on the album.

After a few listens to the this joint I was compelled to purchase a trailer home and get my moonshine on.
