It will do nothing for you, other than smell nice. I have battled cracks in my feet since I was a child. I have tried a lot of different products. I have found that if you have feet like mine, your best bet is a product that exfoliates, to remove the callusy skin. I don't mean a product with \\"microbeads\\" or some other gritty type of exfoliant. I mean an additive like alpha hydroxy acids or salicylic acid to help shed dry skin cells faster. These product help break up that dead skin over time and slough it off so you have softer skin which is less likely to crack (if you keep it moisturized). I have had really good luck with Kerasal, as long as I keep using it consistently, and keep an abrasive loofah in the shower to assist the exfoliation process once a week or so.

Minor problems from the start: it goes through an \\"INITIALIZATION\\" process sometimes. Often right when I need it to answer the phone. It continued going through spurts of switching between working and not working. I moved to a place where there is no phone jack in my office, so I figured I could connect it to the nearest one, about 40' away. Total failure at this point.

They refused to replace the battery or the headset with the pretext that batteries are not covered by the warranty. Of course this was not a simple case of a dead battery it was a battery defect and possible safety issue. Also beware that if the headset or the base break, they cannot be replaced as standalone pieces as they are both paired to each other in order to work.

It doesn't sound so bad on my end, but I keep having other people (including clients) complain about it. So that right there is a deal breaker.Second, the battery life is dismal on this thing. My last cordless would go through the day fine, even make it through an hour or so the next day if I forgot to charge it. This thing goes out after about 3 hours of talk time. I'm on the phone a lot, so I need something that lasts a little longer.Third, after just a couple weeks, I can already feel the flimsy nature of the phone. It's become clear that this will not go six months without breaking.Overall this is a very disappointing product from RCA.

As the earclip with the headset looked cheap, we've been using it with great care, but ultimately it just broke. I contacted their customer non-service department and they refused my claim and said it was customer damage. I was particularly insulted as I KNOW we were very careful with it, so I explained it must have been a defect in the material or workmanship and should be covered by the limited warranty. I escalated the call 3 times before getting the manager (i.e. they gave me the run around). The absurdity of them not sending this 2 cent plastic insert piece gives one an idea of how they regard their customers. If you don't want to use the headset I expect you'd be fine.

The main attraction being the wireless headset. After about 6 or 8 weeks, the headset spontaneously stopped working. I called thompson electronics and they asked me to return it for a free replacement which I did but that stopped working after a couple of months as well. Thompson gave another free replacement and I have had the my current phone for about 5 months now and so far the headset still works. However, at least once a day, the phone literally dies sometimes it shows an'Initialization' message and sometimes it just goes blank. When that happens it wouldn't work unless it is placed back in its cradle for a minute or two. Very bizarre. I absolutely love the wireless headset. It is such a help to have your 2 hands free when you're on the phone but this particular model needs tuning.

This book has every explanation towards every step of this frightful battle of the Gallipoli campaign of 1915. It is also a great description of trench warfare back then and how men had to endure knowing that death was certain.After reading The Nek, I am highly grateful to be living in the generation that I am in. You get an utmost respect for Australians and a clear understanding of why they celebrate ANZAC Day.

It only crushes SMALL cloves easily. Large cloves are fairly impossible to crush without brute strength and the flimsiness and lightness of this press makes it even harder. It does not clean so well either- bits of garlic get stuck in the holes. The garlic press also seems to retain the garlic smell which I think is due to it being made from plastic. I will be buying a regular stainless steel garlic press."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works well. Very hard to clean.","review":"This as a new and \\"improved\\" Zyliss press. It does not come with the plastic cleaner the older model used because it has a \\"nonstick\\" surface. It is very difficult to remove the peels left after pressing. The holes have to be cleaned individually with a small probe like a toothpick. Difficult and time consuming. I have sent multiple e-mails to Zyliss asking for cleaning suggestions. Zyliss does not respond. The companies lack of interest in customer satisfaction is very informative. Don't buy their products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked awesome until it snapped in half","review":"Was thrilled with this press, then it snapped in half about 3 months after we bought it. Made from some sort of cheap metal material. Not worth it, buy a stainless steel one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coating flakes off, hard to clean","review":"Works well enough but the coating starts coming off in about a year. Then there is cleanup, its a pain to clean. Several other presses have built in cleaning pads, check those out instead of this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"It handles both traditional and cut up elephant cloves with ease without squirting stuff out the top like a kitchen aid press I previously had. Like many people said the only disappointment is that it does not come with one of those plastic cleaners making it somewhat difficult to clean at times. I recommend just leaving it out and allowing the leftover garlic to dry so it will then just flake off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to clean, not pretty. Overall not imPRESSed.","review":"Hello,I bought this thinkin I'd b saving $ compared to the better presses (they have teeth that fit through the holes in the press...so its easier to clean). but, this one is almost impossible to clean if you don't start right away. So this press is not impressive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works-if you have very strong hands","review":"This is a fine garlic press provided you have hand strength like King Kong. I have carpal tunnel and I couldn't get it to work. My piano-playing son who has very strong hands was able to squeeze it but only with great effort. Since the capacity of the thing is rather small anyway, this press went into the junk drawer. Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great garlic press","review":"This garlic press is totally wonderful, it is inexpensive, no parts to lose, and Zyliss makes the best kitchen products!"},{"rating":"1","title":"paint peels off ,no cleaner","review":"the garlic press works fine but its hard to clean and i the finish is coming off so its not worth it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cleaning is easy.","review":"Folks,It's easy to clean any garlic press by using the plastic dish brush or nail brush that many a kitchen sink has nearby.Just hit the outside surface of the holes with the bristles of the brush to poke any garlic out.Rinse your garlic press after using, so that the garlic doesn't have a chance to dry before cleaning. If dry, just soak it.Soap is not needed, just rinse. Cleaning gizmos are not needed if you have a brush, and toothpicks are silly once you try using a brush.The Oxo press is useless and so are most presses other than Zyliss. Why are they the only ones who understand how to engineer pressing garlic?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing garlic press","review":"Very hard to press garlic through holes but even harder to clean. The most concerning problem is the fact that the coating flakes off after a short time of use. Who knows how toxic the material that flakes off is and what it is doing to ones body? I just threw it away after it started seriously flaking off. I had a similiar problem with an oxo garlic press made of the same material and coating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great growing up book","review":"If your child is a future fan of Neil Simon's plays, get them About the B'nai Bagels as soon as possible.This is a story that grows on you a lot. I first read it when I was ten, and thought it quite dumb at the time. But there's a lot of life in there.It was years later when I saw a presentation of Brighton Beach Memoirs. It dealt with the same issues as B'nai Bagels: a pubescent kid who goes through puberty.While your average fourth or fifth grader may wish to pursue an adventure in Donkey Kong rather than reading, the book is short enough not to interrupt their busy schedule.Trust me, when he/she gets to be an old college kid, you'll be glad B'nai bagels was one of the old book reports."},{"rating":"1","title":"My pan has warped and is getting worse","review":"At first we loved this pan. We've used it quite a bit, but recently it has started to warp and it gets worse when it is heated. I can no longer sear a roast and then put it in the oven because the pan is so uneven. I've contacted All Clad and am waiting to see what they say. Needless to say, I would have been much happier with a less expensive pan. I am very happy with all the other All Clad pans that we have, but this one is a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this pan!","review":"After finishing the best turkey I have ever made for Thanksgiving, I cannot highly recommend this pan! An investment for sure, I was lucky enough to receive it as a gift. At first I was hesitent about cooking on stainless steel. My Mom has a set of some cheepy brand of stainless steel that she got in 1971 as a wedding gift (still has them) and they are a pain to cook on, everything sticks. Not in these pans! The majority of the time they wash right up. Sometimes you might have to use a little Barkeepers Friend on them to keep them sparkling, but it takes two seconds to clean with that. When we got married I had started with Calphalon. I am definately switching to All Clad!!!

Two weeks ago I sent an email to Amazon and have not received an answer. Today I called Amazon and after being on hold for over a half hour the rep said that I must contact Magazine Express, even though Amazon took my money. I requested to speak with a supervisor (another 10 minutes), who did her \\"research\\" and she said that the magazine \\"was not available at this time\\" but I would have to wait another 12-16 weeks and it might be available.

I ordered this strap because it was the highest rated strap and the gold would match my vintage Epiphone Acoustic very well. So I ordered it. I was very surprised at how quickly it arrived. It was very well packaged and it is strong enough to hold my light acoustic or my heavy electric off the ground with no issue. It is double layered so it is even stronger than a regular single layer strap. My only complaint is that it is more of a bronze color but it goes even better with my acoustic.

To ship it back is very expensive, and there was no info in the package on how to contact the seller, so I have tried duct taping the thing together several times now.

Its one of those songs that when you here it - you have to hear it again . Try Again and Lady of The Lake are also good.

A very amateurish production. There are clips of Taylor's movies shown without audio and they don't relate to the narrative. Commentators are unknowns giving their opinions while sitting in a public park or backyard. The film starts off with a slanderous comment about Taylor's father being envious and taking her money. The truth is she had a trust fund as required by law and had a close relationship with her mother and father until their deaths. I imagine this is a shoddy attempt to rip off Elizabeth Taylor fans. Amazon should pull it from their offerings. I returned my copy for a refund.... it's that bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"How Do I Get My Money Back??","review":"A ridiculous, homemade production narrated by 3 nobodies--this video looks as though it were slapped together by a seventh grader.

When I purchased the DVD, I seem to remember the reviews on here being positive--I don't know if it's possible for people to remove their reviews?With a little extra effort, this video could have been garbage...at the moment, it's sub-garbage. Save your money, do NOT buy this trash!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible DVD","review":"This DVD about Elizabeth Taylor is incoherent and badly written. The screen shows images that don't relate to what is being said by the announcer. The program jumps around incoherently from unrelated images to different times in Elizabeth's life. Many images are repeated again and again. Many of the comments are incorrect. In addition, women on a park bench are interviewed, but no sound can be heard.

He just makes playing the guitar look effortless.The version of Highway star suffers a little from Ian Gillan fooling around with the lyrics and tune but both this and Hallelujah are sure to be of interest to Purple fans.The DVD jukebox would have been better without the cheap and uninspiring advertising that almost ruins Emerson Lake and Palmer and stops me from watching more than 10 seconds of any one else.Shoddy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as strong as I expected","review":"My Catholic friend seemed to like it OK.

I am into music like The Cure and such and heard much acclaim about The Banshees so I bought this album. I liked everything about it: the lyrics, the cover art, etc...until I played it. It was horrible. One of the worst things I have ever heard. This is truly torture music to me. The kind I would listen to to punish myself. I have nothing against Siouxsie and the Banshees...I don't recommend not buying this record, but just give it a listen before you do."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Banshees' Best","review":"In my humble opinion, Peepshow is the most fully realized, both musically and thematically, of the Banshees' many albums and therefore unmatched. Siouxsie's voice is at it's best, sensuous at times, sometimes even loving, and yet aggressive when necessary. Musicianship is at a real highpoint with all the players working seamlessly together. The production is tight throughout and all of the songs are fresh and inspired. Many (most?) \\"goth\\" fans will pick Juju as the Banshees' best album, but let's face it, \\"goth\\" is really more about attitude than musical quality. With Peepshow, Siouxsie and Company [maddened] old fans, confounded the pundits and released a brilliant work full of energy, playfulness and fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst movie of the year","review":"I order this movie just to see what is was about.

It's not that the guy is lovable or anything, but the film plays fast and loose with the truth, takes quotes and film clips out of context and demeans the history of Iraq and the Arab culture. The narration and on screen titles are amateurish. And the film tone changes from silly to brutal and back again several times.

Well narrated, fast paced, filled with information, and organized. It begins with some funny stuff and then gets into the serious evil of the Saddam regime. There's a lot of file footage that most viewers have likely never seen before, interspersed with interviews (way more fun than interviews interspersed with file footage). It's got a great soundrack too!Finally, be sure to watch the interview where the creator explains the risks he took to make this film.

I was wrong and should have paid attention to the reviews that said the colors were not as they appear. The blue is definitely purple and the green is really bright. I thought it was ugly and sent it back before I even opened it. Maybe I would feel differently if I had a girl, but this cover is definitely not for boys."},{"rating":"1","title":"U-G-L-Y","review":"I am rating this a one because of the color. I am sure that this seat cover would work wonderfully, however the color is so disgusting that I had to return it. The color in the picture is not a good representation of the ACTUAL color. It really a disgusting baby poop green!.

It's worth spending the extra money for these. I read reviews of other products that said they fell off of the door or swung too much when the door was opened and closed.These stay in place. No worries! I'm glad I read reviews and shopped around. I'd recommend this product again. I guess my only suggestion would be to make them in colors other than white."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with these blinds","review":"Given the numerous positive reviews, I was expecting these magnetic blinds to solve the problem of finding a nice window treatment for a metal door that cannot be drilled into without voiding the warranty. Unfortunately, I am very disappointed with them. They look cheap to me, and their operation is far from smooth. If you take pride in your home decor, I can't imagine being satisfied with these blinds. On the upside, it was very easy to take them down, after seeing them in action. I decided to keep using an $8 temporary shade for the time being -- it actually looks nicer than these blinds and lets some light filter through while protecting privacy. I regret purchasing these magnetic blinds."},{"rating":"1","title":"will not work with Gateway Essential PCs","review":"This is the RAM recommended for the Gateway Essential series.

How many spoons have you purchased and tossed away?Stylish and easy to clean, these heavy-duty tools are great. I was pleased to see that their handles mimick the handles to my all clad pots. The container is also large enough to accomodate more tools (start shopping).Quick re-use eliminates the turnaround time with other tools. I think these will last longer since there is no wood to split, no screws to snap, and no plastic to get stained and funky.Nice gift, since it arrives in a large, colorful cylinder package. Another hit!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality tools, anemic canister","review":"Restaurant-supply quality tools (overlooking that restaurant suppliers' tools often aren't twenty bucks a pop or quite as heavy). Their weight and the size of the spoons may take some getting-used-to, but as others have stated once you do anything of lesser quality just won't do.Each tool's handle is pierced for hanging, plenty long enough for stockpots, and stay cool. The turner is ridged with a beveled edge; unsuitable for serving up pie, but great for flipping burgers or scraping loose the fond when deglazing. The canister, by comparison, is too light-weight and tips if balance isn't maintained, unlike the Le Creuset canister, which easily handles the weight of these five tools however they're plunked in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as functional","review":"After reading the glowing reviews, we thought we would splurge and buy a really good set. While they all appear nice and shiny and are made with sturdy stainless steel to last a lifetime, my wife and I found the functionality of three of the pieces limited.Both spoons are surprising shallow and on the small side, so they hold very little.And in addition to the spatula being on the small side, it doesnt have any holes for draining things such as bacon fat, etc.Personally, we also didnt like the fact that the handles on all the pieces are indented which sends your thumb into a depression, instead of rounded handles which are more common.We are returning them for stainless steel pieces we found at Crate and Barrel that are similar in quality but have spoons that are slightly larger and deeper, spatulas with holes for drainage, rounded handles and all at half the cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"All-Clad Top of the line ...Does not disappoint","review":"The All-Clad 6-piece Stainless steel tool set costs more but it is worth it in terms of functionality and general appearance.

However, the characters that we normally don't get to see a lot of really did shine in this and we got to see a back story that did fill in a lot of missing pieces. But, the human trials, the facing of the truth of one's self and learning how true your friends are is a lesson we all can embrace and learn from. Still a great series and I have watched it several times over so don't think for a minute that I didn't like it, I did and very much so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!","review":"Firstly let me say that I love Bleach. Since it comes on Sunday night I can not see it so I DVR it. But I am a little confused with this 4th season. I was under the impression that they had broken up the Bount saga into 2 box sets but, from the looks of it that is not entirely true. They seem to stop the season when the Bount enter the Soul Society. Which means that you are not getting the entire season therefore you have to wait for season 5 to drop to find out what happens to the Bounts. I really hope that they do not do the same thing for season 5.

My friends and I all agreed-it was incredibly dope. The raps are hilarious and original and fresh. Red Money--featured on a few songs--is a nasty genius on the mic. Kilo has a nasal twang and pimpy flow that ingratiates, offends, ring-around-the-rosies, and gets down. The ladies love this record when they finally get to hear it. You should do yourself a favor if you love good times and very groovy, original styles that express what it's all about to be young and full of cum in the deep south. Why hasn't this record gained more notoriety? Perhaps it's because Kilo went from this inventive, funky record into generic booty bass with little to distinguish it from the herd. So get this record and you can thank me later.

Trying to get this problem resolved involved frequent interactions with customer service.

I love using this to make a quick batch of whipped cream or perfectly frothed eggs, its amazing for making sauces and stirring anything from cooking pasts to soups. It feels great and sturdy in my hand, the heavy handsome metal makes me feel like a real cook and it's surprisingly easy to clean.This is a fabulous whisk, it's different than most, the loops are different heights to really get the air and liquid integrated; I absolutely adore and recommend this to anyone who cooks.

I decided to start with just one. While it's true that the disc is surround encoded, the music is just awful. The synths and drum sounds he uses sound like they were obtained at a garage sale from the 80's!! Unsatisfying rhythms, no melody, no real development just boring and repetitive (and that's from someone who enjoys techno music). I didn't find one redeeming track on this CD which now lives in my garbage can. Don't be fooled by the slick artwork, this is music by a bad musician, nothing more."},{"rating":"1","title":"All hype, little substance","review":"I was new to DTS audio recordings and seduced by the descriptions of this being the ultimate example of the technology.

However trademarking 3-Dimentional Sound Reality was pretty darn smart, it suckered me right in! The disc enjoys to kudos, 1 it is nicely packaged and 2 the publicist did a great job in blowing smoke up the rear of potential customers in search of real surround sound mastery.Of the 100 or so DTS audio discs I have, if you want something that really shows off your system, albeit and totally different genre of music, look into Clapton/BB King \\"Riding with the King\\".

Well they give a character description for each person in the cast and then they tell you what needs to happen and in what order. The rest is really up to you. This is a fun show to put on but because of the constant improv, it is very difficult to perform, unless you know like the back of your hand what is happening throughout the performing area.

The only comment i would have to make are those annoying L and R buttons, the big buff odd things that you really have to press to activate. The right side of the controller (the part with the A button, B button, C joystick, and those other buttons) is a perfect design, allowing you to feel the buttons good.

The button placement ensures a long learning curve, causing you to take your eyes off your game for precious seconds to figure out which button you need to press.Also, on the analog sticks, the tops easily pop off revealing sharp areas that really hurt your hand if you push on buttons hard like me.Next time, lets hope that Nintendo can create a controller that has an easy and comprehendible design"},{"rating":"1","title":"IT WOULD BE GOOD IF AMAZON.COM HAD ANY IN STOCK!","review":"GET SOME IN STOCK PLEASE!, I GOT A CERTIFICATE AND I WANT A CONTROLLER.

The 'setup' utility window (from control panel/game controllers) shows you which button you're pressing so you can test it, and it lets you test the rumble feature too.The only bad things about it are that it says it only works with the original GC wired controllers.

Don't listen to people who say it is too small, because it is the perfect size and shape for hands of any size (unless there are 12-foot tall giants that i just haven't noticed yet). The buttons are set up in systems that allow for simple and easy gameplay. The c-stick was pure genius, and the built in rumble is small and unobtrusive. It is easy to play with this controller and those who have trouble adapting to use, in the majority of the games, two buttons (A and B) have worse problems than gaming issues. The z-button is tricky, but you can move the middle finger up to the r-button and you are set. The colors are great, and the l- and r-buttons are PRESSURE SENSETIVE, not cheap. Another genius adaptation is that you can no longer get that \\"wandering cursor\\" effect like you would with malfunctioning N64 controllers, since the gamecube uses the stick's position at powerup as default.

David Carradine is featured very little in the movie, maybe 15 minutes of air time, which he is billed as starring in. The parts he is in he seems vacant.

While they are well made, they are not well designed. I agree with others that they do not grip very well. I also think they're too heavy.

All-clad is a great name and the product in made in the USA. I have used tongs to cook and serve for many years. I find that these are a bit clumsy to use and do not pick up the food well in the pan or from a cutting board. In addition, they are heavy and the locking mechnanism and spring are not well constructed and have a tendency to lock when using or unlock if moved, while they are stored. There are less expensive tongs on the market that are a better buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Tongs I Have","review":"The negative reviews surprise me. I've had these for a year and love them. I have several other stainless tongs but these are the ones I grab for first. They are gorgeous in their 18/10 stainless steel and very well made. I am big and have to make a conscious effort not to crush people's hands when I shake with them so the spring in these tongs is perfect for me. The ends are slippery but a little more pressure on the tongs keeps foods from slipping. The weight gives them the substantial feel of a quality tool and the fit and finish reinforces the impression. Despite what one review said mine do bear the All-Clad logo and don't say Made in China anywhere. I would recommend them and replace these in a heartbeat if anything happened to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO SLIPPERY TO HANDLE","review":"Phooooey..... I bought these as a gift for my boyfriend and put them in his Christmas stocking. We used them right away for Grilled Chicken and it was almost comical.

Next time we tried them on steak and it worked a little better but not much. Great heavy quality, nice to look at, but worthless for the task they were designed for.

They are well made, pretty to look at but have zero function. They do not grip food; they bend in the middle, and are completely useless in the kitchen. All-Clad should be ashamed of their selves putting out such a horrible product. I would NEVER recommend these to anyone, unless you feel like dropping food all of the time. Seriously I think a cheap pair of good grips OXO tongs are much better. Why can't anyone make perfect kitchen tongs?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I have owned and used these tongs for 1 year plus...","review":"Gorgeous, Heavy, but ultimately Fails to Perform. Locking mechanism is a nice feature but I do see where it could use improvement as attested to in prior reviews. Price to Performance ratio is a dismal dissapointment.I use my tongs as an extension of my hands, using these tongs is like wearing teflon mittens dipped in lard, they just have no grip. Bending the ends in provides a slight improvement in gripping power but it is too little and eventually they bend back. The high spring tension is actually welcome by me as I have large hands, but the lack of \\"teeth\\" or deep scalloping, the shallowness of the gripping end and the slick surface combine to doom this thing to an expensive showpiece, not a useful tool in my arsenal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not designed well","review":"I love all my All Clad pots and pans, however, when I bought these from Amazon.com, I was very unhappy with their function.

I got these All-Clad Stainless 12-Inch Locking Tongs with a All Clad set. These tongs are totally worthless in my kitchen. It's not just the amount on strength required to squeeze the tongs closed. The scalloped working end of the tongs grips nothing. My favorite kitchen tongs are theEdlund Restaurant Tongs - Scalloped: 12 INCH. And the Edlund's are made in the USA and cost about the same as Oxos. Or if you need tongs that are safe for non-stick cookware try theRosle 12926 12-Inch Silicone Coated Locking Tongs.PROS:NoneCONS:The scalloped working end of the tongs grips nothing.It needs more strength to squeeze the tongs closed.It is heavy.It is expensive for something Made in China."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible tongs","review":"I agree this must be the worst tong design in the world, if not the universe.

The finish and weight are first rate. The problem is, at least on the set that I bought, that the spring rate is too high. I found them fatiguing after a very short period of use, and it's not as though I lack hand strength.In contrast, I recently bought a set of the Oxo tongs, and they are much, much more usable. Not quite as nicely finished, but they also lock and are sprung much better. I think they were a bit less expensive as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!","review":"I'm an All-Clad fanatic. I have their pots and pans, their measuring cups, and most of my cooking utensils are All-Clad. All of them have exceeded my expectations in its quality, design, and utility, except this one. Thank goodness I didn't pay for them (I got this as a bonus gift to buying bunch of other All-Clad pots and pans) b/c unlike other All-Clads, they are NOT worth the price! The locking mechanism is not designed well -it takes a little more effort than my other tongs to lock and unlock during cooking, which might not seem much, but it becomes a huge nusiance when you use it as much as me. But what's most disappointing is that the end of the tongs are so flat (my other tongs curve inward slightly so that it will hold onto food better) that unless I use extra force to hold onto the food, it just slips out (talk about hands cramping!). Like others have commented here, it looks beautiful, but in terms of getting things done in the kitchen, it fails miserably."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst I've ever used","review":"These are in a word, horrible. They simply do not work. The \\"teeth\\" areflat (no curvature) to clamp/bite into food. You have to exert extraforce on the handle to keep food from slipping out of tongs. Judgingby the workmanship I'd say these were made overseas. Clearly not upto All Clad's standard of craftmanship. I bought the Rosle brand toreplace All Clad's tongs, the Rosle is far superior. I use All Clad'scookware but some of their tools leave much to be desired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look nice, but not so functional.","review":"The tongs look very nice, but in general are not as good as others that I've used.

However, the item is relatively flimsy and my pump kept tipping over in the sump pit with this device. It may work okay for a primary pump only setup, but I have a battery backup pump and the additional weight means the weight is slightly off center.

It really is a simple piece of plastic, with some double sided tape pre-installed that (not very well) holds the thing to the feet on the bottom of your sump pump. It is hard to imagine that will hold very long under water (its for a submersible sump pump...).I thought the ring of double side tape would attach to something, or there would be clips, etc. Maybe a strainer to keep large pieces out of the inlet? Nope, none of that was so.The plastic piece appears so lightweight, I think it could easily be dislodged and end up jamming something.If you want to raise the level of your pump, I think the bricks approach is superior to this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just plain old fashioned fun","review":"A fun storyline and wonderful illustrations make How to Speak Moo a delight to read.

My recollection of safety glasses is the dorky ones from 7th grade shop class. Forget about those, as these Fastcap tinted safety glasses look like very cool sun glasses. Now when I trim the yard or mow (I use a riding mower and grass flies like crazy -- especially when it is windy), I don't worry about my eyes getting whacked.

I've read his column for years, as well as some of his earlier books, and this is vintage Dave Barry. He manages to fit the history of humanity, the formation of America as a nation, and the 2000 presidential election into 180 pages. His humor is pointed and (no matter what he might have you believe) educated, but not mean-spirited. Barry pokes fun at lawyers, campaign smear ads, and much more, as well as inserting giant zucchini into every chapter. If you're confused, all I can say is read the book. It will give you a new perspective on the funny sides of American government-and believe me, there are many."},{"rating":"2","title":"Listening to the CD makes the experience twice as humorous.","review":"Dave Barry Hits Below the Beltway is funny for the Washington-themed humor. Add to this a section on the history of our government, a pinch of South Florida politics, and add the great, great narration, and you will laugh, laugh, laugh.As Dave Barry states, if he wanted this to be a real good book on Washington politics, he'd have to spend a lot of time in Washington. So this is not going to be a really good book!The jabs at the US Department of Agriculture (not sure whether it should be permitted to call dried plums \\"dried plums\\"), the driving habits of older Floridians, and the Clintonian escapades are all fair game to Barry. And wait till you hear the attorney arguments in the 2000 elections!Read it and weep... from laughter!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vintage Dave","review":"If you're a Dave Barry fan, you'll like this book; if you're not, you probably won't. If you don't know who he is yet, WHERE HAVE YOU BEEN? :^) Some of the book is just so-so, but I laughed until I cried - literally - when I read his spoof on 'smear' ads on TV that major political candidates air against each other. His 'complete explanation, including the footnotes' of the Constitution and its amendments is also good. Not his best, but it has its moments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Barry Goes Nuts","review":"Barry once again writes what he knows.

But Dick Hill's reading voice is wrong, all wrong. He is SUCH a distraction from the content of the book. I had to give up after about 10 minutes. He constantly plays with his voice and does all these stupid inflections as though he's reading to a child. It's awful, simply awful.

It has served me well for two years. It is great for any students or new therapists hoping to expand their practice. Eventually, you will have to upgrade if you are doing chair massage on a regular basis. It is lightweight and easily portable which is what I like the most about it. But beware if you work with heavier clients because there is limited chest and stomach space which may make it very uncomfortable for them. The seat is not sturdy either. I am afraid that some clients are going to fall off of it.If you don't plan on doing many chair massages (maybe just a few social functions and demos) then this chair would be fine and is well worth it.But if you are seriously wanting to practice chair massage on a daily/weekly basis, you should invest in a more durable chair."},{"rating":"2","title":"massage chair","review":"The massage chair is a very good value for the money.

This is definitely not a professional product. The seat is made with 1/4 inch plywoood and mounted (screwed) to the frame with a small block of wood in the center. There is no lateral support for the seat, although there is for the arm rest. After several sessions, the seat literally cracked on both sides, so now I have to create a new base for the seat before it can be used again. Further, there are minimal adjustments that can be made for size and comfort. On the upside, for the occasional home user, it is more than easy to set up and use, although I would adhere to a weight limit of less than 200 pounds."},{"rating":"1","title":"beware...you may not be getting a new chair","review":"I was disappointed in this purchase. I purchased this chair for my wife who is a massage therapist. it was sent with two cuts in the arm rest that were obviously repaired (two shiny spots over the slits). There were also screw marks on the headpiece were it is tightened.Comfort is also only 2 stars. either the seat is too flush with the frame or the chest rest is two big...either way, you get the feeling that you are going to slip off.it's a good value if you need a chair. however, i do not see this as a chair that you would want if you were a serious career massage therapist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste you money","review":"If I could give this 0 stars, I would.

Sadly though, not as many laughs come from Black as one may like, and more often than not the debating comics become the centerpiece. All in all, Root of All Evil is worth your time, but for big fans of Lewis Black, you may be a bit disappointed that he isn't constantly at the forefront."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lewis Black Root of All that's not funny!","review":"Being a huge Lewis Black fan, I pre-ordered this DVD with great anticipation. I was so disappointed when I watched and saw that it was not his stand-up act but a horribly unfunny, scripted attempt to be who? This certainly is NOT his arena for what he does best and that is... be Lewis!Stick to your stand-up act or take a final bow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lewis Black? Where?","review":"I was excited when I found out that a new Lewis Black DVD with 'all new' material was coming out -- I'm a great fan, and have all his previous work. I preordered, and have been watching my mail box for a week. When I received it, I dropped everything so I could watch it. THIS DVD SUCKS! Less than a quarter of the DVD was even Lewis Black, and if I want to watch Judge Judy, I'll turn on the TV. Give me Lewis Black as a standup comic, that's what's he's best at -- but leave the stupid game show adolescence out of it. If this was my first experience with Lewis Black, I wouldn't even be a fan of his, that's how bad it is! If you want great Lewis Black, buyLewis Black: Red, White & Screwed. Don't waste your money on this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"iJet Wireless Remote is a nice add-on","review":"My wired remote from Apple shorted out, so I decided to go for fewer wires and bought this iJet. This remote works very well, particularly at close range. There is a good disclaimer in the directions about needing \\"line of sight\\" for the best infrared signal. Sending the wireless signal through walls cuts down the range considerably, but it is great if you are sitting across the room from your iPod and just want to shuffle songs or change the volume. I use it to control my Pod while I am walking or biking. Replaceable lithium batteries last for about 6 years (probably longer than this iPod will last) and the wireless receiver is powered out of the remote port on top of the iPod. Read the directions first. It takes about 30 seconds for the wireless point to \\"find\\" the remote each time you start up. If you just wait that 30 seconds I think you will find this product to be quite acceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"compatibility!!!!!!","review":"I was given one as a gift - I see neither the product description nor the reviews mention that, like the airgriffin one, it can't connect to some ipods, notably the video ipods and nanos. Check the picture - if yours doesn't have room for that extra projection next to the jack plug, this probably isn't for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasure to read","review":"Although my primary motive for reading this book was research for a school paper, I was soon reading it for pleasure. The author's writing style is appealing, intelligent, and humorous. The comprehensive description and analysis of J.D. Salinger's life before he went into seclusion keeps the reader interested, not only in what Salinger did, but in how it was viewed by the world around him. Hamilton peppers the text with well-chosen quotes from both Salinger's works (both the well-known books and short stories as well as the lesser known short stories published by magazines) and from his contemporaries. Although Hamilton could not directly base his biography of Salinger off of an interview, his sources are well documented and believable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on Hamilton","review":"If you're a fan of Salinger's work, do not read this poor written biography. The best you can do is just read his marvelous books, and forget about the writer to focus on the writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A real gem","review":"Occasionally, a book is published that makes you want to sing and dance, and tell everyone you know to go and read it. Chris Abani's, Graceland, is one of these books. The story is about Elvis, a young man living in the slums of contemporary Lagos. With the skill of a master writer, Abani depicts the humour and pathos of life in one slice of modern day Africa. While the setting is refreshingly unique, its themes and characters are recognizably universal. This is a book that will appeal to anyone looking for good literature, and especially to those who have an interest in Africa, and are longing for more stories set in this continent."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly gifted writer","review":"Chris Abani has written an amazing novel that you won't soon forget. It's gritty and raw, indeed. This novel will reach deep inside of you and won't let you go until long after you've read the last page.

The cover intrigued me and so did the description of a young African Elvis impersonator trying to make a life for himself. Who wrote the summary of this book? Did they even read it? It's not what this book is about at all.This book is interesting at first. As I read on, I kept trying to find where this book was going. This is difficult as the book switches between the past and the present; unfortunately the two are never reconciled.About half way through, I found myself skimming through the remaining pages, scanning for a semblance of a plot. No luck.I gave up on this book- it's just too much work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Graceland: A Novel","review":"I didn't care for this book. I found it to be very choppy, with the storyline starting and stopping before it was really developed. Characters were not developed properly and the recipes were annoying.

Yes, I recently purchased the highly reccomended Madden 2002. It lived up to its expectations. The only downside was the fact that when I saved this it took up an entire card.

Pathetic","review":"A major disappointment on an otherwise nice system. Beware, 4Mb is only 512K, about a third of that on a floppy drive. If you are a serious gamer and would like to do anything other than save the BARE minimum, try to hold out until real cards, or the SD-Adapter is available. I have about a dozen games, and have 2 cards completely filled. I have had to delete many features within games, such as replays, custom skate parks, multiple seasons, etc.. because of the lack of space available. Madden 2002- 59 blocks ALONE just for franchise mode, then even more memory for saving anything else. FIFA 2002- 29 blocks right there. 1 SSX tricky replay- 29 blocks. Pikmin- 19 blocks.(EA must not know how to keep stuff small, they tend to be the biggest offenders). I am definately waiting for the 8MB (although, judging by past errors, it could only be 8Mb, 1/8th the size)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why four?","review":"This is a pretty good memory card. I gave it a four because even though I have two, I can barely hold my memory for Pikmin, Tony Hawk 3, Super Smash Bros, Luigi's Mansion, NBA Courtside, Spider-man, 007, and Sonic.Buy this item, though.

Luckily, a memory card can change all that.

They have a really good irish-punk kind of sound happening at first. Then it turns more into less irishy punk. I hate to use the word punk because I don't want to draw connotations of lame pop-punk bands. This is a very good album. The only thing negative I have to say, hence the 4 stars, is that towards the end of the album the songs get a little redundant. They start to sound the same a little bit. I would, however, reccomend this album. It probably got about 5 or so play-throughs in my CD player before it was replaced."},{"rating":"2","title":"I knew this was going to be a good one!","review":"This album is fantastic. After last years EP (Love the Cup), I had a strong feeling about this band.They do the common guy/girl vocals but it fits perfectly.They twist folk/punk/rock/alt. pop all into one solid rhythm. The lyrics are dark and destructive. Much of the writing is about betrayal or being fed-up with someone once close to you.I'm guessing it will be years before this band does a bland album.You can watch them live on www.xfm.co.uk opening up for the Fiery Furnaces (I suggest listening/watching both shows)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product but not like old All-Clad","review":"Not as good as other All-Clad measuring cups and spoons.

This isn't your regular radio friendly, run-of-the-mill Kylie, this is Kylie Deconstructed.. all the best from her days with her Deconstruction lable. Some of her, if not totally her best work. Smooth vibes, deep beats, brooding synths, this is Kylie...chilled.For those of just recently turned on to Kylie, I'd recommend this collection along with her mainstream collection \\"Ultimate Kylie\\".

In an age where people need to get to local food rather than shipped food, this book is not the one to get. Its recipes require exotic ingredients grown in different parts of the world at different seasons.I found none of the receipes usuable for my local food needs and, indeed, my eating out of my garden needs. This book, for me, was a complete waste of money! It is a good buy for the upper income eschelons though, but for most of us, it is obsolete in an age of shipped food being too expensive to buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best whole grain book out there.","review":"I absolutely love this book.

I often describe this book to my clients as perhaps the turning point to understanding and appreciating what they observe others who lead a healthy & rich life talking about when we describe our love of food.The recipes are delicious, creative, and culturally diverse. Although, you will be searching for some uncommon ingredients depending on the recipe, it is an incredible opportunity to learn about food as well as slowly build up a well-stocked kitchen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that many practical recipes","review":"I ordered this book because other reviews spoke about the thorough descriptions of the grain and basic cooking instructions which I wanted. While those were great, there were very few recipes, and it only covered like 8 grains.

There were also only 3 quinoa recipes which was really disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Alternatives","review":"These boots have zero insoles whatsoever which make them extremely uncomfortable.

I was making this cake for a birthday luncheon of 20 women many who were not from here or even the south and I was embarrassed.It will be a long time before I use your book again and I will not recommend it as I feel I can not trust the recipes.

Sturdy. Stainless steel. The design is good. Not much curvature in the tines, but usable. Then I noticed that the tines were not sharp, even a little. I looked closer at the tines. The tips had been ground off flat with an electric grinder. There were heat discolorations at the tips from the rough grinding operation. It's not usable as received. It would be like trying to pierce meat with a flat punch or a screw driver.The tines are different sizes. One is larger than the other: an eighth of an inch longer and about a sixteenth of an inch wider. The outside surfaces are polished, but the inside surfaces of the tines are rough, as though from casting. The roughness and the flat tips would tear the meat, not penetrate smoothly.This shows very bad QC. Not what I expected from All-Clad, even if it is made in China. I may just use a file and a stone on it to make it usable. Or maybe just send it back. Probably the latter."},{"rating":"1","title":"check the review dates before you buy","review":"I sent it back. Something has changed since the glowing reviews of earlier years and the unhappy now. All-Clad used to be wonderful stuff. Now it seems there's a big change in quality. This fork has rough places, it's not smooth and perfect. And it's not nice-looking. No deal! I'll keep my well-made 40 year old cheap one with the pink plastic handle. The All-Clad stainless steel was meant to be a long-overdue upgrade. But I can't live with something so strange-looking, the tines too huge, the handle bulky and hulky in my hand. What really made me send it back instantly, however, was the fact that it would not stick to my magnetic strip for hanging utensils above the counter. Just be warned--apparently not all \\"stainless steel\\" will stick to a magnet.

When one mentions that it was a cargo airplane, people usually respond with a frown. \\"Why on earth would anyone want to hijack a cargo airplane?\\" they ask. Well, read the book and find out; it covers an amazing story. I found the book very difficult to put down -- just the kind I like.

The smaller size of this colander compared to others I've had actually works to it's advantage - it's easier to find room in the dishwasher for it and it fit's under my kitchen faucet better.

The 5 qt size gives us the capacity to handle any straining job, and although it has a high capacity, the Colander itself is the perfect size. Not too big and not too small.

I don't recommend viewing this due to the complete torture of boredom. But I think you should watch this if you hope to become a screen writer on what NOT to write. If they can make movies like this I have a bunch of scripts I think they should put together than would be block buster hits compared to this film. Just absolutely horrible.

The way Metheny has mastered the orchestral arrangements on this CD, shows me that he truly deserves the oft overused title of \\"musical genius\\".If you are a new fan, I would suggest starting with his early stuff (man, this guys be around a while!), and working your way up through the years. This way you can appreciate his musical growth. I plan to start buying ALL his music from his 1st to his last CD because I don't want to miss out on any of his musical splendor.

I am a music lover, I can appreciate almost anything but not this, I didn't experience any feeling or emotion while listening to it.

I think 'the truth will always be' is the best of the lot. The last 3 minutes of that song do it for me. Of course, the vocals on 'above the treetops'(if you want to call that vocals) is superb. That one is really calming. 'the longest summer' is also great.The music is soft and soothing. I could let it run and work and it would not invade but would just merge. The music has a very settling feeling about it. Somehow it clears my head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pictures in Music","review":"To find words to describe this album is indeed a difficult task. Pat takes us on journey through some of the most beautiful worlds with a masterpiece of modern music. At times, a symphony drives us through the landscapes which he creates. In other pieces, a couple of instruments provides the space to enjoy individual moments. Right from the start, the tunes are crafted with typical Metheny style. It is almost impossible to listen to just a few tracks as the whole album flows with such melody. Definitely less jazz than other recordings but nothing in the music is lost or missing.

The Harvest of Sorrow is one of my most indispensable books, as it documents the millions of Ukranians who were sacrificed on the altar of collectivization. After a lifetime of looking at depths of human depravity in the modern era, Conquest has written a sober, reflective work that lays the harvest of corpses at the feet of the twin radical ideologies of Communism and National Socialism. Finally, he is more than a \\"Eurosceptic,\\" being a scholar who is convinced that the European Union is not merely divisive, but doomed to failure. Conquest writes well and this book is full of insights that any student of history should enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hope this is not our future.","review":"An astoundingly shallow piece of work from a great historian. The work of bitterness wrapped in the guise of a pragmatic. Conquest's careful dissection of other societies can be quite convincing and penetrating. He, unfortunately, never manages to apply the same precision to his own thinking. The crux of every argument, and of the book as a whole, is \\"all great, megalithic ideals are bad except my great, megalithic idea.\\" He attacks with an imbalance that undermines his points. The book is a strange combination of intelligence and ideological bullying, which, unfortunately, makes the book almost pointless.

Hey, here's an idea--a full-length CD that includes ALL of the charted hits (such as Unborn Child, You're The Love, My Fair Share and Takin' It Easy). Better yet, why not a double CD anthology such as those by The Doobie Brothers, America and Bread--all Warner/Rhino releases? I know a box set would be too much to hope for. Oh well, I guess I'll just have to wait 'til September and get the reissues on Wounded Bird Records."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Decent But Lacking Collection From Seals & Crofts!","review":"I bought this album back in the mid-seventies when it was first released. It did contain most of the essential Seals & Crofts hits such as \\"Summer Breeze\\", \\"East Of Ginger Trees\\", \\"Hummingbird\\", \\"Diamond Girl\\" and \\"We May Never (Pass This Way Again)\\", etc., but Warner Brothers Records badly needs to release a more complete and remastered collection. As another reviewer mentioned the hit \\"Get Closer\\" is missing on this collection because it came out later. For a duo as popular as Seals & Crofts were in the seventies, the label should have remastered and released the cd's \\"Diamond Girl\\" and \\"Summer Breeze\\" (the one still in print has not been remastered) as well as a more complete hits collection! If Warner Brothers (Rhino) can release Jim Croce, America and Gordon Lightfoot remastered collections than they should do the same for Seals & Crofts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bring back Bill Inglot, this sucks.","review":"Rhino U.S. is seriously sucking lately with all this misleading slipcase re-bundling of old titles and no upgrading or extras. Even the UK cheap-o looking \\"Rhino Platinum\\" releases are putting some interesting first-time-to-cd tracks on. What is wierd to me is that Rhino Handmade is doing some really great releases (Buck Owens Warner Brothers stuff,\\"Atlantic Blues\\",ect) so clearly Handmade must be run by different folks. It's a sad state of affairs for this once great label. Hopefully poor sales on these titles will talk and Rhino will get it together again. A darn shame."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 Stars for their 2-part harmonies...","review":"Sure Seals & Crofts couldn't hold a candle to Simon & Garfunkel, but there's still no denying that this duo could write a tune and harmonize with the best of them. A nice example of their harmony is in the beautiful \\"I'll Play for You\\". And with songs like \\"We May Never Pass This Way Again\\" and \\"Summer Breeze\\", it's tough to give this collection a low rating--whether it has \\"Get Closer\\" or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seals and Crofts greateat hits, great!","review":"This cd bought back so many good memories.

If you have or remember these movies, you know there are some GREAT tunes by Seals and Crofts on these soundtracks. I really love the easy, laid-back country-tinged theme to \\"FOOLIN 'AROUND\\".

It only has 10 songs, like the original vinyl album had, and does not include their later hits like Closer To You. It is a shame that a comprehensive greatest hits collection has yet to be released for this duo, one of the top acts of the 70's.

There are so many tunes not on here that truely should be, this is what happenes when record companies get greedy and some cat in a suit who does not know the music makes the decision to put out a greatest hits Cd. Jim and Dash are great guys and I know first hand, I grew up jamming with them at San Fernando park in the San Fernando Valley.

I can hear all the S&C fans out there going, \\"Hunh? Never heard of it...\\" Actually, it's much better than just \\"worth listening to.\\" It's a great record. It sounds nothing like the over-produced AM radio garbage they're known for. The songs are unforgettable and the playing by the studio musicians is out of this world. John Hall (who also played on a lot of Bonnie Raitt's older albums and eventually fell from grace as leader of Orleans) lets loose one of the best guitar solos ever put on vinyl on the song \\"Leave\\". If you want to feel terrible about a S&C record not being available on CD, make it this one. I have exactly 5 lp records that I'm still hanging on to, down from a collection of thousands, and \\"Down Home\\" is one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"nostalgia, its only value...(and it isn't much)","review":"I own a lot of CDs just because they remind me of my am-radio/single-collecting days.

How will my partner and I resolve a fight? Do my parents like my partner? Will this dinner designed for couples go well. It's also hard to watch because the main character is so unique. Slotnick has a long oval face, a receding hairline, and layers of coarsely curled hair. I mean, he's not Steve Buscemi, but he's no Jude Law either!

The writing is sloppy, you can find a mysterious trumpeter Kinny Dorham (the name every jazz fan knows as Kenny), he forces Mr. Rollins to be born in 1929 pushing him one year back (he was born on 9/7/1930), attached sheet music contains a lot of errors and St Thomas is transposed half tone up.

On the Threshold of Hope is much kinder to survivors and offers more hope for healing and restoration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing. Same old secular stuff.","review":"Very disappointing. I was expecting a Godly analysis of abuse and a Godly approach to healing. This book provides neither.

If you are looking for a Godly book concerning emotional abuse I recommend \\"Finding Peace for Your Heart\\" by Stormie Omartian."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Helped Me Change My Life","review":"I read this book after nearly having a break-down in college. I remembered some instances of childhood sexual abuse that I had supressed. This book was a lifeline for me. I read it cover to cover, and always keep a copy to give to others. It is well-written, easy to understand, highly insightful, and if you employ the advice, life-changing.I found the chart on types and degrees of abuse very helpful. Too many of us minimize abuse and call it by some other name.I especially found the part about taking on different personality types helpful. It helped me understand some of my own confusing behavior, and it helped my then fiance, now husband, to understand and support me as well.If you have been abused, suspect you might have been, or know someone who has been, this book is for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The wounded heart by Dan B Allender","review":"This was the best book I have ever read because it deals with the unconscious effects of abuse and exposes the traps of the enemy and how to reveal healings in these areas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for victims and families","review":"This book has been very helpful in understanding my wife, who was raped.

Not only was I astounded at the way the book seemed to be speaking about my personality, my experiences, and basically my life, but everything was explained with a christian perspective. This book is great, and will help you understand yourself, or someone that you know that has been abused. I would suggest it to any abuse victims, and especially their parents or spouse, because they of all people will need to understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh well","review":"Freque pretty much summed it all up.

I would rather chew broken glass then listen to this cd again. Every song was cheezy. The mixxing was completly amature. There hardly any blending Just a bunch of slaming the crosfader over to the new song. If I were to have spun this cd it would've been the worst cd I ever did. The label reads something to the effect of best vocal trance from europe. I would hardly agree. The lyrics are like a 4th grader, with a SERERIOUS substance issue, in the early eighties wrote a couple of poems and they were made into trance songs.The best song ( in my opinion ) was on disk 2. The track was called falling its #4. Its sad though cause the lyrics have a really similar melody to Lange's- drifting, and its amazing how the beat and synths as a matter of fact the whole song sounds like a bad re-make of tiesto's - flight 646.Sad Sad cd... : (Shame on the producers and dj of this cd.But the cover looks really cool : )"},{"rating":"1","title":"A STUPID-ASS BOOK NOT WORTH READING!!!!!!!!","review":"THIS HAS GOT TO BE ONE OF THE WORST BOOKS I HAVE EVER READ IN MY LIFE....

However, I was a wee bit disappointed in one thing. I had a previous tape (lost it) of much of the same music, and the performers were less professional, meaning that the music gained in earthiness which I felt to be a plus. As this recording was done by professionals, it is lyric, musical, and lovely, but lacks that unsophisticated touch which I had liked. Still a very enjoyable recording, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"It beats the 11:35","review":"Fred, Doug, George, and Howie (James Garner, Howard Duff, Tony Randall, and Howard Morris) Share the commuter train daily to and from work.

Not a problem. I have had it two days and it is already my favorite pan. I made chicken Marsala for guests the first night and scrambled eggs for breakfast. One of the best things is that it is not only a cooking pan but a serving dish as well. Another point is that it takes less heat for cooking. Instead of turning on the burner at full power, I turn it to medium and I don't burn anything. No hot spots but a nice even heat over the entire pan. I will be proud to take this to our church's monthly potluck. It cleans up like a dream and is beautiful as well as making me look like a good cook. What more can I ask?"},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT Little pan, that holds a lot!","review":"LOVE THIS PAN. I received a much larger ALL-CLAD pan from my sister as a birthday gift, and was so impressed by it's performance, that I purchased this smaller pan. Two thumbs up! I love to cook, and have more cookware than I need, a lot of it non stick, but this was a must have for me. It's a great size, shape, and cleans up easily.

This is a very cheap, very basic drum throne that should probably satisfy most casual drummer's needs, though I certainly wouldn't recommend it for a professional.So why the two stars? The chair's construction is solid enough to sit on, but it wobbles a bit. There was also an element of added frustration when the drum-key-like screw that holds the seat in place refused to budge, no matter how hard I pulled on it.

I also can't stand Roy Dupuis (Micheal), the pretty boy trying to play tough guy. \\"The Operator's\\" talking with half a mouth aka Gretta Van Sustern is the final straw. Plots are boring and not up to the standards of other spy thriller shows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Struggling to understand what is so great about this show","review":"This show has the feel of a porn, except the porn. It's probably in the sets, the lighting, unrealistic situations that are too obviously made up, lack of believable emotions, simplistic dialog and predictable flow. There's very little story in a single episode with almost no twists or thrills. The characters are trying hard to be who they obviously are not. It's painfully clear that the main actress is there for her looks. Arguably the only unexpectedly pleasant part is that all girl-girl interaction has sexual undertones, but then it doesn't go anywhere ;)Makes you wonder how come there are so many good reviews here. So I looked. Seems like nearly all good reviews are from those who watched it when it aired (aside from that, a lot of good reviews are about DVD quality, prompt shipping, etc.).

I purchased season one based on all the good reviews posted here. Those people owe me $20. The concept for the show is the only good thing about it. The acting is terrible. I believe the sets are supposed to look futuristic, but they actually look silly. The director loves to use a great deal of close-up shots that really show the actors' lack of emotional range. The songs and musical score actually detract from the scenes rather than compliment them. The plots are fairly linear and when there are twists, they are so riduculous that it is comical. I purchased this set to watch at work when I'm bored. It's not even good enough for that.If you have never seen this show, Do not waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ack!

The acting.....well, I kept expecting to see some, but did not (except for Cassar's episodes, which were somewhat less offensive than the rest). The writing was juvenile, at best. The costumes were.....well.....atrocious. Who dressed these people?I made it through two disks of the first season, and elected to abandon this series.Upon further reflection, I'm downgrading this review to ONE STAR. Relative to other series on DVD, it is Just That Bad. The first few episodes, the lead \\"actress\\" couldn't even speak with a consistent accent, for crying out loud.

I know of three, Diana: People's Princess (hard to find but look for it), Diana & Dodi (the worst one of the bunch), and this one. Here you get a selection of scenes from throughout the Princess's life, even a few that I hadn't seen elsewhere on tape or DVD. The price is fantastic, the picture quality is good considering the source material. Not much to complain about except the editing, some material is arranged in an odd order or needs renarrated to give a stronger Diana angle. You get the usual crop of interviews from the usual people (just once I'd like to hear her really close friends), some material appears to be duplicated from the Prince William: Future King video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough old footage","review":"I was disappointed with this DVD because most of the footage seemed to have been filmed after Diana's divorce.

This is still a good quality, light weight hatchet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Hatchet","review":"I bought one of these from Home Depot (by the hammers) for about $30 several years ago. This is a fantastic hatchet. Durable, stainless, one piece forged. The handle has held up well. It looks beat up but is still comfortable to grasp.My use conditions: My hatchet has been used car camping, up north at deer camp, boy scout camps, summer camp, winter camp, fall camp, spring camp, anything and everything. Held up well.Best way I have found to use it is to embed the head in a piece of wood, and then whack the back of the head with another log. Splits everything. up to about 8\\" diameter x 16\\" long. It's a little rough to use to make shavings because of how narrow the head is...it gets awkward in your hand to use repeatedly that way, but for what I use it for, it's indestructible, believe me, Boy Scouts using other people's tools are a good test.I would recommend the product but I can't speak for the vendor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality hatchet, perfect for camping or for around the house","review":"I was very impressed with the solid construction of the ax and the nice leather grip.

There were a couple of minor imperfections with the grinding at the top of the handle - it looks like when the metal was polished up the leather was nicked a little. Other than this causing a minor breech in the finish of the handle that may weather poorly, these nicks are mostly cosmetic. I touched mine up with a tiny bit of clear nail polish just to make sure the leather doesn't get wet. Now you'd never notice it was blemished. I also touched up the cutting edge a bit before using it the first time. If you're just going to split kindling, the factory edge would've worked fine. I also spent some time oiling the sheath as it looked like untreated leather and I expect to use this tool a lot in the rain and in wet conditions.I would absolutely recommend this tool to anyone.

I'm not a great chef, but I enjoy cooking and like to have the best equipment. I bought these bowls because of the All-Clad name. They have not disappointed once. The handle is perfect for holding while whisking. I'm a big guy and the handle is definitely not too small. I also have found no issue with stability and I'm a klutz. They clean easy. They are lighter and easier to manage than glass bowls of the same size. They are solidly built and haven't dented or dinged from being dropped (though they are loud when they hit a tile floor). As with all All-Clad items, I don't mind paying the extra money to get them because I know that they last. A must have for anyone who enjoys cooking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty average mixing bowls, made in China","review":"These bowls aren't built any better than some of my cheaper $10 mixing bowls and these All-Clad bowls cost over $33 each. To me, that's unacceptable. I don't buy into the All-Clad hype. I have several All-Clad pots and pans, several Calphalon Contemporary pots and pans, and so on. I don't care if it's made in the U.S. or China but what I do care about is value and while the quality of these bowls is certainly acceptable, the price is too high for what you get (an All-Clad logo etched in the handle of a standard 18/10 stainless bowl.)These bowls used to be made better; I have some that I bought over 10 years ago and they were much better. These are your average, everyday mixing bowls."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tippi-tippi-tin NOT!","review":"The design is perfect. Although you want the bowl to be stable on the counter, the rounder the inside of the bowl the better, And the nearly round bottom is important because then the bowl and the whisk share the same profile enabling the whisk to do its job easily and well. These bowls also make good hats."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE WARRANTY TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE","review":"I had problems with a pan warping.

So I used the Internet to order the All-Clad set plus an extra bowl not offered as part of the set.Without comment, she reported that the bowls had arrived. By the time I visited her, 3 months later, I found that she had totally rejected the bowls mainly because she found the diameter of the base far too small. She felt, and I agree, that the size of the base creates a real problem by degrading the bowl's independent stability. I can easily visualize a bowl containing soft material or liquid tipping over if it's not held 100% of the time it's in use. And that is very difficult, if not impossible.I never even considered the possibility that All-Clad would create such an imperfect design in a product whose cost tacitly implied flawless production."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sound and broke within a year","review":"There is quite a bit of sound interference - white noise. Worst of all, the flexible electronic ear band broke and now hangs loose. This was without rough or even regular use.

Far superior to their earlier, home studio releases, \\"Bigger Than it Really Is ...\\" shows the Asheville-based funk-and-rhyme collective at their very best. Part socio-political epistle, part mountain rapper's proclamation, this album takes a giant toke from a fat blunt of genre-spanning funk spiked with the angsty-dust of urban hippie-hop. Tracks like \\"Asheville Smoke\\" and \\"A Thought\\" show the group's talents at combining live music elements with their deft wordplay and ganja-driven sound. In fact, the smoky cut \\"Everybody Get High\\" was even rolled from the hands of funk master George Clinton himself."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent for family teaching activities","review":"somehow we managed to lose our copy of this book when we lived in samoa. i have been trying to find another copy ever since. it is the best book i have read on activities that parents and even kids themselves can do to illustrate wonderful principles of spiritual living...very hands on stuff that the kids love. i've gotta find another copy!!! it's perfect for family home evenings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb and Dumber","review":"This story is the dumbest story I've ever read.

This book discusses these people and their views.I suppose being a ww2 buff, I have read almost all this before so I did not learn much new on the subject. Still I found many of the comments interesting. There are some interesting comments on Holocaust denial which started even when it was taking place. You can also see how little even top officials played in the decision making in the Reich.What is also a major thread throughout the book of what exactly caused the defeat of the Nazi regime. I suspect here the writer feels the Allied bombers played a much greater part in this then most historians today give it credit.If you are interested in this subject I recommends another book too \\"22 Cells in Nuremberg by Douglas M Kelley MD\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Overy Misses the Point Big Time","review":"Actually, the Nuremberg Trials were a complete sham in terms of following international law and legal procedures and unfortunately Overy just adds to the sham. Basing their evidence upon a prisoner's interrogation, who will say anything to his interrogators to save his own skin, was pretty outrageous and illegal in its own right. In fact, the unusual rules that these allies implemented for the trial could be applied against our leaders who conducted the Vietnam War. But the biggest tragedy of the Nuremberg Trials was the myths it had created and has sustained about what really happened in Germany and why."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD Player","review":"Received promptly in good shape.

I tried to contact Sony for warranty service, but I was told that they only cover labor for 3 months and parts for a year. Since I am just outside the 3-month window, I will have to pay $40 plus shipping to have it repaired. I am very disappointed at the quality of this product as well as the warranty term.

Suzzane not only survived abuse as a child and young woman but has the guts to write about her ordeal and that of her siblings. She must have gone through hell revisiting her past to write this book so that she may help others. Suzzane found the will-to-live through the music of the BCR's and a school-girl crush on their singer Les Mckeown. Like all survivors she grabbed at that 'life raft' and held onto it with all her might.Suzzane is an 'inspiration'.

We were given just the telephone for my daughter's first birthday and she is now 15+ months old and still plays with it for a long time. Then when we were out, I saw the \\"keys\\" at a local retailer and bought those also. She loves the keys too. Previously, when she would play with my keys, she kept (on purpose) pushing the \\"panic\\" button on my car keys and the alarm would keep going off. So now she can press the buttons on this key set and get to hear varous sounds. I typically take both of these items out of the house, for her to play with when she has to be in the stroller or somewhere like a waiting room. I'm actually thinking about buying the set so that I can keep one set in the house and the other in the diaper bag. I know some reviewers have listed some problems.

Yes, my one-year-old likes to toss them around, but I doubt she's any rougher than any other one year old!

The \\"recording\\" part on the phone is a joke - it's very fuzzy and you can't really understand what you recorded, even though it's usually your own voice!Do yourself a favor - give your child an old cell phone and an old set of keys. It'll cost you nothing, and your child will probably play with them more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cell Phone","review":"I purchased the cell phone for the primary purpose of using the recording feature to share \\"Grandma's Voice\\". The quality is unbelievably poor. The cell phone does what it is advertised to do, but the voice quality is almost unusable. There is a lot of background tone that almost drowns out the voice. We ended up just tapping a rhythm on the phone so the baby can at least listen to a drum sound! I would NOT purchase the phone again. The keys are ok.

The phone must have a short in it, because the recordings sound awful, you cannot understand them at all. Also, whenever we change the batteries the whole phone goes dead, that is why I am thinking it has a short in it, and that is how it came. The keys however are great. But to pay this price to only have the keys work is ridiculous. I am looking to see if a return or exchange is in order here.

Springsteen and Nirvana, to just name a few.Tesla's Five Man Acoustical Jam is not your typical live album. With this cd you can tell everybody's having a goodtime. The band and the fans are really enjoying themselves, not taking things to seriously. The intimatcy of the performance is great. Many highlights from Tesla's first two albums and great oldies covers make this a great cd.Tesla turns Five Man Electrical Band's \\"Signs\\" into their own song. What a great rendetion.

Your best bet is to just get solid dumbbells with the weight already set for you. It requires a little more room. However, if space isn't that big of an issue for you then get what I just requested. The price is relatively the same and you can quickly determine if you need more/less weight during sets in case you need to make a switch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Apex Threaded Dumbbell Handles","review":"The handles are nice but I was expecting the rubber to be fixed over a solid center. Instead it is a thick rubber piece that slides over the threads. I just hope the rubber doesn't break due to the pressure of the weights when you tighten the nuts. Also the nuts have sharp edges that can cut your skin. I got a minor cut myself. It would be nice if the manufacture made a better smother finish on the nuts and if the handles should have had a solid higher center covered with rubber so that there would be no pressure on the rubber possibly minimizing it's useful life span."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good","review":"i bought these dumbells because i needed the collars, but i try to used the whole dumbell instead and there terrebile. Your hand well be scrushed between the weight on each side of the dumbell. the rubber doesn't protect much, your better off bujying the dumbells without the rubber."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value","review":"A very nice pair. Good grip (probably vinyl), good screws, sufficient width (discounting space for the screw, it can hold about 5 standard 2.5 lb plates on each side).Each bar weighs 5 lbs and the plates sit firmly. Bought 2.5 lb plates from nearby store and 1.25 lb plates (for small increments) from a web site. They all fit perfectly since its a standard 1\\" hole. With this setup, i can have any weight from 5 to 30 lbs (depending on the plates, you can have much more).Great value for the price! Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"No rubber. No protection.","review":"I've opted to return this item since the handle bars are I received are not actually covered in rubber... i want to keep my hands soft like a babies behind. ... like real manly baby hands. But seriously, there was no rubber on the handles, just textured steel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"At first, these were great. They were comfortable to hold and worked as advertised... However, every time they are tightened, the soft plastic grips get compressed. I've had mine for about three months and they are at the point that they are unusable for me. They've been compressed so much that I can no longer hold them with weights attached. I had to buy dumbbell bars with metal grips.Please take my advice and don't buy these. They're junk and you'll regret it when you're eventually replacing them."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent product","review":"Buy this with some of the Standard Flat Plates, or whatever plates you want, and you get an excellent cheap weight set. The grip is good, but by no means perfect.The only problem is that the grip is too flexible. The plates will tilt slightly, but this is tolerable, especially for the low price. Hence the 4-star rating. For the price, this product is easily 5 stars, but to give this 5 stars is to pretend that it is perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent value","review":"These dumbbells perform well, and the rubber grips are a nice touch, particularly with relatively heavier weight loads. Because of the rubber grips, I find I need to slightly hand tighten the spin locks a bit just before use (takes about one second). Otherwise, long term overtightening can cause some distortion of the rubber handles. The rubber grip helps keep them from loosening up as quickly as other spin lock curl bars I've used, so the weights don't start to spin around in the middle of your repetitions.Anyway, these items work as well as can be expected with no unpleasant surprises, and if you shop around I think you will find them a very good value for $25, particularly if you take advantage of the super saver shipping option."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"These handles are really nice to use, they'll easily hold three plates, which are readily available at my local sports store. The cushioned handles make them very comfortable. My only gripe is that the cushioned part has a tendency to \\"move along\\" the rod which results in the plates being a bit lopsided I think it happens because I haven't tighted the locks evenly on each side. The \\"cushions' though are easier enough to move back to center. This is a good product at a good price, I would buy again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pissed_junky!!","review":"First the box the handles came in was beat up and appeared to have been previously opened because it had tape all around the openings.The handles weren't even coated in rubber like the description mentioned.The paint was already chipping off right after opening the package.The screws wouldn't tighten properly and would come loose really easily. I briefly set the bars with weights attached for a minute and once i picked them up the weights were already loose!!Don't waste your money on these even if they seem like a good deal, the reason they are so cheap is because the product is crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppy threads","review":"I gave this two stars because they hold the plates. However, the nuts are threaded very poorly. They do not mate well with the threaded bar. Although I was able to tighten them on my weight plates, I am concerned that I could easily overtighten them and strip them. I typically use 40 pounds per bar, so I am concerned about injury if the nuts fail. I saw a similar review for the Gold's Gym dumbbell bars (Gold's Gym Dumbbell Handle) and I bought these instead. It looks like it's the same sloppy manufacturing for these as well. I would recommend that you get something from another manufacturer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings back the memories!","review":"I love this book.

Mind you, I have nothing against \\"new Aersomith\\" or \\"Hit songs\\" and in fact think G.A.G.'s follow up, 9 lives, and the new Just Press Play are two of their best albums. Get a Grip has a few high points (Eat the Rich, Get a Grip, Amazing, Walk on Down) but it never really works as an album. The band sounds as if it wants to do something other than what their label was forcing them to do and the result sounds like a lot of filler. With few exceptions, the Joe Perry factor (bombastic, loud, swankey guitar rock) is at a minimum. If your looking for examples of what makes later-day Aerosmith great look to Just Press Play, 9 Lives or PUMP before stopping here. Better yet sit down with the older albums Get Your Wings, Toys in the Attic, or Rocks.

Ofcourse Aero's hard-rock is among the very best of the planet, but you can't deny that they can do good ballads,too.It's not sell out,they do it just cos they are gifted.

The lead singer danced around while the guitars thrashed incomprehensibly. The bassist seemed pretty talented, though.Anyway, from the performance I saw, I came to this conclusion:If you hate all bands who have \\"sold out\\" because their fan base is larger than 6 people (including you and the bandmembers), then this band should be right up your noncomformist alley.Otherwise, steer clear of B.A.T.

I then tried to withhold judgement until seeing them open for SOAD and Mars Volta, hoping they would be better live. Wrong again! The rest of the crowd seemed to share my sentiment and just stood around while they went through their set. These guys shouldn't be allowed to share a stage with SOAD and Volta!

It is approximately seven inches thick as described, but I can feel the slats underneath the mattress already (I am of average weight for a grown adult male). It appears to be a recycled material inside. I took the risk of going the cheaper route and I do regret it. I bet we'll be replacing this mattress within three years if it's used regularly.On a different note it was packaged appropriately. It arrived in a very timely fashion.

It's appropriate at first was slipping down because of the thickness of the mattress so i noted my futon was assembly the wrong way and after I flip the bar everything was working beautiful and I LOVE IT .

It is barely tolerable on a futon in \\"couch-mode\\", but as a bed it is lumpy and you can feel every contour of the futon slat through it. I wouldn't subject any guests to this mattress, at least not guests that I like. I would strongly recommend avoiding this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy but moldable","review":"A nice and solid mattress, the only downside to it is that even though it is very firm it tends to settle and pick up the shape of whats beneath it quickly. If you have a metal bar futon, the bars will start to be feelable through it relatively soon unless you move it a lot to keep it from settling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfiest thing imaginable for the first three months","review":"As mattresses go, I can swear by this one. It delivered fast and without hassle, it was obscenely comfortable, it fit the frame we have perfectly, and the price could not be beaten. I could not be happier with it.The only downside (and the sole reason for my four star rating) is that a few months along it has already lost some of its fluffiness. It is by no means in the condition of the mattress it replaced, but the constant up and down of a group of ~200 lb. guys using it as a couch during the day has rendered it merely comfortable and not a divine surface of sleep inducing glory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy,Happy,Happy!","review":"I read a review on another mattress and decided to buy this one.Cant say enough...

Mine also arrived in rolled up in plastic and tied with twine. The plastic was covered in grease, as others have mentioned.I'm disappointed because it is pretty rough, and very difficult to keep repositioning. I never use it.

I called Sony to see if I could just buy a new optical drive, and I could, but it would cost $90..

A few days ago it just stopped mounting DVDs. The discs were being spun, but nothing more. My cheapie Cyberhome and Presidian players have lasted much longer. My Toshiba lasted 7 years.

When hooking this dvd player up to a SONY digital reciever via a digital coax cable, I get absolutly no sound what-so-ever. Way to go sony for building a dvd player with less connections that doesn't even work with your own existing equipment.

This player also will not turn off automatically.

Folks, these were originally broadcast as two mini-series of five episodes each. The \\"movie\\" versions came later and omitted material broadcast when the shows first aired. Thankfully, the folks at Rhino know better than some self-proclaimed fans. The two \\"G.I.

We go through life trying to shield ourselves from the inevitabilities of disappointment, death, and decay, at the same time insulating ourselves from joy and from the needs of others. Rabbi Lew focuses on the time from Tisha B'Av, the fast day commemorating the destruction of the Second Temple and other tragedies, to Sukkot, the harvest holiday where we acknowledge our vulnerabilities and celebrate joyfully in roofless shacks, having examined our lives, admitted our brokenness, forgiven slights against us and also forgiving ourselves. With additional Buddhist perspective that never falls into Buddhism Lite, this is a profound book that should be read over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"While this dvd does show some uncommon medicine ball exercices. It is NOT worth more then 10 bucks. It is very low budget quality. You can see that it was made with medicore Imac software. It is also dragging.

My chest is about 30 inches, and when i do dips, my chest barely touches the seat. So if the handles were even half a foot longer, that would of been great. Also, i feel that there could of been a little more padding on the seat, but its nothing too bad. Overall, its acceptable for me. I'm only 110 pounds though.

I am looking forward to many yrs to keep my back in shape and loose the next 10 lbs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too wobbly","review":"The \\"seat\\" section is not very sturdy. It wobbles. We have it as tight as we can, and it just shakes. Too much money for that kind of quality..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does exactly what it's supposed to.","review":"This bench was the cheapest one I saw on Amazon, so I was a bit skeptical, but it's actually well made and very stable! I don't have a single complaint about it. It only has the one function, but I gave it five stars because it's a great deal for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chair even a roman can love","review":"Well built and adequate for its purpose. Assembley was straight forward and went off without a hitch. Satisfied, no complaints and well worth the money. Would have given 5 stars, but its not an expensive top of the line unit and should not be percieved as such. Still a great value!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock solid bargain","review":"This bench is very sturdy. I weigh about 200lb and it doesn't flex or wobble at all when I do back extensions or obliques. It was packaged well, arrived in a couple of days even with free super saver shipping, and was not too difficult to assemble."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for home gym!","review":"I have been using the Apex Roman/Hype Extension Bench for a few weeks now and it has exceeded my expectations! As the rest of the reviewers have mentioned it is built of very high quality materials and very sturdy. I weigh 190lbs and did an abdominal exercise where I leaned all the way back so essentially all my weight was on the back end of the equipment. I was a little apprehensive that it would tip over but it barely moved at all!Setup was very easy and took me about 30 minutes.For the relative price of this (I got it for around $75) I dont think it can be beat! And it definitely beats out any of the ab rollers/ab balls that you can get for not too much less expensive.Perfect for the home gym for those who want more of a strenuous workout than the ab rollers can provide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great GHD!","review":"This is a great and sturdy product. I really can't believe how cheap it is compared to some others (check out GHD's online or at Rogue Fitness). It supports me, 6'1\\" 205lbs., just fine with no wobbles or even a hint of being unsafe. I thought that the lack of bottom foam roller to hold my feet might be an issue, but it is not at all because you are constantly putting pressure on the foam roller that is included when you are using it. Well worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh - does the job I suppose","review":"You get what you pay for. I always seem to be relearning that lesson over and over. All of the connecting joints are non-orhtoganol to point of absurdity. I can do the exercise I need to, but 15 degree offsets in the frame necessitate shims underneath it, and I expect to be exceptionally strong along one side of my back. Next time I'll pry the extra sheckles from my wallet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff!","review":"Completely satisfied and recommend to everybody. Did not expect such quality for less than 70$! Easily put together and transported to office where i can practice whenever i want!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Item is fine but try to be more careful guys...","review":"When I got this thing the screws where all over the place and the box looked like some kinda animal was chewing at the corners. Either the people at the warehouse or ups just taped it up the outside and sent it along. I had to go to Homedepot to get the last few nuts that were missing. I didn't send it back because it was only 2-3 bolts and washers and that cost a total of maybe a buck or more. When the Bench was put together it works fine for sit-ups and back extensions. I weight about 280 lbs and it felt like it was going to tip over on me the first time I used it but everyone else said that it was solid. I've at this point had it and have used it for maybe a month now and there are no other problems as of this date 1-23-2012."},{"rating":"2","title":"Roman Chair","review":"Good solid value for the money.

But it's not very usable.The chair/pad doesn't interface well with male anatomy (I am 5' 10\\").I don't understand why the foot bar moves up and down-- it would be impossible to use this with the foot bar at any position other than the highest one-- and I wish that it went a little higher.Here is what would be helpful: if you could adjust the distance between the foot bar and the chair/pad, a feature that you will find on 100% of roman chairs at the gym.Maybe I don't understand the range of exercises that can be done with it? It comes with no suggested exercises, and I have never heard of any being done on a roman chair other than back extensions -- so I doubt that is the problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not appropriate for all body types-disappointed.","review":"Was looking so forward to this fitness pc for my gym but unknownst to me it was not fitting for someone as petite sized as i could not hyper extend over bench as too wide so had to immediately pay more than three times the shipping they sent it to me for to have it returned.

It just did not work for me being under 5\\"3'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Apex extension bench","review":"I am used to using a 45 degree extension bench at my gym and thought it would be useful to have one at home. The one I have previously used (and love) has a footrest near the floor with a heel plate to keep your legs down. You then easily lean over the padded bench itself and flex forward. It is easy to use and comfortable. Unfortunately, the Apex unit forces you to lean over the padded bench and then hook your legs under the footrest which sits well above the ground. It is very awkward to get into this position and lean forward. Also, I wish the front frame legs were wider to make it a bit more stable. It can be used and is a great price, but I would have rather paid more for a different unit had I been able to find one. Also, it is a bit short for someone over 6 ft."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far so good.","review":"I am so surprised by the quality of this product that I felt the need to create a review. I never purchase cheap when it comes to exercise equipment, but I just couldn't bring myself to spending a couple hundred just for hyper extensions!So far I am very happy I took a chance. It provides exactly what I require and would recommend it to anybody who is looking for something similar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy construction, small bench","review":"This bench is a bit of a joke, unfortunately. Having put the bench together myself, I can tell you the most flimsy part of the bench is the part you sit on: It's particle board wrapped in thin vinyl sitting on two VERY small pieces of metal, balanced over the main structure. I feel foolish for buying this bench.Between the shoddy construction and the fact that the bench is supposedly rated for a MAXIMUM TOTAL WEIGHT OF 300lbs -- INCLUDING YOU AND THE WEIGHT YOU'RE LIFTING, I think it would be a mistake to purchase this.The maximum width of this bench is only 3 feet. It's narrow. And small."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is fun..","review":"I actually like this bench. I have to be honest that it is slighty poorly constructed and holds only 300lbs but it works as a bench for me. I am currently piecing together a home work-out gym. This is a great addition but it will need to be replaced in the future.If you are looking for a bench that you can prop up in your living room instead of playing video games this is a nice purchase. It's a weak in certain areas such as the leg curls and the preacher curl but it has 2 inclines, level, and I can decline it too.Short and sweet essay:Cheap mans bench. Functional but you will need to replace it later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Phenomenal","review":"Simply put, this is one of my favorite albums of all time.

Nothing too obscure here, just solid tunes that cold rock the party - with a twist. The mix starts with an indie-fied reworking of summer jam favorites Nina Sky, weaves into some early electro, New Wave, and proto-techno, and then parks itself into a lengthy mash-up of Brazilian favela funk and grime. The Cure usher in the punk-funky final act that makes a brief detour into classic Detroit booty. The ghetto fabulous refrain of \\"uh, oh, work it, work it!\\" should bring a smile to anyone familiar with the club and radio scene in the 313 during the late 90's. By connecting the dots between seemingly-disparate subgenres that in fact trace their roots to that most fertile of moments in pop music, the late 70's-early 80's, Diplo is truly one of the new generation of DJ/producers that \\"gets it.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of old and new","review":"I have to give Diplo props for putting together such an ecclectic mix that delivers on all levels. All the old school party jams from the eighties infused with current hip hop and latin flavors shows how diverse his musical tastes are.

If you want a fresh musical experience that is guaranteed to get the party going pick this up."},{"rating":"1","title":"The FabricLive Series Disappoints Again","review":"Although Fabriclive and Fabric albums are obviously suppose to differ in regards to being truely live recorded sets versus pure studio sets(that may or may not have be modelled after a set that the featured artist or DJ actually played at the fantastic London-based club), there sure is an overwhelming difference in quality between the two major series overall. Sure, Fabriclive is live, and therefore will sound a little more raw, but that is not the issue with the majority of Fabriclive's albums. The artists, DJs, and more importantly their sets are terrible! Diplo is no exception. I may have electronica genre preferences which guides (with some bias) my music collection, I do still try to sample a little from each genre and subgenre whenever possible.I had a hard time listening to this ablum in its entirity.

The film is funny because the story and actors are funny.

Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pancakes!!!","review":"After one use, I am very satisfied by this griddle. My Calphalon griddle non-stick coating was worn out and needed replacement. This was the only product that met the requirements: full two-burner size - anything smaller is not and anything much larger is too big to fit. Heavy enough construction to not warp, handles that are accessible - many griddles' handles stick out to the sides making them useless, or have none at all. Price is acceptable - I'm not paying much more that $100 for this; it is simply not worth it.This is actually better than the old griddle in one important way - the cooking surface is only slightly convex. Oil will not immediately run off to the sides like with the Calphalon. That was always my biggest complaint with it.I see nothing here after one use that I would change in any way except that it, like everything else anymore, is made in China instead of here at home. :-("},{"rating":"2","title":"Used this griddle at my sister's house last week.","review":"On a week-long golf trip to California, four of us stayed at my sister's home and used this griddle every morning to make breakfast.

The non-stick coating works great plus stuff really gets nice and crispy on it unlike some non-stick surfaces.

Ot shows that love does not have to be all sex, and shows that a novel can be a work of art without all those off color words. The book is entertaining, educational, and a monument to love. This would make a wonderful gift for everyont."},{"rating":"2","title":"Written From the Heart","review":"This is a beautiful story which will wrench the emotions of the reader, pulling them into the story with Julie Hunter. Julie faces her impending death in the battle with lupus with great strength and courage. With a husband who refuses to face the seriousness of her illness, and a daughter about to become a mother, Julie focuses her energy toward reaching her dream of a college degree. As the disease rages forward with breathtaking speed, she finds compassion where she least expects it. Don Lipton, professor and intimidator of students, is mired in guilt for a tragedy which happened twenty years earlier. Julie is the student who refuses to be intimidated, searching instead for the secrets which haunt his soul.Barbara Jeanne Fisher weaves her story by pulling these two unlikely souls together in a love story that does not cross the boundaries of betraying vows. Through her own struggles with Lupus, Barbara writes from the heart a story of \\"Stolen Moments\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stolen Moments","review":"I love all books but I must admit this was the worst book I have read in a long time. Talk about predictable! It was sort of like being at the scene of an accident...knowing I should look away but also experiencing the need to know what in the world is going on. Boring...boring...boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be rated no stars","review":"I can't believe the five and four star reviews for this book.

It's virtually unreadable. Definitely not what it purports to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE BEAUTIFUL BOOK!","review":"I started to read Stolen Moments as a favor to a friend of mine. She insisted I at least give it a try. I did! For the next day and a half I was burried in the book, I became one of the characters, and I had every emotion within me brought to life. I laughed and then I cried. Don Lipton reminded me of one of my past professors, and Julie is very much like myself. .It was exciting to see their relationship turn to love. So many books go to extreme measure to relate sexual encounter, but this was love in it's truest form, and ever so pure. I would suggest this book to anyone who wants to be reminded how precious life is/ and how soon it can be gone. Great job, Ms Fisher, hope you have another book soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic, Enlightening Work","review":"It's been a while since I read this book (in Fall 2002), but I remember being highly surprised with what it taught about how the contemporary, taken-for-granted ideological practices of cleanliness (daily bathing, soap, house cleaning), etc., came into being during the time period discussed, and how class and race (racism) functioned -- more blatantly then -- to promote certain practices and consumer products to the point that they now are often assumed to be \\"universal\\" and go unquestioned in terms of their historical development. Additionally -- and not mentioned in the reviews -- is the discussion of resulting fetishizations, particularly in the accounts of certain historical persons. It's a fascinating read, and includes hard visual evidence of the racist advertising that promoted certain practices and products that have continued from the colonial past to today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unconvincing","review":"The 3 leading ladies had no chemistry what so ever, even when the 3 dare share a bubble bath. The oldest daughter Tilden was the most hateful and unlikable girl I have ever seen. Not one convincing smile crossed her bland face. The lack of chemisty however had nothing to do with actress Elizabeth Perkins who is always a joy on screen. Also Scott Bakula was good too. It all boils down to heavy handed melodrama at it's dullest."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Girls Learn","review":"Scott Bakula is great in this and the rest of the cast, especially the oldest daughter, are also outstanding.

But this movie is so well acted by youngsters who later become top stars in their own right---and Elizabeth Perkins' super performance as a quirky mom---I loved it. Good actors make good movies. This story-line is based upon Karin Cook's first novel and it's full of humor,fun, sadness and interesting characters. Also, it tells the story about a guy who didn't run away when things got tough. (Yeh, there are good guys out there.)

The main character, Veronica, was too self-centered, especially at the begining. During the attack on pearl harbor, all she worried about were her two boyfriends. When she heard of a great tragedy, the sinking of the ship one of her boyfriends is on and the deaths of most of the sailors, all she cares is about her boyfriend, not the other innocent people who died. A dissapoinment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Veronica- A dissapointment","review":"Veronica is the only Sunfire book I did not like. It was all about a selfish, spoiled girl and I hated it.

A truly inspirational, witty, uplifting and downright spiritual work, I've read it more than once and found something a little miraculous for me in each reading. For anyone with a heart, this book is well worth owning. If \\"Diary for Nicholas\\" touched your soul, \\"Mike's World\\" will take you places only a powerfully written non-fiction book can.This is clearly NOT a book about a challenged child, but a book that will make you see everyone around you differently. The most powerful 148 pages I've read in many, many years!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Book Celebrating Life and Determination","review":"Patricia Leary's son Mike is brain damaged, but neither she nor Mike have let his handicap deter them from making their lives together as mother and son full of joy, love, and humor. While the author relates stories of her little boy's growing up challenged by limited motor skills and sight, achievement and success and the indomitable spirits of the duo are the focus of each chapter. Their inspiring story will have meaning not only for parents of handicapped children, but for all parents because the task of raising any child is filled with questions, worries, joy, success, and pride. All parents and children are the same, and Patricia Leary's portrait of Mike will inspire every reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"All-Clad Stainless 3-Quart Double-Boiler Insert","review":"Fits the 3 quart pot perfectly, lid fits it well. Steams the heck out of foods a person wants steamed. As with other All-clads I think the handle is about two inches too long. Makes storage a bit of an issue requiring more precise placement in the roll out shelf drawers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't fit my All-Clad pots!","review":"I would have been delighted with this double boiler insert (despite the groove noted by previous reviewers) if it had performed as expected. I own three All-Clad LTD pots I should have been able to use it with : 3 quart, 4 quart and 5 quart. The insert doesn't fit the pots precisely or snugly; it slips and tips when set onto the pots. Obviously, this makes it unsafe as well as unusable. Since I agree with some reviewers that the qualty is inferior to All-Clad products produced in the USA, I guess it may be that the items produced in China are not really a good match with the original items produced before recent globalization of the company. Maybe I just got a bad one, but a previous reviewer mentioned the same problem. For an item of that price from a company with the reputation of All-Clad, this is inexcusable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shotstar Is AMAZING!","review":"This is Travis, not Michael. But anyway. Shotstar is Amazing! Saw them for the first time at a show w/ The Juliana Theory in Tucson and I haven't stopped listening to them since. The CD opens w/ \\"My Luck Dragon\\" which is a great opener, and then comes \\"God Bless This Mess\\" which is my favorite song by them. Go check it out on MP3.com if you haven't yet. Other standout songs are \\"All On My Own' (great acoustic w/ incredable {sp?} lyrics), \\"A Boy Can Dream\\", and \\"Falling In Love\\". I let my friends borrow this CD and they all like it a lot, my school is tagged w/ their stickers (well not so much since the janitor takes them down), and I see them live every chance I get.. You know your band is doing good if kids are coming on their own to see YOUR shows. These guys are amazing live, so don't miss out on it! And get this CD now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"fun with local bands","review":"It is fairly difficult to find a bunch of boys in Tucson with pants so tight that they must break out the tighty whiteys, but shotstar seem to manage every time. Whether you see them on stage or just listen to their fairly succinct cds over and over, you will never be disappointed with their ability to rock it hardcore. Unlike the above critic, I would rather listen to \\"what the hell is rock and roll\\" than \\"pinkterton\\" any day. So buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I know theyre local but......","review":"IM sorry, but shotstar makes bad music. They are merely an imitation of the great \\"emo\\" bands listed above in the editorial review.

I read all of the reviews and took a chance. Unfortunately if it sounds to good to be true, it probably is. I tried several batches, each time trying something different (different starters, adding milk powder, leaving it in longer than 9 hours, etc). The unit just doesn't get warm enough to make yogurt. I am going to try to return it and purchase a different unit. Good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"good for making buttermilk","review":"I bought this product based on good reviews, but have not been able to make good yogurt with it after 5 attempts. I have spoken to the manufacturer on the phone, and they admit this product is \\"tempermental\\" and needs to be experimented with to find out the best combination of milk and starter. I have tried various combinations of whole milk, goats milk, powdered starter, yogurt starter (Dannon and Brown Cow), and milk powder, and out of my 5 batches only 1 thickened up, after I left it to process for 20 hours, and it came out tasting very tart.

They especially love the rewards. I do agree with another reviewer about how big they write the letters. But that's perfect for my boys. This gets them excited about learning there letters and making them on their own. Plus, it doesn't take your child long to complete the activities. Both kids completed the workbooks in 3 months.I would recommend this set for the earlier ones. Over 5 maybe to old, due to writing the letters big. Even though our kids completed the sets. They still like to get out the workbooks and practice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irreverent? More Like Irritating...","review":"Being a long-time Seattle-dweller, and even longer-time Western Washington native, this book irritates me. The author hasn't spent enough time in Seattle to truly appreciate the wonderful things about the city, not to mention he consistently dates both himself and the text by referring to events/people/places that are no longer in rapid use in the Seattle vernacular/mindset. Seattle is about MORE than coffee, grunge (ugh.. could that irritating phase have passed more quickly?), Microsoft, Boeing and rain. I'd recommend the Fodor's and Lonely Planet series to anyone who really wants a good feel for the city. Fodor's may be snooty, but at leats it's up-to-date instead of dated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended for using small piece at a time","review":"I bought this to dress a small fissure on my toe on an extended daily basis.Deceptively, the wrapper is a polished-metal foil finish plastic which curls open rather than lending itself to folding up or flattening like a metal foil would."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Product","review":"My 88 year old father injured his arm and his physician bandaged it with the 5x9 xeroform dressing.

At first we did not think we would find much of a use for it.

If you want a real thing - look elsewhere!","review":"I am studying singing, and so far I have had quite a success. My mentor is Jamie Vendera, and I study mostly by his books/CDs. However, I also wanted to see what else is out there as far as singing tutorials go. I picked up quite a few different books, CDs, DVDs. Some of them were quite interesting and challenging. However, this set is far from being really useful, in my opinion. It is so basic that it hurts that I paid for it. It is not taught by any professional singers, rather, by kids! And, those kids don't sound that well either (some of them were just okay, some were just so-so). So, if you'd like to get some useful material to study and learn how to sing properly I would suggest to look elsewhere. My personal recommendations: all books by Jamie Vendera, Hard Rock Academy Performance Vocals DVD, Singing for the Stars: A Complete Program for Training Your Voice (Book & 2 CD's) by Seth Riggs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give this one a pass!","review":"I don't know what's more annoying about this book, the chirpy tone or the moronic advice. Not only are the tips all over the map, but they are just that--tips--with no help at all given to developing an overall philosophy or strategy. Loeb also completely ignores the emotional aspect of financial planning, leading to ridiculous advice like taking out a home equity loan to pay off credit card bills. Sure you can reduce your rate by doing that. But you're likely to run your cards up again. And now you've put your house at risk. Real smart move, Marshall.I'm so grateful that I checked this book out of the library rather than spending good money on it. My advice: Almost any other basic personal finance book would serve you better than this one. A couple of good ones that deal with the emotional and the practical aspects of financial planning are Suze Orman's, Ruth Hayden's, and Jerrold Mundis'. Don't waste your time with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"LAME AS HELL!","review":"I love ghost story, as movies or documentary and so on...because all these hip an all and stars, I go head and got this DVD.

You're supposed to stumble into that secret passage way in the dark corner, not spot it from across the room.If you want a passive experience, watch a movie.If you must do this kind of thing - and neglect yourself of the developers' vision - just crank up the brightness on your TV, most also have a sharpness control too."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLLLLLEEEAAASSSE!!!!!","review":"Who would even invent such a useless piece of plastic.

He has successfully and dilectically researched the History of Ethiopia from different angles to prove his philosophical discourse. Some of us who are familiar with Ethiopian history are amazed in his ability to uncover those deep seated traits of the Etiopian mind and use his philosophical discourse to analyze them.It is a powerful book, especially for Ethiopians and other nations, who are experiencing some kind of identity crisis in the national level.

I have two and using both at once allowed me to be very efficient in the kitchen. A few months later though, they are rusted over, disgusting and impossible to clean, with no nonstick surface to speak of. All-clad's warranty is completely worthless. They insist that you send them the pans for inspection AT YOUR EXPENSE. If they decide the problem is a result of a covered defect they will replace them and ship you new ones AT YOUR EXPENSE AS WELL. These are heavy pans! If they decide not to replace the pans they will send you back yours, you guessed it, at YOUR EXPENSE as well. By the time you are done sending the pans back and forth you might as well buy new ones, from another company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this pan, even heat, easy clean up","review":"Looked all over for a thick and solid grilling pan that would fit across two burners.

It was so easy to clean. She uses it in her oven as a broiler rack with her electric oven. The broiler trays that come with most ovens are not that easy to clean, even when using a grilling spray. I liked it so much that I am now buying one for myself to use the same way, as a broiler tray for my oven. It is large enough to fit under the broiler and Soooooo easy to clean!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Third Time Was Not A Charm","review":"This latest order was my third. The first Grill Pan was purchased several years ago and finally wore about. I purchased a second. It lasted about a year...warped and with no non-stick surface left. I tried to send it back for another, but All Clad requires you to send the defective product back...and if it was improperly used, then tough. I decided that All Clad must have simply produced the odd bad pan, and decided to order another (cheaper than mailing it back in). This third is the worst of all. The non-stick surface is completely worn off in spots. I use the pan once or twice a week. 5 MONTHS. That is all this thing lasted. All Clad is a metal cookware giant, but they clearly do not put anything into their cheaper grill pans. This is Walmart level crap, being sold under the All Clad name. I am ordering a iron grill pan....to heck with big name brands, sold cheaply. I am a sucker. When All Clad sells something for 80 bucks, it likely is of poor quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really great grill pan","review":"I use this professionally in my small catering business.

It fits perfectly into my 2-quart All-Clad saucier, which is wider at top than the 3- and 4-quart saucepans into which it's said to fit. I put an inch or two of water in the saucier, insert the steamer, and cover with the saucier top. I was surprised to see the reviews mentioning steam escaping. I have never had steam escape and the vegetables have always been perfectly and uniformly steamed -- even when I fill the steamer to its rim with kale. I gave the steamer four stars instead of five only because of the length and weight of the handle (which probably helps to keep it cool, I suppose). I agree it cleans up nicely, even if I put it in the dishwasher instead of hand washing it, and it still gleams like new!"},{"rating":"2","title":"All-Clad Stainless Steamer Insert - Must Have!","review":"This is a wonderful steamer insert.

It's in a lower register. It's unpolished. It's not that much different from the original recording of \\"Stay Hungry.\\"This might be about what you'd hear if you were to see TS live. The rest of the band is fine, by the way, but Dee sounds old and tired. Was anyone asking for this album?I wanted to rock but ultimately I'm not gonna take it.

The re-recorded Burn in Hell is worth the price alone. And TS have added a boat load of bonus tracks. Some are from their Club Dayze, and some are from the original Stay Hungry sessions. I was waiting for TS to do something with Stay Hungry, as that was the only album they didn't remaster a few years ago when the rest of their catalogue was remastered. And, I agree that the sound of the original was much too tame and radio friendly. This re-recording is how I've always wanted their flagship album to sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!","review":"Here's my take. When you go to see these bands you want to here the old stuff. And as we have seen with the other 80's bands, new music does'nt sell except to the hardcore's who then compare it to their older work and criticize it. This was an excellant idea by Dee to update the music without losing any credibility the work had and give the fans what they want when they see a concert. My opinion this was far and away a great idea and other bands such as Bon Jovi (who I love) should take note of this cd, as I feel they failed with their accousticly updated versions of their hits recently.Just enough change to update it and thankfully no tampering to ruin it.

(Slow, Unenthusiastic and, Boring)","review":"I am very disappointed by this disc. First off, when a band re-records their old stuff, it outta send up a red flag. I was foolish enough to get this CD. The band redid the songs 'cause they hated the old \\"thin\\" sound of the originals. I think the originals sound fast, crisp and excited/on fire. The new versions are bogged down, slow, low and unemotional. I think anyone who gives this a great review (and some have) is trying not to feel bad about the $$$ they wasted (along with me.)The new songs are crap.The one and only worthy track on here is \\"Heroes are Hard to Find,\\" which you can get on the \\"Strangeland\\" soundtrack.My advice is to pick up the re-mastered issue of the original version of this cd.

But the product isn't enough to begin playing guitar. It won't get you even close to playing guitar. They advertise that it comes with a DVD, a CDROM, a book and an audio cd. The truth is that on the dvd, you are supposed to play things that you should learn on the cdrom. However, the CDROM does not contain the lesson required for you to play. And the book and the audio teaches you exactly the same lesson you got with the CDROM, instead of teaching new things! They say you have 50 lessons. That is a lie. Actual playing lessons are just a few, and very poor ones. It doenst even teach you to learn to tune your guitar, they just tell you to buy a digitar tuner for $20 bucks - and they count this one as \\"a lesson\\".

Though the skillet was never touched with a metal implement, never in a dishwasher, always allowed to cool naturally ( meaning not immersed in water right from the stove ), after only 4 months of use is sticks badly! Considering the care it received, I can only assume that this may be the result of abrasions caused by spices or the one i received was a lemon. I am clueless, but know in either case I am unimpressed and the product has miserably failed to meet my expectations for what I expected from this caliber of product. Hence, why I am here today shpping for new skillets. I read many good reviews here, and I wish all the best of luck. Maybe if you don't use them as frequently as I do, you will have years of service.

The metal was thinner, lighter, and just felt like cheap cookware.It is to bad as this product was great till Emerilware changed the set and make it like any other cheap knock off. If you want Emeril on the video on the Emerilware website you will notice that he doesn't seem to happy either.Avoid this product.I tried to call Emerilware to talk to them about maybe using the Emerilware Pro Clad but their support lacks anyone that knows about cooking yet along about their own product.

The only downside is the weight. These things weigh a ton. Its a good thing the handles are designed as well as they are, because they have to carry a substantial load.

The ever-present organ adds nice flavor but gets a bit grating over the course of the whole album and I happen to miss guitar.

Horrendous editing kills more of the victims in the movie than the creatures do, and there are SO MANY characters I felt the movie should have included some sort of chart.

Think back to your high school health and safety videos or driver's ed videos.

Grandma's do allow that. :) The cake released from the pan easily with no cake left behind and cleaning the pan was quick and easy.What was VERY disappointing was the cost of shipping the pan was MORE than the cost of the pan itself.

This is simply over-over-produced. Jessica has a great voice, but if improvisation and spontaneity are the heart of jazz, this is not jazz.

In this installment a gruesome murder of a music critic occurs in a television station bathroom, and Slider is on the trail of what turns out to be a religious zealot. Even though I had figured out the murderer about 1/2 way through, it did not take away from the story. There were still wonderful characters to meet and a spine-tingling ending to get to.

I doubt what kind of people gives so much critical acclaimation, awards, golden globe best actor and even an oscar for best screenplay for such a disgusting movie.

Henning - Australian Author"},{"rating":"1","title":"A pale copy of the TV Show","review":"I am a huge Ali G fan...and I loved the HBO show (5 stars out of 5). So I went to the movie expecting more of the same, and boy was I ever disappointed. The real problem to me is that too much of the movie (all of it?) was scripted. The genius of the TV show was that it was improv depending on what happened with the guests, usually with hilarious results. This movie on the other hand relies too much on scripted situations and you just get the feeling that they are trying too hard, whereas with the TV show things just flowed.Interestingly enough I found that people who loved the film had never seen the Ali G show, and that most of the people who had seen the show were disappointed with the film...count me among them.If you saw the film and have never seen the Ali G show, take my advice and check out both seasons and see if you don't agree with me.H777"},{"rating":"1","title":"Borat Does America","review":"Agreed that Americans are very gullible to the next trend. Borat is an example of how hype can make a bad film a success. I thought they tried too hard to be funny. I mean look at the morons he used in the film. Drunken, disgustingly stupid redneck college guys. Moronic manner-driven southern belles lost in the past. Small minded, gay hating rodeo fans. Annoying, overly serious convention attendees.The part where Borat shows a nude picture of his family to someone has been done in his TV show awhile back. It was funny the 1st time, but seemed tired now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny","review":"Borat (Cohen) is a Kazakhstani TV personality sent to the US by his country - with a documentary crew in tow - on a fact-finding-mission about \\"the greatest country on earth\\". This is an acutely political piece of filmmaking that cleverly uses the guise of a dim-witted, if undeniably sweet character, to make some irrefutable points about the frame of mind of (some) American culture. That said, there's a point (in the film) where Borat wrestles his naked corpulent producer to the floor in a cringe-inducing scene that will have you both laughing and wincing in disbelief at the lengths that Cohen is willing to go to - and good God, laugh you will. This is simply one of the funniest films of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Borat","review":"I thought that this movie was supposed to be offensive and disgusting, but instead it showed the American public how perverse and subjective they are.

The initial idea was great, that's why 2 stars. I loved the beginning in Borat's native land and it was cute, but I was never laughing out loud. But it all downhill from there. Since everyone else has analyzed this thing to death, I'll only ask one question:Azamat: In the naked wrestling scene, where are his gonads? He is sans penis. I have watched the beginning a couple of times and I do believe that the \\"woman\\" who plays his short, fat nasty wife is Azamat. Azamat has female breasts and if you look close enough, I think a female actor was given a FX \\"hair shirt\\" and male balding pattern wig. The voices of the two characters are identical. Haven't read all 566 reviews, so if anyone knows some inside info, please clue us in. Azamat has been completely castrated otherwise.I don't know why this haunts me, but like the movie \\"It's Pat\\", it's bugging me to no end to know what sex Azamat really is........"},{"rating":"1","title":"What Am I Missing Here?","review":"I notice that most of the reviews here are 5 star or 1.

There are funny moments, but I wouldn't call it a funny funny movie - let alone the funniest movie I've ever seen. It's not even in the top 100.I liken the hype machine of this movie to the same people who did 'Napoleon Dyaminte'.

Repulsive for its concentration on scatology and the sheer ugliness of some of its scenes; embarrassing for its cynical exploitation of the courtesy and gentility of the people victimized involuntarily by its creators' relentless and aggressive boorishness.I suggest that future films from Mr. Cohen might attempt to embarrass those who deserve it -- perhaps people who make films like this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"So not funny.","review":"I watched this with a friend of my awhile ago, who typically loves this sort of thing.

That something could be a pentecostal meeting, a rodeo, a business meeting in a hotel, etc. It really doesn't matter. Just find an event that requires a great deal of planning to pull off in an organized and efficient manner and rush in and be very obnoxious or offensive. Film the reactions, edit it, and you have a movie. The question for the viewer is whether it is a movie worth watching. I didn't think so. There is no wit involved here. You either think it is hilarious to mock a Christian religious service or you don't (I would like to see Cohen do the same to an Islamic religious meeting. That might be the end of his career and more.). What is funny about going into an antique shop and breaking dishes? Some of the people he makes fun of seem genuinely nice.

I have to say, I enjoyed every minute. While the plot is a bit shallow, the film itself is frank, funny, and cruel. It definitely unmasks the hypocritical, shallow, and disgusting society we live in. Even when people know a camera is pointed to their face, they say and do things they know they will later regret.

If there was a tiny guffaw in the scene, it occurred in the first 15 seconds - several minutes later there was no reason for it to still be going on - but it was. Not only is this scene not suitable for childeren, it's not suitable for you mother, father, wife, husband, or even somebody you don't like. Sometimes gross can be funny, crass is just crass.Only a group of faternity brothers on beer number six could find much to laugh at in this sad excuse for entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a thinking man's movie","review":"I watched this farce on DVD and turned it off after about an hour. Enough of this crude,offensive nonsense. I'm depressed and discouraged that I live in a world that finds this funny. It seems to me that the whole shtick was a rip-off of the Alex character inEverything Is Illuminated, which was an excellent film in which this character provides comic relief to a serious and very moving story.

There are simply no redeeming features. Crude stereotypes of racial, ethnic and minority groups. Gratuitous bad language and nudity. A plot and story line that is laughingly improbable. Its beyond me how it got the press it did, and why Cohen was so lauded. I guess he plays the character the way the screen writer wanted him played, but that's small comfort. The acting overall is not bad considering that it was supposed to be a documentary of travel through the US, and the folks on the screen weren't supposed to be \\"actors\\". That's the reason I gave it 2-stars (\\"didn't like it\\") instead of one! But its a bare 2-stars, maybe 2-minus! Save your money and time.

If it is not the worst movie ever made, I think everybody should be able to agree on Borat being easily among the 10 worst movies ever made.The plot is so thin that it could be told in 2 sentences. There is no point to the movie, no morals, no nothing. The only thing that sticks out is the technique use to tell the story: it is in your face obnoxious, revolting, offensive, obscene, repugnant, disgusting, nauseating, filthy, etc.After coming out of the movie, I felt dirty.

I was sure before watching it I was going to be one of them. I was expecting something politically incorrect in the realm of Blazing Saddles... or Animal House. I enjoy an offhanded joke or even what some would consider offensive... But this even went beyond what I can call offensive to just plan GROSS or Nasty.

It was anti-semitic-they showed Borat thinking that Jews \\"shape-shift\\" to cockroaches and then Borat throws money at them. They showed the running of the Jews and then an egg which is a baby Jew-they tell the little kids to attack the egg so the Jew can't hatch. It was 80 minutes-short, but not sweet.

He was telling us about how funny this movie was and even showed us clips on Youtube.

He goes around filming this \\"documentary\\" for his homeland, and acts goofy and sees how people react. Some parts were funny, especially their fear of Jews, and how they portray them, and there were some sight gags if you caught them, like his producer telling him their bear got away, and later seeing the bear's head in the refrigerator in the background.

The movie is a fast paced comedy that will make you laugh the entire time. I will not spoil it for anyone. Borat is a real comedy made on a really low budget. Sacha Baron Cohen is the brains and body behind borat. There are many times in the movie, when he does what he does, where i thought, \\"How can he keep a straight face?\\" You will laugh within the first 60 seconds of the movie, how many movies can do that, i would say none, short of spaceballs or 40-year old virgin. Borat has many marks at anti-semitism, Sacha in fact is jewish and pokes fun at jews, and everyone else as well. For example, you find how some people in the southern United States, aren't the brightest in the country.

While you will roll with laughter and be offended countless times; dont lose sight of the underlying message. At some point during the movie the stereotype will turn on you, and when it does... pay attetnion to how it makes you feel. If you find yourself saying 'Well - that's not right, or that's not true' remember that evereyone else said the same when the joke was about them. The PC world pretends these feelings dont exist, but the beahvior modification has only buried these ill ideaologies - not solved them.

Yeah, right. But I was certainly expecting a few more BIG laughs from this movie...Still, it was pretty much constantly entertaining and downright shocking at times. Cohen def. has some nerve, kind of in that Tom Green 'I'm going to annoy the **** out of you' way. There were only two bits that weren't really all that funny to me(the bed and breakfast and the church...which was just scary!!!); All the deleted/additional footage was priceless, esp. the Dr., the dog pound, and the supermarket. There are plenty of laughs all around, and like 'Bowling for Columbine', this movie allows alot of the 'real people' in it dig their own graves. And while some will find it offensive on numerous levels, I just found it really funny...'Hey, Vanilla Face...'...Classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious...","review":"This was beyond question the funniest movie I've seen since \\"The Jerk.\\" The premise, the acting and the farcity are the greatest.

I had high hopes for \\"Borat,\\" based on numerous reviews and comments, but I was disappointed. I expected rude, crude humor, so that aspect did not bother me -- but this is basically a one-joke movie, the joke being that Borat says stupid and outrageous things to provoke stupid and outrageous responses. Which he does. Again and again. Unfortunately, after a while this wears a bit thin, and I found myself glancing repeatedly at the time display on my DVD player.Quite often my reaction was \\"Oh, c'mon, this HAS to be a setup, with the interviewees being in on the gag from the start.\\" Surely, people would see through Borat fairly quickly. How many people hitch-hike with a film crew, after all? So, overall, I'd give this a paper-thin, very marginal thumbs up, but no more. Proceed at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"embarrassing","review":"Sascha Baron Cohen's ability to take innocent people and expose them as absurd cultural stereotype is unmatched.

I assume that the people behind the movie have achieved what they set out to achieve. People love it or they hate it, but the movie was talked about, quoted, merchandised, etc...The movie was certainly funny and, on it's own, I would give it four stars, but I feel that the level of humor was a step down from the original skits on Da Ali G Show. Having to follow a storyline often has this effect on skits-turned-comedies. Normally, we would see Borat set out to interview someone or sit in with some group in an attempt to learn of the American way. The skit would hit you hard with laughs and then it was back to Bruno or Ali G... The movie does suffer, somewhat, due to the need to adhered, even loosely, to a storyline.In any case, it is a very funny movie. 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"No surprises here...","review":"We already knew Borat from Da Ali G Show, so no real surprises here... but good fun, that's for sure.

Borat is a well made, intelligent, satire mockumentary. This film was written, produced by, and stars the English comedian Sacha Baron Cohen. Cohen plays a journalist named Borat who is traveling through the United States from Kazakhstan. Borat travels through the American country side and interacts with what appear to be actual Americans. The results are at times hilarious and equally disturbing considering some of the thoughts and feelings of the individuals Borat interacts with. It is always questionable which element of the film is more funny: Borat's questions or the American's responses. This film could be viewed as a sign of the times. It attempts to uncover the mainstream American culture. Arguably the best part about this feature was the controversy surrounding it upon release in the theaters. Cohen did his homework and scored a hit."},{"rating":"1","title":"It just went too far....","review":"I know good satire can be ugly, but this was just too mean-spirited to tickle my personal funny bone, and too raunchy for my comfort level.

The only people who could ever be offended by this movie, are the people the just don't get the joke. Make sure you see it for yourself, it's much more than a silly movie. It touches areas that haven't been touched before and takes risks. If you're not laughing, you're shocked by what's happening.Sacha Baron Cohen deserves a whole lot of credit for really putting his life in danger just to make people laugh. But if you don't, for some reason, find the film funny, you will definitely learn a lot about the country you live in. It's a scary glimpse into ourselves and neighbors, but Borat will have you laughing so hard, you won't even notice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"This movie is hilarious, but only if you have an open mind and a good sense of humor.

But it is endearing, very funny, and its explorations of the american psyche are spot on.. I found myself more often than not laughing at the American's who confront something different than themselves and bring out the worst stereotypes of Americana.. Borat is one of the most outrageous and totally relevant portrayals of international relations in the history of cinema..

Don't get me wrong, I enjoy oddball humor (Tom Green, Coen Brothers movies, etc). But, this was overkill. It might have been better if he made a TV special and showed a few of these sketches. After awhile his \\"schtick\\" grew tiresome. Some of his \\"victims\\" were obviously playing to the camera. There was nothing to like about him and I began to feel sorry for the people he victimized. For me it just didn't live up to the hype. I wish Amazon would allow \\"negatives\\" in their star ratings. This movie would get a Negative 5 Stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"and the punchline is this...","review":"Plenty of the humor in Borat is funny. Andy Kauffman would be proud that his \\"foreigner\\" humor is being recycled so heavily.But there is also a lot of the type of \\"humor\\" that makes people laugh because they feel uncomfortable- the same kind of laughter that someone may have when they are being tickled relentlessly, or worse, when someone is being picked on for their flaws (there's a big difference between that and self-deprecating humor). It isn't really funny, it's just embarrassing and/or demoralizing.Besides that, Borat and the other characters of Sacha Baron Cohen work fairly well in small doses, but overall this movie tries way too hard to break out of it's usual 10 minute segment. The movie loses a bit of it's steam half way through.I laughed through plenty of it, but I also left with an unsatisfying sense that the biggest joke in the movie was on the viewer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately *no stars* is not an option","review":"Funny, it takes a film as offensive as this one to get me to finally write a review.

Subject Selection: The film properly selects some of the worst aspects of American culture for mockery, yet mixes it with innocent victims in ways that lead to moral grayness.2. Clarity: The film does not clearly distinguish staged from unstaged scenes.3. Integration: While smoothly integrating all scenes, real or otherwise, using the humorous plot device of sexual infatuation, the end result amounts to misintegration rather than authentic integration. Although much more engaging than a fully disintegrated \\"plotless\\" approach, this very engaging nature makes it that much more dangerous as a cultural influence. Its box office success reflects its effectiveness as a work of misintegrated art.I cannot honestly recommend watching this movie in the theater. If you have an insatiable curiosity, wait until the film comes to DVD and you can get a good deal through your local rental store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borat","review":"The little we heard about this film gave us the impression that it was funny and charming, so my husband bought the DVD.

I am amazed that it wasn't direct to DVD. It had a single joke; a Kazakh country bumpkin travelling around ignorant of U.S. customs, bringing out the worst in everyone he came in contact with. It was pretty much used up in the first ten minutes, then became a painful exercise in repetition. By any aesthetic, this movie was so repulsive as to cause an aversion to ever seeing Sasha Baron Cohen in anything ever again.You do not want to be eating when Borat and his producer get into a fight sans trousers because the producer was 'making hand party' on a Pamela Anderson magazine. There is no redeeming social value in a naked, hiruste, over-weight man 'making hand party', or fighting with a naked, skinny, hirsute man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Offensive","review":"Tasteless, Offensive and Stupid; Borat makes Pauley Shore look like a comedy genius.

I noticed that most professional reviewers top ten lists were half filled with foreign films for 2006. Borat is a great example of why. I am an open minded person. Rocky Horror and Requim for a Dream are not for the squeemish or closed minded, yet I love both. But Borat is just crass and uncomfortable. That a person can stoop so low as Sasha is so disturbing that it does make you laugh - out of embarressment. The fact that it gets so much press is doubly disturbing. Let's be kind and accept the sexual sister kissing, the running of the Jews, the purchase of Jew killing guns and the butchering of the national anthem. The naked fight in the hotel is about the most disgusting thing I've ever seen and so far from funny as to not even being worth consideration. I hope to never see Sasha again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The premise of the film wasn't bad, and the character of \\"Borat\\" is very entertaining but it just seemed to me to be unnecessarily vulgar. I was more impressed with the parts of the film that did NOT employ feces or incest as gag devices than with the film's efforts to \\"one-up\\" itself to see how much more tasteless it can get as the story unfolds. For instance, the elevator scene was pretty good and the discussion with the feminists was hilarious. But other parts just left me cold.A movie I like I can watch a dozen times. This one I could barely get through the first."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to be a comedic genius","review":"Judging by the reactions to Borat, I would have to say that you too can be a comedic genius just by following these three simple steps:1. Fraudulently misrepresent yourself. Claim to be making a video for the Dutch Antilles, Tannu Tuva or some obscure country no one is likely to know.2. Insult/offend the person you're talking to. Talk at length about your wife's sex organs, break valuable objects in their store, say something contrary to their political position, like telling feminists that women are inherently stupid, and so on.3. Videotape their reaction.There. You are now a comedic genius."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borat","review":"found this movie a real ill composed movie.

Nonetheless, I gave it an honest effort, even sitting through the whole thing. While the theater had a lot of people, it struck me that the laughs, and there were some, to be sure, just didn't come often enough for people to feel like they were truly having a good time. I know that at a certain point I waited for it to be over. When it ended I felt like my friends felt the same. The humor is not really offensive; it's just that the film alternates between smugness and overkill. I recommend that you wait to see this when it comes to a discount theater.

It's like Cohen had a brain cramp and figured the best way to stretch his tv material into a movie was to remove the more clever ideas and add more boorishness and vulgarity (which he also seemed to do with the Ali G. movie.) Sadly i think the reason this movie did so well in this country is that many of the people that he was trying to make fun of didn't get his jokes. If anything, he overestimated the intelligence of the American public. How else can you explain two terms with the worst president ever and morally reprehensible war. Then again, maybe Cohen did know what he was doing. Either way, the joke is on us Americans. Perhaps we'll wake up and see what a mess we've made once the housing and stock markets collapse.

In fact, there was maybe one funny scene in this whole movie. While Sascha Baron Cohen may be a comedy genius, his Borat character plays better on the small screen then it does on the big one. I don't think it should have been made into a feature length film and at 85 minutes long, the movie overstays it's welcome. It's to long and to stupid to be anything but a half hour Tv series.

While it is effective as a horror story about the profound ignorance and deep-seated prejudices of the Americans it caught 'Candid Camera'-style, this would have been better as a 5-minute skit on 'The Daily Show'. It relies far too much on toilet/gross-out bits for laughs, which in a very limited form appeals to the 15-year old in all of us. However, in a full-length movie it just doesn't cut it.I recall watching an episode of Tom Green's old TV show wherein he was suckling the mammary gland of some bovid (!) and asking the camera, \\"Is this comedy?\\"No, Tom, it isn't. And neither is 'Borat'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crass does not automatically equal funny","review":"I was very unimpressed with this movie. \\"Borat\\" suffers from the same delusion as Sarah Silverman in thinking that crass or politically incorrect AUTOMATICALLY equals funny. It does not. Of course sometimes it can be hilarious (and Borat does have moments like that), but overall I did not find this movie particularly funny or even amusing.

Since he was learing about the American culture, he runs into a bunch of people learning things from them. The funniest part was when he was with those people learning about table manners and such. There are many funny parts in this movie that are going to make you laugh until you're short of breath, it's THAT funny. Especially since this was a filmed documentary, so almost everything was real, not that many scripted performances. We need more movies like this, seriously.Also the deleleted scenes were funny as well. If you're looking for a movie to laugh until you're sides hurt, this one is perfect.

However, I've never seen his work until I rented this movie last night. What a hoot!! Of course, there's some really course humor, but you have to get past it to see the adroitness displayed. As the movie starts you've got 'over the top' comic background of Kazakhstan, remember this is a comedy looking for laughs. The subtitles are moving fast and furious between the characters. Borat speaks to the audience in English. He speaks Hebrew to his Kazakh producer who answers him in Armenian. In fact, the Kazarkh producer Azamat speaks Armenian throughout the entire film (with Borat answering him in Hebrew). Then you have the visual 'subtitles' rich white folks, ghetto black folks, country folks, CA nerds at Pam's book signing, etc. Mr. Cohen has translated the visual into a form of verbal, hence, the 'House of Babel'."},{"rating":"1","title":"what's the point of this mindlessly exaggerated movie?","review":"the whole movie is a farce not even a melodrama. something funny but didn't bring out faithfully except exaggerated ten time more. the borat character didn't deliver a believable and realistic person but a would-be one. i didn't find anything that supposed to look funny but stupidly playing dumb and dumber with out-dated exaggerations. i've heard that russia has denied a release permit to allow this stupid movie shown in russian theaters in case to cause unpredictable protests and chaos to the people this movie targeted from. something wrong with the media people, they not only produced the 'jackass', 'dirty sanchez', they also produced this stupid 'borat' that i could never find it funny but repulsively disgusting."},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is gay","review":"Sacha Baron Cohen is not funny in this movie.

However, juwes like Eli Roth in his movie Hostel and Sacha Baron Cohen in this movie Borat have the nerve to mock these poor people. Juwes can dish it out but can't take it. Someone should do a movie depicting Juwes in a negative light the way they depict nonJuwes in a negative light. I cannot think of any race more despicable than juwes. They are hypocrites. They won't tolerate defamation of their race and religion, but they enthusiastically produce mockumentaries of other races and of Christians.

If Cohen was trying to combat anti-semitism, all he did was shoot himself in the foot and set the movement back about 60 years.In addition, I was disturbed to find that Cohen's caricature of Borat is no doubt a ripoff of comedian Mahir Cagri.

In saying that, it is still bizarre that this gladiator shows up out of nowhere in 16th century Scotland to help right some wrong or stop injustice.Still, I really like this movie. It's a lot of fun. I hope a real studio produces this title some day. For now, if you want it, you will have to suffer with a Alpha release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible DVD transfer","review":"This is not a review about the film itself but the Alpha Video transfer: it's horrible. Really horrible. In fact, I believe this a complete ripoff. Who in their right mind believes that the transfer on this DVD is anything close to watchable? I'd like to see the folks from Alpha Video sit through it and try to watch it. I'm sure they could not watch it for more than 5 minutes.Avoid this DVD at all cost. Hopefully the film will have a presentable transfer one of these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"TRULY CURSED","review":"THE WITCH'S CURSE is one of the worst sword and sandal epics to grace our screens. The DVD transfer is horrible; the colors are washed out and the sound atrocious. But even if it had the crystal clarity of a better transfer, the material is so bad, it wouldnt help. Kirk Morris, one of those hunky 60s bodybuilders, plays Maciste, a muscleman who appears out of nowhere and goes to hell literally to put and end to a witch's curse. The movie takes place in 16th century Scotland, so what is this Roman gladiator even doing there? Morris has little dialogue, and he spends most of his time showing off his muscles by lifting trees, moving rocks and ditto ditto. It isn't even campy enough to be funny. What a waste of time and effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is always a wonderful experiance","review":"when great jazz players collaborate with pop singers to create a record.

He's a pilot and, for all practical purposes, an astronaut. This book reads like a chat with a pilot who has been there and done that. Although the prose is a bit lacking, the honesty and quailty of the stories more than compensate for the rather dry and unprofessional style. The rough feel may even inprove the overall effect; reading this book is like sitting in an adjacent booth at Denny's and listening to an old pilot tell stories. He assumes you are an acronym expert so don't expect a lot of explantions of the terms he uses every day. I learned just the right amount about the people, the machines, and the program. No fluff here. Just the facts, with the occasional bit of humor. This one is a keeper."},{"rating":"2","title":"An outstanding aviation story","review":"This book is a treasure for anyone with an interest in aviation and/or space exploration.

The protagonist is gunrunner along Interstate 95. When a big shipment to a NYC gang goes haywire, an adrenaline surge propels the book - through the unraveling of scheme after scheme - to the necropolis of its cataclysmic conclusion. For good measure, a baroque quantity of minutia concerning firearms is peppered throughout. Suspenseful, stark, and startling, 'Run' includes the key hallmarks of the noir genre: taut, rapid-fire prose and an overarching existential nihilism. Like Highsmith's 'The Talented Mr. Ripley,' Goodis's 'Down There,' and Thompson's 'The Grifters,' Winter's neo-noir deserves to be put on screen, but get a copy of the book first - copies are disappearing faster than a pack of smokes at an AA meeting."},{"rating":"1","title":"RUN...from this","review":"Would it be that hard to add quotation marks? This style of writing is terrible! The story-if you can get through it-is quite good. The fact that this author uses no quotation marks makes for a slower read. It slows the reading down immensely when you have to stop and figure out 'is this narrative or a character talking?' This seems to me to be lazy writing as opposed to artistic writing. I do not recommend this book for that simple reason. I do, however, recommend that you read an excerpt before you seriously consider purchasing this book. In my opinion there is way too much dialogue in this book to be written in this manner"},{"rating":"2","title":"Droop is Comin","review":"Droop could be the best rapper ont the west coast. he has a rap like Twista but it is probably faster and is way more clean and gangster. All need is YD to buy the cd but there are some things you may not like. Actually the only thing is the beat production. I think after Under Pressure they kind of gave up on the cd. They even sampled an eminem song, although the song is pretty tight. i suggest getting any other song besides UNder Pressure (because everybody likes that song) and see if you like his flo and if you do get the young droo. Closer to 3.5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Understanding, we get it!","review":"This was the main textbook in my Curriculum and Instruction class, and it's okay, but VERY redundant. It says to start your lesson by deciding what you want your students to learn (well, duh!) and then don't let a bunch of nice-to-know-but-not-really-important facts get in the way (I guess that's what comes from the SOLs and stuff). And it hammers home the idea that students can LEARN something without really UNDERSTANDING it, which seems a little obvious to me.All in all it's not a BAD book, but Id recommend something by Robert J. Marzano instead. We also used \\"Classroom Instruction that Works\\" in our class, and it was much better -- easier to read, not as boring or textbook-y, and more practical application type stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Push comes to Shove","review":"I remember this album vividly growing up. This, the Black Album, Get a Grip, COC, Ugly Kid Joe, etc etc. This album and the first one were really good. The fact that I still have fond memories of songs from the early 90's should say something. It was fun to listen to as a little kid and it's still fun to listen to in my early twenties. The album is full of memorable tracks and it's a shame that this is as underrated as it is. I was playing Secret of the Bottle on my acoustic and my friends were like, you make that up?

You see the Boyz II Men and Shai thing has already been done. You must have that extra something within your sound that really sets you apart and they lost that in my opinion. I have done A & R work for several labels and these guys sound d*#n good but they need that other guy back. I saw KB in 2004 @ the Midtown Music Festival in Atlanta and he was currently working on his project and it sounds exactly like what 4Shades could use to make their sound more universal. I would really love to hear all of them together again and show these other groups how its supposed to be done."},{"rating":"1","title":"did i miss something?","review":"Was it just me, or were several parts of this movie patched-together segments from other movies?

Another issue is that he takes a non-Ben E. King approach by using alot of whispering effects where you would expect his tenor to soar.\\"You Still Move Me\\", authored by Dan Seals and \\"It's All Right\\", by Curtis Mayfield are the best cuts, although even on these more engagaing opuses, there's that same monotony.The best original track is the closer, \\"T'm Gonna Be Somebody\\", good lyrics, well-delivered."},{"rating":"1","title":"A boring album","review":"Pat Metheny is a creative genius in the jazz world, but this album totally misses....it's boring, despite all the enthusiasmfrom the audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is included?","review":"The Product detail says that this is a 1 disc item, totaling 100 minutes, yet the review is for a 3 disc set containing over 600 minutes of content.

However, about every third DVD the unit would freeze up and/or skip for no apparent reason, and it would occur on both new and used DVDs. I did some more research and discovered others who've bought this unit have indicated they experienced the same problem. Since the freezing/skipping problem appears to be rather common, I would recommend against buying this model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty nice little player.","review":"PROS:Plays all regions and both PAL and NTSC perfectly.

The very first disc seemed to speed up slightly in the audio in a couple of places. Since that one time, I've played it for hours with no problem whatsoever. A great find. I gave it 4 out of 5 since I want more than a month's use before calling something great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coverdale or Plant?","review":"The following has absolutely nothing to do with this album but you may be interested anyway. Have you noticed that David Coverdale looks and sounds exactly like Robert Plant? Do a web search for photos of Plant with Jimi Page and Coverdale with Jimi page. You will not be able to tell who is in which picture. Then try to find a picture of Coverdale with Plant. You can try all you want but you won't find one. Isn't it kind of strange that they look and sound exactly alike, both have worked with Page, but they have never once appeared in a photo together. Then listen to a Whitesnake song like \\"Is This Love\\" and tell me that's not Robert Plant. Either Coverdale is a second personality of Robert Plant or they are long lost identical twin brothers. Just think about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE REAL DEAL!","review":"This may be the most UNDER RATED CD in history. All the flack about Coverdale sounding like Plant, hurt sales. Pay no mind. This is Jimmy Page playing his best since Zeppelin! All the songs are unique. Even the lyrics are right on. This is the release plant should have been on, and HE KNOWS IT! In fact, So jealous was Plant, He was back with Pagey within eight months. Every song is excellent. This disc shows who gave Zeppelin It\`s muscle. \\"SHAKE MY TREE\\" or \\"PRIDE AND JOY\\" or \\"OVER NOW\\" will show you the direction Zep may have headed in. TRUST ME....Get this CD and Rock out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gag Me","review":"I'll **NEVER** forgive Page for making an album with that delusional wannabe.

Led Zeppelin's influence can be quite obviously seen in Coverdale's band Whitesnake, but when he sings with Jimmy Page, it is quite hard to beleive that he is not Robert Plant. The two come from a similiar stylistic background, and they even look the same. After listening to the Led Zeppelin song \\"In My Time of Dying\\" followed by the Whitesnake song \\"Slow and Easy,\\" I find it hard to beleive that Plant and Coverdale are truly separate vocalists. Coverdale/Plant sounds to be one more release from Page and Plant, but at a fraction of the cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst albums I bought","review":"One of the worst albums I bought.

Tepid sales nixed a scheduled tour and brought Plant and Page back together again for future projects. On one level, it was too bad that the project couldn't stand on its own commercially. But Page was delivering a Led Zeppelin sound without the lead vocalist and people weren't buying into it.Page has never been able to shed the legacy he structured through Led Zeppelin. And it doesn't help when he can't get out of delivering little while grinding through the same territory."},{"rating":"1","title":"The low point of Jimmy Page's illustrious career.","review":"I can't give this album fewer than two stars, because, hey, Jimmy Page is Jimmy Page. But, unfortunately, David Coverdale is David Coverdale. This unholy alliance was doomed from the start. Unlike Page's fantastic collaboration with the Black Crowes, his album with the derivative Mr. Coverdale was a disaster. This album was released when I was in college, and I had a benighted loser of a roommate who purchased this garbage. I promptly broke his CD in half and left him some small change in the case (which was probably overly generous on my part)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of Both Worlds","review":"Have to say, just listened to this album for the first time in years, and it is very good. Best of Page's mid 70's guitar work; Best of Coverdale's 80's vocal-stylings. Forget the \\"Zeppelin\\" ripoff idea. Just two great musicians rocking out. Everyone says \\"Shake My Tree,\\" but I'd say \\"Take it Easy\\" has a little bit of it all.....like a lot of other reviews, I have to say I wish these guys had done more together.....peace"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ten Years Gone","review":"Putting aside the inevitable Coverdale/ Plant antagonisms, this album is really notable for Jimmy Page's most inspired guitar playing since the '70s. Riff-laden, imaginative stuff that for some reason he completely forgot or ignored on the Page/Plant \\"Walking into Clarksdale\\"-a bland, affair compared to this dose of \\"big-bollocked hard rock\\". It ain't LZ, but a reminder of Page's stature as a guitarist and producer when he cares to give a damn. Ten years gone, and I'm still waiting for Jimmy to swing the hammer again...with some new stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're going to crib, crib from yourself!","review":".... Jimmy Page seems to finally remember here just what his reputation rose on (HINT: It wasn't his days with The Firm!) and he, DC and the Bonham/Jones stand-ins make those Misty Mountains hop just like the Seventies never left. If it absolutely galls you that this mimics Led Zep so slavishly, don't buy the album. Me, I like that sound enough that I can overlook the fact that absolutely nothing original is happening here. Sometimes good riffs beat out originality; this is one of those times. Nice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a good album","review":"I know many Led Zep fans said that Coverdale tried to copy Robert plant style, but according to his Interview( TOBE HONEST) Coverdale did not mean to copy Robert Plant style voice, he admit that he wanted to create Deep purple and Led Zeppelin sounds, DEEP PURPLE the greatest name of the Heavy band cannot been forgotten Coverdale had ever sung along time ago,..Coverdale wanted to complied Led Zep and Deep Purple sounds together...Though robert Plant became very Jelaousy and still hates the guy,...there is no reason to be Jealous PLANT! Coverdale can sing much better than you! cheers"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth a try","review":"Give it a try! Seriously, 'tis if you do not like bubble-gum Whitesnake or Gabrielesque Plant solo, this one suits really. Ok, sometimes Coverdale sounds like Plant torn-out photocopy or like W.

Other than using the tired old Samurai metaphor, the authors provide little in the way of real business examples in Japan. I was wondering how far into the book it would be before they mentioned importing guest workers but sure enough, I occurs on page 93 about 1/2 way through the book. The authors give the example of Shinsei bank and make sure to mention importing workers from India to Shinsei as a sure sign of \\"Japan's Renaissance\\". Well, I did a little research on Shinsei Bank and since they started this radical new program, the company has gone into the tank including its stock - no doubt ruined by imported guest workers as so many American companies have been. Japan's \\"recovery\\" is due to nothing more than increased trade with China - China's new consumers want to buy Japanese products. Don't waste your time or money on this book - and don't give these globalist shills any more money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Japan's renewal and Samurai spirits.","review":"This book is neither just talking about Japanese businesses nor business strategies, but is a literary work that, using several metaphors, tries to associate Japan's business renewal with Japanese history and Japanese traditional mindsets, so called Samurai or Bushido spirits.We, the Japanese usually are not conscious that we are descendants of Samurai. As authors say, however, those factors of Samurai spirits are part of our nature, and they might enable us to continue to revive.The lessons from Japan's renaissance can be applied to Western business, but of course, just learning them does not revitalize your business. In order for you to enhance your value through this book, the essential process would be to think over the lessons and embody them in your business strategies, tactics and daily operations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hicko has motives","review":"Throughout this book the same thought kept occuring in my brain: The author, Hicko, is an accountant and tax preparer by trade. Of course he doesn't want a flat tax. His profession is the only one that loses under a simple tax code. This book is just a bunch of class warfare dribble that went out of style in 1975. Forbes' book, Flat Tax Revolution, is much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"A cynical defense point of view","review":"Hicko defense the current tax system of USA in a very cynical and rough way. The book takes you through in his myths based on the proposed new flat tax system by Alvin Rabushka, Dick Armey, Robert Hall, Robert Eisner and Herbert Stein. However, you will have moments during reading when you can laugh about his viewpoints of defense. Before you read the book, it might be better being at least a bit familiar with some other books, like: Robert Hall, Alvin Rabushka, The Flat Tax; and/or Dick Armey, The Flat Tax; and/or ISBN 0-8447-3987-1 Fairness and Efficiency in the Flat Tax.

As if this group wants simplicity? Flat tax shifts the burden to the middle class. Start the payments at whatever level of income everyone thinks is fair. Right now 50% pay no tax. Is that shared burden? Get the congress out of the favor business in the guise of tax code. Why have deductions for housing? Aren't tax paying renters equal to home buyers? So what if I want 10 children and my neighbor has only one. (By the way I own a home and have three boys.) These are choices that should not be influenced or subsidized by fellow tax payers. Congress won't pass a flat tax because it is a source of too much power for Washington and too much money for CPA's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Even Looking in the Right Place","review":"For almost 150 years America thrived and expanded without an income tax.Our problem now is that we have an income tax.

I guess I'd take the shot, but I'd rather have a third option of keeping my life and living it freely.You best bet right now is to use Amazon to gather as much about income taxation as you can.

If you like the pity and catharsis of authors like Hawthorne and Melville, the decadent symbolism of Poe, or the logical precision and impassive sadness of Kafka, then I highly recommend Ford as he is their contemporary successor. Those who criticize the plot and characterizations of The Physiognomy and Memoranda do so from misapprehensions regarding the appropriate style and substance of the allegorical genre of fiction which is not to be evaluated by the same criteria as the psychological realist school.

Over time (a month or so of use), this plastic gets worn down, where it holds the grinding mechanism in place (a couple of tiny divets in the glass bottom fit into the plastic rim), so the item stops working because of a tiny flaw in the plastic used. Although the ceramic grinding mechanism is of good quality, and I was pleased with the grinder at first, I''ve had six of these, some owned myself and some bought for friends (after an enthusiastic first month), all fall apart eventually. It's too bad that this flaw exists - because the design is cute and the grinder holds a fair amount of pepper/spices (more than similar grinders)."},{"rating":"2","title":"OXO Salt/Pepper Mills (Glass Jar)","review":"These early OXO award winning mills with glass jars are the best mills I have ever had.

Reade also made this into a play which was immensely popular in the 19th century and shocked Victorian audiences in its depiction of prision life. Many considered its \\"realism\\" too harsh. The performance on this 1930s film is in the style of the 19th-century melodrama as it would have been performed on the stage, including the style of acting. So if you want to eperience what that was like, try this film. Squire Meadows is a true \\"villain\\" and you'll be rooting for the hero, who is saved by his best friend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"My review of this book will be very short: It should be titled \\"David Miller's Political Philosophy: A Very Short Introduction\\". I bought the book expecting to be introduced to political philosophy, but I find that I have learned more about Miller's opinions (however mainstream) than political philosophy itself.

The last is my favorite at the moment, but they're all good. I think Joan Osborne, who I didn't know before listening to these concerts, has a great voice, and really adds to the mix. The players are all terrific, though. I particularly like the piano and guitar solos in Mama Tried, and the pedal steel is particularly good in Cumberland Blues, but these are high points among songs that are great throughout.

For example, the entry Know had a dubious exegis of the Hebrew word Yehta, along with the Roman Catholic Church's teaching on homosexuality. There was only ONE Old Testament citation for Know. If you need a serious concordance for Bible study, I suggest you obtain another translation such as the NRSV, for which there are considerably superior concordances available. Since the NAB translation of the NT was revised in 1986, the Psalter translation in 1990, and the OT due to be revised in 2003, I doubt there will be new concordance for the NAB published for quite a while.

But if you're wanting to save a couple of bucks, I would look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap and pink","review":"Very cheap plastic (you can easily push in), which is the last thing I want for the purpose I bought it for (storing vegetable wash).

This is probably a fluke, but is disappointing nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I needed - spray bottle with adjustable spray","review":"I was looking for a spray bottle that was adjustable - not with just a stream setting - and this was perfect for that. I'm using the bottle to spray my ivy plants so they don't get dusty, and the bottle is nice and small so it doesn't stand out when place amongst my plants. I saw that other reviewers didn't necessarily get a good color - mine was a purple top with translucent clear bottom (the translucency is from the surface being finely pebbled). My one complaint is that the bottle is somewhat difficult to screw shut - the threads are probably just not that great. However, it was cheap and it does 95% of what I wanted, so I would recommend this to you if you need a spray bottle!"},{"rating":"2","title":"super spray bottles","review":"gives a real fine mist spray up to a stream - nice adjustment control on the spray head and i needed that \\"mist\\" spray ability - would definitely buy again"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spray bottle","review":"I like this spray bottle it is so efficient and even though I got it at a price that was good for me it works just fine.

It's not the cheap flimsy device I feared at this low price. The plastic is sturdy. The seal is tight. The trigger handle pumps smoothly. The nozzle sparys evenly. I'm not sure what more quality anyone could want.POSITIVES:1. Flawless at its primary function, i.e., a smooth even spray.2. Attractive design. Decorative color.3. Translucent bottle is clear enough to see how much fluid you've poured so far. This is a useful feature when mixing two liquids. Other bottles are either clear (ugly) or opaque (blind).4. The inner straw-like tube is the perfect length to draw from the bottle's bottom-most recesses. You can spray out nearly every drop that was in the bottle. No waste!5. Trigger handle enables strong pump leverage, in contrast to those finger-spray bottles.NEGATIVES:(none)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stands Guard of the Counters","review":"I got this squirt bottle to help train my kitten. He's a quick learner, and it only took a couple squirts before he stopped jumping up on the counters.

It seemed hardy enough. One thing I didn't love is they sent me a bottle in pink. I work at a spa and bought the bottle for a body wrap I do. I try to keep everything gender neutral and hot pink does not fit the bill. I will keep it. I wish I'd have known pink was an option so I could have asked for a different color. That may be my fault, however if you do not want pink don't make the same mistake I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not all spray bottles are created equal","review":"If you just need something that functions as a spray bottle for one or two squirts every now and then, save a couple bucks and get one at the dollar store. In fact, I have a bunch of them that you can have for free. BUT if you need to use it multiple times a day, every day, you're probably already fed up with terrible sprayers, which is why you're looking here in the first place. This is a good one! You can adjust it from a clear stream to a fine mist, and anything in between. It's smooth and relatively quiet. The one I got was green. It comes pretty clean - I still rinsed it out before spraying plants and animals, but there's no unpleasant chemical odor. The tension is just a little greater than I'd prefer, but hey, I'm not complaining.

The author spends so much time on unimportant details, whipping around names and places that she misses the entire essence and feel of the old Roman Empire. For a murder mystery there is no sense of urgency or tension, just slow, boring, plodding to the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lighten up","review":"Previous reviewer--Lighten up! This is a fluffy 1980 something made for TV movie. The premise of the story is about two parents who thought they were raising their children right, one day got a rude awakening when their seemingly perfect older daughter became hooked on drugs. Gangs and drugs don't just happen in the ghetto to latch key kids of single parents, it happens everywhere and sometimes with the person you least suspect. Hence the title \\"Not my kid\\". The movie was excellent and the actors were amazing; The family played by George Seagal, Stockard Channing and most of all Viveca Davis as the older daughter, all give solid performances. The ending of course was a little cheesetastic (what do you expect, it was the 80's) but I would recommend watching it if nothing else is on or even if something else is on (Down with reality TV)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabric 25 is excelent!!!","review":"This is the third CD of Fabric 25.

Diane Arbus had significant talent, and it is amazing that she continued to produce outstanding work when burdened with a serious chronic depression. The author also impresses us with Arbus's special ability to coax almost anybody to pose for her. If she had lacked this skill, many of her portraits would never have come into being. This is a must read for those interested in the history of photography."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent read","review":"This book, although not authorized by the estate of Diane Arbus, was very insightful to her life and her process as an artist. Arbus was fascinating and the book was illuminating. It is a sad fact that her life ended too early, as do too many fantastic artists like her. One can only imagine what else her legacy might have added with another 30-40 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Bio and Insight on Creative Genius","review":"A well-organized effort by Bosworth that gives us insight into the makings of one of most creative photographers of our time.

Anyone who truly appreciates Arbus' photography and has been exposed to it (for example, the excellent show which the Metropolitan had a few years ago) will love this book.

In using the code from the book (I typed everything in, and didn't use the CD-ROM), I only needed to make 6 minor changes to the code to the get it to work (and I have never written a CORBA program before). I initially tried running CORBA examples from other books (including the Orbix Web documentation itself!), but the programs were always incomplete.

Aerosmith had a FEW decent tracks from this time period (FINE, Young Lust, The Other Side, geez I'll even say that What It Takes was ok for a ballad), but the rest of this album is pure schmaltzy vegas pablum.

If you love great music, then you absolutely MUST have this album. I also highly recommend their first greatest hits collection from the '70's. Pick both of these albums up, and get ready to rock AEROSMITH style!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Well...................","review":"I am the eleven year old boy who gave this two stars on the fifth of June. I read a coulple reviews and I found one that I should have added in my review. If you like the old Aerosmith, than this is not a CD for you. If you are a newcomer to Aerosmith, and you buy this CD you might like it, But I bought Toys in the Attic after this CD and there is alot of different stuff and I don't think you can beat Toys In the Attic but, lots of people may oppose that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honestly, one of Aerosmith's Greatest Works","review":"Can you imagine having an artist's greatest hits in one CD? Well, Big Ones is a fine example of one. I am a huge Aerosmith Fan, and I think that Big Ones is their best work. Big Ones contains their hit singles and other great, unreleased songs. I can't say that I have a favorite song in this Album, because it is truely extraordinary. When I hear this CD, I just press play let go on and on.If you've never heard of Aerosmith before, or if you're a true Aerosmith fan, I recommend you this CD. I guarantee you that you will not be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aerosmith's Greatest Hits: Post Rehab...","review":"They should have named it Aerosmith's Greatest Hits: Post Rehab.

I have to admit that I have skipped past the songs that I am not familiar with yet, hence the four stars. The songs on here that were released in the 80s are the best ones, thought I like the ones from the \\"Get a Grip\\" CD. Only for casual fans, like me, who aren't interested in getting every single album they have released.

I was not a fan of \\"Get A Grip\\", and I haven't given a chance for \\"Nine Lives\\". I hate half the songs on here like \\"Crying\\", \\"Crazy\\", \\"Blind Man\\", \\"Janie's Got A Gun\\". I feel that this was a flake off to Geffen records as they weren't able to get a lucrative deal out of them. I found the songs from \\"Permanent Vacation\\" that are represented here are the best songs on the album, and \\"Living On The Edge\\" is just o.k. Otherwise this is a poor excuse for a greatest hits compilation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album!","review":"If you're looking for a compilation of all your favorite Aerosmith songs, this is it!

There all masterpeices, and as people in other reviews have said, I really recommend this CD for someone who doesn't really know any Aerosmith songs. If you really want to get a great album with signature Aerosmith [awesome]... rock n roll, unfortunately, this is not for you...you should try Toys in the Attic or Rocks. Furthermore, if you want a greatest hits type collection, all of the songs on this CD are classic, but if you get the new \\"Oh Yeah Ultimate Aersomith Hits\\" you will get a better idea of what its all about."},{"rating":"2","title":"BIG 1s","review":"I think this was a very good record to put out. To start out on a good note, the last 3 songs are the best, along with Janies Got a Gun and various others. The downside is some of the songs are not so great. For example, Amazing and Blind Man. The rest are great! Amazing, sounds like the rise and fall of his drug addiction. It starts out with... I let the wrong ones in And let the rights ones outI was glad when it was over.

There's a reasons for this low rating:This is NOT the best of Whitesnake, its simply a collection of songs taken from only 3 of the bands 11 studio albums. I think it's deceiving to call it \\"Whitesnake's greatest hits\\", even tho the songs themselves are good. I guess it all has something to do with the rights to the material, and maybe the fact that the earlier work of Whitesnake is rather unknown in America. As an introduction to this great band I guess it's alright but for the more than casual fan it won't do.I advise you to get the original studio albums instead, because Whitesnake is one of the best bands in this genre. From the early blues rock, via the more traditional hard rock to heavy metal, Coverdale with his amazing voice have been able to release top material time after time."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is good...","review":"This is a good sample of Whitesnake's most successful years (Slide It In, Whitesnake, and Slip Of The Tongue).

Check out Blue Murder if you like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good hard rock album","review":"Although I'm only a casual fan of Whitesnake but I think that this is a really good album to own if you're an old school hard rock/metal fan and I find it interesting that Whitesnake vocalist David Coverdale replaced Ian Gillan on vocals for Deep Purple and recorded 3 albums in the mid 1970's just before Deep Purple broke up and I also had no idea that Whitesnake recorded some albums in the late 70's, I totally find that amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"White snake greatest hits","review":"Whitesnake greatest hits is a Great cd and was in great condition.

The recordings are superb on this disc. A nice clean, crisp, and loud sound. If you don't want to obtain all of Whitesnakes cd's or just want one to begin with this is the disk to get. Its a great introduction to they're music. David Coverdale sounds awesome as does the rest of the band. This cd starts out with a bang with STILL OF THE NIGHT, and their are many hits like, NOW YOU'RE GONE, FOOL FOR YOUR LOVIN, LOVE AIN'T NO STRANGER, SLOW AND EASY, JUDGEMENT DAY and many others. This will not disappoint. You can even get it used for under a buck through amazon.

David Coverdale, is a singer whose voice can only be compared to Robert Plant. This band is also known for it's excellent guitar players like John Sykes, Vivian Campbell, Adrian Vandenberg, and Steve Vai. They specialized in straight up rock n roll and smooth powerballads. This compilation has all their big hits, previously unreleased songs, and minor hits as well. Every song is excellent, especially the previously unreleased \\"Sweet Lady Luck\\".

I can\`t help but detect \\"shades of Deep Purple\\" (no pun intended here! :)) in some of their songs, esp. \\"Give Me All Your Love\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Hair","review":"Whitesnake were a great band in their day. However in the mid eighties they became a \\"big hair\\" band and ponced up Here I Go Again with some nasty keyboards and Poisonesque guitar. In short they made a mess of it. I don't care how good the rest of the album is, that just did it for me. The best Whitesnake albums in my humble little opinion are 'Live In The Heart of the City' and 'Lovehunter', the latter because of Medicine Man which is one of the best songs ever written and is probably still the best song in the world except for other songs that might be better than it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nomads","review":"The movie was relatively boring until the end when one finally understands what is going on. At the end when the two women are trying to escape the motorcycle rider and he stops at the border of California it violates the whole premise of the move as he has become a \\"Nomad\\" and cannot be stopped by any kind of borders.The acting was only fair and even Pierce Brosnan seemed stiff and uncomfortable in this role. And, as for the \\"male frontal nudity,\\" that's a joke too. Pierce is naked but the shadows are so dark nothing is visible in the scene.Save your time and money and see Pierce in \\"The Thomas Crown Affair.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Nomads: an eerie tale that isn't easily forgotten","review":"This is an 80s sleeper flick starring Pierce Brosnan with a very unusual plot.

It starred Christopher Lee, Betta St. John, Patricia Jessel, Venetia Stevenson, & Valentine Dyall, and was entitled CITY OF THE DEAD, or HORROR HOTEL here in the U.S. It tells the story of a young woman wishing to find out more about a particular witch that may or may not have survived burning at the stake. Needless to say, she finds out too much. I don't wish to elaborate on further plot details, suffice it to say that the scares are of the Val Lewton school of fright and are thus wonderful! The performances are of top caliber, in particular Lee, Jessel, and Dyall in rather sensationalistic roles. The other cast members also fare quite well thanks to director John Llewellyn Moxey's superb handling of an excellent screenplay.

His treatment of Lee, Grant, Lincoln, and the hundreds of other players during this episode of American history in nothing short of wonderous.Also, Winik's treatment of the irony sprinkled throughout the events of this month in history is great also. A clerks error and the confederate army starves. Starving armies don't remain in the field for very long. One can't help but wonder how different American history would have been had this minor mistake not taken place. (What happened to the food anyway?)Lincoln's revelation of the dream in which he is dead is chilling to say the least.I could recommend this book to anyone including Lee, Grant, and Lincoln."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm not a Civl War buff but I enjoyed this book","review":"I became interested in this subject after viewing the documentary on the History channel about the pivitol events at the end of the Civil War that saved our union. Mr Winik impressed me so I had to buy this book.No matter what one feels about the Civil War, this book shows that men of honor fought on both sides. This nation owes so much to men like General Lee and General Sherman. They were bitter enemies on the battle field but they were men of honor and they put this country ahead of their own causes after the war. This book will change how people view some of the main players in the Civil War. It shows that no matter how brutal men can be toward each other, there is always hope that man's goodness will prevail in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read and loved it; palpable military tension and more","review":"This is the only military-based history that I have read and loved, at least before \\"1776\\". Of course, it is not only about the military, as many other things happened in that month. But it really built up the palpable tension between Grant's and Lee's armies as they chased each other and met to end the war."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lawyer's summation for a guilty client.","review":"Good idea, some good information, at times good dramatic pacing. But Winik has a bee in his bonnet and his arguments about the likelihood of guerilla warfare after Appomatox are paper-thin. \\"Critics and ethicists today argue that his scorched-earth policies violated all the strictures of . . . justice in warfare,\\" he says of Sherman. His fawning over Jeff Davis is extraordinary. His language is often bombastic. Dresses in new clothes some of the old ideas - the war was really about states' rights, the slaves were treated benignly, the South had a noble heritage. History taken from primary sources belies these concepts. Argues the case, doesn't change the verdict."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"The most irritating thing to me about this book was the way the author would interrupt his own story about what is happening in the \\"present\\" (april '65) with character studies of the people involved.

To me, this was a boring book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloated History","review":"April 1865 is an excellent example of a long magazine piece that has been blown up into a full-length book. I found it tendentious as well as too clever by half. In addition I took great exception to his portrayal of Robert E. Lee as the acme of Civil War generals. Now, if you want to read an excellent book about the Civil War and beyond, try Jean Smith's biography of U.S. Grant. What a great read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated ahistorical journalistic pap","review":"This book is well written, which is about all the positive I would say for it. The book contains, as far as I could tell, absolutely nothing new. Just a retread, at a very high level, of numerous other works on the Civil War. Why was it needed to be an addition to the already huge Civil War literature? It was not! Why did it need that pretentious and overblown title? Must have been the publisher's choice, to sell more, since the book in no place makes the successful argument that this was the point that saved America."},{"rating":"2","title":"The month that created a nation","review":"The one problem I have with this book is the way that Winik portrays Lee and Grant. Lee's virtues are portrayed as heroic,and even his vices are depicted as the manifestations of a superior man. Grant on the other hand, comes across as a loser who basically bumbled his way into being the first Lieutenant General since Washington. I hope the reader won't take Winik's word on Grant but read instead one of the many good Grant biographies out there. My favorite is \\"Grant\\" by Jean Edward Smith.Despite that caveat, the author brilliantly illustrates what I have been saying much more clumsily for years. That is that the American Revolution did not end with the victory at Yorktown. The American Revolution did not truly create a nation until the end of the Civil War and the convulsions of reconstruction that followed. As Winik says, it could easily have turned out differently anywhere along the way.This is an excellent read: highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't listen to this book","review":"This book is painful to listen to. The publishers made a mistake by letting the author read it. His lispy voice does not make for good reading.

The first half is a \\"what if?\\" What if, instead of surrendering at Appomattox, Lee had taken to the hills and set up a guerrilla army? Winik likens this to the Viet Cong. He ignores that Lee's army is starving, exhausted, and just wants to go home. Winik uses sports write throughout. \\"Unlike a Washington, or a Jefferson....\\" I finally gave up when he misquoted Stanton's great comment on Lincoln's death, \\"now he belongs to the ages,\\" as \\"now he belongs to the angels.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"One of The Best History Books I Ever Read","review":"APRIL 1865 is a one of the best history book I ever read.Through detail and imagery, Jay Winik brings events and characters to life and tells an emotionally moving story, partly because he he able to see history from different perspectives.This book is certainly not dry, factual history.Winik clearly has a take on the forces that drive history, which he makes a strong case for.

It is anything but a military account. Winik reminds us that prior to the Southern Secession, some New England states had threatened to leave the Union over the War of 1812. And armed rebellion was nothing new either, when you consider that, as Winik points out, frontier farmers had fielded a small army to fight against Hamilton's whiskey tax. More startling was reading about Jefferson Davis's General Order Number 14, emancipating slaves who enlisted for the Confederacy. (Of course, civil rights in a future independent Confederate nation was another matter.) Winik makes the case that the South was really fighting for its independence, not slavery, and that whether the Union existed in perpetuity was, until this last secession, a question that had not been completely resolved....\\"April 1865\\" is a brilliant distillation, but still ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"So You Think You Knew About The Civil War?","review":"If one were to read only one book about the Civil War, this would be the book. Short on battle details but long on creating human beings out of historic characters.I live on the ground upon which the Battle of The Wilderness was fought and Winik brought new insight and feeling concerning the latter part of the war. He also did well in explaining the Confederate position in not demonizing all the Rebs.I did not award 5 stars because early on he made it clear that the peace could have turned out badly (as it did in many other civil wars) and I feel he reiterated this point more than necessary throughout the book. It is, however, a great book that I strongly recommend to all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not serious history, poorly organized","review":"I have usually enjoyed history written by non-academic historians like Nathaniel Philbrick, but Jay Wink's book was a tremendous bore. I'm familiar with the period, but not a Civil War buff per se, and I was extremely disappointed. The narrative is full of unsupported generalizations, attempts to get inside the head of historical actors without any documentation from letters or other sources, and attempts to wax poetic that wouldn't make it past a freshman composition professor. Professional historians have been trained to avoid these mistakes, but Wink falls head-first into every possible type of error. Finally, the book is poorly organized, throwing in a long section about Lincoln's upbringing only after 200 pages, completely out of place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely worth reading, even for non-history types.","review":"Jay Winik provides a new perspective on the turning point in one of our nation's most crucial times.

Unfortunately, Mr. Winik's skills do not extend to reading the book aloud.Mr. Winik reads his material at 78 RPM. He lacks diction, enunciation, and cadence. Every sentence is a challenge and a distraction. His multiple and misplaced emphases in each sentence comes straight from fifth grade. There is absolutely no consideration of the listening reader's desire to hear, grasp, absorb, and appreciate; there is no thought that the spoken word might have beauty and dignity. Why, why, is Mr. Winik the narrator? Is it ego or greed? Whatever it is, Mr. Winik, Please, Please, Never Do It Again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and Poorly Written","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. For readers not very familiar with this period in American history, maybe there are surprises here. But Winik covers no new ground (I'm not sure there is any new ground left in terms of books on the Civil War). I can't imagine people like me who have already read a lot about the Civil War would find any of this to be interesting. He's not a very good writer, either. He's pompous and pretentious at times--and at other times he just writes badly. For example, at one point he talks about \\"decapitating the seat of government.\\" How does one decapitate (literally, remove the head from) a seat? He gets certain historical facts wrong as well. I know this was a best seller and people just drool over it, but, really, it's not a very good book. If you want to learn about this particular time in our history, you can do a lot better."},{"rating":"2","title":"civil war excerpt","review":"an excellent accounting of one crucial month that ended the war and ended pres; Lincoln.. first rate.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Military Analysis Suspect","review":"The author dedicates a good portion of the first half of the book to a praising description of the life of Lee. He seems to argue that Lee saved the country by not ordering a guerilla war. Grant's strategy which brought the war to a close in 1864-65 is not mentioned.The second half of the book is much more interesting, especially the discussion on the development of the role of the vice-president.I would not recommend the book to someone looking for an introduction to the Civil War."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read for those interested in American history.","review":"I really loved this book. I have always been interested in American history, but have never before been very educated about the Civil War. This book changed all of that. The writer does a wonderful job of making you feel as if you were there for the month of April 1865. Most importantly, Winik sheds a light on the Civil War that makes us view the war in a new and different way, showing us just how fragile the nation was for the first 100 years of its infancy. Finally, on a pure entertainment level, the book reads at times like a suspense novel. In particular, the sequence where Lee and his men are trying to outrun Grant's forces, until they arrive at Appomattox, is particularly gripping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Certainly gives the reader reason to think...what if?","review":"I read for entertainment and to learn...not to be bored. Thiswonderful work certainly fulfilled the former rather than thelater! I've enjoyed reading \\"history\\" for forty years yet stilldiscovering books which still teach & excite are as welcomeas a fine scotch and a good cigar. Pages 253-272 covering theshooting of Lincoln to the swearing in of Andrew Johnson certainly attests to our nations strength"},{"rating":"2","title":"The first \\"saga\\" I didn't want to get to the end of","review":"Jay Winik writes in a most moving and elogent style. The book is a masterpiece, filled with historical and moral value. I loved it and I am not a Civil War buff. April 1865 is a must read, trust me you will not want it to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spotty Scholarship","review":"While I consider myself something of a history buff, I've never really gotten the Civil War bug. This year my parents tried to draw me in with \\"April 1865\\".While I liked many of the Winik's observations and tangents, even a cursory scan revealed errors that a good fact checker should have caught. Compounding these simple errors were stilted classical allusions that seemed either incredibly obscure or incorrect.As a neophyte, I gained a fair bit of information on the War and the primary actors. I only wish that I could trust the strength of Winik's scholarship. As it is, I feel like I'll need to do follow up reading just to accept Winik's arguments.This is not what I would have expected given the warm praise on the backcover."},{"rating":"1","title":"Author pleased with himself","review":"There is much to be thought and said about April 1865, unfortunately author Winik says too much, thinks too little, and makes too much of himself. Reads like an undergraduate thesis--\\"Lions and tigers and bears, oh My.\\" Read any of the standard histories of the Civil War; they are better."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to clear a room quickly; put on a cassette of April 1865","review":"Yes, you can get rid of everyone the instant Jay Winik starts to drone through his book. What torture. Who let him read it? What kind of editor let this book go to print? I could forgive his awful reading, but only slightly, if this book were interesting and well written. It is neither. He continually puts thoughts into historical figures' heads. He overuses adjectives to the point of excess. Someone should ban him from using 'and' more than twice in a sentance. Need I continue?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Far from \\"amazing\\" and \\"incredible\\".","review":"Being required to read this book for school is the only reason I would have ever picked up this book. However, after the first 50 pages, I have decided to spare my brain from this utter nonsense.Winik spends far too long on unnecessary subjects such as the various meats and other foods served at Lincoln's inauguration. While the narrative on Monticello may be interesting to some, it served no purpose to why April 1865 was the month that saved America.Instead of trying to show readers that he is, in fact, an excellent writer who has done far too much research and therefore tries to shove every single fact he found into a 388 page book, Winik should focus on his thesis and not on his arrogant attitude and increasing sense of drama."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audio Tape Review","review":"This is an enjoyable book with a lot of interesting information. However, the audiocassette version is a prime example of why an author SHOULD NOT be the reader of their book! It is torture to listen to the tapes and the recording performance distracts from the subject.It sounds just like someone reading a text when they are unfamiliar with the material. The intonations are off, the emphasis is in the wrong places, and punctuation is missing or unnoticeable. Words are mispronounced and parts sound like disjointed or long run on sentences.Buy the book and you'll enjoy it! Buy the audio version and you'll probably regret it! I've listened to several hundred audiobooks and this is one of the most difficult to tolerate."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you read one book on history this year, make it this one.","review":"Jay Winik's \\"April 1865\\" is a gem. I hesistated to read this book as I have read rather extensively on this period of U.S. history and wanted to expand the scope of my knowledge to other topics. I am so glad that I couldn't help myself. Winik does not hesitate to express an opinion and back it up factually. His research is obviously extensive and his ability to convey just how precariously the future of our Union was after Lee's surrender and Lincoln's assasination is riviting. The author's use of collective reference rather than numerical citation makes the read that much more enjoyable. This belongs with McPhearsons \\"Battle Cry of Freedom\\" and David Herbert Donald's \\"Lincoln\\" on the bookshelf of any budding historian."},{"rating":"1","title":"Introduction raises serious scholarship questions","review":"I was reading the introduction to Winik's book, and it seemed somehow familiar. Then, it hit me: it's almost identical to William Manchester's brilliant introduction to his book on Winston Churchill. I pulled out both books and couldn't believe how closely Winik's introduction parallels Manchester -- so much so that it raises issues of whether its plagierized. While I'm enjoying the book, it does make me wonder if other parts of the book likewise lack originality????"},{"rating":"2","title":"Young Gunz","review":"The young gunz cd is a most have for any real hip-hop fan.

Its more on Memphis Bleeks level. Young Chris definately holds up his end, but Neef is weak. But, you don't have to like the lyrics because the beats are straight fire. The Roc right now has the best production around, and they can make anyone sound good. If Young Gunz became Young Gun, and dropped Neef, I think the CD would be closer to five stars. As it is, it gets a solid four stars. The Roc is definately taking over tho...Kanye West, Memphis Bleek, Twista, Young Gunz, Beanie Sigel, Juelz Santana, Cam'ron, Freeway, M.O.P., Just Blaze, and oh by the way Jay-Z too...Who can stop em'?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Young Gunz - Can't Get Any Better...Cop This 1, 4 Real...","review":"Speechless, The Roc is without a doubt on top, hands down...only crew I can think off top that's close is that D.T.P. out of Ludacris's camp otherwise none that I can think of.CD is just about perfect, amazing first major release.

I've been on this debut for a long minute cuz i've downloaded a bunch of unreleased songs and freestyles from these youngsters and they're official. Chris is the hottest rapper on the roc since Jay put the mic down and neef can hold his own. To be real, Chris is sick with the flow and he can ride a beat better than anyone out at the moment. you can tell he put a lot into this project and neef may be holding him back a little but this is still a solid debut effort and i would advise anyone into lyrics more than crunk music to get this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still on Blast!!!","review":"I bought this CD the day it came out in Philly, I was in HS and i left class to go down the block and cop it. i spent all day in shool listening to the CD, I remember saying to a buddy that i thought this was the best CD i heard all year!!!

This cd is straight blazin from the first track \\"Future of the roc\\" to the spectacual \\"Never take me alive(would've been better without gay-z though).\\" People need to stop hatin on these guys because this is true hip-hop. They may have a few hip-pop songs on here, but most of the cd is blazin. Im glad gay-z retired and hopefully he doesnt come back. I think rocafella will shine now that gay-z retired, because it will give other artists a chance to shine and showcase their talent. I never really thought gay-z had any talent anyway.

Tracks like \\"Look In Your Eye\\" and \\"Tough Luv\\" I had heard months ago, and they're like the two hottest so they're weren't fresh to me, but others like $$$ Girl and Friday Night, once listen to again were definitly bangin.

It seemed like te story was unfocused, and more attention was paid to humorous bits or litle side-tracks than to the actual plot. Add to that a villain who really wasn't very threatening or menacing, and other characters who weren't as interesting as theyusually are in the series, and this book gets a D in my book. Oh well.

The band seems to never try too hard to make a good song but what tumbles out here is gold. Out of print, I believe, but worth the price if you can get it, I guess, it depends on the price.

The Rakes have more in common with early punk than say, Franz Ferdinand, but the true calling is the current climate of post punk freshness that seems to be sweeping the BBC airwaves. A bit tidier than The Others, less polished than Maximo Park, The Rakes find a nice home with their smooth, yet crunchy, punk-dance-rock.Everyone talks about how this is a good record with 4 great singles on it, and little else. I couldn't disagree more. Personally, I find the song Binary Love one of the best, non-singles of the year. The 4 singles to date (Retreat, Strausborg, Work Work Work, 22 Grand Job) are truely great and really bring up a record that basically doesn't have a weak moment on it. So if you park your car in the Garage next to the Kaiser Chiefs and Maximo Park, enjoy the ride the Rakes will give you."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of 2006's Better New Releases","review":"If you're looking for a great album from start to finish, look no further than the Rakes' Capture/Release. One of the albums to be in constant rotation on my 06 playlist, Capture/Release is pure rock'n roll. From the ridiculous guitar riff on \\"22 Grand Job\\" to the Clash-esque chorus of \\"Violent,\\" the Rakes will have you pounding off solos on the ol' air guitar and wondering why all debuts can't be this much fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"really cool and sharp","review":"This knife is exactly as pictured.

Benedict's succinct way of giving us the teachings of the Church in a manner the average person can easily understand. This book does just this on the subject of revelations. If you have ever wondered about the difference between public and private revelation or if you or anyone you know believes they are the recipient of revelation, read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forbidden Magic - Truly Magical","review":"I don't know what the other reviewers were reading because I found this book delightful and quite, to the point, magical! I found Sax to be absolutely delightful, sexy, fun, and needy. I found Meg to be charming and also needy. They each saved one another. The entire household was a blast, including and especially the pets! The dialog just so spicy, sensual and fun! I'm wondering if these other people read the same book as I did!Granted, I am a big FAN of Jo Beverley, but I truly enjoyed this Regency romp and was sorry to see it end! Maybe the sister Laura's story could come next? Definitely a keeper!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip This One...","review":"I have to echo the opinions of several previous reviewers who pointed out how far-fetched and unbelievable this plot was. Even if you suspend belief enough to buy the Shellagh-ma-gig, why is Meg so afraid to tell Sax about it? How could she think he would actually believe that she \\"forced\\" him into marrying her by wishing on a statue? Good grief! Plus the Grandmother is way over the top while being a cardboard character - we never really understand her motivations. If it weren't for Sax (and the rating system), I wouldn't have given this book even one star. Ironically, I read this book based on the opinion of a reviewer at a romance novel website. She considered it a \\"Desert Isle Keeper\\". I wonder, did she read the same book I did?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I give this book one star only because of the following few good points: (1) Sax is extremely handsome and falls head over heals for \\"plain\\" Meg; (2) Sax has a soft heart and loves his pet who has a deformed mouth and employs servants who have physical or other problems.I can think of nothing more that is positive about this story. When the characters finally have sex (I can't construe it as making love), it is accompanied by ridiculously inane conversation. With about 40 pages to go, I cared so little for the characters that I put the book down, will never finish it, and have not the slightest curiosity regarding its ending.For beautiful stories with well-developed plots and characters, read the author's _The Shattered Rose_, _Dark Champion_, and _Lord of Midnight_."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun, lighthearted read........","review":"\\"Forbidden Magic\\" was such a delight to read!! This book was full of colorful characters. I LOVED Sax and Meg together. What a sweet story. This book didnt make my keepers list, but it is DEFINITELY a fun way to pass an afternoon..I would recommend it it without hesitation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical, spellbinding, and absolutely fabulous!","review":"I love romance, but most of the novels out now a days are trashy and are all about copulation. Forbidden Magic was well done, and actually had a story. It was a woderful mix of magic, love and passion. Meg is a charming character full of life and spunk from her naughty undergarments to her shy demur way. I found Sax to be a marvlous character, with his temper and his love for stray unwanted animals. He is quite eccentric and just what I would want in a husband. Mrs. Beverly did a fabulous job on this story and I throughly recomend it. This was the first book I've read writen by Mrs. Beverly and you can be sure that it will not be the last!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast and fun","review":"Meg is an impoverished heroine who wishes on a magic stone figure for a better life for herself and her four siblings, and the answer to her wish comes in the form of the Earl of Saxonhurst who must marry immediately or be stuck with the bride his evil grandmother chooses for him. Hijinks ensue when she leaves the statue in her old house and tries to retrieve it without his knowledge.The good:The humor. From the witty dialogue to the eccentric characters, including a mysogynistic parrot.The emotions. They're clear and on the page. Sax's habit of taking out his frustrations on the inanimate objects in his bedroom is particularly well done. As is Meg's guilt over having won Sax by magic warring with her desire to provide for and protect her siblings.The bad:I'd give this an extra half star, but Meg's stubborn insistence on not telling anyone anything went on just a wee bit too long.The verdict:A thoroughly delightful, romantic read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story, terrible cover.","review":"I first read this story a few years ago and went looking for it again. Full of wit and charm I definitely recommend this story for those who like old time love tales. Sax is both smart and kind, a welcome change to some of the more brusque heroes. My only qualm would be the cover art which indicates a cheap, teenage romance. Do none of these people know about marketing? I am ashamed to look at the thing but it doesn't diminish my love of the plot!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea","review":"While I found parts of the story here and there to be interestingI didn't particularly enjoy the book. The plot wasn't developedenough, nor were the characters in the book. And I found theheroines repeated thoughts over whether the earl was mad to betiresome, also her guilty thoughts that she had somehow \\"forced\\"the earl to marry her because of the sheelagh-ma-gig to beridiculous. He married her because he made quick decisions, shedidn't have any magic power over him. She should loosen up andenjoy life and knock off the guilt trips."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very entertaining romp.....","review":"Hmmm... my first thought is - Meg WAS NOT good enough for Sax!!! I am not refering to financial or physical aspects either! They would not have had half the trouble they did if she had just believed in him a little more! (of course the story would have been MUCH shorter! lol) However, other than that she was a good character.I totally loved Sax & all of his misfit household. They were such an enjoyable & fun group.This was a different flavor of Regency than I'm use to reading. I'll have to say though that it was a nice change of pace. JB really does a good job of coming up with original storylines. I'll be continuing to pick up more of her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Quite Work for Me","review":"I was given a different brand of Melatonin called Nature's Bounty Maximum Strength 10 mg in the hospital after back surgery.

When I was discharged my husband purchased this item, Vitamin Shoppe 3 mg Melatonin.Vitamin Shoppe 3 mg doesn't keep me asleep. I am drowsy 1 hour after taking it but I am awake 2 hours later and I'm up every 2 hours throughout the night.

Although the topics found in the book provide a good introduction to cultural theory. This text is used as a college text at my school and I am not the only one to complain.

It contains a lot of useful codes that are commented and easy to understand. For the advanced user there isn't much to get.

Very well finished, very shiny, decent proportions (teaspoon bowl touch too big but at least it's not super long and big like many contemporary sets - what are people doing with these monster teaspoons beats me).They are heavy, and I think essentially unbendable. But there is one fatal flaw related to heft. The weight is all in end of the handle. You can't normally lift them without them violently swinging up. There is no way they will stay on plate if the handle extends a little bit past the edge. They are also too thick to be comfortable to hold.Last but not least Amazon lists them as made in Korea, but they are made in China."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomplicated","review":"If you like your western straight-forward and predictabe, and the writing simpistic and uncomplicated, well then this is the Slocum for you. It's not that it's bad, it's just that it's not very good. In this Slocum, he rides into town to help out a friend from his Quantrill days who is in a range war. And you know how it ends--the opposing side from the ranch the Sixgun, bites the dust and winds up in the cemetery, hence Sixgun Cemetery. About as simple as they get, but a quick read if you just want to kill a couple of hours. Not many pages, and you won't need a dictionary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far from his best","review":"For years I have bought every novel Dick Francis has written and was disappointed with only one. Now there are two. This collection contains what appear to be magazine short stories. There is virtually no character development and not much plot development either.

For example, Dr. Borba points out, early in the book, that family conditions help nurture the self-esteem of children. Meaning, all of the exercise and tips in this book may be meaningless if the parent doesn't have the ability to authentically mirror the behaviors they are attempting to teach their children.To assist in further action for parents, she has also included several resources (books, videos, and web sites) at the end of each chapter. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely Important Parenting Book","review":"I consider myself to be a well educated, caring person with a lot of common sense, however this book has been a real eye opener on human nature and how to nurture our children to grow to their greatest potential.

It was really common sense! Things like don't label your child such as \\"clumsy\\" or don't compare your child to their siblings.

Their music is indie rock with a definite punk edge, but nothing that you wouldn't want to dance to. I love the fantastic, clear British accent of Alan Donohoe, and the lyrics he sings are cleverly fun without being too serious. \\"Retreat\\" has to be one of the best songs I've heard this year, with its catchy tune and carefree message.

This is the first one that actually does real dance stuff. I am very pleased with it in that regard, however the video is almost like a throwback to the 80s with crazy colors and weird instructors. It can get dull because the drums sound exactly the same the whole time, but if you're looking for a real dance video (not like those MTV Grind videos) this is a winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Great","review":"There are three sections in this video. Unfortunately, the first dance section is terrible. The instructor counts out steps but never tells you what you're doing. Because there's no vocal instruction, it's nearly impossible to follow the dance movements and watch the video at the same time (most of the steps require a frequent head-down position). The video is very poorly filmed with too many tight shots on the upper bodies of the dancers, making it difficult to see the dance movements. The instructor also wears a filmy skirt that makes it impossible to see her movements clearly. If you are a trained dancer and have a good command of dance terms, you might be okay with this video. You will also need a space the size of a small rehearsal hall, not the small space most home exercisers have. The other two workouts were all right, although also with unfortunatly selected framing for a fitness video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good even for beginners","review":"I haven't excersized much, but I've always wanted to dance since I was little.

I was very disappointed to start it and see that it is the very same video I have been using all these years and not something new.With that said, it is a good workout form me because it is very similar to a real dance class. I just don't like being tricked into buying a second one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dance, Dance, Dance","review":"Well besides the fact that I combine section 2 with other Method videos and don't use part one much at all, this is a well rounded dance workout that is fun and do-able.The first section is fun but you need allot of space and you have to put up with Kries's \\"abstract\\" dancing. I think this section is hard, eventhough I am a dancer, but it is the style and space I have a problem with.The second section is excellent, much shorter, but excellent. It is more up beat and jazzy, it doesn't require much space and the cuing and explanations are better. I enjoy mixing this section with section three of the Method's Cardio Bootcamp and part one of Precision Toning (these tapes are great)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recommended!","review":"I have no dance experience so I was bit hesitant about buying this video. I have no regrets after using it for 3 months. It takes a couple of tries before you get the hang of the movements but once you do, you feel energized, toned and great!

I've seriously studied many types of dance, enrolled in movement courses as well as played various sports over the course of my lifetime, but nothing could have prepared me for this video.

I am not weak, and had to use a metal tube extension on the end of a 3 foot breaker bar, and pull with all my strength to break it free - I actually thought the breaker bar itself was going to snap.

I picked up those up at the nearby Harbor Freight for about $12-$15 bucks a piece.

I just put it in the crank pulley, shimmed it to keep it from wiggling, and let the handle torque against the car body while I worked on the bolt with a large breaker bar. The bolt took about 400 ft-lbs to release, but the tool held its ground. If you are doing this for the first time, you'll also need a 2' extender on a 19 mm socket, and the largest 1/2\\" socket breaker bar + cheater bar you can get your hands on.

The bolt came free with a startling bang. Borrowed the breaker bars from a national auto parts chain. Easy to put the bolt back on that requires a 90 degree tightening after torqued to the pulley. Just get this tool if you are seriously considering doing it yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must have tool for your Honda.","review":"This reasonably priced tool is well worth the purchase price. This simple tool will make removing the crank pulley simple and save time. There are other methods of removing the pulley, but too often people mistakenly use ineffective methods that damage the brittle crank pulley, like chains.

It only dubs when it feels like it. Once it started flashing blue, displayed the term \\"LOADING\\" and wouldn't allow me to operate my television for a day and a half. This thing makes Regan in The Exorcist look like a beginner. Tonight it ate a tape. And frequently it only plays tapes that somehow are to it's liking.

I think it's their way to improve their response time. Anyway, it didn't matter because they had no record of my package. They told me the service center is so backed up that they didn't even log my package yet.The next week, I found out that they logged my box. Well, I asked them how long will it take to fix it.

I have never had this problem with a VCR - you just put the tape in the door slot, it takes the tape, closes the door, and then plays. So thinking this was a new feature, I gently pushed the tape into the machine - it did not play and would not eject. I had to use a screwdiver and knife to remove the tape. I returned the machine.

Three months later it now flashed 'loading loading' and does not work at all. Again I have to pay $20 to ship it back to JVC.

I would not recommed buying this product until JVC can get the bugs worked out.Also,the instruction manual is poorly written so it does not give much information on trouble shooting especially when the machine starts flashing.I have had good luck with other JVC products in the past, but this experience is giving me second thoughts about buying another JVC product.

But it really wasn't at all. The advice is very conservative and solid... As someone \\"just starting out\\" this seems like great information to have.

As I kept reading, though, it became increasingly apparent that this guy was just trying to sell copies of his book, and didn't have much worthwhile information to say. He constantly repeats that he is showing you how to \\"get rich\\" without providing any substantive advice. He repeats lists that have little or no value, including things like \\"Work Hard\\" over and over again.From the outside in it seems great, but after going through it you will have learned very little from the book. All of the worthwhile information in the book could be sufficiently summarized in two paragraphs. I find it hard to believe that most of the other reviewers actually read the entire book.

This book is tailored for young men and women, who are entering the workforce or are still in college, and want to start building their fortune now. Masterson uses his direct experience to convey time-honored principles of managing and improving your personal finances, while introducing the concept of intra-preneuring as a way to learn the fine art of selling tied directly to the company's profits, so as you make more for the company, you receive more as well.If you are young and ready to start making money, this is a great book for those willing to take action."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael Masterson does great... again!","review":"I bought \\"Automatic Wealth for Grads... And Anyone Else Just Starting Out\\" for my daughter's 19th birthday. She read Automatic Wealth a year ago and loved it! (Even though she said that Mr. Masterson sounded too arrogant.) I told her that he was only giving out advice that worked for him to build his wealth. So... when Michael Masterson published his book for grads... I just had to buy it for my daughter. I gave it to her a couple of days ago and she told me last night that she was getting more out of this book than the first. I have to admit that I snuck a peek at her book before I gave it to her. I thought it had more detailed information than his original version. He breaks down his information in easy to follow steps and descriptions. Now I will have to buy it for my library! She said that I can not borrow it... she is stingy with her library collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"FALSE COMMENTS. DELETED REVIEWS","review":"Negative reviews of this book (including the highest rated, most detailed ones) have been removed. Beware of the reviews here. There is very little useful content in this book and all of it can be found online (e.g. compound interest). A lot of the advice centers on real estate which was useful in the 80s, but is no longer applicable. Moreover, a lot of the anecdotes about how he succeeded will not be possible for most people. For instance, few people will have opportunities to make really major contributions to their companies that will be recognized by a very generous boss who will give huge pay raises. Check it out at the bookstore or the library to see if the book is helpful for you, but it will be a waste of money for most people. This is why most of the negative reviews and the most detailed reviews have been deleted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift","review":"I didn't read the book myself, but I did peruse it.

The front wheel could not be put on the bike because the arms were not aligned. How can they make a bike so obviously defective and try to sell it? IF the bike had been correctly manufactured, it would have been the perfect bike for my 13 year old son. The quality of the bike itself was OK, a few things probably should have been a bit more quality, like the pedals, they were plastic, not good for $169. I'd say if you are a serious biker, this is not the bike for you. If you ride a bike for lesiure or family time, it would be fine.Buying through Amazon was great, I was able to return the bike, free shipping, and was credited back the $169. I love buying from Amazon, they make it so easy for you, if your purchase doesn't work out. So don't tear the box up until you know the bike is a keeper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best A+ prep","review":"This was the first book I bought when I decided to pursue a tech career, and I couldn't have made a better choice.

Most of the information is trivial but that is exactly what the A+ exam is. I suggest reading the book a chapter at a time and reviewing the information before moving on to the next. For additional help I would suggest the Exam Cram book because many of the questions in the book were on the exam I took or were so closely worded that they were nearly identical. If you're going to take the exam, buy this book and if you still want more practice, buy the Exam Cram book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well written","review":"This book was very well written. Everything you ever wanted to know about the A+ test is in it. It might be a little too much information if you are going to take the A+ test. This book is very thick.

It basically boils down to downloading 4 exe files from 3 different sources, changing the folder the disc wants to download to and rebooting about 2X.All in all, way too much then what should have to be done to view a simple video training demo.Do yourselves a favor, STAY AWAY FROM OSBORNE BOOKS WITH CDs.Its not worth the trouble.

I used nothing else except this book to study. The only thing I found I did not like about the book was that it covered all 4 tests, so there was a lot of information that I did not need to study for....guess a little extra information never hurt anyone.

I wish I had bought the book at the start of my Instructor lead program instead of in the middle.As far as I was concerned the book was extremely readable not dry at all. So re-reading and/or studying was not that much of a chore.

The best thing about this book is the practice exams it gives you on the CD. Taking the practice exams prepared me alot, because the questions are very similiar to the real CompTIA exams.

They're all fantastic, but Buoni O Cattivi is my favorite...it's a bit 'harder' than the others (more heavy guitar and less sax) and the guitar riffs are sometimes reminiscent of Metallica.

Needless to say, this book is not very helpful. It seems many very important topics extremely relevant to pediatric primary care are either not in the book or are very briefly mentioned.

The story was extremely slow-moving and nothing ever seemed to happen. I skipped ahead a lot of pages before anything ever happened, and even when it sort of did, it was boring. I'm just not that into the everyday minutia of raising kids even though I've done it. I want a story with adventure and excitement and this definitely didn't have any."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charming and Funny","review":"The follow up to \\"Hens Dancing\\" features Venetia continuing to struggle with independence and autonomy. Her love from the previous book, David, is out of the country and Venetia fears he has permanently abandoned her. (Despite the fact that he regularly communicates with her boys, sends gifts and even arranges for the delivery of a rather profane parrot - that story alone is worth reading the book.) Venetia's sodden mother, her slacker brother and his wedding and \\"the beauty's\\" continued progression are the stand out features of this book. The story line with Hedley Sale, her volcanically tempered maybe/maybe not fiancée is less engaging.The book is a bit more melancholy than Hen's Dancing, but it is still laugh out loud hilarious. I am so hoping that this is not the last we hear from Venetia."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic","review":"this album came out when i was still in high school and man did it just save me. first that same year sonic youth released washing machine witch was another amazing album they had done, but this just grab me from the first song \\"queen bee and her pals\\" i couln't stop playing it. and til this day i will play it, and memories of my high school will come back. thurston an amazing artist and great poet. if u ever get the chance to find this cd get it and play believe me it rocks. also if u ever find it on record get it. the record i have is clear green vinyl. and the other lp is black but turn it over and it has skecthes on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brains of the outfit","review":"It's obvious who the real artistic force behind Sonic Youth is - Thurston Moore.

I was so disappointed to find out that for $50 the DVDs did not even have chapters or subtitles.

I was shocked to see season 2 is only made on demand and is almost doubled what season one was. This is probably in my opinion the best season, if for nothing else because of Lana Turner's guest appearances and show downs with Jane Wyman. I think it is a shame as with other series on dvd that greed has krept again. If the manufacturers were not so greedy, they would realize they would get more sales at an affordable price. Many fans would buy this for Lana Turner alone.

However, I bought the first season on DVD on a whim after falling in love with such shows as Dallas and Knots Landing. I was blown away by virtually every aspect of the show. However, hiking up the prices on this second season's DVD set is simply unacceptable . . . production quality is reprehensible, and everything about this LOOKS, SOUNDS, and FEELS like it came from the eighties. Someone should have at least TRIED here, especially for what they're charging!

Rand combines the old west with the weird and deals up a winning hand each time. Each story has its charm but if I had to pick one that stood out, it would probably be \\"A Spider Poor Cowboy Rapt and Wide Lemon,\\" which title makes sense if you say it aloud and allow for some linguistic drift. In this story, a ghost decides to settle in the saloon, and the regulars have to exorcise it to save the business.The stories are all cleanly written, with almost no verbal cellulite and are a pleasure to read. This book represents, to me, money well spent.If I have to mention a problem, it's a very small one; the stories were originally published in magazines and weren't edited for the collection, so there are small bits of redundancy, but the glitch is a minor one, and the stories are major fun.I'll be looking forward to reading more of Ken Rand's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Egyptology Handbook","review":"This was disappointing -- I expected a large DK-like book, but this is small and not nearly as much information in it as expected.

Now, I have spent a lot of money and I am very dissapointed with the SACD stereo mix sound quality. I can't stand the harsh sound in my headphones (top level stuff both headphones and amplifier) and in my ATC loudspeakers the thing does not improve very much. Everything is louder, the mix and EQ is a completely disaster. For me the sound quality is essential to enjoy music, so if you look for this, better try the remastered old CD's (The Tricks of the tail MFSL LP version blows SACD away). The visual extras are not really new at all (for very very fans at least) .

I was worried I'd be super dissapointed. Plus, I wasn't sure about which version of the box set I was purchasing (SACD-DVD, DTS, etc..). Finally, I went with my first choice which was the DTS version. I was absolutely knocked out by the sound quality in DTS and also the clarity of the vocals, the music... Frankly, I can't wait for the next installment of the Genesis box set (hopefully, it will be the first version with Gabriel at the helm and also other footage and rarities). I also hope they will put out the live albums with rarities and (another wishful thinking) complete shows or song additions not yet on CD or DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"GENESIS IS GENESIS","review":"About this box set well I must concur with other reviewers that the European version which includes SACD is the best option but really expensive. I bought 4 of the SACD version and then bought the US box set. Yes, yes I'm a big Genesis fan that's why I did this crazy purchase.

ChangeOne is really the first program that seems 1) thoroughly sensible and 2) truly sustainable. Rather than changing you overnight, it teaches you step by step how to eat healthy and smart for the rest of your life. No calorie counting, no points, no protein or carb gram tallying, just sensible portions, healthy foods, and a positive, energetic approach to life. The portion-specific food photos are wonderfully instructive, and the quizzes, success stories, recipes, and tips are fun and motivating. I'm off to great start, and believe that Change One will be the last diet I'll ever need.This is the perfect weight-loss program for people sick of gimmicks, weird science, and yo-yo dieting.

The Hopewell experience reminds me most of the crushing joyful feeback accomplishments of the traditional heavies, like Velvet Underground, as well as the masters of more recent noisy neo-psychedelia, including the Flaming Lips, rather than of the lighter Merry-Go-Round or Beatles production style of bands like Kula Shaker. This stuff actually vibrates its way into your head.For those who started with the later work of \\"Hopewell & the Birds of Appetite,\\" as I did, you will find the vocals heavily buried under the roiling harmonic noise. For me: a very good thing, though others may prefer the more lyrical sound of the later work. This album has replaced everything else in my CD changer for the moment."},{"rating":"2","title":"some great psychedelic noise","review":"Composed of three memebres of Mercury Rev and friends of theirs, Hopewell isn't what you'd expect Merucry Rev to sound like. However the psychedelic element is still present. The guitars of course have a great presence on the album and sound dreamy, noisy, as every good guitar should.

Every time she spoke someone would get hurt or bruised.I know the all words by memory to all the songs. However, I have a personal favorite, \\"Sandlewood.\\" Because there was a guy once who smelled wonderful and his hair did fall soft like animalss.

But, this is a fine album. Lisa's band is tight and competent. The production and mixing of the CD are excellent. Lisa's voice, of course, is the highlight. Her voice is sublime and can send chills down my spine; vigorous, yet vulnerable. I was stuck on this album for quite a while and still enjoy listening to it from time to time. Her lyrics are one of the weaker points, though. It's not that they're bad, just not what they might be, sometimes confusing and, worst of all, sometimes trite and simplistic. Her sentiments are heartfelt, but her ability to capture them with words can still use some work. In any case, this album is well worth it. I was quite disappointed with her second album. She is a cutie, though, and that doesn't hurt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music from a talented artist","review":"This album is wonderful! Lisa Loeb has an amazing voice and the songs are great.

Unless you are doing research in this area and absolutely can't find any other source of information, I would say Don't Buy This. I now realize all the Men-At-Arms series are probably all the same. Instead of compiling all three Roman Military Clothing booklets into one half-respectable \\"book\\", they opted to split up the materials and make more money.

There are sections on calling, handloading, varmint hunting associations, competition, tracking, camoflaging one's gun, shotguns, handguns, and of course, the various varmint rifle cartridges. It's a shame this book is out of print because it truly conveys the excitement and fascination of hunting, and no doubt could help draw more people into the sport, were it more widely available."},{"rating":"2","title":"An amazing recording!","review":"I first heard tract one of the album on the radio whilst working in London - and I thought that was great! It took me two years to pluck up the courage to buy a jazz recording. And 'We Live Here' was it!Whenever I'd pick-up the album it would be for track one. Then one day I started the recording at track four and fell in love with jazz. An amazing escapist track!The rest of the album does not disappoint in the least, and I am now glad to have at least one jazz recording in my music collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jazz at its most accessible","review":"This is Pat at his most pleasing and outgoing. Great jazz musicians like Miles and Satchmo also had this ability to put out albums that have wide appeal. For me this album had the same kind of stature in the 90's that a classic album like Brubeck's \\"Take Five\\" had in the fifties and early sixties. The album reaches out to the listener, but still has enough sophistication to please more demanding critics. Not all of the songs obtain the same heights as the best material on this album, but there are no clunkers.This is one of the albums that I would like all jazz reviewers to review, just so I can know to ignore, or at least hold suspect, those who pan it. If you are snobby enough not to like this pleasing music, then your tastes are wildly divergent from mine."},{"rating":"1","title":"soooo disappointing","review":"no i dont like this cd, sure it got some nice tunes, but it's not the pat i used to know. It's no where near the output of for example \\"the road to you\\" which in my opinion is pat's greatest record all time together with \\"travels\\". pmg i s a live band and the studio cuts just don't do the trick. back to this record, i think there's too much experimenting with modern hip hop kinda rythms, which all in all end up silly. \\"red sky\\" has a nice tune, you know the \\"infinite-loop\\" that could be repeated again and again and again kinda tune that pat do so well, just like \\"song for bilbao\\" or in the end of \\"third wind\\", but then it doesn't do much more than that. too bad, i think they could have done so much more than simply adding what sounds like synth trumpets. no i'd skip this cd if i was you. ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"drummer?","review":"This is the worst Methney album I have heard to date. Although it has some great guitar playing in parts most of the CD is totally ruined by monotonous hip-hop beats which,in my opinion, have no place in jazz. Where's the freedom and improvization which jazz is known for? In fact, I'm not even convinced the drummer was playing at all. For most of the set it sounds as if the drummer switched on the drum machine and went out for a smoke. There are a lot of good Methney albums out there, but this is not one of them. Save you money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing PMG album","review":"WE LIVE HERE is the most disappointing of all the Pat Metheny Group albums in that it is full of cookie-cutter, jazz fusion fluff and watered down, relatively uninteresting melodies -- Pat is capable of so much more. I can honestly say that none of the tunes really grab me. \\"Here to Stay\\" is fairly standard, upbeat Metheny -- what one might deem the \\"hit single\\" from the album -- but even this pales in comparison to other songs on PMG albums. It feels like Metheny and Co. were simply going through the motions on this album. Following Pat's accomplished solo album SECRET STORY (one of his all-time best) which was a should-have-been PMG album, WE LIVE HERE is just not up to the same standards."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Metheny's best","review":"Get it.

This is one satisfied customer, encouraging you to enjoy the experience as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jazz that grows on you","review":"Initially i thought there was something questionable about this album...maybe too smooth or something. Possibly the seamlessly smooth integration of Metheny's synth quitar with Lyle's great piano and the excellent vocal support..Blaimes et al.

CPR has a lot of C--David Crosby--in it, but Croz himself will readily acknowledge that the P (Jeff Pevar) and the R (James Raymond) are equal partners in the sound that CPR produces. And what a sound it is! It's a team effort, combining great songwriting with beautiful, soaring harmonies. This album ranges from soft, haunting ballads (\\"Eyes Too Blue,\\" \\"Breathless\\") to old-time rockers (\\"Katie Did\\"), all with lyrics that get your attention and make you think. Pevar's fine guitar work fits right in with Raymond's angelic tenor (and songwriting ability) and Crosby's well-honed sense of how it should all blend together. Steve DiStanislao on percussion and Andrew Ford on bass provide just the right amount of support to the mix. Make room in your CD collection for \\"Just Like Gravity\\": this music will earn a special place in your heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lisa","review":"I am converted! this stuff is medicine to my dry skin but still very light which is is essential when living in the tropics.

The moves look easy but I definitely felt them working and I started to notice results pretty quickly. I also thought it was really convenient because I could just pop it in and do pilates whenever it fit my schedule.This dvd is great and the instructor was very direct and easy to follow. I would really recommend this dvd :D"},{"rating":"2","title":"new to pilates","review":"I am new to pilates and was worried about taking instruction from a DVD as I have injured myself before using exercise videos.

Expect to feel the workout the next morning...and also expect to receive compliments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cross training tool","review":"I trained with Jon in person and using his dvd in preparation for the FBI fitness test and found his training techniques to be an extremely valuable asset to my overall training. The pilates techniques he teaches on this dvd focuses on functional fitness and emphasizes the need for core strength as the foundation for all other athletic activities. After 3 months of training I found that my recovery time between workouts was significantly reduced and my capacity for situps, sprinting and long distance running had all improved thanks to the strengthening of all the little stabilizer muscles in my legs and core. Definitely happy with the results!"},{"rating":"1","title":"These reviews have doubtful legitimacy.","review":"I hate to be unfair and give a product I haven't actually bought a review, but I feel as if I should give other viewers of this product a caveat. Plus, a 1 star will hardly make a dent to the 86 out of 90 5 star ratings this has.Look at the reviews. Pages upon pages of 2 to 3 lines reviews from accounts that have NO other activity (reviews or wish list). Not real-name confirmed, not verified purchases, EXTREMELY similar writing styles. These are very clear-cut patterns and shocking disparities between these reviews and the reviews on other Pilates DVDs.Rather suspicious, isn't it? I was really excited to buy this DVD after looking at the great ratings, but not anymore. This kind of shady manipulation is intensely off-putting to me, and I hope it will be to other would-be purchasers of this DVD as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pilates That Even A Klutz Can Do","review":"As a total pilates newbie and a lifelong Klutz I was hesitant to even try Jon Belanger's DVD,Discovering Pilates, afraid that it might end up collecting dust with the rest of my exercise DVDs. Wbat a wonderful surprise to discover that through Jon's expert, yet idiot proof instruction, even my lack of coordination did not hinder my ability to execute every exercise! Okay, at first I didn't look pretty, but within two weeks I had graduated to the intermediate/advanced section. It was a miracle and so effective. A month later, my core is tight as a drum (so helpful in negotiating the Boston icewalks this winter)and I swear I've grown a half an inch. So many people have approached me telling me how great I look and asking if I've lost weight. I smile to myself and say an inner \\"thank you\\" to Jon. If you have never gotten into in exercise DVD before, treat yourself and try this one. I promise you, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jon's great!","review":"Workout 1 is a great choice for beginning/intermediate students, as Jon explains clearly the proper movement, as well as common mistakes of newbies.

Really nice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST BUY WORK OUT VIDEO!","review":"I have tried just about every type of work out there and have numerous work out videos; this is by far the best one out there. The Pilates moves are easily explained and anyone is capable of the exercises, which provide a great work out for all fitness levels.

They are very good in the cold (I use them in motion detection cameras in the woods) and like NiMh they discharge by using up the amp hours rather than loosing volts. When they are nearly used up they still show 1.2 volts on my battery checker. Whereas alkaline show voltages of less than .8 volts.

I have read other Idiot's guides and they have been basic enough and broken down with more examples to help someone who is starting out. The term \\"Idiot's Guide\\" is misleading for this book. I believe the author did not successfully keep the reader, in mind. The book should be called something like \\"The Advanced Guide For Real Estate Investing\\" I wish there was some regulation to keep it simple enough to be considered an \\"Idiot's Guide\\" . I am definitely disappointed with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Idiot's Guide to Real Estate Investing","review":"This book was very scattered. I got a few old books out of the library (Getting Started in Real Estate Investing and The Real Estate Book). They were very old but much more helpful than this idiot's guide. I am sending it back. It wasn't helpful for a novice like me. And I doubt that people that really know what they are doing would be helped either. Many subjects that I wanted advice in were not covered.

I attended this seminar in Los Angeles, and enjoyed it immensely. It addresses several means of communicating, and is done in an entertaining fashion.The sharing of the \\"gunshot\\" incident was used to get the audience's attention, and to (successfully) make a point. I understand that some people can't visualize this discussion in the context of a live seminar, but it certainly works.If you're narrow-minded and/or have no sense of humor, this tape is not for you. If, however, you want to have some fun while learning basic commincation skills, this is one great tape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I thought the tape was a terrible waste of money. I felt like the techniques she suggested were ludicrous and that I had just wasted an hour of my life listening to it. First, for example, the author/spokeswoman on the tape suggests using the subject of sex to get someone's attention so they will listen to you. As I'm sure that would work, there are other, more intelligent, ways of getting someone's attention and communicating effectively with him or her. Then, she gives the listner an example of how she validated herself and blew off some steam after having a very bad day by firing a gun into the radiator with two other people in the room. This sounds more like she should have taken a trip to the therapist's office for some anger/grief management.I think the general population has better communication skills than what is taught on this tape. Don't waste your time or money. Spend an hour doing something more productive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definately not worth the money or the time.","review":"This tape has ABSOLUTELY NO substance and is EXTREMELY annoying to listen to.

I plan to return the book and get my money back. Believe me...DON'T BUY THIS BOOK/AUDIO TAPE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Manwar's worst album","review":"I am a die hard Manowar fan. They are the best heavy metal band in existance. Every recording they have produced is excellent with 6 or 7 great songs. Louder than Hell is the exception. It is by far Manowar's worst album. There are no real good songs on this recording. The songs seem to have been written from a formula or template. They are are boring. Even after many listens I think the whole ablum is terrible. I recommend Hail to England, Fighting the World, and Sign of the Hammer for those new to Manowar."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Metal Must-Have!","review":"This CD is definitely one of the best. Manowar continue to prove they are not sell-outs like some 80's bands who shall reamin nameless. My only complaint is that the band does these crazy endings to their songs that remind me of fingernails on a chalkboard, but if you're into that sort of thing, by all means get this CD. Otherwise, this CD is flawless. For maximum enjoyment, play it LOUD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DISSAPOINTING","review":"I heard Brothers of Metal on the radio and found it to be one of the most driving metal songs ever, so I bought the album. Courage was very inspiring too. They had that blistering guitar solo as the second to last track which was awesome. The rest of it......repetitive stuff, same guitar slash and bass lines again and again, quite boring. When I see so many five star reviews for a mediocre album at best, I start to doubt the credibility of fan reviews on Amazon"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why so many 5 stars? This is a pity! :-(","review":"The razor-sharp axework of the excellent guitarist Karl Logad and the sincerity of Manowar's themes don't save this CD. Eric Adams vocals and Joey DeMaio boring bass lines actually ruin this album, which should never be compared to the high flies of \\"Kings Of Metal\\" and \\"Fighting The World\\". If you want to explore Manowar, take the aforementioned albums instead of this one. What happened to Adams' voice? It sounds broken, finished... It's a shame listening him, as you won't identify this voice with the one that sang \\"Stand And Fight!\\". Drumming is also second-class rated -Well, I admit that Manowar had never had a extra-class drummer. The production is flat, and the sound is outdated and unexciting. I can't stand so much monotony! Why so many 5 stars? Go for something better and do yourself a favor: overall, this is a poor album, and I encourage you to avoid purchasing it. Two stars is by far a gift to this release!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor excuse for music","review":"If you are looking to spend your hard earned money on a great Rock CD \\"Louder than Hell\\" isn't it. Banal lyrics, awful amaturish musicianship, and tacky packaging. Eric Adams is a singer with tremendous power which he shows on the Cd's one good track \\"Courage\\". The rest of this Cd is a total waste of time and money like the rest of Manowar's \\"recordings\\".Manowar claim that they are \\"The loudest band in the world\\".Well i guess they have to be to cover up the fact that their music is so poor. Manowar is an indie bar band posing as a professional major Metal band.

I grabbed everything of theirs I could, but the fact I couldn't find any new material made me nervous, that perhaps like Guns n'Roses (another supremely talented but short-lived band) they'd faded away. Fortunately this album came out in 1996, making me glad that I believed and kept waiting. A couple of songs aren't their strongest, and may seem a bit like earlier albums to longtime fans, but for new fans or old ones, it's a gotta-have. \\"Outlaw\\" is perhaps one of the three greatest Manowar songs ever, and \\"Number 1\\" and \\"The Power\\" are fantastic too."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love these guys!","review":"I first got into Manowar in college in 1991.

There is no mistaking their sound or style. Along with the metal anthems are a few classical interludes thrown in. Very macho and very metal. Yeah, it may seem a little excessive, but you can't knock a group of guys that really believe in what they are doing. And, it is very entertaining. I give it five stars because I got what I paid for. It rocks and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Heart & Soul Metal","review":"The title of this disc is a little misleading.

The variety lets everyone have a different matching plate so it's fun that way. Someone mentioned in another review that plain Corelle sandstone dishes go with these and it's true! The Friendly Village background color is the same as no matter to Corelle sandstone so it is possible to set a coordinated holiday table without totally breaking the bank. These were delivered promptly and packed in the Johnson Brothers box cushioned in an Amazon box with bubble packs, so no breakage (although the inside Johnson Brothers box was scuffed). Stuck-on labels say \\"made in China\\" but the quality seems fine.

In my opinion the action scenes are the only thing that needs to be talked about. That and Ti Lung's amazing acting performance. The action scenes are so creative. Definitely some of the best I have seen from 90's new wave wuxia movies. And Ti Lung is so good in this movie!

Especially the method for the S&P which is perhaps the only real market for day-trading leads to overtrading. Also the money management techniques presented are not effective.If you use a third contract set only to cover costs you are increasing your risk (and of course your costs) by 50%!Such a technique would only work if you were able to liquidate this contract set at least in 80% of the time at a win which won't be the case with the presented methods.Also a 250$ stop in the S&P is almost always sure to be hit. Also the use of 'stop with limit' and MIT- orders is no longer applicable. It might be true that the presented methods worked 10 years ago, but i don't think they are still working. Therefore the book is highly overpriced."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is as close to the Holy Grail as you can get","review":"I have bought over a hundred books on trading.

I know that they flatten it out for packaging, but even when I tried to fluff it up it stayed as thin as a pancake. Maybe it is meant for year round if you live in a warm climate... The FREE down pillows were disappointing as well. I could feel the stiff backings of the feathers right through the fabric.

But anyhoo, this is still surprisingly heartfelt music. Don Henley's solo career has been full of,lyrical, insightful music. Compare this music with the solo career of Don's Eagles writing partner, Glenn Frey and you'll see that Don is the better lyricist.This collection is disappointing in that it leaves out two tasty soundtrack tunes- \\"Sit down your rocking the boat\\" from LEAP OF FAITH, and \\"Love Rules\\" from FAST TIMES AT RIDGEMONT HIGH. Also left off are Henley's duets with Stevie Nicks and Patty Smyth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I never got my order. The seller cancelled the transaction.

To my ears, there was nothing of any great value or significance other than those. Yes, the liner notes are there, and that holds some interest--but this case isn't filled with jewels.Since I'm selling mine on this site the review is contrary to my own best interests, but that's not unusual--poor people often vote Republican."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my favorites.....","review":"I was so delighted to see this CD available for purchase, as I still had this in an audiocassette!!I am enjoying it now as much as I did when it firstcame out - probably more.

But, let me tell you I had never heard \\"In the Garden of Allah\\" (okay, I was asleep that decade), and it completely grew on me, so that now it is one of my favorite songs of the album.\\"New York Minute\\" is disturbing enough to bother you subconsciously, and \\"End of the Innocence\\" is thoughtful.This album is what I would call a Jukebox Keeper (if you were filling a jukebox with the best albums throughout the years, which ones would you choose?), along with \\"Eagles Live\\", and \\"The Very Best of Robert Palmer\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Solid Hit...","review":"...because I'm a hit or miss Henley fan; the stuff I like I absolutely love, the rest I can take or leave; this is a good compilation, all erudite snobbery aside.

By making it seem as if the house was haunted, Weber was hoping to get Butch aquitted of the murder charges he was up against. So he got the Lutzes to move into the house (they didn't even remove the family's old furniture, incuding the beds they were murdered in) and act as if the house was haunted or possessed. It's a fabricated story that is disrespectful to the family that was murdered. The Lutz family is sick."},{"rating":"2","title":"a terrifying TRUE story","review":"THIS BOOK WAS THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ.I AM A TRUE BELIEVER IN THE PARANORMAL,AND I JUST HATE IT WHEN PEOPLE SAY THIS STORY IS A HOAX 'CAUSE IT'S NOT!

I only recently found out that this story is probably not true, and that is a bit sad, and probably why this book is now out of print.

Hard to believe it is a non-fiction book..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepy Fun!","review":"In the spirit of other 70's horror stories like Rosemary's Baby, The Exorcist, and The Omen, The Amityville Horror is a flesh-tingling shiver-inducing read. The main difference is that it is not fiction. It's based on the experiences of the Lutz family, who get more than they bargained for when the buy their super creepy house including ghosts, poltergeists, and demons (allegedly). While there has been enormous speculation regarding the truth behind the events, it is essential for anyone who loves a good scare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"Very ordinary dodgy haunted house fare.

How disgusting to dupe so many people just to make a buck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anson may have believed, but we know better now.","review":"Total hoax: what more needs be said? Even before I read that the Lutz' supposedly concocted the whole story over a couple of bottles of wine, I found the story within to be more of an 'annoyance' than a 'horror'; even as fiction it wouldn't have scared me. If you want to read something REALLY scary, ignore Barnes' review and try \\"Hunt for the Skinwalker\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary, creepy, chilling","review":"I just finished this book and I have to say it is very, very creepy. Now I know that recently The Amityville horror has perhaps been proven as a hoax, but I still found this book to be good. It's about a newly married couple George and Kathy Lutz, and her three children who all move into a \\"dream house\\" which happens to have been the home to Ronald Defeo who said the house made him kill his parents and siblings. Overall the things that happen to the characters are scary and I found myself practically yelling at the Lutz's \\"Why don't you just leave!\\" but what I enjoyed the most was the part of the book that discussed what had happened to the priest that had come to bless the house. His story is perhaps even more frightening b/c all the things that happen to him result after visiting the house only once!! If you're a horror fan I would suggest reading this book, and who cares if the real story is a hoax or not, the book is still good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"All right for a work of fiction claimed as truth","review":"It scared me more as a child, when I thought the story was true. After discovering it was a hoax, the story's ability to frighten me lessened until now, I find the whole thing laughably silly.

I thought the book was a lot better and different than the movie, but I didnt find it all that scary. I guess part of the books scariness is that fact that its BASED ON A REAL STORY..... I did find it very creep and very well written. If you plan on watching the new movie comming out in April, read the bok first... its pretty short and will make a good afternoon read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a tall tale, totally unsubstantiated","review":"When I saw this in the \\"true crime\\" section at the book store I thought it was about the De Feo murders, but it's about the subsequent family (the Lutzes) to occupy the house. The story is told in an omniscient narrative style, like Cub Scouts telling ghost stories around a camp fire (\\"Then the priest heard a voice saying...\\") --which is OK if that's what you're looking for. (\\"Lions and tigers and bears --oh my!\\") There are no photos nor any other semblance of proof. The author claims that paranormal activities were a regular occurrence even before the De Feos lived there, but the family living in that house today doesn't tell any ghost stories. Perhaps Amazon said it best when they labeled this a \\"Mass Market Paperback.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"True Story or Big Hoax? Who cares!","review":"Whether or not you believe the events in the Amityville case, the book made wonderful reading for the weekend that had me shivering in the night. If you take this as a factual event then it is a fascinating, disturbing read and if not then it can still be approached as ostensible horror material."},{"rating":"1","title":"great story, bad read","review":"The story itself is great...very intriguing, but Anson does a horrible job of telling it. It's incredibly mechanically written and nearing the end of the book, he actually starts ending each chapter with an exclamation point, which is the definition of cheesy.This may be the only book in history where the movie is of higher quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amityville Horror","review":"Book came in on time and in excellent condition.

Just a very scary and awesome novel that stirs your soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scary...true?","review":"This book is really well written, almost to the point of taking away from believability.

At the time I was about 16 or 17 years old. I had read a lot of this type of book but nothing before or after has scared as much. In fact, I actually wouldn't sleep in my own room for almost a week. I think that was due to the fact that the book was based on a true story. It truly was a awesome book, that was very believable. I do have a word of caution, don't watch the movie \\"The Amityville Horror\\" its an underated (a very unreated) version of the novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superficial","review":"Wanting to familiarize myself with Linux, and looking for a way to obtain an installation copy of Red Hat 7 on CD-ROM, I purchased this book.Unfortunately, I found that this book failed be the \\"well-organized set of sessions\\" that make up a teaching guide it claims to be. The choice of topics is not exactly what you want (why spend a session on listing calendar and calculator tools), and the topics hardly provide any concrete information (unless you find the statement that \\"all you need is the predefined configuration files from this book's companion CD-ROMs\\" enough to have \\"learned how to use the mail server to exchange e-mail with other systems on the Internet\\"). It lacks depth, even for me as a first-time user.In summary, this book quickly shows many features of the Red Hat installation, but falls short of providing the insight required to get started.2 stars for providing Red Hat 7 on CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely scrachtes the surface","review":"This book is ok for anyone that has very little computer experience and, like the title says, has to learn Linux in a weekend. Anyone else should look elsewhere for an introduction.

That's were I find myself and I found it difficult to find good quality books aimed at intermediates."},{"rating":"2","title":"Back in the Day","review":"I review for what an item is supposed to be, in my opinion. This is a good Disney show for the 1960 standard. It is not a \\"Classic\\" film but is fun to watch if you grew up in that time and like many love the Daniel Boone, Davy Crockett tales. If you don't like those then you probably will not care for this. Great to watch with a child or grandchild. Has some singing, quite a bit actually and could probably be called \\"campy\\" like Batman of the 60's, but you know, somtimes that's not so bad. There are four parts to this series and I would rate them all of equal quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a final album usually sounds like.........","review":"total .... What a bomb.

The book has been updated to include recent developments such as writing for the internet and includes more recent writers such as J.K. Rowling."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book won't make you a great writer","review":"This book is far to general and abstract to make you a great writer. Something I liked about the book was the examples of how different writers used specific \\"devices\\" in their writing. I also liked the Q&A; with publishers at the end.Sadly though, the bulk of the book can be summarized as:Read a lot to keep up with the field andWrite a lot to get practice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Knights But Not Templar","review":"Templar history, the real history not the fervid imaginings regarding the Holy Grail and such, is a truly fascinating tale worthy of sustained study.

Slash is a great guitarist but even he can not save this cd. also the singer is pretty bad, he just sounds like an Axl impersonator. The second snakepit cd is much better and i would reccomend that one, but don't bother with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD","review":"Slash, long hair and leather pants are not a career.

This album is overall more aggresive than anything Guns and Roses has ever done. While being mostly a balls to the wall 1970s hard rock record {think Led Zeppelin and Aerosmith}, it does have some other worthy moments as well. these moments being: the bluesy \\"baggers and hangers on\\", the somewhat trippy \\"Lower\\" and the beautifully melodic \\"Back and forth again\\". If you are looking for a solid rock record to save you from this age of boybands and other forgetable teen idols, then this is the album for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the real fans","review":"First of all this album was for the real fans of GNR, if you didn't like them to begin with, why would buy Slash's solo album? Slash must have some talent for a 10+year career. I am a big fan of Slash, and say if you thought his guitar playing in GnR was a fluke all along (you people in Maine and Europe), why did you buy his solo album, doesn't make much sense does it? Musical ingnorance for all of the slash-bashers out there. looking forward to the next solo album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good debut album by ex-Gunner 'Slash'.","review":"As a debut album by former Guns N' Roses guitar-god, Slash, shows to a great extent just how much input on the sound of his former band. He brings this style to \\"It's Five O'Clock Somewhere\\". It's brash, occasionally rough, bluesy, but definately rock and roll. Just so you know, the hignlights of this record are Neither Can I, Dime Store Rock, Beggars and Hangers On, and a few more. His attempt at a love song in I Hate Everybody (But You), dedicated to his former wife, Renee, is okay as well. Pick this one up is you dig Guns N' Roses and Slash's bluesy rock style, you will be happy with the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Packs a punch better than most music out now","review":"ok, so Slash knew this album wasn't going to be a classic, but this was just a side project while GN'R weren't doin anything. Eric Dover is no Axl Rose (then again, who is?), Slash again provin one of the worlds greatest guitarists and a decent line-up for the rest of the band which is: Mike Inez(alice in chains normally), Gilby Clarke(ex-gnr), and Matt Sorum(ex-gnr). This was an experimental album for Slash, trying to add some blues to the GN'R sound which works in most cases. The second Snakepit album 'Ain't Life Grand'is probably better but this is well worth buying if you're into GN'R."},{"rating":"2","title":"Other than GNR, this is as good as it gets!","review":"This album is hands down one of the best rock albums I own. I dont care if everyone disagrees me. Everyone seems to have a problem with the vocalist (Eric Dover) but he's not that bad at all. The man's edgy, rough style fits with every song. I was actually quite impressed. Words cannot describe Slash's guitar play. People say that he was trying to recreate GNR, but thats just HIS style. GNR was based around his guitar play just as Snakepit is. In my opinion this album is better than the new Snakepit album. Dont get me wrong, the new album rocks, but it doesn't have as much solo time for Slash. Anyway, buy this album, its well worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice try!","review":"Its good! Even if you dont like Guns N Roses, you will find something here. Songs such as Neither Can I, Beggars, Doin Fine are really great. The vocals are thrilling. Slash guitars are even better... like a bird flying out of the cage. After months with those giant gigs, the GNR boys re-started with a nice try!"},{"rating":"2","title":"gnr without axl","review":"Sounds like the GNR of old , around the \\"Lies\\" days.

While the guitar work is unsurprisingly fine, the songwriting is lackluster at best, with memorable hooks or melodies in short supply. And what's the point of hiring as good a singer as Imperial Drag's Eric Dover if you're just going to have him do a second-rate imitation of Axl Rose? What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNLISTENABLE","review":"I love G n' R but I have to say that this disc is really disapointing. I guess it proves that Axl was the talent of that band. This is embarrassing, not only to Slash, but to anyone that was a fan of the original Gunner's. Maybe Aerosmith were better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slash should leave us alone","review":"It's hard to decide which is worse, the songs or the playing. While the songs are pretty terrible, the guitar playing is atrocious. Slash was kept in check when he was in Guns, but here he's given free reign, and somebody told him he could play the guitar. He should look at Axl and how Axl has stayed out of the limelight and he should do the same. Axl was the talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinker","review":"An unbelievably bad recording from one of the worst guitar players of the century. So incredibly awefull it offends me to my core."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD! BAD! BAD!","review":"Slash's music is disturbing because it's so bad.

We have very little money, and very little food. Many days it is hard to go on. An American Red Cross worker played me some American music, to make me happy and ease my immense suffering. She played this disc by your rock man Slash. It is atrocious. I would rather starve here in Afghanistan than listen to this horrible music. I would rather listen to the sounds of my goats going hungry than hear this. My country is in shambles and on the brink of civil war, but at least we have not produced anything of this awefullness."},{"rating":"2","title":"SLASH WAS (IS) GN'R!!","review":"This is one of the last TRUE Rock N' Roll records.

Slash (or anyone else for that matter) never sounded better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock from a hard place","review":"Great stuff ... borrows styles from Aerosmith, GNR, Metallica and Twisted Sister, with the harmonious vocals of AC/DC meeting Cinderella(well ... he tries!)If you like your music with a heavier and moodier bent to it than the original GNR albums, you could do a lot worse than taking Slash home!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Every song is fucking worth hearing 10000000 fucking times","review":"Every song has an excellent guitar (of course-Slash) and this jelly fish guitarist it fu**ing good in the vocals."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK, listen here....","review":"I want to give you an unblinded opinion of this album. Slash is of course one the greatest guitarists in recorded history but this solo album fails. It's not his playing though. It's the people he works with. Mainly songwriter/vocalist Eric Dover. He ruins the songs and makes them almost painful to listen to. He has absolutely no presense or style and many of the lyrics are bad as well. At times it even sounds like he's trying to sound like Axl --- and failing miserably.I hope and pray that Slash works with a new vocalist on his next album. We all know that a ton of worthy ones would be lining up to work with him!If you want a good Gn'R solo album, check out Izzy Stradlin and the Ju Ju Hounds. That guy has a voice, style, and he is the best songwriter to come out of Gn'R.Of course the best thing for Slash and Izzy would be for the real Gn'R to regroup but there seems to be little hope of that unfortunately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Guns N Roses, but good.","review":"This album is a show-case for what Slash brought to Guns N Roses and his guitar-ability. I'd suggest a Guns N Roses fan NOT EXPECT a Guns N Roses album, which can't be done if the right guys are not together. This is a GOOD Rock N Roll album.(If you want to see Slash live, playing his new-stuff, he is opening for AC/DC this summer!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS ONE IS SOOOOOO BAD","review":"Slash has a song called \\"It's Good To Be Alive.\\" I say it's bad to be alive if you have to listen to this awful music. I'd rather listen to nothing but air."},{"rating":"1","title":"MY EARS ARE IN PAIN","review":"I have a theory. Slash felt guilty about all the money he made with his pedestrian band Gun's and Rosers. He decided to show the world that he isn't the least bit talented, he just happened to be at the right place at the right time, and his band had a talented and good looking lead singer, Axl Rose. Slash put out this album to prove that he can't play the guitar or write songs very well. He must have felt a tremendous amount of guilt over the fact that his band was so popular, yet he was no the least bit talented. This disc proves to everyone once and for all that he's just some guy with leather pants and a vintage guitar. We should thank him for coming clean."},{"rating":"1","title":"A HORRIBLE ALBUM FROM A PITIFULL GUITARIST","review":"Slash, Please leave us alone. Your guitar playing is terrible, your songwriting is awefull. Can't you go away quietly like AXL?"},{"rating":"1","title":"AWEFULL!","review":"Someone said that this album would grow on me. I listened to it once and hated it. I gave it another chance and you know what? I hate it even more. It's terrible. Slash finally answers the musical question: How bad can a disc be? Here's your answer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get a Cell Phone","review":"It is May 11, 2007 and Amazon is still trying to sell a 1.5 megapixel camera for $599!!

That is probably why this has never been released before. I believe the joke of a human being that he has become (Shaaaaroooon!) probably has something to do with karma.... Also, someone was asking why Ozzy doesn't use that effect on his voice where it sounds double more often. The reason is that this is impossible to do live.

I also needed to enlarge the center opening of the floor flange extension so that the seals on this product passed through it easily, and down into the lead closet bend.

Of course I didn't figure that out until I had stuck the gasket on the toilet. We couldn't get it into the pipe, and when we stopped trying, the gasket just fell off the toilet. So I scraped all the adhesive off, stuck it back on the toilet with copious amounts of Plumber's Goop, let it set for 24 hours (fortunately we have two bathrooms), boiled a pan of water and put the toilet on top so the gasket was in the hot water for several minutes, soaped up the outlet pipe with dish soap, and it popped right in. That was 4 days ago and so far, so good. I like this product because we couldn't find a wax ring deep enough at any of our local hardware stores to reach the bottom of our toilet because of the tilework in the bathroom."},{"rating":"2","title":"wax free toilet seal","review":"Terrific product.

She decides to be the troop leader of the Beverly Hills chapter of the Wilderness Girls, a ficticious version of the Girl Scouts. It is hilarious to watch the Beverly Hill troop do things that the other troops never thought these girls could accomplish due to their money and upbringing.This is a very feel-good type of movie that will warm your heart.

Even though this troop had everything against them, they kept on being themselves and made the local wilderness girls of the year. They were the first troop to cross the jamboree finish line with their leader.The assistant troop leader Annie Herman is initally a spy who is supposed to doccument all of the allegedly horrible things the troop is doing.

If you're obedient to Rome -- yes, postconciliar Rome -- and don't think authority in the church is a personal plaything to be manufactured every time a small sect doesn't get it's way, then this book is definitely not for you.

Bad history and hubris all the way around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Understanding the Traditionalist movement","review":"This book gives insight into what the whole traditionalist fuzz is about. Why do some people long for the restoration of the Latin mass? What has happened to the Church over the last 40 years? The answers while interesting are a bit one sided. Since this book comes from the far right of the Church, and wants to \\"close the book\\" on Vatican II, I cannot recommend it to orthodox Catholics who want to understand the teachings of the Church. But for spiritually mature Catholics who want to understand the fundamentalist mindset that lies at the foundation of the radical traditionalist movement, the book is invaluable."},{"rating":"2","title":"well worth it","review":"Very educational and well written.

Like political spin. Like ideology. This book punctures some of these rationalizations.The Church does not claim to be perfect regarding prudentially: and to defend the Church as though this was a teaching is not to honor God. Mistakes were made: avoidable mistakes. Unnecessary mistakes. The scandal comes to mind.

Needless to say, it was bit embarrasing.I just returned them and got the Motorla SX700R. Friend has a set, and we used them in camping trip and it works great.

Better to use 2 cans and a string!","review":"I am an \\"Extra-Class\\" radio amateur, and these radios are not worthy of the Cobra name... Uniden and Cobra used to be semi reliable names you could count on, but these are the worst by far!Line of sight, Channel 6, high power, squelch disabled, and I was losing contact @ ~ 1.5 miles!We were in the desert, and the IR image test we were doing was only @ 5 miles max. The radios were supposed to help coordinate the IR image video recording. NO way, we had to rely on our spotty-service cell-phones till I got to ~ 2 miles. (Even then the reception was VERY marginal!)My old Motorola FRS (Low power only model) was better than these @ HIGH power.I took them back. Certainly not worth the $70.00 asking price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A real fraud","review":"I was browsing for 2-way radios in a store and this set caught my eyes because they use Li-ion batteries. Most other radios use the older NiMH technology so I thought the extra battery life would be good. Well, I just got back from a trip and the radios performed horribly. From the beach to my 4th floor hotel room, the distance could not have been more than 1/4 mile with a line of sight, and the reception was hit or miss. Even when the call button worked, the speech usually was not intelligible. I am trying, but I cannot come up with a single positive thing to say about this product. I will go back to using my older Motorola set until I find a suitable GMRS set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Quality Product I have bought in a long, long time","review":"These radios performed just terribly, right out of the packaging (after properly charging the batteries). You can barely hear the other person when receiving, even with the volume turned to max. I tried receiving from other FRS radios with no better result on the reception. After one month, one no longer works, and neither of these radios ever left the charger and was ever used in a functional situation.Save your money. For my buck, I'm going back to Motorola's.

It challenges the masks we wear, the roles we play, and the values of our culture, both Christian and secular. The author's assault on so many fronts is based on her conviction that unless we re-examine ourselves and our culture - including our church culture - at the most fundamental levels, we will continue to live anemic spiritual lives largely separated from God's love. That separation, according to the author, is as a result of our choices, not His. If, on the other hand, you have been left frustrated, puzzled, cynical, or guilty as to why the life of a Christian as portrayed in the New Testament is not a reality for you, if you long for a more vibrant and intimate relationship with God, then by all means read this book. It will provide direction for your deepest longings."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm on Fire!!!","review":"This book spoke to me like no Christian book ever has. In fact, I felt like much of it was about me. Transformed Into Fire made me see myself as God sees me, rather than the broken self who is always trying to act mature and nice so that I can receive God's blessing. I went through a two-year struggle with self-hatred. This book made sense of that experience and gave me the tools to see God's blessing in my life. I thank God for this book and the impact it has had on my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"Melodrama, silly and improbable situations (the worst scene was the mother's corpse ejecting from the casket during a physical tussle between the 3 sisters), and wearying repetition of dialogue dealing with the same issue throughout the book made this a most difficult novel to finish.

Never read anything else by this author but will give Ms. Ansa's talent the benefit of the doubt by attempting one more time to enjoy her work - a library book, not a purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Way","review":"Anyone who knows me would tell you I truly enjoy reading. I am an avid reader known to finish an interesting book within hours. It took me two weeks to get past the first seven chapters of this book. The story just could not keep my interest. I felt no real affinity to any of the characters. I have other books by this author and come away with an interst in what would happen next with her lead characters. She writes with real emphasis on how characters interact with each other and usually leaves you wanting more. In the case of this novel I just didn't feel it. Her other novels will not leave you dissapointed. Ugly ways is not a good example of the Ansa's true talent as a writer. If you have not done so try her other novels. I guarantee you will come away wanting to read more."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just didn't like it...","review":"This is just my humble opinion, but I thought the daughters would have all benefited from psychiatric help.

This book was no exception. UGLY WAYS was a novel that had a good premise, but kept it going on a very slow pace, until the funeral parlor scene, when it really got hilarious! That was the best part of the book. Mudear should have been on the cover instead of her daughters, because she was the scene stealer. She may have many misunderstanding about her girls, but she still loved them, and when all is said and done, who could ask for anything more? I could. I could have asked for a better book, but at least Mudear saved the day.

In the book Mudear called her kid's ungrateful but in actuality she was the one that was ungrateful considering all the things her kids did, tried & wanted to do for her. there were times when i laughed out loud at the statements made & actions done. i am now reading the hand i fan with & i hope it's just as enjoyable as this book was. i learned alot from mudear.

While most tracks retain the kind of accessibility that drew a whole new generation of listeners into the world of Jazz, the album moves to a much more sophisticated and drier (i.e. less saccharine) space than some of the PMG albums that immediately precede it. Part of its strength is its great variability: it ranges from the contemplative through the celebratory and the powerful, sometimes verging on the eerie or painful. The rhythms and harmonies have a sophistication rarely touched in the recordings that preceded it.

I would have paid twice the price for the DVD alone. Once you see or hear him live your hooked, just like a junkie needing your next \\"Howie fix\\". If you like passionate music, Howie is your man. Trust me..you won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another brilliant Howie Day CD","review":"Howie Day is a phenomenon. This one-man-band started playing in the bars of Maine when he was still a kid, and has been touring the United States for years. Australia was debut album, and admirably showed off his skills with an accoustic guitar.But the heart of Howie Day has always been his life performance. Using peddles, he \\"loops\\" segments of his song to create an emotional experience. Madgrigals lets you hear great professionally recorded live songs (including Ghost, bunnies, and Sorry So Sorry). It even includes a bonus DVD showing him live in concert.The only downside is the DVD. It has none of the informality of his normal live shows. He doesn't really joke around with the audience, and he's farther away than normal. But that just leaves more time for the songs! :-)Buy this CD, and make every day a Howie Day."},{"rating":"2","title":"brace yourself...","review":"pain, love, and lyrics...howie's voice resonates inaudible bliss and his lyrics leave you puzzled--Day is exceptional...his vocals cry with inexpressable passion...this cd/dvd is a must have...five out of five."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"The mixes on this c.d. is totally awesome how Howie remixes these songs into totally different sounding tunes with the same lyrics. Some new songs are added and kick .... The DVD is unbelievable and this cd is definately worth the ... price!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest Wrap Up","review":"The 9th season of the most highly rated comedy series ever obviously strove to wrap things up in a way which would exemplify the character of the series and seemed to succeed in doing so with this pot pouri or episodes followed by the inevitable climax. This was not your father's television but it was cutting edge and took chances and maintained a bite to it while providing so many laughs and yet.."},{"rating":"2","title":"happy gift giver","review":"I was completely pleased..between ordering and receiving the cost went down and the savings were passed on to me!!!

This set includes some of the best episodes. It also includes a great behind the scenes of the last episode."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic !","review":"This comedy classic is a must see for any lover of Seinfeld, or anyone else looking for some top-notch comedy shows. The writing is consistently superb, and this being the 9th and last season of the show, the 5 star quality of the show is the accumulation of 9 years worth of team work and character development. Highly recommended for major non-stop laughs![...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Done...","review":"by the 9th and final season, pretty much all the magic was gone.it had become an obnoxious charicature of itself. the fact thatpeople give it five stars is highly suspect. and the final episodewas embarrassing...- cRAIG"},{"rating":"1","title":"Antipiracy Publicity in every disc","review":"The rate is about the DVD Edition, not the show. Is one of my favorites shows of all time.A shame of edition.Contain in every disc, without the chance of fast-forward or interrupt, a long antipiracy comercial that starts before the first episode you select after inserting the disc.Very annoying. Probably I have watched the same commercial at least 15 times in the last weeks.Why I have to be forced to watch that commercial so many times when I bought an original edition?I bought the last two season recently and the same also occurs in the 8th season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Because of the quality of the show and the product","review":"The Seinfeld TV Program was a very entertaining one, and, continues to entertain in syndication. I find viewing the DVD is the same. When I view the DVD, I can be assured of a mutltitude of laughs in each episode."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Season-Love it!","review":"Seinfeld will make you laugh and some funny extras also! Will buy other Seasons too. Season 1-thru 8 are also keepers"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best everlasts!","review":"The final season not only doesn't let the ball drop but also leaves you thirsty for more! Jerry Seinfeld and team wrap Tv's all-time best sitcom with 24 episodes filled with the most amazing comic absurdities. Hard to choose a favourite story: hilarious 'backwards' \\"the betrayal\\" episode; \\"the voice\\"; \\"the reverse peephole\\";... Even the 'flashback' 2-part \\"The Chronicle\\" episode is so beautifully edited that you forget it's all about things you've already watched. The only shortcoming in this package was for me the too short \\"Scenes from the roundtable\\". The return of Larry deserved a longer exposure! Even so, this minor pitfall doesn't compromise the great value of the set. Definitely 2 thumbs up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased.","review":"Product arrived several days after purchase. Seller kept me informed of the shipping process. Product arrived in good shape as advertised. I was very satisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great comedy!","review":"Seinfeld has a different kind of humor but I have always enjoyed the situations these characters got into, sometimes pretty hilarious. I recommend it to anyone who wants to break the monotony."},{"rating":"2","title":"It really was on a high note","review":"I had heard that Seinfeld left on a high note but watching this season again just reconfirmed for me how good the show was at the time that it went off the air. This really was their best season! Every episode was among the best the show ever had to offer. Amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seinfeld Season 9 hate to see it end !!!","review":"This is the last season for Seinfeld great to be able to see it over & over again...We will never see another series like Seinfeld...from the jokes & writing to the actors it will never be duplicated...I highly recommend this DVD it's a piece of television history..."},{"rating":"2","title":"SEINFELD !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I just love it, its Seinfeld !!!

If you dont know it, you got to see this !!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Some excellent shows on here...","review":"Seasons 8 and 9 pale a little in comparison to the first 7 seasons (when Larry David was still on board), but they are all still funnier than 99% of everything else that has ever been on TV."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dave's Quick 'n' Easy Web Pages","review":"Although this is listed as a \\"kid's\\" book, it is a clear step by step procedural manual for anyone new to HTML and wanting to set up their own website. Dave takes us from a simple text-filled page through adding numbered lists, bulleted lists, colors for text and background, adding tables, adding images, creating hyperlinks with text or images, and creating an image map (an image that has \\"hot spots\\" to be clicked as links). He also has listed many websites for downloading free programs, clip art, backgrounds, etc. He shows how to set up, save, and then upload website pages onto the Internet. The procedures are easy to follow if the reader carefully recreates what Dave has written.Definitely a good book for anyone new to creating personal webpages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong approach. Focuses solely on HTML.","review":"I got this book, and was disappointed. It starts out teaching HTML, the language web pages are used for. HTML programming is the wrong way to start learning web page design. Tools like FrontPage and even MS Word will do ALL the HTML programming for you. After starting to read this book with my 8 year old daughter, we went down to the computer, started Microsoft Word, and made a couple web pages. That was a visual way to program, and it lets the tools handle the details. This book is the wrong way to learn web page development and design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"The video is simply a compilation of camcorder-quality home videos dating back to the 80s."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic solo debut","review":"Well I love it. Cowsill does have a distinctive voice, but I think it's soulful, expressive and effective. In a way this is somewhat like a poppier Lucinda Williams (who sings memorable harmonies on the achingly gorgeous \\"Nanny's Song\\"). There are somereferences to Continental Drifters & even The Cowsills, and a bit of pop sheen compared to say, the Drifters. But okay with me. What I like too is the sense of 'hard won' optimism that is here overall, even if many of the songs are also ballsy and realistic. Her dramatic read of \\"Who Knows Where the Time Goes?\\" is one of the greatest I think-- only Sandy Denny herself can compete, and shesang it rather differently. I think Susan stakes out a significant solo place here-- rootsrock/folk/pop with heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah, I BELIEVE IT.","review":"Susan's songwriting abilities continue to amaze me. From several songs she wrote with the \\"Continental Drifters\\" to this, her first solo album, she just gets better and better. Susan's tunes range from the soft melodies that invoke thoughts of a dewy morning to a bitter rivalry between ex's to get up off your chair and dance! It's a work of art and essential for anyone into power pop and rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Christian schools / home school","review":"This is specifically for Grade 4, but if you're familiar with these resources you already know you can accellerate at a faster pace (i.e., use for advanced Grade 3) &/or if your child is getting started late, s/he won't be bored.An excellent Catholic resource, covers the following topics: Creed, How God invited us to be His friends, how communities express their faith, God's faithfulness to His people in the Old Testament, Jesus's life/love/Gospel, how Jesus is the Good Shepherd and what that means.Easy-to-use guide, to help you build a solid foundation for your students & children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Micro Cookbook","review":"I have not been able to install this program as it is not compatible with WindowsXP, which leaves me with about 1000 recipes on an external drive that I cannot access.

I, also, have tons of recipes that I am trying to get to run from an old Micro 4 version. Micro 5 was recommended as the solution. I am now going to have to spend money at my local cumputer geek to figure out how to get this to run.This could get expensive.I will update review when I get a solution from the Tech.REVIEW UPDATE:Been on the phone with my trusted Tech Support...won't go into details, but first try running in compatability mode. If that doesn't work...buy a windows 95 computer or toss this piece of garbage software in the trash!He said the odds of compatabilty mode working are slim to none...but give it a try.I am now calling around to see if someone has a dusty 15 year old computer in the back of a closet somewhere...for $5. No luck yet.JUST DO NOT BUY THIS DRECK!!!I can't believe Amazon even allows this on their website."},{"rating":"2","title":"A high quality work of art.","review":"This collection of \\"comic\\" stories from various artists is a beautiful work of art. The quality of the book is wonderful, the color and print is strong. It is a great book to have in a collection. I'm sure some of these artists will go far, if they haven't done so already. I would love to see more of there individual work."},{"rating":"1","title":"(not a target enthusiast) Don't waste your money","review":"I bought this phone about 4 months ago and was initally pleased. The sound quality was great it felt good in the hand and on the shoulder. After a few weeks it would ocassionally not dial when I press numbers. Right now I can't get it to dial anything unless I keep pushing the numbers over and over. I've never dropped it so I know thats the problem. It is just a bad phone. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Good","review":"This phone works very well. We are very difficult to please when it comes to phones, but we are happy with this one. It doesn't take up a lot of space on our counter, and it fits around your face comfortably. Plus it's made by a well known company. The phone works even when you're outside (we've had some that don't)... it's definately a good buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible phone!","review":"The phone works great for about 6 months but then quickly goes downhill. Often the phone will not allow you to answer, it simply beeps. Now, the phone will not dial and I have to hang it up on the charger for 5 seconds then try again. Don't waste your money!!! I have never dropped the phone and it charges every night so the problem is in the manufacturing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just doesn't last.","review":"I have owned this phone for about 6 months. It is now very difficult to get situated on the charger and the sound quality has deteriorated since purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent value!","review":"I cannot find a good selection of much since we are stationed overseas, so I buy a lot online. Our housing has concrete walls, so I wanted the GHz model but didn't want to pay too much. It's great! I can hear upstairs in the back closet, and even took it with me next door and the phone rang while I was there. (Our home is like a four unit condo.) I've recommended it to my friend who needs a new cordless phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"I have had this phone for about one and a half years, and already am having the same problem as another reviewer where the phone will no longer answer, and just beeps, even though it's been recharging overnight. Additionally, the phone gets very static-y when I enter my attached garage, which is only 15 feet from the base. And finally, I am not a heavy user of my home phone (I more often use my cell phone), and am on the budget phone plan of less than 30 calls per month - so the problems I've been experiencing have certainly not been due to abuse."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, but poorly engineered","review":"I had the exact same experience as another reviewer. The phone worked fine for about 6 months and now the 1, 2, 3, &amp;amp; 4 buttons don't work, nor does the &amp;quot;answer&amp;quot; button. I had the same problem with a prior GE phone. I am now of the opinion that either (1) GE intentionally gives their phones a lifespan or (2) GE hires inept engineers and technicians. Either way, the quality is terrible.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY ON THIS PHONE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Long Lasting Work Horse Phone","review":"This is a great phone. I work extensively from home, spending several hours a day on the phone, and have had this phone at least two years. It has never broken, the battery lasts several hours without needing recharging, the reception is clear, it fits well in my hand, it works well outside, and it has a much needed Mute button. I have tried many other phones from Siemens, Panasonic and AT&T and this one has latest the longest without breaking, while providing the functionality I need. A much more expensive Siemens Phone Model 240 just broke after two years and we are replacing it with this phone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Basic phone","review":"I've read some reviews that criticize this phone. Don't know what they did to it (dropped it too many times?). We recieved this phone as a holiday gift and have been pleasantly surprized. I typically have little faith in GE small appliances and electronics, but, since it was a gift, was forced to try it. No problems to report. Fair battery life, never a signal failure, locator works great, looks good on our office desk. Can't beat the price. If it's got what you want, buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing sequel","review":"I felt this was a big disappointment compared to the first one (Detonator). While the chemistry between Mike Graham (Pierce Brosnan) and Sabrina Carver (Alexandra Paul) is evident, the script was poorly written and I felt that this movie was just thrown in together. It was not a very suspenseful movie, and some of the acting is pretty atrocious, especially by the characters in Hong Kong. The first Detonator was very well-written, well-directed, and well-acted with great actors such as Patrick Stewart, Ted Levine, and Christopher Lee, but I could not believe that the same director was responsible for this sequel. I would definitely stick with the first Detonator."},{"rating":"1","title":"D.O.A.","review":"Pierce Brosnan is back as a government soldier/agent, this time looking for whoever stole a famous Rembrandt painting and replaced it with a forgery. Working with a female agent played by Alexandra Paul they travel to Holland where they find the painting in the possession of a businessman. He has a deal with gangsters from Hong Kong that involves a computer chip that can be planted in any telephone and then controlled by a satellite he has invented and plans to launch into space.Detonator 2 is a little more light hearted in tone than the first one but its really no better of a movie. The plot is convoluted and dopey. The acting is somewhere between amateur and people hired from the local mall. William Devane hams it up during the action-packed but wholly unbelievable ending and then its over, leaving you feeling cheated out of quality entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Future eye-candy spotted","review":"The only reason to rent this C-grade telemovie is the 30-second appearance of future \\"ER\\" doc, Goran Visnjic, who only utters two lines, but bucks the trend of his film appearances by not getting himself killed in the process.Otherwise, it's a routine action thriller, with lots of guns, explosions, evening gowns, chases, and bad acting aplenty."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT SERVICE!","review":"The book was in EXCELLENT condition and arrived PROMPTLY! I'll order from this seller again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impossible to stop reading.","review":"This book is one of a kind. When I bought it I thought I'll never get to finish the book.

This gives much insight about the powers of darkness and Light that one needs to know so that they can grow in their walk with God."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book wasted my time.","review":"I found this book from an online course for getting the A+ certification. As I studied it I found inaccuracies. Some of the practice tests even have wrong answers when aligned with actual study text. The book rambles on and on about history and theory but gives little information needed to pass the A+ exams. I enjoyed the computer facts but I spent my money to learn the technical aspects of computers and prepare for the A+ exams. This was a major waste of my time that I needed to spend on getting my A+ certification."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating and outdated","review":"It is truly hard to understand why this book is even still in print. It doesn't even have information on OSs dating back to XP, much less anything on current wireless technology. If you are looking for a boring book on the past or have a yen to work on antiquated PCs, then this is for you. If you are even remotely serious about learning current technology and doing sound diagnostic repair, then save your money and look elsewhere. Giving it just one star was being generous!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Clear soap runs green","review":"We have several pieces from this set and love the look. However clear Softsoap comes out green.

The lyrics are vivid, the music is energizing and Noa's voice soars like a Bird of Paradise. Whenever I play it, I can't help but think of Calling as her official \\"rock album\\". If only Alanis and Shakira could infuse their music with as much spirituality and social awareness while delivering it with such artistry and depth."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's highly recommended as musically and lyrically great.","review":"In \\"Calling\\" Noa continues the wonderful songwriting from her first album and goes one step beyond with a great mixture of contemporary and traditional rhythms. Her lyrics as usual are profound and beautiful. I especially liked the songs \\"By the Light of the Moon\\" (uptempo), \\"Mark of Cain\\"(a haunting ballad about a painful subject that has significance one various levels) and \\"Manhattan Tel-Aviv\\" (her commentary on the two identities that are part of her). After having seen her perform live as well, I really appreciated her musicianship on this album too. I hope more people discover what a talent she is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Album of the year when it came out","review":"I started seeing John Wesley as a one man opening act for the english progressive rock band Marillion in the post-Fish era for many years whenever they toured the US. He would play a harmonica and his guitar. One year when he toured with them he was selling this album at the concerts. It was the best album I bought that year. He rocks on thirteen days and there isn't a bad song on the entire album. Too bad he didn't do it as an accoustic gig like he did at the concert. Ironically, he is now the guitarist in the band of the former Marillion lead singer FISH. What an awesome duo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inside 3d studio max2 v.1","review":"the book has 1300 useless pages.

At key points captions were switched, or wrong information was given. Still, the book covers such a broad array of subject matter, so precisely, it is worth the money spent.

The first few days were uncomfortable, which is typical for dress shoes, but they eventually became acceptably comfortable.The reason this review is 2 stars is the shoes started \\"sqeaking\\" as soon as they were broken in. Also, the shoes only lasted about 3 months of frequent use before the sole started seperating from the shoe. I got the sole repaired twice, but after 9 months the upper seams started coming undone as well.I will buy Kenneth Cole shoes again, but for this price I'm hoping some of the other models will last a bit longer and be a bit quieter."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the greatest soul records ever!","review":"It's too bad that this thing did not sell because it's fantastic, soulful and sweet.

Grab it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW, who knew?!","review":"As the other reviewers of this cd have said, you have to listen to this cd. It's the ultimate Doyle Bramhall II cd. I've long listened to the Doyle's other 2 cd's, as well as his work with Arc Angel, and I've thoroughly enjoyed his blend of rock and blues. After listening to this cd however, I was BLOWN AWAY!!! I just can't stop playing it. My favs on this cd are What You Gonna do, Bleeding from a scratch, Time & Part II. If you like Stevie Ray, Derek Trucks or other artists that play that blend of rock & blues, this cd is a must listen!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"I purchased this hose to drain the water from my humidifier. It has leaked from day 1 from the nozzle where it connects to the humidifier. If I get it in the right position, it doesn't leak.

That possibility had not occurred to me, and although we have an air compressor, I had to go buy an inflation needle in order to blow it up! Meanwhile, during my Christmas shopping, I saw this football at several area stores, both inflated and cheaper than what I paid to buy it through Amazon (plus an exorbitant shipping rate, since it is not eligible for Super Saver shipping). This was a major lesson for me in terms of comparison shopping and what to buy or not buy through Amazon. Unless you are hours away from the nearest store that might sell this item, it is not worth purchasing through Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"funkier style that the Blue but good, quite good","review":"Some, including Rivers himself, were disappointed with this cd at first. However, looking back it is probably the most well received album second only to the Blue one. Songs like Pink Triangle and especially El Scorcho and The Good Life are incredible to listen to. The cd is mostly filled with excellent songs and I attribute the stylistic discrepancies from Blue to be the source of the initial disappointment. Not to worry people, most people really really like this cd and would argue it is even better than recent Weezer cds like Make Believe. El Scorcho alone is worth the price of buying the cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Their Best CD. Better Than Blue. Amazing","review":"Never before have i been able to listen to a cd so many times and not get sick of it. this cd is one of the most amazing, emotion evoking ever. Anyone who says this cd isn't good, obviously doesn't know a thing. BUY IT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pinkerton- The other side of Weezer","review":"pinkerton is, in my belief, an excellent album. i believe it has become the \\"bad Weezer album\\" due to poor judgement by critics and listeners. even though it does not contain the poppy sound found in the blue album, it packs a punch. i like this heavier, angrier sound just as much as the catchy, poppy harmonies on the blue album. I believe that there is one downside to pinkerton, the continuity and quality of the 10 songs is less than on the blue album. but never forget that Weezer rocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smells Like Weezer Spirit...","review":"This band is so much better than Nirvana it isn't even funny! Man, this cd ruled and still rules. Nothing can beat the lyrics of Rivers Cuomo or the excellent guitar and song writing. It wasn't really a big loss to lose Matt Sharp but it's always hard to see someone leave such a great band. BTW, The Rentals are nothing compared to Weezer. Anyways, I can't wait for the next weezer album. Long live =W=!! I really think this album is as good as the debut."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weezer's Best Album","review":"I always hear people dissing Pinkerton. That gets me really (mad). This is their best album. It begins with the (...) hardrock beat of \\"Tired of Sex\\" followed with the hard rock tune of \\"Getchoo\\" and \\"No other One\\" . And than comes my all-time favorite Weezer song, \\"Why Bother\\". This song is totally differnt from the first three (which are still awesome, mind you). \\"Why Bother\\" is less hard rock-ish, and has a (...) guitar solo halfway through. Then, comes \\"across the sea\\" which is, in my opinion, weezer's most emotional song. Following that is the (...) tune of \\"The Good Life\\", and after that, the infamous \\"El Scorcho\\". After El scorcho is when the album gets dull. \\"Pink Triangle, Falling for you, and butterfly\\", hardley compare to any weezer song ever written. But the first 7 songs (All of which are my top 7 fav =w= songs) completly dwarf the last three, giving this album 5 stars. If weezer is your fav band like it is mine, you must buy this CD! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock and Roll bonanza","review":"Well, when I originally recieved this gift over 4 years ago as a Christmas gift. I set it aside, still in its shrink wrap, until later last year. I listened to the first Weezer CD, and liked it. When I unwrapped Pinkerton, I was sonically blown away. I never put the cd down, and in fact, I wore out the ball bearings on my former CD player from playing the cd so much. after going through two copies of this CD. I can thoroughly recommend this CD to anyone who is a fan of rock music. From the lovelorn lyrics to the hard rock background...you'll fall in love. Anyone who's a fan of hard rock to soft songs, will love this CD. Getchoo later"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yay for Pinkerton.","review":"Before I first listened to this album, a lot of people told me how awesome it was and how it was \\"their best album\\", so when I first heard it, I was surprisingly unimpressed. Then, I listened to it a second time. I don't know what it is about this album that makes me like it so much. Perhaps it's the raw emotion that's in it from start to finish. All I know is that \\"The Good Life\\" describes my life perfectly, and this album is one of a select few that I can listen to 4 times in a row and not be sick of it at all. =W= forever! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This is a fabulous CD. True, it didn't sell as well as their Weezer's first album (also EXCELLENT) but it's full of incredible lyrics and raw emotion and energy. You'll notice that of Weezer's first three CDs, each one is different. The Green Album is the most radio-friendly, and this album is probably the least. But these songs tell stories and make you feel. Sometimes somber, sometimes angry, sometimes excited. It's a terrific album, and the band (Rivers especially) keeps trying to hide it. It's NOT something to be ashamed of, but instead something to cherish and admire. I'm seeing them in concert in a few weeks. Very excited. Buy it now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry- never could dig it no matter how had I tried","review":"OK - first off, let me tell you that I consider myself a huge Weezer fan. Being a fan of the band essentially since day one (Blue album release prior to the Undone and Buddy Holly popularity), I have REALLY tried to get into this album. I bought it the day it came out with almost orgasmic expectations. The first time I listened to it, I was HUGELY disappointed. I listened to it again this week for probably the 150th time, and I was still hugely disappointed.I just can't understand what everyone allegedly sees in this album. My gut feeling is that people must feel that it is trendy to think this is Weezers best album, so everyone jumps on the bandwagon. Obviously, to each their own. I have THOROUGHLY enjoyed all of the other Weezer works, especially the B-sides you can dig up online. If you want to really hear some good tunes, search and find Weezers unreleased tracks - they really rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"One word: \\"Disappointing\\"","review":"I've got most of their other CDs. I held off on this one due to the bad reviews and they were right. I can't recommend this one at all. Muddy sound, lousy lyrics, no hooks, nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT HAPPENED???","review":"This is definately heading off to a used cd store. Weezer's debut cd is definately one of the best cds in my collection...now what the hell do they call this racket? These songs don't really have too much depth, the lyrics are bad, and the instrumentation sounds like a five year old who just picked up a guitar and went crazy with it. Do not buy this piece of trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing.","review":"Well, Weezer's debut album is one of my favorite CD's, and because of this, I was excited as heck to go out and buy Pinkerton. I had to go to three stores to find it, and when I did, I was overjoyed. \\"Yay, more good Weezer music!\\" I thought. Well, I got out to my car, ripped open the package, and put the CD into my car stereo.Instead of hearing lyrical and musical masterpieces I heard in the first album, I heard a bunch of simple, unappealing racket. It's difficult to explain the sound, but it seems as though Weezer was going for something different and it just didn't work out for them. On top of all this, the lyrics are sappy and lovey. I suppose a lot of people might like that, but that's something I pretty much loathe. I can take one or two sappy love songs, but a whole album! Argh.Anyhow, I absolutely love Weezer's first album, but this one just didn't work out for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best CD ever.","review":"This is hands down my favorite cd. I can relate to so many songs, and I do not know where all of the negative feedback for this cd came from. Even if you don't like Weezer, get this cd anyway. From Tired of Sex to Butterfly you will thank yourself for spending the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"great album","review":"this album is good.weezer has really outdone themselfswith this one.quite possible their best work"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Underrated - Pinkerington is Weezer at its Best","review":"Honestly, I don't know why everyone LOVES the Blue album so much. Pinkerington is BY FAR the best of the Weezer trilogy. It is more mature and more varied than both the Blue and Green albums. While the Blue album clearly has its stand outs (Like Undone or Say it aint so)every song on Pinkerington is great. Its hard for me to pick a particular favorite among the lot. Unfortunately most Weezer fans failed to see what a masterpiece Pinkerington was and thus Weezer reverted back to their less mature, less artistic poppy stuff for the Green album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rolling Stone are ...!!","review":"Correct me if I'm mistaken, but... didn't Rolling Stone name this the \\"Worst ALbum of 1996\\"?!?!?! That's why I've chosen to eschew the music press altogether... They are too influenced by what's \\"in\\" at the moment. Remember the Top Pop Singles of All-Time article, with 20 or 30 boy-band and teen-... songs on it?? Geez!! No wonder this record was panned when it first came out: it was not in keeping with the music being heard at the time, AND it didn't have a \\"Buddy Holly\\" on it. This album is: a)MUCH better than the \\"Green ALbum\\", and b)As good, and probably more consistent than the \\"Blue Album\\". This is, in my book, Rivers Cuomo's masterpiece, with its sheer moodiness and explosiveness: if the Blue Album was a bespectacled cool geek, Pinkerton has taken off the eye-glasses and rocks as hard, tousled and sweaty as Black Francis ever did!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"So, I bought \\"Weezer\\" after I heard it a few times thinking it would be worth my $12...it was. I LOVE big guitars so I instantly fell in love with the first effort. Then I got a hold of \\"Pinkerton\\". More fuzzy guitar with great melodic vocals that you'll be singing for days! These guys put the Cars, Cheap Trick and Kiss in one great package for the 90's. If you like rock, do yourself a favor and buy this album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album ever? Could be!","review":"I like all of Weezer's CDs, but I think this one is their best. I don't understand how everyone hated this! The only 2 songs that aren't great are \\"Tired of Sex\\" and \\"No Other One.\\" Everything else, I could listen to over and over again and never tire! I can't really pick a favorite, but it's probably either \\"El Scorcho\\" (just so weird it's great! Plus it's the only song I can play on the guitar) or \\"Pink Triangle\\" (hilarious). \\"Across the Sea\\" is pretty good, too...slightly creepy, sure, but good nonetheless. It took me 3 months to find a copy of this CD, and I had to spend $18, but it was worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Underestimated and underplayed","review":"Okay, let's be honest with ourselves -- The Blue Album was obviously the best Weezer release ever, and will probably remain that way forever. However, there are good things about every album by these guys, because every album seems to have its own unique sound. Pinkerton, for example, is more angst-drive and edgy than their first album. People failed to give it a chance! From the frustrated openings of \\"Tired of Sex\\" and \\"Why Bother\\" to the in-your-face wailings of \\"El Scorcho\\" (which happens to be one of my favorite weezer songs) and \\"The Good Life\\" to the quiet reminiscance of \\"Butterfly\\" the CD rocks and rolls and should definitely not be passed up. This is a must-listen for any weezer fan or music lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"the bottom line","review":"\\"El Scorcho\\" is the greatest song ever written. They should have filled the entire album with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"COOL!!","review":"Weezer's cool! I love this band!! How can they sing dumb songs so well?!? And these same songs are so cool too... This cd is 100%!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than their first","review":"Weezer is a great band, and it is sad if they turn out to be one hit wonders. This album definatly deserved more attention it would have been a hit if it had more airplay. Every song is great (except perhaps Butterfly)and the album has a cool Madame Butterfly connection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure Emo","review":"I've heard this album called \\"the bad Weezer CD\\". Nothing could be further from the truth. This is pure, raw emo. Stripped of it's cheesy pop, 13 year old girls just won't \\"get it\\". Much more raw and gritty than Weezers first. The first track says it all... \\"I'm tired...so tired...I'm tired of having sex...so tired\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"More Addictive Tunes, Minus \\"Buddy Holly\\"","review":"I have had this album for less than 24 hours and I have already listened to the entire album plenty of times. Weezer has to be the most addictive band that ever was. I enjoy \\"Pinkerton\\" even more than the last album, mainly because \\"Buddy Holly\\" is nowhere to be found here. That is the one Weezer song that you can overplay and it ended up being extremely annoying to me in the end. I read the other reviews for this album and I noticed that some fan's feelings were hurt because there was no ultra-catchy \\"Buddy Holly\\" on \\"Pinkerton\\". I'm sorry, pal. Maybe it's time you realized that any band that has real talent will experiment and change with every album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a Failure for weezer at all","review":"Everyone talks about how this album killed weezer commercially but in reality suppose they release another blue album in 96' it sells moderatly well maybe platnium and weezer just drifts off into obscurity as the fickcle fans lose interest, but instead with pinkerton they create a rabid fan following that grows every year by word of mouth until thye return to touring in 2000 more popular then they were before! They owe thier success to the \\"underground\\" (i.e. music fans whose opinions arent in the mainstream media) scene which had every teenager into emo at all talking about how much they like pinkerton as a sign of how cool they are. The green album was a success only becasue of these fans, sure the songs are catchy but there is tons of catchy music out there that doesnt get the airplay that weezer did."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can I Say? It's weezer.","review":"First of all this is not like the first album, it has a slightly different style. At first it may seem foreign but it eventually grows on you. Some people say that it isn't any good. These \\"people\\" are not true weezer fans, ignore them, they're stupid. This album is just as good as the first, it's just different"},{"rating":"2","title":"Carlos' review","review":"Although I first though of this cd as nothing more than good, I soon became obsesed with it. What makes weezer so fantastic is, the more you listen, the more you love. Everyone I know agrees with me that at first they don't care for the album too much but soon can't take it out of their cd player. This album is much more hardcore than the first cd, but is still weezer. More agressive guitar and less pop-lyrics make the album. The album really is that wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a phenomenal album","review":"How sad that the \\"critics\\" and the \\"real Weezer fans\\" despised this album, while heaping praises upon the repetitive and utterly meaningless (But, admittedly, entertaining) Green Album. What is the world coming to? I suppose it might be because Pinkerton takes a few listens to fully appreciate. (Unlike the first album, which will probably catch you right away) But giving a magnificent masterpiece like this anything less than five stars would be an act of high treason. (To who? Humanity, of course) People who heard the Blue or Green albums first will be in for a shock when they hear this. After the preamble, I usually do individual reviews for each of the songs, but that would be pointless since they're all so incredible. I can't guarantee that you'll love this album as much as I did, but at an average retail price of 10 dollars, how can you lose? Buy this album today. If you don't like it, give it to me. I could always use a backup copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Woo Weezer","review":"I bought this CD when the album was first released and I listen to it as much now as I did then. I really enjoyed their self titled album Weezer which prompted me to immediately buy this one. I'd never even heard of them at the time when a close friend of mine turned me on to them and the Foo Fighters. Don't even get me started on the Foo Fighters 'cause I just love 'em. But this is about Weezer. I usually just listened to R&B and some alternative music, now alternative is what I seem to be into the most now and it dominates my music collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"life changing album","review":"This is one of my favorite albums of all time. Rivers Cuomo at his songwriting peak. If you want to hear Weezer at their best, get this album now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta Have it!","review":"I'm kind of a \\"new\\" Weezer fan (or I was recently) so before I heard this album I wondered why everyone loves it. Then I heard it. Now, I understand. What an amazing album. But don't take my word for it, go listen to it. I swear, I can no longer go a day without hearing either \\"El Scorcho\\", \\"The Good Life\\" or \\"Across the Sea'. Trust me, if you haven't already, you NEED to hear this album.

Ignored upon its original release, \\"Pinkerton\\" now stands out as Weezer's most accomplished album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only 1 Regret...","review":"I should have bought Pinkerton when it was released instead of listening to a friend of mine tell me it wasn't that good. Some tracks you will recognize from the radio with others that have that great Weezer sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now that what I'm talkin' about!","review":"Outstanding CD. The best song on here is \\"Tired of Sex\\". The lyrics may be a bit shocking at first but the guitar is unforgetable. Another good song is \\"The Good Life\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent but not perfect","review":"\\"Pinkerton\\" proves that there is more to Weezer than the nerdy image and lets the music speak for itself. All ten tracks are emotionally charged and well written, and the songs won't get out of your head for months. Rivers Cuomo, the man behind Weezer, shows musical maturity from the last album. He specializes in writing about relationships, in which he usually gets dumped, and this album speaks of nothing else. This is where \\"Pinkerton's\\" weakness lies, but the diversity of the music usually compensates for the lack of subject matter. Songs such as \\"Why Bother?\\" are heavily distorted and full of energy, but the last track \\"Butterfly\\" is a melancholy, soft acoustic song that serves as the perfect finale. Each song has something to offer, and \\"Pinkerton\\" is solid from start to finish. Even though Weezer did disown \\"Pinkerton,\\" it is still their best album to date."},{"rating":"2","title":"To Underrated","review":"This album was so good to bad it didn't because as famous as the first one. Tired of Sex is an awesome song and so is A Good Life and all of them. Rivers and the boys are still coming out with the good ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Killed my cat.","review":"Little Chauncey Purringtons the second (my cat) was sleeping on the window sill when I started the record, but I forgot the volume was all the way up on the stereo from the previous night of partying. His greatness flipped the hell out, and landed two stories below safely on his feet. Then my neighbor's pit bull ate him. The record also blows manatee flabs."},{"rating":"2","title":"An emo masterpiece, perfection from start to finish","review":"The topic is quite debatable: What exactly makes a \\"masterpiece\\"? The term may be very loosely used among diehard fans who worship the band as some sort of deity. However, this album, undoubtedly, can be called a masterpiece in every aspect of the word. With every single note plucked, every single word uttered, every single drum pounded, you can hear exactly what is on Cuomo's mind as he shares his personal conflicts with the listeners. The lyrics are heartfelt and dramatic, which is why they are so flawless and magical. When playing this album, it is almost as if Cuomo is reciting his latest diary entries to the audience: the lyrics are about as personal as can be. Hundreds of others have said the same on this album's behalf, but this LP, this piece of art, is not only one of the greatest musical endeavors carried out by Weezer but perhaps one of the greatest musical endeavors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"This album is great. I love this album. Every song on this album is great and it's easy to listen to this straight through. However, don't expect another Pinkerton because that's like Pearl Jam makinganother No Code. It's not going to happen people. Enjoy this record and move on."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Weezer album!!!","review":"This is the must have Weezer album!!!!!After a great debut self titled album produced by Ric Ocasek, Weezer set out alone to produce this CLASSIC album. The results a little more loose, a bit more raw and allot more feeling. While the playing is kinda sloppy on some of the tracks the quality of the songs and the vibe of the band definately shines above.The standout songs on this album for me are Tired Of Sex, Why Bother?, Good Life, Butterfly. My big favorites are Pink Triangle, for those of us who fell for a lesbian and Across The Sea, for those of us who love the bearly legal set.Reading the reviews I see some compare them to the Pixies. WHAT?! Weezer is nothing like the Pixies, Weezer is so different from anything out there and this record shows them at their best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly the greatest album of all time!","review":"When I listened to the first album, it blew my mind...every song was a hit, and the entire album danced in my head 24/7. I thought nothing could top it, until Pinkerton came out! This is by far the most-played album of the 150 or so that I own... As hard as you try, I'll bet that you can't find one thing to truly dislike about this album. The 50's-rock guitar chords make a perfect compliment to Rivers Cuomo's genius lyric writing. Buy this album!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"weezer","review":"This album is absolutley amazing. There is no comparison after you have heard this album. After you listen to this you are hooked for life.=w="},{"rating":"2","title":"Not you're classic Weezer","review":"Weezer's second album delivers a shock, and almost a blow, to the average Weezer fans. While being condemned as \\"uninspired,\\" this is probably the most inspired of the three albums, mostly because they weren't trying to please an audiencs. This album is an outlet, designed to show a different side to the band. With a lot of stranger mixes and instrument variations, they sure did the trick. Although the music is not bad, it is not their best. If you are a hard core Weezer fan, get it, because it truly is a crucial step for the band, but if you are just trying Weezer out, get the Blue album. Weezer fans appreciate all three, and realize the beauty of the music much more than the critics ever will."},{"rating":"2","title":"Youthful, energetic and at the same time a little sad...","review":"The entire album sounds like one song, but it is Weezer's unique style that makes it a good album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointing after listening to first CD","review":"I feel betrayed by Weezer - They did such a superb job on their first CD. It had a style all of its own. This new CD brings Weezer back into the cesspool of other manic-depressive alternative titles. Its songs are harsh, not fun like \\"Buddy Holly\\" or \\"Undone.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"D-oh!","review":"I can only imagine the conversations that went on before this album was recorded. (\\"Hey, man...how hard can producing an album be? Ric, Schmic. Let's just do it ourselves! All we need is someone's empty basement, a few cases of beer, a couple amps, a mic and a Radio Shack tape recorder!\\")I love Weezer and I really, really tried to get into this album, but I can't. I still can't erase the horrible memory of first listening to it. (Sort of like the way I felt when I first heard The Strokes, but that's another story...)Pinkerton is AWFUL.Anyone expecting this to be anything like the other three albums is going to be sorely disappointed.If your life isn't going to be complete unless you have the whole Weezer catalog, go ahead. Don't say that you weren't warned..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I'm sorry, but the only reason why I had bought this CD was because of El Scorcho...which is a great song. Everything else just doesn't cut the mustard. Maybe I'm expecting a cute CD like their first one. But everything is just really really really bad. I can't understand why people like this rancid album."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were they thinking?","review":"Oh, please! I am a Weezer loyal fan, however, I got disappointed after listening to Pinkerton, since its quality is too low for what they are really able to make, I'm sure, and that's the reason of why they didn't get much money with it. The truth is that I dislike the sound of the guitars in this album. An example of what I mean is the instrumental beginning of Getchoo and No other one. Besides, the songs in general are displeasing. Why bother? really BOTHERS with its simplicity, Across the sea is such a big garbage, and I consider some other tracks as the worst made by this band. On the other hand, my favourites are The Good Life and Butterfly, which is the last one and results to be a tune so beautiful and surprising because that's not the type of any Weezer song. So, if you like the band, I wouldn't recommend you to buy this one, but the Blue Album and the Green one. They do show their highness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Album ever Recorded!","review":"Sorry to upset all you Weezer fanatics but I guess I just don't get the joke and musically I'm completely inept. I truly wonder what all these five stars are about considering this album is nearly as bad as Scott Wieland's solo L.P. It appears Ric Ocaseks production and dire help was needed the second time around. Maybe if Rivers tried to write a song not involving one power chord we could get somewhere. Utter garbage and waste of jing. Have a nice day geeks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jon W. for President!","review":"Jon W. is right, this album is terrible. If you want good songs, buy their first one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Weezer album!","review":"Too bad they hit their sophomore slump so hard. The blue album was pretty good. I was looking for an improvement beyond that. But this is just annoying. I wish Rivers would have stayed in his cave for the rest of his existence. Their music just keeps going downhill. The only song that is tolerable is Pink Triangle, and maybe The Good Life. But come one, it bombed on the charts for a reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"This album might not be for everyone; it's not as goofy or cheerful as their debut. However, 'Pinkerton' is terrific. The songs are very catchy, but also bitter or bittersweet as well. After all, the album is about loves lost and loves never meant to be. That kind of subject matter might not be your cup of tea, but if it is, you will love this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the few albums of the 90's that has more feeling behi","review":"Rivers Cuomo wrote this amazing album while attending at Harvard and he put everything he has into it. I wouldn't be surprised that Weezer didn't release another album because this type of music comes once in a lifetime! You must listen to this album a few times before you find what I mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Musical Perfection","review":"\\"Pinkerton\\" is my first purchase of albums from Weezer, after listening to this one I now have to get the other two! \\"Pinkerton\\" is a very solid effort from Weezer. There is not a bad song on the cd and each song tells a story while at the same time being catchy and infectious. I have heard bits and pieces of the Blue Album and enjoy it but I am always one that will take the CD which actually tells stories within the songs. For instance I will always love the unreleased \\"Lillywhite Sessions\\" from Dave Matthews Band because that cd is so very personal and you can tell by listening to it that it is from the heart, and that is exactly what \\"Pinkerton\\" is. There is a song for everyone to relate to on this album. The only bad thing is if you pick this one up don't expect the other two albums to be the same because they aren't."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best!","review":"It irks me that Rivers Cuomo is cutting down on this album. It's Weezer at their finest. Yes, it's better than the blue album, and easily better than the green. The emotions flow, and you can easily realte to the songs. Pinkerton will be hard to match."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weezer's Pride and joy but very UNDERATED!!!","review":"The best songs are:So tired of SexAcross the seaWhy bother?The Good LifeButterflyBut I think all the songs are good!!!!!!!!Its worth the money and its way better than the really poular album they have.

Even though Cuomo reckon this album as a failure, it is not. In fact, this is their best album and one of the best albums of the decade. It may be a bit hard to get into some tracks, but it's worth giving the album some time. It may have the most noisy guitars of their albums, but the lyric s are so great, so catchy, that you'll be singing them forever. Trust me. Buy this album and you will never regret it, never ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weezer's Pinkerton is a great album.","review":"Pinkerton has everything that one could ask for in a rock/pop album. It has a rawness that is uncommon in the realm of digital recording, yet it still has a sparkle of professionalism that can only be grasped by competent musicians. The melodies are so incredibly catchy that they will have one singing along in just minutes. The lyrics are personal/emotional, and sometimes even amusing. If you have had a hard love life, then you will definetely relate. This is a must have for any rock and roll or guitar pop fan. The musicianship that this band possesses shines through like a shooting star.

Her heart-wrenching ballads will have you feeling with her and her dance numbers will have you moving around the house. Hopefully her recent exposure on the Rosie O'Donnell Show and Ally McBeal will give her the audience she deserves. This woman can sing!!!

There can also be no denying that her limited recorded output and lack of greater success are among the true crimes in contemporary music. Unfortunately the material she has sung has not always allowed her to shine, nor has she always had the arrangements to do justice to her gift. Luckily some of her greatest moments are included here, giving a taste of her prowess as a belter and as a true interpreter of songs. And I Am Telling You I'm Not Going is still my all-time favourite vocal performance and even on funky outings like No Frills Love and Hard Time For Lovers, her voice lifts them to another level."},{"rating":"2","title":"Striking voice","review":"The album is fantastic.

It (sadly) has no magic powers. It just dries hair. End of story. All I can think of is The Emperor's New Clothes. I feel stupid for having fallen for this nonsense.

Horrell lays out the biblical description of the church, pokes fun at the monotonus circles the church is moving in, but refuses to make the New Testament description the model for the church. He alleges that God has given the church wide lattitude as to form and structure and seems to twist himself into knots trying not to offend his denomination (with one eye on his job, no doubt). We're probably doing it all wrong, he says, but then adds, who is to say what is right or wrong? Save your money and pass up this book if you are looking for straightforward answers to church dillemas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frequent errors make it difficult to use","review":"I needed an intro to Perl, which also let me jump into examples. From the table-of-contents, this book seemed like it would be a good one. However, I found the first chapter so full of errors (especially in the code examples) that it was almost worthless for a Perl newbie like myself.With Perl especially, it is difficult to know for certain whether a stray symbol in the code samples is a mistake or a subtle construct of Perl. This book's examples are cluttered with such odd mistakes, which really are generally mistakes.Even worse, there is really inadequate discussion surrounding the code examples to tell exactly why they are presented. Sometimes new constructs actually are introduced in the examples, without explanation surrounding them (or even reference to the later sections where they will be fully explained... which would be fine too).Very difficult for a beginner, and probably too simple for an expert."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too proprietary","review":"As you go through the book, more and more examples rely on the previously discussed code. That makes it unusable as a reference book.My main complaint is that well over 1/3 of the book is devoted to HTML parsing and dynamic output, which is great. The problem is that the author wants you to use his HTML parsing engine for every 'How-to' recipe. So, if you don't want to use this particular parsing method, close to half of the book is useless. :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"This book was a great resource in preparing the two presentations for teachers that took place two weeks ago.

The thing I like about it is that it's different than the TV show. They actually go on an adventure. There aren't all the characters, (just Barney and 4 kids) but the camera angles aren't from 100 ft back like the live tapes. One other thing to realize is if you buy really long tapes (70 min +) they are likely to break much faster than the short tapes. This is a factor because our daughter has probably seen this tape about 40 times.

This useful book gives the tense, voice, mood, person, and number for each verb in the Greek New Testament, verse by verse. Not a very interesting book, but a useful one; however, it is important not to become too dependent on this - if you want to get good at Greek, you will have to learn to recognize these forms. Do not use this book before you try to parse the verbs yourself, use it to confirm your own understanding. I have found a useful game for improving my parsing skills - I read a few verses, write down the verb forms, then check them in Han.

This BBC production, which deals with 19th c anti-semitism, is well worth the tiny price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Intoxicating","review":"I love this movie! I think it was done very well, and Hugh Dancy is simply hot. The movie is very dense, with a lot of opportunity for critical analysis. It is not lighthearted, but still has a good ending. It is not necessarily a family movie, not because of any overtly vulgar scenes, but because the themes are more complicated and appropriate for adult audiences. It has four episodes on one disk and is not a typical 19th C. plot. Great movie! One to watch multiple times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Period Piece","review":"Cable programming has become boring at times to watch, so I have decided to purchase more interesting programs and movies like bbc and period pieces centered around 14th to 19th century. Daniel Deronda was a great period piece. The storyline was very interesting. I was not prepared for some of the twists in the many events that took place and the final outcome of the story. I found it to be quite a moving story. I think others will enjoy it just as much as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable","review":"I've read Daniel Deronda several times and I found the miniseries to be enjoyable.It certainly bears a mark of an Andrew Davies screen, attempting to remain on the fine line between the author's original work and making it enjoyable for modern audience. Other times, Andrew Davies has failed miserably, but he did well with this version.The cast is wonderful and it is just long enough to keep one enthralled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment..","review":"Most of the characters in this movie are great, the scenes, the costumes and everything but I didn't like the outcome of the story .. I felt Daniel changed somewhat after discovering his past and I couldn't understand his abandonment of his former love in order to persue a life with that new girl. To be honest I never liked Gwendolyn's character at all, she was selfish, self centered and annoying, yet towards the end I felt very sorry for her, after all she'd gone through for Daniel and he seemed to have just forgotten all that which happened between them.It's just what you expect once you discover the jewish factor involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"A VERY painful Experience","review":"I love BBC miniseries, like Pride and Predjustice, Berkeley Square, Wives and Daughters, just to name a few. But this was torture to watch. It is so overly dramatic it's like watching a poor high school play. I didn't care about the characters and the plot (if in fact there had been a plot) was so slow ... so slow and disjointed. If this were going to be a story about the Jews returning to their homeland, I would have loved to see that. If it were going to be a story about British aristocracy, I would have enjoyed that too. I Don't understand how the other reviews for this movie are so high. I would not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant work of art","review":"This production is one of the best I have ever seen.

It was disappointing. I did not connect to the characters, not even Daniel. I kept waiting for some redemptive part that would make me glad I watched it. There was none. If read and enjoyed the book or are a psychology major as a previous reviewer claims to be, you probably would enjoy the movie. However, if you didn't read the book and are not trying to analyze the psychology of each character, I would suggest sticking with Jane Austen and Elizabeth Gaskell books and movies. Otherwise it is another boring English movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff","review":"I bought this set because I love all period movies/mini-series. It is definitely worth the money but be warned its not on par with North and South or Pride and Prejudice. The story wanders sometimes and can be a bit sedate.This movie features some very beautiful scenery and the clothes are beautiful. I believe that most period fans will love this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so hot","review":"Beautiful costumes and landscape but the actors didn't seem committed to the story line or were, in my opinion, not doing their best work for whatever reason. Nothing set this film aside from the usual British period piece.

I felt there was next to no chemistry between Daniel and Mirah; whereas he seemed more compatible and happy with Gwendolen. This movie is a huge waste of time and money. I wish I read between the lines of what the other reviewers also tried to express."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time it takes to get through it","review":"Okay, I am glad that so many people enjoyed this film, but having never read the book, I had a very hard time getting through it. Let me start off by saying that I love period dramas, but this film was terrible. I didn't like ANY of the characters, and the supposed lovers of the film barely speak to each other. No one in this film is happy, and for the most part, they don't deserve to be. There is lots of whining and complaining about why life has to be so difficult and unfair, but I just want them to get over it!There is a large part of the film devoted to discovery of true identities, but that still feels wholly unresolved by the end, because knowing who one's parents are doesn't mean they'll know who they are themselves. It doesn't change anything for the better.Now I will say the costumes are beautiful and there are some amazing landscape shots, but I cannot under any circumstance recommend this movie to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good if only for the brilliance of the production","review":"An early Romola Garai vehicle, \\"Daniel Deronda\\" is faithful to the novel while yet putting its own stamp on the story. The cast is stellar and impressive, and Garai fans get their money's worth. This is a gem for period-costume advocates, one which effectively takes the viewer back in time. The pace is slow but deliberate and never boring - George Eliot, we think, would have approved."},{"rating":"1","title":"It had promise","review":"I enjoyed this movie..but halfway through, it became utterly boring and depressing.

Other than zombie, ac/dc, and ozzy, itsjust a soundtrack fit for a different show. They missed the opportunity to really put out a soundtrack of good metal/hard rock anthems.

I saw it the day it came out and a second time three days later. On the cover are MTV's Beavis and Butthead in clothes and hairstyles from the 1970's riding motorcycles like a scene from an episode of TV's \\"Chips\\". The album opens with Isaac Hayes' TWO COOL GUYS sounding like it was recorded in the seventies. Hayes had a hit in '71 called \\"The Theme from 'Shaft'\\". The Red Hot Chili Peppers cover the Ohio Players' '75 hit LOVE ROLLERCOASTER. AIN'T NOBODY was covered by LL Cool J. That song was recorded sometime in the 70's,I just don't know by who. AC-DC recycles their song GONE SHOOTIN'. Even Engelbert Humperdinck recorded a song called LESBIAN SEAGULL. That probably went below his principles.

I also like \\"Two Cool Guys\\" and \\"Love Rollercoaster,\\" but the rest of the songs on the CD were not particularly memorable. However, the White Zombie song made it all worth it.

It also means that I'll be giving Mr. Cashwell's book to all of my more ornithologically-minded friends, not to mention language/literature buffs, since Mr. Cashwell's amusing musings are by no means confined to things that fly and should therefore not be - dare I say it? - pigeonholed into just one category."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best thing to get your kids back on track","review":"I bought this for my 4 and 5 year olds to teach them personal responsibility and the value of money.

We would set a value to the check marks and at the end of the week, we would add up all their check marks and give them their allowance. They could then use that money to buy the toy that they wanted. I find that they value the toy more when they earned it instead of just being given whatever they want.

All doubts were erased when I saw the production values, saw the beautiful women, and heard the flyest in-movie soundtrack that I've heard in a while. Snoop plays a character that all of us fellas can relate to and want to be. Shillae Anderson is so damn fine too! You've got to see this girl. She will probably blow up after this role. The girl that plays the attorney is ridiculous also. Get this movie and get a hold of some of the tracks from the movie. Ride out and pimp on! Be easy people."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING: SCARY FOR KIDS- not to mention terrible writing!","review":"Honestly, i expected shallow- i mean- it's BRATZ- my expectations were really low, but the entire disc is just really scary ghost stories that derive from urban legends and it makes amusement parks and clowns even scarier than they already are.There is no feeling of safety here.There is no happy ending.it isn't just silly fun.There wasn't even a redeeming message, just stuff to give kids nightmares-please don't waste your money on this.there is no Passion for Fashion on this disc."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO SCARY!","review":"BEWARE! This is packaged as a fun little girly girl sleepover and it is a MONSTER STORY. The girls turn into monsters and it is good for night mares. Moms, you might wanna preview before you let kids watch this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Scary","review":"I got this for a sleep under my daughter was having, thought it would be perfect. Wrong, wrong, wrong... very scary, mature themes. Stay Away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disc did not include Kidz Fairy Tales","review":"I ordered this two disc combo but the only show included was Kidz Sleep Over. The Fairy Tales show was not included, either on separate disc or on the disc with the Sleep Over show. I have one very disappointed child and this disappointed parent. Would have saved a couple bucks by just ordering the one show."},{"rating":"1","title":"HATE THE ENDING!","review":"DO not waste ur money on this! i thought it wuz going to be an awesome movie, but my title explains why i hate it. dont make the same error as me purchasing this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not at all Scary!!!","review":"I have every single Bratz movie, and this one was a real treat. I got a little creeped out at some parts, but that's what made it fun!!! I was even laughing at some parts!! Anyone who's scared of this really is a big loser."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too scary...","review":"This movie is entirely too scary for children. The images and themes are too mature for young audiences. Parents that don't want to put crazy ideas in to their childrens heads should not purchase this video. I stopped the DVD and threw it in the trash. Total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Fashion. No Music. Just... Scary.","review":"Ilove Bratz and thought this movie would be just like the others, involving fashions, cool music and cool things. I was really wrong- This is almost extremely scary.This features about 10 year old Bratz coming over a friend's house for a sleepover. They tell scary stories. One is about Sasha getting sucked in a mirror, and never getting out. Next one was when Megan was at the Carnival with two sisters and then everyone suddenly dissapeared. Beware- that episode features scary faces and abnormal creepy laughing. Cloe tells one about a talking dog. Jade tells one about being chased by monsters.I admit I was actually a little SCARED when I went to bed last night. I mean, HELLO PEOPLE. The monsters, clowns, and other things are freaky.I wouldn't reccommend this to anyone. In fact, don't even buy it. I'd give it a zero if I could......."},{"rating":"1","title":"This freaked out my girls...","review":"We watched this movie in the middle of the afternoon amid Midwest sunshine. It still totally freaked my 6-year-old out. She is pretty good at separating fact from fiction but this had her and her girlfriend begging me to stop the show. I'm glad I didn't save it for a before-bed movie. They would never have fallen asleep. I'm sure older girls would enjoy it. First graders, not so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best bratz movie ever!","review":"this movie is awesome! i like scary stuff. i like cloe's story. i used to play the game on the computer, my brother was watcching me and told my mom about it. i wasn't mad. but mom said i had to stop playing the game because it might give me nightmares. so i rented the movie from the smoky hill library once i saw it. i loooooooooooooove this movie! all those fraidy cat girls out there need to shutup about this movie. it is awesome!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not hold air","review":"Like the included hair dryer inflation attachment. But, this mattress will not hold air. Very poor quality based on this most important of all features. Sent back to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is concenterated liquid, not powder.","review":"I ordered this thinking that it is powder. Turned out to be concenterated liquid. The description does not specify whether it is liquid or powder. Going to return this. See how it goes."},{"rating":"1","title":"1940 Woodworking & Carpentry","review":"This DVD was ordered by me, however I received a DVD titled Thanksgiving Dinner. A replacement DVD was sent to me, I received the same thing, with one exception, it wouild not play but the title was the same as the first one. Quality Information Publishers (QIP)are not sending out what one orders, nor are they replaceing the incorrect DVD with the correct one. I have returned both on them and I hope they issue me credit as requested. I will never do business with QIP again."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'll sell you this book!!!!!!!!","review":"This is a book for old farts, but even they might want to think twice before buying it. \\"Write about your retirement,\\" the book says, \\"Write about your wedding.\\" It gives no writing techniques or advice, simply prompts...\\"write about your first child's birthday!\\" And then half of the book is the own author's memoir!!!!!!!!!!! Boring!!! But if you still want to buy it, let me know, and I'd be happy to send it to you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT waste your money!","review":"This book is full of errors in grammer and contains NO usable information. It's page after page of less-than-basic advice.I think $1.00 is too much money to spend on this one. Beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only a review","review":"I was hoping this was a bit more but it's really short. It does give you some feel for the move but I would have liked to have seen a bit more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really clear cooking demo","review":"This dish looks so doable after the clear demo video. May try it with friends as a cooking \\"class\\" and serve it as a dinner party"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very cheap product.","review":"I have been working on cars for years. I installed two Kat's block heaters and both leaked from the center hole. No matter how little I tightened the nut, the product leaked. Too cheap for an item that requires so much labor to install. Steer clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy","review":"do not purchase this god forsaken horrible frost plug. i got it 2 put in my 98 jeep grande Cherokee and i spent more in anti-freeze then what the plug is worth. all it did was leak all over my drive way. if you really want one i suggest going with the OEM plug (at jeep dealer); that will be worth what ever the price is. my other suggestion is dont install it your self because at least if you bring it to a garage and have it done, they will have to repair it if it does leak and you wont need to waist all your money on anti-freeze."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these","review":"There are only two ways these can just go bad. Improper install or not burping your system before plugging it in.I have three of these installed. One is 6 years old and the youngest is 3 years old. Never had a problem. Ordering one for my new hunting Jeep."},{"rating":"1","title":"frost pug heater failure","review":"First one lasted 2 months. Second one lasted 1 month. The element will blow. The second one I put on a timer, so it did not even run all night. It probably had less than 40 total hrs on it. You get what you pay for. I guess for 10 bucks you can't expect too much. Bought my last one of these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"Boring, inane plot with a \\"heroine\\" who is so self-centered and shallow you wonder why you are bothering to read another word about her. Try Perri O'Shaughnessy's books instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnalite is top of the line","review":"If you buy one, you will have it the rest of your life. I got one from my Grandma 32 years ago for a wedding gift. I use it every week for many different things. Pot roasts are the best when cooked in these. I ordered another one, because my daughter needs one and has had her eye on mine. Very sturdy, useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not compare with Wagner Magnalite","review":"The lid does not fit tightly on the pot. The Wagner Magnalite Dutch oven tops are so tight they create almost a vacuum, lessening cooking time. This product is far less than expected. I'm very disappointed in the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"complaint","review":"the pot started to peel during the first use. the item is not safe to use and i want to return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting book, well written","review":"I really enjoyed this book as it provided insight into some men who are long since forgotten with their stories buried by the likes of Wyatt Earp, Doc Holliday and Wild Bill etc. Unlike another reviewer I saw nothing racist about this book. It's not the author's responsiblity to sympathize with anyone. He just related the facts as he believed them. This is my favorite old west book of all time. Ah the good old days!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Triggernometry: A Gallery of Gunfighters","review":"I have bought several copies of this book since first reading it a fewyears ago ... a recommendation in itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great love story and thriller.","review":"Blood Curse and Blood Spell were great romance and thriller books. I recommend them to any teenagers who love a good romance novel. Read it's great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for sensitive skin or fragrance-sensitive people","review":"I disagree with the comment that this spray does not have a strong smell. It's not quite perfume, but compared to some \\"traditional\\" sunscreen lotions, it has a very strong floral scent.Scent aside, this product made me break out in hives everywhere that I used it (arms, neck, shoulders, back). Obviously, I used the product only once, and then gave the remainder to a friend.I like other Neutrogena products, including some of their other \\"spray\\" (though non-aerosol) products like the Sunless Tanning Spray, but I would strongly *not* recommend this product to anyone with 1) chemical/fragrance sentitivities or allergies (or with family/friends with such sensitivities) or 2) sensitive skin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Stuff - Even for a very white chick in the tropics","review":"Spraying this stuff on was so light and easy I didn't believe I was really covered, but took my very pale skin for a June week in Key West and came back looking exactly as I left. Beach, boating, biking - we did it all. Can't recommend highly enough. And my very fancy dermatologist said to buy anything with Helioplex - guess it's not just a gimick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scent Too Strong","review":"I like the concept of a sprayable sunblock; however, this one has such a strong fragrance that it makes me gag. It literally leaves a trail of sunblock scent in my house. I'd look for another sunblock."},{"rating":"1","title":"This stuff sucks!","review":"My friends and I went to Florida this past weekend, and, based on the reviews of this product, I bought this sunscreen and encouraged all my friends to use it. We are all fair-skinned and had not been in the sun since last summer. Not only did all of us burn to a crisp, but our sunburns are splotchy and uneven."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy tanning","review":"This really did feel cool on the skin and protected better than I had hoped for. I have very sensitive skin and always burn but made it through a whole week in Hawaii with no burn and an actual light tan - a first for me. I took along aloe vera lotion just in case but didn't need it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anyone else have this problem?","review":"My husband works outdoors and was using this product faithfully on face, neck and arms. I can't be in the room when he sprays it but the smell goes away pretty fast so that wasn't a big deal. The big problem was his T-shirts would be stained orange at the neck and where they touched his upper arms. Scrubbing reduced the stains but wore out his shirts. Maybe it was a body chemistry thing. It kept him from burning but ruined his shirts so he no longer uses it.Has anyone else had this happen?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works, but needs improvement","review":"I prefer spray sunblock because they are easy to apply. This can sprays upside down and sideways. It is a bit strong in the scent department, but I did not find it particularly unpleasant. It's like wearing strong perfume.Neutragena body mist does feel refreshing when applying it in searing heat, but it could use improvements in a couple of areas: it does not dry instantly, and it left my skin with a sticky residue.One 5 ounce can only lasted my daughter and me about a month, and we use a total of 4 applications between us a week. The sun in our area of Southern California can be intense, with temperatures this week hovering near 110 degrees. My daughter's skin is medium tone. She is swimming in that sun, and she hasn't burned yet.This product works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give me Coppertone!","review":"Bought this sunscreen based on news show recommendation and reviews on-line. My husband and I (who never burn with Coppertone Sport 30) used this at the beach yesterday (we live in Florida). We are both burnt to a crisp. The areas we applied the sunscreen to the most frequently are the areas burned the worst. I could have used baby oil or butter and not burned any more than I did yesterday. Give me back my Coppertone,please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work as a Sunblock","review":"I hate having to spend 45 minutes lubing up my kids just to go to the beach. So I was thrilled when I saw this... it would be cleaner, fast... what more could you want.Except that it didn't work! As another reviewer noted, we came back after 2 hours and had a TERRIBLE sunburn.I guess it is back to the greased pig routine... On the plus side, my kids now have a VERY HEALTHY RESPECT for the dangers of the sun! They will NEVER go without sunscreen again because they know just how bad sunburn feels!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sunburned to a crisp!","review":"Similar to a few others, I used this all day long this weekend out on the boat with friends. I faithfully applied it before even going outside, and again after each time I was in the water. I actually think the areas that I applied it to most got the most sunburn. This is truly the worst sunburn I've had in ages. This product shouldn't be on the market!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading album cover, Cookie Monster on Crack vocals.","review":"I was walking though Best Buy last night, Perusing the selections of metal bands and trying to figure out exactly what I should come home with. I routinely pick up a band's cd that Ive never heard of, and Society's Finest was on the shelf... The Sticker says \\"Fans of Unearth? LoG? Dillenger Escape Plan? Pick up this album!\\"This is nothing further than the truth. Im a huge fan of Unearth And LoG, and it was pretty much outright false advertising. The sticker should have read \\"Enjoy Zao Style-hardcore? Pick up this album!\\"The songs are incomprehensible from start to finish. Although I know that there is a market for this sort of music, seeing the success of bands such as Dillenger Escape Plan, Zao, etc. But, It is not my taste in metal at all.
