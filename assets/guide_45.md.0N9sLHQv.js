Perhaps the title and chapter content of the written word will afford a bridge for readers who may not be art lovers, but these days such introductions are always welcome to build appreciation for art history and contemporary art. Generously and beautifully illustrated with paintings, sculpture and photography this little tome is a banquet for discovering new artists among the Old Masters. In the wake of the Brooklyn Museum press, this rich survey enjoys itself, provides beauty, and teases our senses in a way that is healthy, fun, and informative. A natural gift for friends and lovers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much to expect","review":"Draws the attention of every person that comes to my house...But it's a ''turn page book'' with nothing much to give.

I noticed it measured different than my stanley tape on a project, so I checked the accuracy. The measuring scale is off at least 3/32 or 7/64, a critical error in measuring for furniture making or trim carpentry. Checked the scale with a stanley tape, lufkin tape, and the standard, a starrett combination square ruler blade. The tapes were within 1/64 of the starrett, which is acceptable for a tape, but the Johnson was much more inaccurate. Johnson needs better quality control, and a concern for accuracy. Now I have to wait when I go back to this town to return it to this big box company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I have been looking for a new cd that would bring different types of styles together.

Once I started paying attention, I discovered that this game is anything but simple - in fact, it is very complex and there are rules to cover almost every situation.Bakalar discusses the rules, the players, the strategies, and even has a section on the managers, omners, coaches and umpires. He has a chapter at the end on how to talk like true baseball fan. I found this book very helpful in understanding baseball. I think that even a long-time fan would enjoy reading this book. It would also make an excellent gift for a baseball fan (though not for very young fans, as it is too complicated for a younger reader.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"This book is GREAT!

A country girl comes to the city, ends up with a slick saleman as a kept woman, but runs off with a bar manager to New York where she finds fame as an actress. Her bar manager husband falls on hard times and kills himself. Carrie's fortunes rise as Hurstwood's falls. The characters operate in the world of the city with its mystical pull. Their decisions and some chance events help guide along the plot, but this is a world of survival of the fittest. Carrie turns out to be fit, while Hurstwood does not. There are undertones of Darwin's theories. Dreiser himself occasionally appears as a voice in the work separate from the narrator and the characters. The Norton Critical Edition contains useful reference works at the back and a bibliography helpful for starting research."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterpiece","review":"Sister Carrie is a masterpiece of American fiction.

Once you leave the parking lot and head out on the trail you're on your own. The maps in this book are useless. They are 3 inch by 4 inch maps with very little detail. The maps show the main trail you would like to be on, but fails to show the many many trails that are unmarked and look just like the main trail. This could be the fault of the forestry or park service and also the book. The book maps have no trail numbers whatsoever. There are dashed lines and arrows to guide you. When it comes to an intersection of three or more trails your guess is as good as flipping a coin. The only reason I gave this book two stars instead of one or none is because it does get you to the trail head and describes what you might find along each trail if you are able to stick to the hike you choose from the book. I would not suggest this book or the Sierra Club book for Inland Northwest trails they're both useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Once a good source of information, now out of date","review":"This book is a once noble effort that is now in dire need of an update.

For the interested non-specialist, Wylen lucidly explains the opinions and debates of interpreters and scholars in the many fields touching on this subject. He convincing places Jesus as a Jew in the context of the great diversity of Jewish practices and beliefs in the first century. He demonstrates the evolution of ideas such as the physical resurrection of the dead and the concept of an immortal soul. Sources discussed include the apochrypha, pseudepigrapha, the apocalyptic writings, Philo, the New Testament, Josephus, and the Misnah and the Talmud.I have read other works that touched on some of these subjects, but what impresses me about this book is it's readability and clarity."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read for Christians...","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this title.

Wylen explains the scenes in ways that remind me of viewing scenes from the very first cameras, focusing on street scenes. He emphasizes the importance of political tensions and offers plenty of evidence and extra readings. It is well-written, aimed at the non-scholar, so it is easy to read. Wylen's knowledge inspired me to continue to enrich my understanding of this time period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. I love Jewish culture and am very interested in the history of Isreal. WARNING: If you believe the entire bible is the Word of God, this book is not for you. Mr. Wylen is a Rabbi at a Reform Jewish Congregation and clearly does not believe the whole Tanakh (Old Testament). As a Jew I understand that he would not believe the New Testament, however, he even tries to explain away much of the Old Testament. He is clearly a liberal critic with the agenda of trying to undermine any connection between the Testaments and the validity of prophecy and the New Testament. I'm not trying to insult the Rabbi, but much of what he wrote was utterly ridiculous. He gives no sound scholarly evidence for his findings. Personal opinion is at the root of his explanations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad, but shows bias in places","review":"Overall, this is not a bad book at all.

I finished it that very night. It's a very compelling book, and regardless of whether you have struggled with deep depression like the main character, his plight is written of in such a way that it really sheds light on struggles that we all have had at one time or another. I also think that Mr. Waldron wrote beautifully not only of the man's problems but also of his spiritual journey, and that of the other characters. In an era where many books tend to have shocking plotlines in order to grab the readers attention, it is very refreshing to find a book that is beautifully and compellingly written without having to resort to any of the base tactics of many other authors.

If A-M were a real city, this guide would get any tourist where he wants to go (or not).Something that I never noticed before seeing this map is how little of the Ankh part of the city has been explored in the books.

NO this is not a good film to educate people about the Jews."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Patterns of Management by Rensis Likert","review":"With all the new and interesting management theory going around today, from \\"Emotional Intelligence\\" to \\"Following the Gallup Path\\", students of management would be well advised to read Likert's original contribution to what makes for effective management. Much of what we are reading today, was researched and presented back in 1961 with Likert's findings. Easy to read and well documented, the is a classic that is often overlooked for the groundbreaking work it represents. Likert presents a thorough reivew of the research done at that time and also clearly presents and explains his notion of \\"the development of a better system of managing the human resources of an organization\\". His research methods, his findings, and his notions of effective management have held up over time and are clearly visable in the work being done today in the field. I would recommend this as required reading for any student of management."},{"rating":"1","title":"Different color from what I ordered.","review":"If I wanted an ugly lime green colored Colander, I would've ordered the other Inomata Colander you have for sale here.

It performs today just as it did the day it was delivered to our home.This television (both size and viewing screen) is huge! We went from a 32\\" tv to this giant. Images are life-size. You definitely need to have space between your sofa and the screen.Watching sports games and movies are like you're in the stadium or the theater, so get your hot dogs, nachos and popcorn.I would definitely recommend this model. We live in a smaller place now, so we're trying to sell our set. But if you have the space, its a guaranteed winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"light and relaxing","review":"If you are interested in spending a relaxing evening with a light movie this is a winner. Witty, with a great music score, good directing and acting ( especially by the supporting cast) and although a bit predictable it does offer a few unexpected twists. There are some panoramic scenes that look great on a large screen tv."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very fun comadey of errors","review":"I was really surprised with this film I thought it would be good but not as good as it was. The film is really fun from start to finish maybe becouse it's a fun movie of errors from mistaken identities and so on. The story is fast paced and has many funny moments. The acting is also really good from Heath Ledger to Sierean Miller and Oliver Platt who steals every scene. The film is really fun and a must watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST movie of 2006","review":"Don't let the awful coverjacket fool you, this is the best movie of 2006. All eyes were on Brokeback Mountain, another great film, but this is the Heath Ledger movie to watch -- and see what a great actor he is creating a totally different performance in the same year.Any comparisons to shakespeare in love is ludicrous, this movie is so much better. A great romantic comedy, a great comedy and a great movie period.This movie is fun, heartwarming and hilarious. I was completely surprised at how good this movie is and you will be too. I've seen over a 100 movies last year and this tops my list."},{"rating":"1","title":"It did not seduce me","review":"I always thought it would be a good idea to make a comedy about young Casanova - his incredible adventures, love stories, his struggle with church. Casanova was a fascinating historic figure, a soldier, spy, diplomat, writer, adventurer who will also be remembered as the greatest seducer and lover the world had ever seen (if only from his own words). His life and mystery surrounded him has made him an ultimate hero for many novels, plays, and movies. Sadly, not all Casanova's movies are good and Lasse Hallstr?m's comedy belongs to the long list of not successful movies. Sure, it is gorgeous to look at - it is 18th Century Venice after all, and locations, photography, Vivaldi's music, costumes, wigs, make up are first class but beyond all this is just another typical chick flick or romcom with Heath Ledger whose Casanova is not that brilliant and fascinating figure but just a cute guy - no more, no less.2.5/5"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Casanova for our times.","review":"An updated Casanova, intrigued by a complicated, modern woman. Heath Ledger and Sienna Miller are attractive and amusing: (Ledger: \\"Seducing a novice? She was hardly a novice.\\"); Oliver Platt quite wonderfully funny as a grotesque buffoon; Jeremy Irons a campy delight as the purple-robed inquisitor: (Bimbo: \\"You can make me a virgin again?\\" Irons: \\"My dear, we are the Church; we can do anything\\".) Venice in Blu-ray never looked more seductively exotic and romantic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heath's Heights","review":"Casanova is an enjoyable film. Alot of fun and very entertaining. Everyone involved are terrific. I love Heath Ledger as Casanova. I think its so great that he has two very different movies out on dvd ( Brokeback Mountain & Casanova ) that showcase his talents and versatility. I enjoy him in light farce just as much as in drama. Casanova is a delight to add to Mr.Ledger's filmography and definitely to all Heath Ledger admirers, such as myself. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun in 18th century Venice","review":"It is definitely worth seeing this movie for the gorgeous sets alone. The story is pure fun with Heath Ledger as an energetic Casanova, a luminous Sienna Miller as his love interest, and talented Lena Olin as her mother. Oliver Platt is hilarious and touching as a pompous yet insecure Papprizzio. Jeremy Irons as the \\"Chief Inquisitor\\" from Rome plays his part to the hilt. Clever writing and several plot twists keep you entertained throughout. Not sure how it got an R rating - only a tiny bedroom scene in the beginning - the rest is definitely PG-13 material. The DVD is a has several great extras including a \\"Making of...\\", a detailed look at costuming, and a tour of Venice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heath Ledger!!!","review":"I do really like this movie, especially since Heath Ledger is in it, but it is a little racy.

And, if you don't like the location, you will not care for the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heath Ledger at his most randy!","review":"The minute he died, I knew there would be a run on this film. He is wonderful in it. I had to own it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Performances by all actors!!","review":"I rented this movie and was surprised at how much I liked it. Heath Ledger is a great actor and gives a great performance in Cassnova. And I must not forget an unforgettable and superb performance by Oliver Platt. This was well written, well directed, and highly entertaining! It moves at a great pace so you must get onboard from the beginning. There was no lag and no drifting off as the movie was totally engaging. I knew I must have it for my collection!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining Fluff","review":"Casanova is an attempt to do a Shakespearian comedy set in 18th Century Venice. It has mistaken identities, romantic entanglements, and lots of swashbuckling action. It's not as well done as if the Bard had actually done it (How could it?), but it is nevertheless a bit of entertaining fluff well worth ones time and money. The costumes are splendid and, of course, the Venetian scenery is sublime. Another plus: instead of using modern tunes to make the story \\"accessible\\" to modern audiences, the film sticks with music from the period."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for woman of all age to watch!","review":"Casana had finally met his match! The movie is very funny to see the wit of the woman Casana is falling in love with. The is a romatic comedy. As Casana shared his secrets with the shy guy, I found the same principles could be used by woman toward man. This is definitely a must for woman of all age to watch! Casana is very clever in catching the human nature of curiosity. In the United States, we stress too much for a woman to catch a man. Man prefers to be the hunter instead of the preyer. A woman that is beautiful plus intellegence will still attrack her Casanova. I love the movie and will recommend it to the singles who would like to meet the opposite sex and the couples who want to keep their fire of love burning."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked this one too....","review":"just like \\"a knight's tale\\"...and \\"10 things i hate about you\\", this flick just makes you laugh and feel good. The fact that the star of this flick (Heath Ledger) is more beautiful to look at than most the women in the film is also a plus. After breaking our hearts in Brokeback Mountain, Heath makes up for it cracking us up and making us swoon here. As always, his work in this film is great. Even though it is not a film to be taken too seriously, there is always an intensity in Heath's performances. This is worth the watch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply delightful!","review":"Here is a lighthearted and romantic tale of the famous (infamous?) playboy Casanova. The sets of the Venice of a couple hundred years ago are truly wonderful. People who enjoy period films are sure to like this one.Heath Ledger does a surprisingly wonderful job of portraying the legendary seducer of women. In many ways, the whole concept of Casanova is like an inflated male fantasy. It asks: \\"What if?\\" it were the case that women were to chase after us like we chase after them? Insofar as that is concerned, the film is quite cathartic.One of the biggest selling points of the movie is that it maintains a great sense of humor. It's good to see how they were able to make a lighthearted film out of what was a rather dark chapter in world history. Typically, movies that deal with the Spainish Inquisition don't have happy endings........until now!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, Heath, why do you do such trash?","review":"Casanova is a beautiful film that happens to be a waste of a bright young talent. Take Heath Ledger in any of his other decent films--Monster's Ball,10 Things I Hate About You, orA Knight's Tale (Special Edition)--and forget that he did the rest of this garbage. It's hard to review a Heath Ledger film since his death without going into sentimental emotionalism, but Casanova is not a film worthy of him.Here are the highlights of Casanova:Heath Ledger, Venice, the photography, and some humor.Here are the problems with Casanova: the silly plot about the church and its moralism and the gross historical inaccuracies.If you can overlook those problems and just want to watch a beautiful film that makes you want to go to Venice, than watch Casanova. But if you want a good movie, you will have to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is Johnny Depp when you need him?","review":"The star of the film is Venice, dialog and role portrayal predictable. Costumes were great but it takes more then clothing to make a believable leading man, oh and the heroine was plain old vanilla, so if you have a choice see something else"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Good, The Bad And The Ugly","review":"The Good: Sienna Miller and Lena Olin as Francesca Bruni and her Mother Andrea Bruni. Charming!The Bad: Jeremy Irons as Pucci, the Grand Inquisitor. He is totally miscast in this role.The Ugly: Oliver Platt (Paprizzio) with his shirt off and Heath Ledger dressed as a Venetian fop in a powdered white wig, lace and ruffles. It just doesn't work.'Casanova' is OK (maybe) for one viewing and that's primarily because of the many lovely ladies cavorting about in amorous pursuit of the legendary lover."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very slight entertainment","review":"I had read reviews that stated this movie to be not half-bad. Well, take the half off, because this \\"Casanova\\" is simply stupid. Heath Ledger doesn't know what to do with this watered-down part and the leading lady whose name I do not want to remember gives a stilted and lackluster performance, if you can even call it that.One reviewer said that the script had some help from Tom Stoppard, but I don't believe it for one minute. And the cinematography is so bad that it makes the real Venice look like a cardboard set.$29.00! This DVD isn't worth 29 cents!Try and find a copy of Felini's Casanova. It's long overdue to be on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW! This is a must have CD!","review":"I own about 3500 CD's in my collection and I would have rate Tandy's CD in my favorite top 10.

A wonderful map and full-color photos make it visually appealing.The book is organized by geology: How are standing rocks formed? Where can you find gemstones? What geological conditions produce canyons? Are there any volcanic formations nearby? Where have they found fossils? If I were doing a report on a type of geological formation, this would be a great book to have. But I'm not -- I'm using the book to look at the natural wonders of the southwest and trying to decide where to take my family on the next four-day weekend.This book, being chopped up by types of rocks (to put it simply) is annoying because you can not use it to quickly find amazing photos of Zion National Park, for example. Information you want is scattered among several chapters.It's beautiful, but not useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Player skips, even in ESP and MP3 mode, but nice interface.","review":"I liked the interface of this player, but it has some real problems with skipping. At first I thought it was a problem with the media I was using to burn my CD's but then I used the media shipped with the product (you get 3 free CD's with the player) and found the player still skipped. The player would skip even without movement, at random, even in ESP mode, and while playing MP3 CD's. (With ESP off it almost wouldn't work.) Also, the player has no Hold switch. (The hold switch keeps you from accidently pressing buttons when the player is in your pocket or purse.) I returned it. You shouldn't buy it, go for a RioVolt or something from a more reputable company, like Sony, Panasonic, or even Phillips. Even if it costs a little more, you'll end up saving yourself the hassle of returning it. The interface and four line display, radio, and headphones are all very nice, much better than I expected, but that doesn't make up for the skipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Player with NO Battery Life","review":"This is a great MP3/CD Player, don't get me wrong.

But really though, regardless of all this, you know at first glance if this is your helmet or not!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hermetic Symbolism","review":"This book is totally not what I was expecting. Saint-Germain uses very deep and real symbols and correspondences to communicate that which can only be communicated through this means, and only with great care and understanding. To those who overlook this, as a previous reviewer who seemed to think that \\"spiritual works\\" should be more simplistic and literal, the only possibility is that they must be missing out on a lot. Even though this book is very short, it must be very carefully analyzed. A good working knowledge of Astrology, Alchemy, Kabbalah, Neoplatonism and Hermetica is recommended. Manly P. Hall's introductory writings are also really a fascinating read, and while I am open to even the most extreme possibilities, from experience I tend to take some of his information with a grain of salt and would like to see some evidence to back them up. I think this text may also shed some light on the development of the various rites of Egyptian Freemasonry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paranoia or a Medieval Men's Club","review":"This treatise is so full of allegorical allusions that I doubt anyone's expertise to fully interpret it and I found the reading for the most part to be disappointing.

In my opinion, if you are looking for insight, this book will not be that need fulfilling-the Masters of the Far East series might be a better read. The most informative section is Hall's analysis.In short it was not a good read for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paranoia or A Medieval Men's Club","review":"This treatise is too well disguised to trust anyone's interpretation.

I found lots of support here for the little problems that crop up. It details well some of the emotional ups and downs that go along with breastfeeding your baby. I felt comforted often by reading about exactly what I was feeling at some of the stages described.The other good thing is that the book carries you through months and months of growth and change. I still keep this one close to me as a reference I check often.The one bad thing is that the section on breast pumps is a bit anemic. And it didn't relate much to my personal experience. You might want to try a book or two specifically for working mothers who breastfeed for better information about pumps and pumping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pumps Not Discussed","review":"You would think a book of this length, entirely on breastfeeding, would discuss the use of pumps. However, the author wrote they do not discuss pumps because there are other books that do. Apparently they want you to go buy another book specifically on pumping.

Given, she is a maternal and child health care worker, but still, I expected more from this book. I only picked it up once or twice. I suffered from mastitis, and my daughter developed some late 'nipple confusion', and the book didn't give me any new help, that my mom couldn't give me.

It hooks you the first time you listen to it, the result of the great guitar riffs, vocals, and occasionally beautiful melodies. After that, you begin to hear the creative side of the band. Every time I listen to this cd I hear something new hidden in a different song...time signature changes, a dissonant chord here or there, a series of guitars hitting on the upbeat when they've been hitting on the downbeat throughout the song, a new meaningful lyric uncovered...this cd never gets old.

They are a definite rock band with a Christian twist but anyone can enjoy it. Cassie is probably the most religious of all the songs (talking about the girl at Columbine who answered \\"yes\\" if she believed in God so the shooters killed her). This is a great band and the singer reminds me of Amy Lee, except minus some of the lung power. I love most of the songs on here such as \\"All Around Me\\", \\"I'm sorry\\", \\"I'm so sick\\", and \\"Cassie\\". If you have heard any of Evanesence, this band sounds similar.

It sucked because I couldn't find the songs anywhere but now I know who the band is.Yay! haha 4 out 5 stars for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"An awesome band both Christian and Non-Christain rock fans should enjoy.Yes she screams on a couple of the tracks, so if your not into screaming its still a good buy, personally I'd grown to like it (before purchasing)!Check the band out on youtube and their homepage and get hooked & buy a CD!Rock on!--W Thomas"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT WANT","review":"I'm willing to admit \\"Cassie\\" is a decent song. However, the album as a whole I hope I never hear again. I had a friend who would play this cd while I was in the car so thankfully I never wasted money on it. Lacey's voice is powerful which is great but would sound a whole lot better if she didn't use it.A lot of reviews seem to praise the song \\"I'm So Sick\\". It uses a very simple, repetitive melody which some bands can pull off but it doesn't work here. The same four notes stick in my head for hours along with Lacey's whiny voice miraculously getting more and more annoying each time. It sickens me that so many other listeners think this is good music."},{"rating":"1","title":"two words \\"bad chemistry\\"","review":"i listend to the bands single \\"i am so sick\\" and i noticed a great scream, then a lovely sound by the vocalist Lacey Mosley who by the way has a really nice voice... but thats it !drummings are really weak and so does the bass, the guitars are not too good but fair.the music is weak, for instance every song probably last less than 3 minutes, what kind of band is this ??every song sounds the same. lacey has a great talent which is yet not to its fullest and she's wasting it on a weak written music. her voice are lyrics are natural.i do not recommend you to buy it, yet i do recommend to download it and hear lacey in the song \\"i am sorry\\" which i think she did the best in. thats all"},{"rating":"1","title":"What.. The... Hell... ???","review":"Ok, so I read the reviews and listened to their song, \\"So Sick\\" and figured \\"eh.. This will probably be a decent album...\\" my god was I wrong... SO wrong. This CD pretty much represents all I hate about people that listen to music today, ten years ago and this group would have been shunned away as another one-hit-wonder, yet the high ratings here reflect exactly the point I'm trying to get across, rock music is dying, and damn does it suck. I put the CD in, listened to \\"So Sick\\" again, and then the rest came... I swear, I listened to four or five more songs after and felt like breaking this CD, but instead, I gave it away, a better solution I thought. Even their single \\"So Sick\\" gets annoying as hell after four or five listens, and then what is there? Nothing. If I could give this CD zero stars, I would."},{"rating":"1","title":"They should tear this Fly Leaf from the book!","review":"It has been brought to my attention, by the people who left comments, that the review I wrote lacked good judgement and taste. It is one thing to say you don't like something, but to be rude and belligerent is wrong; nevertheless, I still do not like the band, and, therefore, I won't raise the amount of stars I gave at first, but I do detract the words Appalling and vacuous.Fans of the band, please forgive me for being rude.The original review is below.The four and one half star rating of this album is beyond me. The music is substandard, the singer, appalling, and the lyrics, vacuous! If you are looking for a female-fronted metal band, buy Tristania, Epica, After Forever, or Within Temptation. This is a \\"Fly leaf\\" from a horrible book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I slept half way through...","review":"I hope and pray the next Evanescence CD flops, so that we can stop seeing bands as obnoxiously bad as this surfacing. Nothing original, nothing intelligent, quite simply nothing great about this album. Personally I would rather have freshly sharpened pencils jabbed into my ears than to ever have to listen to this girls voice ever again.Save yourself $12, don't but this."},{"rating":"2","title":"good debut","review":"This is a good debut album. Most of the songs are catchy and have good music. The price of the cd is good too. Despite what some people (incubus1) may say lacey's voice is similar to Avril Lavigne's. I wouldn't compare this album to Evanescence (who by the way do not get boring). The music isn't really similar nor are the vocals."},{"rating":"2","title":"so sick","review":"The new flyleaf CD is definetly sick. Lacys voice is definetly one of the big draws to the band. But the rest of Flyleaf is totally sick too. I saw them open for Staind and they totally rocked. So I got thier album and checked out thier website. On thier website, Flyleafmusic.com you can sign up for a mobil fan club which gets you free ringtones for thier songs and enters you in contests and stuff. Anyone who likes Flyleaf should seriously check it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as heavy as expected; but acoustical sounds good...","review":"It's good but mellow... not as heavy as I like. If you like acoustical more than heavy, give it a shot."},{"rating":"2","title":"flyleaf","review":"after stubbling upon this band on youtube, I look to amazon to aquire the music. I find this metal band refreshing. If you like flyleaf, then I would suggest lacuna coil, within temptations and fireflight as a look see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool CD","review":"This is a pretty cool cd! It's all rock and a little bit of screaming, plus theres some cool acoustic songs at the end of the cd! The riffs are catchy as well as the lyrics! You will definetly get into it and be movin to the beat! I would say they will play this CD on the classic stations 20-30 years from now! haha! Get this cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"surprise inside","review":"The 1st song and only sond I heard by Flyleaf was \\"All Around Me\\". So you could imagine my surprise when I heard the 1st song \\"So Sick\\". Most of the songs are heavy rock with the except of 2 or 3. It may take getting used if heavy rock is not your thing but I ended up liking it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting Vocals","review":"Discovered Flyleaf by pausing on an episode of \\"Beavis and Butt-head\\". I must say I was suprised considering the normal music they showcase. Lead singer Lacey Mosely's vocals can either shatter your eardrums or break your heart."},{"rating":"1","title":"WTF?","review":"First of all the users who rated this 5 stars are all girls. I heard one of their songs on mtv headbangers and damn they suck pretty bad. Her singer its a mix between avril lavigne and evanescence. Their songs sound all the same i dont see any difference. This band blows ass if you want to hear real girls rocking maybe you prefer to hear Kittie, Arch enemy or My ruin."},{"rating":"2","title":"great cd","review":"first heard this band on xm radio and really like them, listen to their cd and youll know why"},{"rating":"1","title":"Alright","review":"Some of songs skip. Received NO ring. Took a bit to get here. (Flyleaf) packaging was good. Does play nice besides the few skips. I may consider ordering from there again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lacey has the most awesome voice!","review":"Flyleaf is so awesome! I LOVE THIS CD!!! Lacey is awesome! I love the way she screams and sings. I got to see them in concert and they were awesome! I love all of the songs on here! This is a great rock album!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not from concentrate. No preservatives. Certified organic.","review":"When a friend casually asked me to pull up the \\"I'm So Sick\\" video on Flyleaf's Myspace page, I was a bit bored and tired. After a few bars of the opening baseline, I was already interested. Then Lacey screamed \\"I Will Break\\" and I was instantly excited and considering purchasing the album.In short, Flyleaf's music packs energy, enthusiasm, and an air of honesty (the latter being rare in our overproduced era, especially among younger bands). When my girlfriend, Jen, and I had the opportunity to see Flyleaf perform and spend an hour on their tour bus, we found more of the same love and ambition. These individuals have a genuine desire to spread hope to a hungry generation.This album is heavy enough for when you want to rock, and beautiful enough to accompany meditation or even prayer. Be cautious, however, because some of these songs have been stuck in my head for weeks at a time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Awsome","review":"It's a must have if you like hard rock. A great band on CD and even better live! You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flyleaf","review":"Amazing vocals done by Lacey Mosley. The band is just all around great. So much emotion put into each and every song."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you want a fresh new sound get this alblum","review":"This alblum is amazing. It sucks you in with the first song and keeps the riffs going. This is the only other band besides Evanesance that can pull off a heavy metal female lead. If you like Hawthorne Heights, Senses Fail, Evanesance or Incubus this is the alblum for you. I cannot wait to got see them live."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Very good, very good for people that like books! Totally AWESOME! Chaim Eliav is a awesome author!

Don't waste your money! 1 Star is to much","review":"I bought 2 of these when Toys'R'Us had them on special. Even that was a waste of our money. Both had to be returned within the first week. One never worked and the buttons on the other 'stuck' all the time. The replacements weren't any better. Even though we had the buyer protection plan it didn't do much good...since we bought them on 'special' they will only give you a player/or fix it up to the amount you initially paid for the item not what it actually retails for. It just isn't made very well:*the buttons stick and can easily becomed jammed*the lid that covers the USB port can come off very easily*the ear buds are poor qualitySpend your money on something else. You get what you pay for I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken right away","review":"Yuck...this MP3 player broke just after my daughter received it for Christmas. The play button stuck down and never popped up. We downloaded all of ONE song when this happened. I did purchase the buyer protection plan tho, so off I go to Toys R Us to exchange it.

However, within 2 hours the play buttons broke and the unit was useless.Very cheap product!!! Not worth $10, let alone $60.Toys R Us wouldn't take it back either. They wanted me to deal with Craig. I will NEVER buy anything form Craig or Toys R Us again! Pitiful customer service! I mean, you have to stand behind the products you make and sale! Neither seemed to care that my son's Christmas gift broke in less than 2 hours!

I earmarked a few pages - but not many. One book that was INCREDIBLE was \\"the knot guide to weddings vows and traditions\\"! Great book with TONS of ideas - i earmarked a TON of pages here. I was reluctant to get it at first just b/c it was \\"the knot\\" - even though they are the so called \\"wedding guru's\\"...you know....I just thought others might have other insightful advice....well, not so...trust me - save your money and just go buy the knot's guide - it was the best!

By the time the samples finally came around I was ready to fall asleep.Buy this if you have trouble sleeping otherwise keep looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great resource","review":"If you are planning your own wedding this is a great resource. There are so many good ideas contained in this one book. This book gave rise to more ideas that I would not have thought of otherwise. It isn't perfect - there are flaws here and there, but these are mainly personal. I love the sections where you can pick and choose from contemporary or traditional. This book does contain Christian-based ceremonies as well as spiritually-based ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking hard for a Unique wedding? THIS BOOK might help","review":"This book is not a workbook on what kind of linen to use at your reception or how to get bridesmaids to wear ugly dresses...For someone (me!) who's trying to put together a spiritual, unique, open-minded wedding this book helps. It's been really hard finding books that are for people like me that don't want to have a Church wedding with a lot of pomp and circumstance that doesn't keep in mind those of other sexualities and partner relationships.Though this book doesn't scream alternative..it's a good reading and offers a lot for you to think about!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Weddings from the heart","review":"This book was a great place for my fiance and I to start some dialoge about what we want. Both of us have been married previously and it was an excellent way for us to compare what we had before, and design a ceremony that is unique to us as a couple. We took a pen and circled parts we liked from several ceremonies and hope to compile them into one. This book came recomended to me and now I see why."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great tool for getting ideas for your ceremony","review":"My partner and I combed through this book learning the history and meaning of different kinds of ceremonies which really helped us as we wrote our own. I am not a specifically religious person so it was helpful learning the background behind the different parts of traditional ceremonies (invocation, vows, etc) as well as seeing how different folks (pagan, recovery) have created their own ceremonies. I actually found these sections a bit cheesy, but it was still a useful book in all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ballinger","review":"Black & white bnooks on painting do not give the true impression of what the colours are like. The few coloured pages are not really like the ocean that I have experienced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tyranny By The Numbers Exposed","review":"Matt Robinson shows how the media's obsession with public opinion polling distorts our understanding of politics and ultimately undermines our (small-r) republican government. The book begins as an expose' of polling and ends as a passionate defense of constitutional government. A powerful indictment of the modern bureaucratic state, the media toadies who help keep it happy and fat, and the citizens who don't take the trouble to know any better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new, or even slightly new, here","review":"This book is a regurgitation of an intro political communication class. I read page after page hoping there would be some new thoughts here, something that hasn't been beaten to death in other political journals or books, but sadly, no such thoughts exist. Robinson's political bias shines through, and while it didn't bother me as I am of a similar persuasion, when I read, I don't want my own beliefs reaffirmed on every page -- I want something interesting and worthy of the $25."},{"rating":"1","title":"Compositionally disappointing","review":"Language on the back cover of this CD states \\"Esther contains dramatically stirring music and features some of Handel's most exquisite solo writing and thrilling choruses.\\" It does not. It's hack work by Handel. The performers are good, but when I see names of this calibre I expect them to be associated with a more worthy project."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun movie","review":"If you enjoyed watching likeable wannabe crooks bumble around in movies like \\"Snatch\\" and \\"Lock, Stock, and two Smoking Barrels,\\" this movie belongs in the same bin. Not as good in my opinion, but still really funny.A bunch of entry-level criminals from France can't ever do anything right, so their boss sends them to Chicago for one last chance at a big job. This job goes worse than their previous work, and they find themselves at odds with the Chicago mafia (led by Harvey Keitel and Abe Vigoda) and a street gang.The plot is not as twisted and surprising as other movies, but it's original as far as I can tell. You might guess at what is going to happen if you are one of those types trying to figure it out, but at least you won't feel like you are watching something you have already seen, and you will laugh all the way. On the other hand, people like me will be thrilled all the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very, Very Funny","review":"All I can say about this movie is... it is SOOOO funny! I great crime caper flick. A real must see!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a Great movie. Funny from begging to end!","review":"I love this movie and it is truly one of the funny crime capers with excellent stars. I would actually add it to my favorites list and if you have not seen it please watch it. If you're not laughing in the first two minutes something is wrong.My reason for a bad rating has nothing to do with the movie but Midwest Pawn who sold it to me as \\"Like New\\" and it was and old Hollywood Movie rental with several bad scratches. When I told them about it they said I was wrong. This DVD could not be watched do to the damage and a less than reputable seller.

How dissapointing for a 7 year old to see an advertisement on tv showing what he thought would be an awesome, fun toy: only to be totally dissapointed!!!Needless to say, we returned both and opted for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible product","review":"If I could give it no stars, I would. I purchased this for my 5 year old daughter, and I was unable to make it blow more than one bubble.

It was only $10 and eventhough he still had $30 leftover, he didn't want anything else. He just wanted to go home and play with his new toy. This toy was a disappointment from trying to open the package to trying to get it to work. My son kept begging me to try and try again.

Not possible for a child to do! Its difficult enough for an adult since you have to pump it the right amount of times just to get one bubble and then have to dip it again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Read before you buy!","review":"Interesting idea, but must not have been tested by an average or above average child.

If you are lucky enough to get a bubble out of it, it is too heavy to float. The bubble goes straight down to the ground and usually pops as it is falling off the bubbler.

The Gazillion Bubblator is much better and easier to make bubbles -- large, floating bubbles!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible product....don't buy it","review":"This was purchased for my niece last week.

But we have to dip the gun-tip in bubbles soap, and the air produced by gun generates bubbles.It needs six batteries. I was thinking, batteries are used to generate smoke bubble, as such to generate bubble(without smoke), I don't see much batteries use. Better, if some mechanical thing could have produced enough air to generate bubbles. Air produced without batteries are very less.Even with batteries, rarely good bubbles are formed, and most of the time, few ones or none.Smoke produced by the gun, also give burning smell, not really good for kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blows Smoke but NO BUBBLES","review":"Like others, we saw this on TV and thought it was a neat idea.

I often did, that is, until I read \\"The Lady's Tutor\\" by Robin Schone. I have to say that this is the best romance novel I have read. Ms. Schone's characters are real people who have an extraordinary romance (just like we'd all like to have). These people really make you care about them and hope that at the end of the book they are together. The story was engrossing - it had action, suspense, and a lot of sexual tension between \\"the lady\\" and her \\"tutor\\". The love scenes were incredible and extremely erotic (I must admit that I learned a thing or two!). I think of this book as the intelligent woman's romance novel. What a great escape it was! I am anxiously awaiting the author's next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"I found this book to be wonderfully erotic without being \\"to much.\\" It was sensual and I was sorry when it ended.

All I wanted to do was curl up in bed and read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Degrading Titles","review":"I have been wanting to try one of Robin Schone's novels for awhile. I finally found \\"The Lady's Tutor\\" at my local bookstore. This book will be returned tomorrow. I must admit I did not read the story, or I should say \\"CANNOT\\" read the story. How a main character can be called \\"the Bastard Sheik\\" instead of his name throughout the book is appalling. Why not call the heroine \\"the English whore.\\" That one term was such a turn off that I could not read this book. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"world of hate","review":"The author writes of: Homicidal maniac male homosexuals and the mother/wife willing to kill all spawns who cross their path, Spanish Fly as a weapon that must be worked off, super charged sex hero Arab/Brit that turns heroine to tough steel able to overcome all in her path after working through arab sex text together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Midlife crisis leads to love","review":"I thought this was an entertaining read although there were drawbacks. I liked Elizabeth and her character was believable. She is a woman who is questioning her life, now that her sons are at school. She has an empty nest and on reflection she finds that her life has been lived to please her parents and her husband's political goals. She realizes she does not have a relationship with her spouse and seeks to capture her husband's interest. The book is about her personal growth. Ramiel's interest in Elizabeth is not as clear cut, but his character is believable and likable. The unraveling of the plot was disturbing and unexpected. A secret this big would have been discovered by others besides Ramiel so it was not believable, it was also not necessary for the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot type - this and LIP SERVICE are my new fav's","review":"Schone really knows how to write a wonderful story with terrifically erotic scenes. I adored this book and even read it in the bath. For fans, I'd also recommend Lip Service by MJ Rose... a little darker but just as steamy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Stimulating.......oooh..laala","review":"This is one HOT book! Needless to say I could not put it down. My husband would like me to read this kind of book all the time(giggle). He read a few pages and was even amazed at how turned on he was. The whole story line was wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"Once I started reading this book I could not put it down. This is the way to write a spicy romance! Everything about these two, was perfect. I might just read this book again next month :)I am on the hunt now--I have to read \\"Awaken, My Love\\". If this book is any indication of her talent, Awaken will be just as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Words can not begin to describe...","review":"I find it hard to begin...to put into words what it is about The Lady's Tutor that was so compelling. It goes beyond the fact that it contains some of the finest erotica written today. The story is compelling, intense, gritty...the characters finely drawn...the subjects Ms Schone touches upon are done with a careful hand, and a thoughtful mind. A story of learning to trust, of awakening sexuality, a romance in it's truest form. When I finished reading this book the first time, I set it down, at a loss for words. I knew I needed to read it again, to understand, to absorb it all. So I did, and after reading it the second time, amazingly enough, I still do not know the words to write to do it justice. I was, and am, quite literally stunned at the power Ms Schone wields with her pen. She has an amazing gift, and she shares it beautifully."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"After all the hype, I expected something different, something exciting, but all I read was an average, and in some places that simply grossed me out, below average romance novel. I certainly can't see why this would be labeled erotica. The only squirming I did was in the sense of ewwwwww, when he was showing her where her so-called pocket was. And is she trying to give everyone the impression all English polititions were gay pedophiles? Sorry. If the author wanted to shock the reader and leave an impression, she did. It was not a good one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great on eroticism, but not my cup of tea.","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed the underlying theme about an unloved and under-appreciated wife and mother of two wanting to explore her sexuality and improve her marital relationship with her husband. I enjoyed storyline and the characters of the book......until I discovered the homosexuality \\"events\\" in the story. This was not my cup of tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"REALLY DISAPPOINTED!!","review":"This is my first Robin Schone book and I must admit I wasen't impressed. I thought the story was very shallow and boring. The passionate love scenes were WOW!! but that is all that was good about this book. I will give Robin Schone a second chance and read \\"The Lover\\", I am hoping this book will be much better. I highly recommend you skip this book, its not worth the time or effort it takes just to get through it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time unless you enjoy explicit read","review":"At first, this book was an interesting read but later it became about explicit sex with graphic description and some pedophile activities. i like my romance novel(s) to have some intimacy but this book just crossed the line; nice story line though but after reading this book, i regretted buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would give this 0 stars if possible","review":"Probably one of the worst books I have ever begun. I never stop reading books mid-way, but just might consider setting this one aside. Can this book be categorised as a romance? Where is the romance? Its just sex. I'm not one of those prudes that gets offended by sex, but this had nothing else! Not going to waste any more time with this book or this author"},{"rating":"2","title":"Romatica at its best","review":"Schone is an excellent author in the Romantica genre. For those who don't know, Romantica is a bit more explicit than romance but not as hardcore as erotica. I just love Schone's books. She write some steamy scenes - whew. This was my first read by her and will always be my favorite as a result. Not your typical romance, thank goodness. The heroine is not perfectly formed, she is aged, and she is not particularly beautiful. The hero is a bastard, paternally speaking, and on the fringes of \\"society.\\" It was just so refreshing. Don't get me wrong, I love romance a great deal but after reading so much, it is nice to see an author who can make \\"real\\" people sexy and deserving of love despite their outer shell or wounded spirit. Thanks Ms. Schone and I have been waiting for your latest book with baited breath."},{"rating":"2","title":"HOT! HOT! HOT!","review":"This is one of the best romance novels I have ever read. But be warned, this is not for the faint of heart. I was blushing so much while reading this book. Even the man in your life will love this one. Go get it now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"!! WOW !!","review":"What a book. It is so hot it will burn you. A bit of caution, only atempt to read THE LADY'S TUTOR if you have a cold shower near by. With that said, I highly recomend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Can't-Put-It-Down Book","review":"This book had me forcing myself to stay awake so I could read 'just one more page,' and then just one more after that. It's been a long time since a book kept me up well after I should have been in bed, making me lament having to go to work the next morning.The Lady's Tutor is one icy-hot read. Set in Victorian England, Robin Schone aptly conveys the cold, starched atmosphere of the era, while tugging at our heart strings when we read of Elizabeth's loveless marriage and the darker, seamier side of life in England at this time.This is not a book for the gentle reader, but on the other hand, the love scenes, while erotic, are done tastefully and beautifully. I truly did not want this book to end. Kudos to Ms. Schone. It will be hard to top The Lady's Tutor, but I've no doubt she's up to the challenge and I look forward to her next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"EROTICA . . . ROMANCE . . . EROTICA . . . ROMANCE . . .","review":"WOW! I didn't think Ms. Schone could beat her first book . . . but she did! Just checked out her web site where she put up a chapter of her new book, THE LADY'S TUTOR, a Victorian erotic romance. In Awaken, My Love, her first book, the hero seduced the heroine with a Pillow Book (I will never forget that scene) <g> In THE LADY'S TUTOR, Ramiel, the bastard son of an English Countess and an Arab Sheik, teaches Elizabeth, a prim married lady, how to seduce her cold, unloving husband by giving her lessons from The Perfumed Garden, a 16th century Arabic sex manual!Having read one of those lessons, I can't wait to read the others! Especially when they \\"become a temptation neither can resist!\\" (I wouldn't have resisted the lesson Ms. Schone put up on her web site, had I been the heroine!)Thank you, Ms. Schone, for coming up with another truly creative and original plot. I can't wait to read THE LADY'S TUTOR in its entirety!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this Book sitting in Front of a Fan!","review":"This is the first book that I've read from Robin Schone, and I can hardly wait to get my hands on more of her books. I thoroughly enjoyed everything about this book. The story of a woman who needed love and affection and sought out what she felt she deserved. Ramiel, was fabulous, who wouldn't want someone like him to protect and love you. It had all the things that I enjoy about a book, love, sex, and an intriging story that is going on around them. A must read for historical romance buffs."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Lady's Tutor","review":"Not as good as i thought it would be... just too draw out.I did like the end. i will try more of her books."},{"rating":"1","title":"HOMOSEXUALITY and PHEDOPHILIA in romance novel?","review":"I know a lot of people loved this book. After all, erotic love scenes are the latest hype in romance novels. The hotter, the better, right? In The Lady's Tutor, there is only one erotic scene and that is towards the end of the book. It would have been a really great book if the author didn't include homosexuality and phedophilia in what is suppose to be a romance novel. In the Lady's Tutor, the hero was raped by another man. There is a scene portraying man on man sex. It was just too dark and perverted for me. Somehow, i get the feeling that the characters in this book are not meant to be happy forever. I also read captivated and in Schone's novella, The Lady's Pleasure(the hero is the tutor again!), homosexuality is mentioned again. I have nothing against homosexuality - I have a lot of gay friends, but i read romance novels as a means of escape. I think i best stick to my 3 favorite authors - Small, Johnson and Devine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overhyped and Overrated","review":"Is this book erotic and hot? Yes, in several places it is, while other parts are more silly than sexy. The characters could have been better developed. I was also majorly turned OFF by all the gay bashing and homophobia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Partial Story","review":"This review is for the $4.99 Kindle version. This version is the original magazine version, which is only half the expanded story published later in book form. If you want the full story, buy the $0.99 Kindle version. The description says nothing to indicate that is the shorter version."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a key episode in the development of Picard's character","review":"This episode is one of the best ever written in start trek. It explores not only the depth of Picards character but also the nature of family. When Picard first returns his bother is jealous and annoyed, and taunts him over what he sees as weakness, and Picard's initial defensive reaction only encourages this. When his brother eventually realizes how much pain he is in, probably when he finds Picard getting drunk, the dynamic changes very quickly although this change may not be obvious to the person watching. I like this episode because shows how families can pull together when necessary in 3 different story lines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for people starting from scratch","review":"I have to disagree with the first reviewer, though I can see where they're coming from. This DVD is specifically designed to take you from scratch. This is for the person who's new to working out or has certain exercises they can't do like pullups. It also serves as an alternate workout plan for fitness trainers or people who want to try a total bodyweight workout. If you're at a intermediate or advanced level of fitness, this may not be for you. Then again, there are professional builders and muscleheads who can't do some of the moves in this or the advanced DVD!! I've seen YouTube clips of guys with 230 lbs. of solid muscle, but can only go halfway on their pullups. This video is about training your body to maneuver your own weight, and getting you ready for the advanced DVD. This video could stand alone, but I recommend getting both. That way once you've done the instructional routine, you can shoot for a bigger challenge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for true beginners, if anyone","review":"This DVD was a waste of my money, and this is the first time i bought something that was completely useless to me. Dont be fooled by their fancy videos, there is nothing of the sort on this DVD. Just exercises that everyone knows already (pullup, pushups, squats, dips) and a little bit of common variations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not So Good...","review":"If you are looking for any kind of hearing protection from loud machines or even voices, do not get this band. The plugs do not go into your ears and you can pretty much hear everything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch","review":"Not for long term use such as an entire shift.

I use it outside to detect to detect intruders. The sensor is over sensitive sometimes going off when it is windy or when the sun goes in suddenly. The drawback is that the Alarm has to be plugged in less than 20 feet from the sensor for it to work reliably. This has not been a major problem for what I am using it for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unexpected problem","review":"I bought this motion sensor to work with a LED Rope Light. They say not to use it with CFLs and I know other Heath sensors work with halogen, so I thought it should work okay.Well, my unit sensed and detected motion all right, and even turned a test lamp on and off as advertised. Turning the alarm all the way down gets rid of the sound so you don't have to hear the buzz if you don't want.But plugging in the LED Rope light into the two prong outlet, half the lights within the rope stay on all the time, creating a \\"dimmed\\" light. When motion is detected, all the LEDs turn on brightly for the indicated period and then return to the half-on dim mode. I can't imagine what kind of output circuit on the contol unit would allow that rope light to stay partially on all the time, but since the unit never completely shuts off power toward the light circuit, it creates a potential hazard in my book.That's the only chance this unit gets with me... back it goes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Don't I Heed the Reviews?","review":"We were happy with the first Heath Zenith SL-6019-WH-A Wireless Motion Sensor. But it had to work only to 10 Ft. We ordered a second set for a different project. It would work only to 20 Ft. I read this same complaint in some of the reviews before I purchased the first one. Should have heeded the warning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk Quality that Only Works When They are Really Close","review":"The base only sets off the light if the motion sensor is within about 10 or 15 feet. Any further and it does not work. Also, even within a close range, it does not work if there are walls or other obstacles that do not provide a clear path of vision between the two units. I like the idea of this product, but the quality is just not there. Save your money and buy one of the more expensive units."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the point?","review":"Bought one of these and I thought it was inoperative then it worked for maybe 2 minutes, plug, unplug, sensitivity adjusted, nothing. Then discovered that it will only power a small light bulb despite being plugged into a standard receptacle even if it did work. Going back to the store for a cash refund, I won't be asking for another one. Have to find something different. I don't know how Amazon or the big box stores can sell this with a straight face. Nothing but frustration for a product doomed to be returned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk-in-a-Box","review":"Don't waste your time or money on anything within the \\"Zenith\\" Wireless Command product line. I purchased this unit to operate indoors to be used as a motion activated lighting system for use on my kitchen under-cabinet lights. The first day this product worked well. After the first 24 hours the receiver stopped working altogether. After unplugging and then plugging back in the lights started flickering when motion triggered the receiver to turn on. I swapped out receivers and they still flickered. I eventually boxed everything up to return back to Home Depot where I bought them. I purchased two similar systems by utilitech from Lowe's that were cheaper and came with a handy remote that works wonderfully and is a lot more versatile in setup and operation.

Great idea if it worked better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely does not work","review":"I bought this from Home Depot and have had trouble even getting it to sound its alarm for any kind of motion.

Save your money and buy a real security device."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as advertised, not useable, not dependable, WASTE of MONEY","review":"It is a surprise to see a name brand item perform so poorly. There is no secret fix. It is simply BOGUS. After 40 years as an electrician in several industries and an afternoon of disbelief the conclusion is this should be taken off the shelf. The other reviews tell the story. No stars because even one star suggests it is possible to make it work with great effort or repair. Two sets only worked for a couple of cycles then had to be reset by removing batteries and wall power."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as Advertised.","review":"Length:: 0:59 MinsSo far so good, The video tells it all. I'm planning to buy a second one to install in my lanai.Even after all the negative reviews I decided to buy it and I'm very pleased. It is reliable and works just fine for me.

This one is my first review and I will update it if something goes wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally unreliable","review":"I bought two of these sensors at Home Depot. They cannot be relied on to sound an alarm, and even when they do, it is barely audible.It is discouraging that a company that was a leader in its field can produce junk like this, and, apparently, be unresponsive to customer feedback. The user reviews for this product go back more than two years. If Heath Zenith is not listening, Amazon should at least take notice and pull this item out of its offerings.More and more, it is caveat emptor. Neither manufacturers nor distributors seem to have the customer's best interests in mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor wireless range","review":"The first unit I bought did not work. I returned it for another one. The second unit worked, but the range for wireless was less than 10FT. Again, I returned the second unit for another one. The third unit had the same wireless range (under 10FT). I would not recommend this at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"For my use this sensor works great.","review":"I used this plug and sensor in my kitchen. I installed puck lighting under the cabinets and then use the plug and sensor. lights automatically come on as i enter the kitchen. I didn't give it a full 5 stars cause I technically didn't use the item as intended. I just turned down the volume on the alarm so it doesn't go off. So there are more uses for the product than just security. The sensor and the plug are only feet away from each other. Maybe this is the reason for it working so great for me. Im purchasing another for my garage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconsistent Operation","review":"I bought this unit and it was so inconsistent, I bought another, thinking as another reviewer, that I must have purchased a defective one.

How could any highly - paid studio executive OK this - the cast and script rank among the worst I have every seen. Prinze was wrong for the lead (Rushmore lead would have done much better), while Biggs was sleepwalking through the picture. This could have been a very good teen pic - but the script needed work. The end result is a painful waste of our time and money - and the studios money. Avoid - at all cost. Instead(same genre): Ten Things I Hate About You, Rushmore, or any John Hughes 80s teen pic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Stinks","review":"This movie was terrible. Basically Freddie Prince and Claire Forlani have a habit of running into each other before they eventually become friends and then, of coarse, more than friends. Nothing in this film was original. Prince and Forlani don't like each other at first, they have strange best friends, and a final sequence in the airport where one of them is leaving. The only redeaming parts of this film are Forlani's beauty and some decent comic relief provided by Jason Biggs, who plays Prince's roommate and only friend. In fact the funniest part of this movie happens during the final credit sequence in which Biggs has a dream with Victoria Secret models that want him to fart.

Gladiator, right around 3 hours, flew by. i guess when a film is painfully bad, it will show. This film has a brilliant director. Who else would think of putting together 2 of the worst actors of the last few years: Freddie Prinze Jr. and the wonderfully obnoxious Jason Biggs. Freddie goes off to college as a dork, the turns into a teen heart throb, ah, how film mirrors reality.... This film turns from bad to worse when they stop everything logical to have a big dance scene, just like what happened everyday in highschool. This film is for those people that think that they like movies, but are really unsure of what is good.

This only cost $15m, so why not take some risks? I'm sure a teen audience could handle a decent remake of \\"When Harry Met Sally\\" pitched squarely at their demographic. But as much as it tries to be, this film isn't it. The acting's fine, the direction's passable, but the writing is fatally hesitant. It's neither funny enough nor romantic enough to really get your attention, and simply stalls in Act 1.

It tries all too hard to reach the levels of films mentioned in the film (SIXTEEN CANDLES and THE BREAKFAST CLUB) and the movie that it ripped off, WHEN HARRY MET SALLY, that it hurts to watch. Hurts to watch because it's attempts are so painfully obvious and by-the-numbers, and its failure so bad. Sure, Claire Forlani and Freddie Prinze Jr. have charm to spare between the two of them. But without material to support them, the two lead actors simply do not have the stuff to make this turkey fly. Smartly, the producers tapped Jason Biggs to help out, and he (singlehandedly) almost pulls it off. But ultimately, is it worth your time/money? No."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very good movie","review":"Robert Iscove's teenage-version of \\"When Harry Met Sally\\" really isn't very good. Actually, it's rather bad. There are, however, some laughs in this romantic comedy, but all in all, the movie's trying too hard to be funny and smart (it's neither smart nor funny). Another weakness are the actors...all of them have performed way better than in \\"Boys and Girls\\". Claire Forlani is too loud, Freddie Prinze Jr. is just boring and Jason Biggs is far away from being funny in that one.It's not disastrous, but not really worth watching unless you are into brainless teen-movies.

The first half blew (trying way too hard to be funny... I didn't smile once..).And the actors...

That's why this movie got two stars instead of the one I was going to give it after the watching the first half.I read somewhere that this movie is supposed to be a \\"teen\\" \\"When Harry met Sally\\"?

Also, the organization leaves something to be desired. The author likes to skip around chronologically in favor of grouping by social, political, and economic topics. This works well in the case of the chapter on Progressivism, but fails elsewhere.Written by only one author - most history textbooks have multiple authors - this books has the feel of getting only one viewpoint. Foner isn't even an expert in this time period; he writes about the Civil War and Reconstruction. There are much, much better US history textbooks out there. I would recommend American Pageant for this level (advanced high school, college survey)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Received a wrong item instead of Give me Liberty!","review":"I received a \\"Voice of Freedom\\" instead of \\"Give me Liberty\\" , and I need to use the book for an exam next week.

It's full of bias against the modern Republican Party and conservatism. Foner wants you to believe that the modern Republican Party stands for bigotry and pro-Wall Street fat cats. Haha...and in 2008, Obama received more campaign donations from Wall Street than any president in history. Foner states that Reagan and George H.W. Bush left Clinton with \\"massive\\" budget deficits. Although they did leave Clinton with deficits, they definitely were not massive. They only reason why there was no surplus during the Reagan and Bush years was because the Democrats, who held the majority in the House during ALL of the Reagan and Bush years, refused to cut spending. Of course liberal Eric Foner and his authors didn't mention that. Most history books today are promoting progressivism and anti-American traditionalism, and \\"Give Me Liberty!\\" does exactly that."},{"rating":"2","title":"the most helpful tape","review":"The best self healing affirmation audo tape I have ever listen to.

I have by no means a strong vocabulary, but I struggled very hard to find a single word in the book I did not know.

The reason that I don't give 5 stars is that I don't think it is good way she always keep using CSS in her example when she talks about XSLT stylesheet. It really makes me confused. Why don't we just use one style rather than two stlye at the same time?

Blacks and whites in Eatonton get along very well and have for many years. There are numerous black elected officials there at both the city and county levels.

The people of Eatonton are much more concerned about WHY the book was written than about how the book was written. This book is touted by the author as being a true story, so the author's motives are going to be suspect. But the style, language choices, and poor plot lines are what makes this particular pile stink."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Disaster","review":"What a disaster! Bad from the standpoint of writing style & technique. Worse from the standpoint of plot, content. Worst from the standpoint of ... everything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst I've Seen","review":"I feel embarrassed this author claims to be a Southerner. I don't understand why anyone would chose to write a book like this. It's so strange. Worse yet, so poorly written. Whatever the truth of this author's story, he should have chosen a writer to tell it."},{"rating":"1","title":"PAINFULLY BAD","review":"You've just bought \\"that book\\", you finally get home, turn off the phone, settle in front of the fireplace and dig into...oooh, that hurts! Ouch! Painfully bad book. Badly written, badly edited. Everything about it is hurting."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ego That Ate Eatonton","review":"After the two readings it took for me to figure out the probable point of this book, I finally determined this is the author's attempt to finally get to be the \\"big man in town\\" he has never been in life. He portrays everyone else in Eatonton as either stupid, incompetent or completely morally bankrupt. The only person, other than himself, admired by \\"Frank Moss\\" apparently was his foul-talking preacher. Everyone desperately needed this hero to save them - from themselves, I guess. What I can't figure out is whether this author really thinks that much of himself or whether he is so ego-starved that he needs this fix. Sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"EVIL?","review":"I have read this book twice and I still do not understand it. Its so totally bizarre. I noticed one of the other reviewers believes this is a true story and is glad all the \\"evil\\" in Eatonton is coming out. I guess the reviewer from Madison would know more about evil than I. But one has to wonder why on earth the writer of this book chose to write it. If really true, use real names. If not really true, write about a fictional place & people. Mixing the two is a bad idea. Finally, the book is written by someone who claims to be a story teller and may be good at that, but he is no writer."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought this book was wonderful!!!!!","review":"This book includes some of the best tidbits from the classic TV show.

It is amazing to know how perfectly planned out this show is paved out for children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am in my late 20s so I was watching sesame street in the late 70s and early 80s.I expected a nostalgia trip and was satisifed in many respects.You wonder about Borgenicht's audience for the books as the book seems to be directed at adults, yet they have a lot about Elmo, Zoe, and things that happened on the show during the 90s. Those things I have no interest in and I would have rather they spend the extra pages on a more detailed history of Cookie Monster, Count, Ernie, etc.Overall the book seemed to try to be all things to all people and satisifed none completely."},{"rating":"1","title":"not as good as it should be","review":"i did like the book but it could of been better. for one they only mentioned why a couple of muppets were discontinued. but they didn't mention why herbert birdsfoot if that's how you pronounce his name or others were banished. and i also wondered how buffy st. marie was written into the series. in other words was she a friend of one of the cast, did she live on sesame st. i never really found out how she got on the show. i'd would of also liked to have seen certain dates on when a certain puppet or film segment was made, how certain films were made and maybe the people who made the film including those who stsrred in them could tell how they were done or they could share any special interesting information about the films. i'd would of also like to know what ever happened to northern calloway. maybe mr. borgenicht could write a follow to this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"One book. Hahahahahahahahaha.","review":"A fantastic overview of the Sesame Street continuum, this heavily-illustrated tome has songs, behind-the-scenes information, a giant picture of Count Von Count laughing maniacally (worth the price of entry along), and lots of neat information with which to dazzle your friends (apparently Oscar the Grouch was originally brown).The only drawback is a confusion of purpose - it's not sure whether it's a guide for kids or grown-ups, and the information is therefore fairly light (there's no episode guide, for example, and Buffy Saint-Marie is never mentioned fully by name). Still, it's a great thing to have around, and you can dip into it every so often for a new fact.Best of all, it'll make you want to watch the show again, if you aren't already - it's one of the finest things on television anywhere, and anything that encourages people to watch it is a Good Thing in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Your favorite memories of Sesame Street all in one book!","review":"I can believe how much this book captured the wonder of Sesame Street so completely and wonderfully. While I'm not 30, only 19, the book was still a memorial item to read. I remembered everything except for Big Bird and Oscar's transformations and Mr. Hooper's or should I say Looper's death simply because I wasn't born yet or too young. I even still watch the show occasional because I love the muppets so much and the book helped to bring all my favorite childhood memories back. Ernie and the clay statue of Bert was one of my favs. And all the little stories and cute facts about the muppets and human cast made the book the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"My childhood has just passed before my eyes","review":"I laughed, I cried, I remembered Ernie using Bert's cowboy hat as a fish bowl! This book is a scream. If you love Sesame Street and it means as much to you as it does to me, you need this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"How can you not love Sesame Street?","review":"I, being a fan since birth, loved this book. I remember a lot of the events they talked about in the book, the death of Mr. Hopper, Snuffy \\"coming out\\" to the adults of Sesame Street, and the wedding of Maria and Louis, and it was nice to have a nostalgic look back at the best childrens' show out there. It was also neat to look at the old pictures from the first few seasons and read about little known trivia. I would recommend this to anyone who is still a four-year-old in \\"feetie\\" pajamas deep, deep down inside."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than helpful","review":"I'm terribly disappointed with Play Violin. The CD recordings are fine but the book itself is badly structured with insufficient explanations and the pieces of music seem to follow no logical scale. I go to lessons so don't rely on the book for instruction, but still it's less than helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Presentation not Lesson","review":"If this book was a simple presentation on playing the violin to a class for example, I would give it 5 stars. However, the author pretends to teach beginners how to play the violin. There is no illustration or mention of the placement of fingers on the fingerboard. The book jumps from playing flat notes (G, D, A, E) to more complex notes (C, F#) without any linking illustration/explanation.The only reason I do not hate it: The CD. It contains music samples which can be useful if you have a musical ear or simply want to compare your playing against a more developed skill."},{"rating":"2","title":"There's something about this...that delights!","review":"I admit it. Although I ordinarily review scifi, I also read alot of mystery and romance, particularly romantic mysteries. Jane Ashford is not Jane Austen but this regency romance is a charmer that I have reread a number of times! I loved all the characters, particularly the hero's brothers, who are desperately in need of romantic assistance. The youthful urges and emotions of the principals underminine their best resolves to keep their relationship on a professional level and they are only fooling themselves. The heroine's backstory and the real basis for the mystery are tragic but this provides a weight to the novel that is needed: \\"The Bargain\\" might float away without it. All in all, one of my favorite romances...Ashford's other novels don't compare although \\"Charmed and Dangerous\\" comes close."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great premise but disappointing","review":"THE BARGAIN starts out great, it's funny, sexy and has an intriguing premise. Because he has a serious scientific mind, the hero's services have been requested to find the culprits behind a very annoying ghost. Ariel is also determined to unmask the ghost because it has been rumored it may be her recently deceased Mom's spirit and she wants to find out the truth behind her Mom's death. It's not long before these two bump into each other, get locked in a cupboard together, experience all kinds of new tingly feelings and decide that two heads are better than one and join together to complete their investigation. Even though THE BARGAIN did have it's humorous moments, and the heroine was very likable, the plot moved too slow and it was not an emotional read for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Retelling Of The Legend","review":"This is a review for I SHOT JESSE JAMES (1949) directed by Sam Fuller. Bob Ford, played by John Ireland, truly admires America's longtime king outlaw but at the same time wouldn't mind the pardon and notorierity that went along with Jesse's demise. Giving in to temptation, Robert Ford backshoots Jesse in his own home.This picture does a pretty decent job portraying and imagining the life of Bob Ford after the killing. Supposedly I SHOT JESSE JAMES is the first western that has other young gunslingers coming after the new man with the big reputation, soon to be a western cliche.Not the greatest nor the definitive version of this story but fairly well done, in many ways, and one of the early efforts of an American original, Samuel Fuller.Four Stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its fine","review":"Well I Probably wont buy this product again.

If it does come in handy, I will eat my words."},{"rating":"2","title":"More please.","review":"The idea of a psychic and seeing through the eyes of a murderer has been done before, and the main murder mystery plot which Saint Claire was attempting to solve was predictable. The clues were often way too obvious, and therefore, Saint Claire seemed less than brilliant for not figuring things out a little more quickly. The author does need to work on plot subtlety and character development. However, there were enough twists thrown in and questions raised, especially towards the end of the book, to keep me intrigued. In fact,I am here at Amazon looking to see if the next book is available yet (which it is - its called Blind Rage.) The author leaves the reader with some cliff-hangers and the desire to solve the mysteries surrounding some of the key characters. For fans of psychic and crime mysteries, this is a decent book that has the potential to become a really great series."},{"rating":"1","title":"How she made it thru Quantico...","review":"I'll never know. There are some aspects of this book I really like. And I hope that the author fleshes out her protagonists with the next in this series. I like Agent Bernadette and I really like most of the story behind her gift. But she doesn't seem to have a single, solitary investigative skill. She's an FBI Agent who doesn't seem to know or care about police procedure. Search warrant? We don't need no stinkin' search warrant! I found myself aggravated with her on more than one occasion. There's a glaring lack background and technical information and though the concept is fairly original, the subjects lack... ummph. I didn't feel them or feel for them. The only character I found truly interesting was Auggie, and I knew his angle before she did..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe getting there?","review":"The writing is very uneven. Vast stretches are just plain dumb, yet there are moments that are fresh and sometimes genuinely funny. Christian religion is central throughout the story, so you might skip this one if that's bothersome for you. On balance, I liked this one enough to be willing to look at more from this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turn a blind eye to this book","review":"This extremely derivative book has only one new twist that I could see, and that isn't enough to justify the price of the book. The protagonist is neither emotionally nor physically attractive, and how the author expects us to believe that she is a trained FBI agent strains the imagination. There is one intriguing character - a ghost - and I'd prefer to read a book about him! Ostensibly a mystery, this novel has no secrets, and the reader knows a lot more than the psychic all through the story. However, I understand that this is the author's first book. I'd be willing to try her next - but only by borrowing it from a library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"I really enjoyed this book, I like to read books in one setting and this book kept my interest.

I called the company and they mailed me a replacement, but that unit had exactly the same problem. The scale ostensibly offers the ability to weigh in ounces and grams; however, the problem I had was that the electronic display showed the letters \\"Cal\\" and no amount of button-pushing, turning off-and-on, replacing batteries made any difference.

We used our machine 1-2x each business day for 20 seconds each time and made certain to turn it off immediately after each use. Still used a 9v every 2 months. Even if your 9v is rechargeable you will wear it out very quickly as rechargeables are only good for a certain number of charges. In addition, battery installation is very tight and awkward. Don't waste your money on this machine. Instead get one with a plug; better yet one that does both (plug and/or battery)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great and cheap","review":"I use this scale to weigh packages for electronically printed shipping labels.

Check out that too.The disc also includes the soundtrack of Histoire d'O 2. Pretend it's not there. Ignore it. It's so conventional pop with the worst clich��s from the 80's. Cheesy and classless. The 5-star rank I gave counts only for the first movie soundtrack.It's a guilty pleasure at its best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterful storytelling","review":"I just finished The Elephant Queen last night. Wow. Paul Soderberg has created some memorable characters, woven an unpredictable,captivating story line, and written some beautiful stuff. I actually read a few passages here and there outloud to my wife,just because of the lovely flow and imagery of the writing. Paul Soderberg is not only a good writer, but a good story teller, and anentertainer. Many a time I was caught off guard with where he took his tale, and he balanced the times of tensionand resolution masterfully, while sustaining the driving tension in the story. I also loved the wealth of educated references to allsorts of cultural, geographic, and scientific events, from plants to Thai customs and language.The Elephant Queen was anexperience for me! Thanks for that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good read, but very common sense.","review":"This book was informative and full of fun anecdotes, but I didn't find it very useful.

For some reason, common-sense tips are things we need to be reminded of. Like always registering at a hotel under your last name and initial, thus avoiding advertising the fact you are a woman. Like taking the hotel card when you register, so that if you get lost you can get someone to help you find it. Like covering guidebooks with covers made out of local newspapers, making it less obvious you are just passing through.This book is a veritable gold mine of valuable advice, the sort that you could write on a 3 by 5 and keep with you when traveling. The best recommendation I can make is that my copy is bristling with stickies.

Having done a dissection course in anatomy, I could not and did not perform as expert a dissection as this video series does. You see cross sectional anatomy that is seldom presented in a formal anatomy lab. Your three dimensional understanding of anatomy will take shape as you watch! Bob Acland, in his soothing British accent, narrates the video and makes you feel as if you're sitting in your living room, in front of the fireplace, sipping a cup of Darjeeling tea! Dr. Acland made it a priority in his life to produce an educational tool for students of anatomy that was affordable on a student's budget. The entire series can be had for far less than most single textbooks!The series is a pleasure to watch, and there is plenty to refresh the memory of one who has used anatomy daily for over 30 years, as I have. Congratulations, Bob, on a job well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Reference","review":"This is a very specialized book with a very specialized core audience and this text does what it says it does -- teach you how to write Excel Macros using VBA. Nothing too exciting here folks, very dry reading that is a necessary reference if you need to have more control over Excel than the everyday user does.I remember long ago when I needed to work on building some installers and I had never worked with Installshield before. There was one book on the market that was helpful in completing this task, and there is a very close correlation here as well. There simply is not enough of a market to provide a wide variety of different books to choose from when needing to learn how to write Excel macros.

I have years of programming experience, some VB, and was looking for something to get me started programming Excel VBA. This book is not suitable as a primary reference. Much better are either Power Programming (Walkenbach) or Excel VBA (Bovey) which contain many useful tips and gotchas that helped me out of a few baffling situations. Roman's book seemed to focus on the few examples he developed, rather than be a resource for problems a beginning/intermediate Excel programmer was likely to encounter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not helpful for an intermediate programmer","review":"When purchasing this book, I already had in mind the macros that I wanted to program and the logic I was going to use in order to accomplish the task. All I was really looking for was a breakdown of the syntax in VBA (I'm new to the language), and a list of commands that were available. Trying to extract this information from the book was tedious at best. It would have also been useful if there was an example or two of how some of the basic syntax works. I can only really use it as a second reference from the help menus already provided in excell and the online microsoft tutorial... suggest checking out that link and thumbing through the book at a store before buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Title of the Book has Been Mistaken","review":"When I bought the book, I was impressed by its title and TOC since they give the promise of leading the reader into macro programming. However, it is rather a large-volume Excel/VBA reference, not a book on how to write macros.Unfortunately, there is no system of introducing the reader gradually into the language (as in all usual programming textbooks) by introducing concepts, giving examples and requesting particular exercises.On a positive note, the book contains (all) VBA concepts relevant to Excel macros and can very well serve as a future reference once the reader has bought another book to learn how to code within some range of macro programming."},{"rating":"1","title":"reference... sort of","review":"I have to say I'm very disappointed with the book. I usually expect great things from Oreilly books and this one fell short. It's an ok reference, but it's not big enough to be a complete reference. It tries to cover a lot of ground and ends up not doing each topic justice.

Time and time again I open it up for help, and I never find any answer.Actually, last time I looked up a particular topic, it essentially said \\"You can do it this way, but there are better ways of doing it\\", and gave no further information. That's what I call useless information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid reference.","review":"The author states that he doesn't mince words or beat around the bush with certain concepts, and he proves to be a man of his word. This is probably more appropriate for macro writers with a little experience. If you're new to programming, you're probably better off in the world of Mr. Walkenbach, who understands that people are either new to programming or under a time cruch, and that sometimes a few explicit examples or extra explanation is appropriate.

I work with high-risk youth and the family dynamics are always so complex. I also like the fact that it addresses changes that the adolescent will have to make and doesn't \\"sugar coat\\" things.

I just couldn't get hot for him as a sexy guy.The girl, Mirabelle, goes out with a \\"looser\\" who was excellently cast, and I kept saying \\"WHY??\\"There were funny moments. Some touching moments. Some weird moments. For an old rich guy to buy a girl gifts, I would be a little creeped out.

I started doing some light reading halfway through this, and I didn't miss a beat. How anyone could find any sort of emotional or mental fulfillment in this movie is beyond me.

Clair Danes was ok. But her character has no self respect, personality or any significance to the story other than being the girl in a love triangle. An extremely long, boring movie about a love triangle with people who have no rapport whatsoever, and express no real attraction and have no reason to be together. It was like a modern day version of Jane Austen's Emma, but without that tedious interesting dialogue, and not a single redeemable character.

They are a couple for a while, and then when Mirabelle is working one day, a gentleman named Ray Porter (Steve Martin) asks her out to dinner. Knowing she was still involved with Jeremy, Mirabelle accepts (lucky for her he isn't a murderer). The thing is, Ray is married, and he's just using Mirabelle for sex.

She owns the screen and even though her character isn't always admirable, Danes instills her with enough depth to make her sympathetic and believable. Too bad the rest of the movie doesn't match her performance. SHOPGIRL seems to be a real vanity project for its writer and actor Steve Martin. Based on his novella, the story is so sanitized and predictable, and never makes a commitment to being either a comedy or a dramedy. Martin is enjoyable when he's funny, but trying to play a straight role he seems mercilessly miscast. Add a whiny, often obnoxious Jason Schwartzman and you get the ingredients for this soupy tale.

She meets a loser, who goes on a road trip with a band, leaving her to meet Steve Martin's character at her crappy job, and they have a pointless quasi-romance.

You basically hammer in the seat cushion to the chair with tiny nails and then that's it. There is no support underneath besides the frame of the chair. I am afraid that one of these days we are going to sink through! The bottom of the seat is very flimsy, too, so you can't really trust it; it's super light with what feels like cardboard with some padding on top of it.

Liddy (as he relates in the introduction of a recent edition of his autobiography WILL) told Dean to sue. Dean sued. And that was just what Liddy wanted. Because in a courtroom, Liddy could force Dean to admit that BLIND AMBITION was filled with lies and falsehoods. Dean did admit it, but blamed the lies in BLIND AMBITION on his ghost writer!

This is a venture into the world of the fast buck and certainly is not a concern of mine. I prefer Gordon Liddy's version of events and in truth Liddy has been proven right based on recent facts. John Dean has been proven to defend a lying President cited for Contempt for lying under oath by a Federal Judge as he did Clinton.

Now's the time! You may not be able to get the deluxe packaging, but the figure is still the same.Gandalf's robes are actually a dingy yellow when held up to the Return of the King edition, so I'd recommend that one over this.But a little info on this one. His hair has a little too much grey in it, and his robes are all plastic. He carries his ornate staff in one hand (complete with a sort-of dorky staff-raising action accomplished by the button beneath his cloak on his back), and Glamdring in the other hand, or in its sheath. It stands pretty well on its own, as long as the joints of the legs don't become too loose, like mine did. The cloak often holds it up best!Again...check out the REAL white Gandalf before settling for dingy yellow.

Do not buy this and, if you must use this bc your boss gives it to you, buy a Pearlcorder or even a Panasonic, pay for it yourself if your boss won't, because it will save you hours and hours of frustration.

I needed another machine, so I bought the Sony M-2000...not a great product for the money. Even if you have the volume turned all the way up to 10 (highest), you can't hear the person very well and there's a muffled quality, even with the tone on high.

Even with the volume turned to 10, I still have difficulty hearing. Just the noise from my keyboard alone when I'm typing makes it even more difficult to hear.

The Volume is a definite problem. Even with the volume turned all the way up, voices are muffled and very hard to hear. Also, when the foot pedal is activated, there is a loud clicking noise that sometimes overrides what one is trying to transcribe. I have tried numerous headsets in an attempt to get better sound quality and, so far, the best is the headset that came with my Sony Walkman (Model SRF-M86V). However, the sound volume and quality are not perfected with this headset -- but much better than with the headsets I have used that are designed to be used with transcribers.

I'm a software/network engineer so hopefully you can just take my word for it and the other 1 star reviews. This product is very seductive because it combines VoIP, Wireless and Ethernet Router all in one box but you're better off getting the best in class of each product.

The functionality left a lot to be desired.I have used Vonage since 2005 and have been more than happy with them. The service is great and the price is right. This Linksys router would occassionally go out or drop all of the wireless connections when I received a phone call. This was a pain because I have to use a VPN system for my work laptop.I went a different route now and it seems to be more robust.

I called Vonage and they said the warranty of the router has expired and I'll have to pay another $50 just to get another router/phone adaptor, or I can bid and get one off eBay.

They don't have a contract but they charge you $40 to cancel service. Now that's a mental torture.Then they have a distinct entity to cancel services which remains only open for few hours on working days and they promise a credit which does never get reflected on your statement. Then when you call back they say they don't have notes it. Where's the value of the word they give.The customer service has sweet sound but they will waste your time by making things complicated, till the point you say why the hell did you get into this one.

I called the account dept several times but nobody would pick up the phone. I waited a total of 7 hours trying to get hold of somebody who would take my call. The only live person I could get to were from technical support who were of no use. On top of all this I was told that there is cancellation fee of $40.

They take forever to transfer your current number(I waited 4 months and it never transfered)while you still have to keep your current phone service. If you cancel in less than a year they charge you 40 dollars. Vonage is not customer friendly. It's hard to get a hold of their customer service group. Their corporate phone system is unreliable.

Vonage would tell us that they never received the cancellation calls and that we were still using the service(which was disconnected from our computer) They lie through their teeth and we still haven't resolved the issue.

If you have a router that is working just go with the phone adapter. I would hate to total up all the time lost trying to get this to work (and I am IT savy).

The unit will work great for a year and then all of a sudden something will die, never to work again. This time around all four of the ethernet ports died. Last time both phone ports died. I never even used port 2. When I called Vonage about it the tech tried to switch me from port 1 to port 2 so I could continue to use the router only to find it dead.This time around I've bought the D-Link.

A couple of weeks ago my phone conversations started getting very staticy. After testing everything else, Vonage advised I replace the adaptor. What a headache.

But where can I get a replacement for $40?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Hope This Router Burns Forever","review":"If you want a crappy product here ya go, this is the definition of it!The phone service was laughable (such as when someone called when you were talking to someone else it would disconnect you. Sometimes you would sound like Barry White but only like 1% of the time. I personally found this funny when calling my friends.) The Wireless is horrendous if you want to anything else than E-mail or IM. Yet the wired speed wasn't bad, but neither is my modem... If you have to buy this router buy it for looks even though it's kinda ugly.If your looking for a fast wireless hookup with great phone i'd reccomend the DIR-625 Router and the VTA-VR phone adapter. This combo gives you crystal clear phone calls and amazing wireless gaming capability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned it.","review":"Bought this \\"Linksys\\" wireless router with Vonage VOIP phone connections.

I mentioned to them that it claims to be a \\"Linksys\\" box, they distanced themselves and told me to call Vonage. I told them I am not a Vonage customer, thus Vonage will not upgrade my ROM software. At that point, there was no one taking ownership for this box. I returned it for a full-refund.

There are examples of 'great architecture', complete with content hierarchy diagrams, that were obviously poorly thought out, if thought about at all. Common problems like separating support and marketing information, or placing/labeling company wide information have no formal identification or treatment.Essentially this is a tour of 'sexy' sites made in 1998 - which wasn't really that much of a break through year for usability or architecture.

The contributions give short shrift to the Arrow, the deepest of the paradoxes, and to the extent that the Arrow is discussed, the contributors miss the point entirely. (The point being that the derivative, which embodies instantaneous motion, depends classically for its definition on behavior at neighboring times.)

The filming quality was poor, the set was unimpressive, the instructor did not seem entirely comfortable in front of the camara. There was little if any introduction--nothing was explained, movements were in quick succession and repetitive. The video seems liked something that could be put together at home. I also had thought that the video would involve partner yoga, but it wasn't, and didn't seem to have much to do with better sex, except for her mentioning the sexual core a lot.

I wish I had looked more closely before purchasing the book. I was hoping for a book that would really express to young couples how God truly desires them to use their money. This book does cover some important aspects of money management. However, the most important aspect of Christian financial management is absent. God's word clearly teaches that every Christian should give a tithe of their income to the church. This book does not focus on the importance of the tithe in a Christian marriage. The author refers to charitable giving in a few places - he even uses the word tithe a few times. However, he does not explain what the tithe is, nor does he look at passages of Scripture that teach the tithe. I will return this book because it is inadequate for teaching how God truly desires for a couple to honor Him with their money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Taboo or not Taboo","review":"After reading and sometimes rereading Ms. Rashkow's arguments on the Hebrew Bible and sexuality within the family, I can not help but come to the conclusion that I was only reading her oppinion.

And the sex scenes are well done as far as I can tell, as I am not a gay male. There is an awful lot of violence and blood. Even for a vampire story, it seems a bit too much. I did finish the book and found it readable. I don't intend to read any more. The main character is not admirable. One can get in a snit over being rejected, then go on with more positive actions. To make vengeance the theme of ones existence is absurd and to prolong life to make vengeance a grand statement over thousands of years is beyond absurd.

Not only was the main character unlikeable (rather an oxymoron for a vampire, but some authors give them redeeming characteristics), there was so much sociopathic violence it was offensive. I don't doubt that vampires are meant to be without conscience, but for me to enjoy a book, I have to be able to relate to someone in the book, and this one just didn't work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sinful Pleasure","review":"This book is highly addictive and very well written. It sucks you in and will not let you go, not until you are done reading it. It captures the raw savagery that is Victor Decimus, and makes you yearn for what he desperately wants. You feel the sheer anger and love that radiates through him for his young \\"Joshu\\" and then you feel his intrigue for the young Brother Michael, the thrill of wanting someone so independent and righteous.I recommend this book for all people who enjoy raw and savage vampires, who enjoy the feeling of lusting after the forbidden fruit, and who seek the love of another."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lust, Valour, Passion Make a Crossover Vampire Hit","review":"In his premier novel, Vampire Vow, Michael Schiefelbein has employed the conventions of gothic fiction with wit, passion, and intelligence, a combination that will render his book a crossover success because these qualities will appeal to a wide range of readers, including those (like me) who would not normally read vampire novels. Vampire fans will relish the renate lore; gay readers, the homoeroticism; scholars, the clever exploration of philosophical and theological themes. The sly Dr. Schiefelbein has produced (without being explicit about it) a debate between Christ and Nietzche's Anti-Christ, in the role of the novel's protagonist and uebermensch, Victor Decimus. Leaving the crypt door open for a sequel, the novel delivers tight plotting, vivid characterization, and demonic romanticism. --Thomas L.

Jesus is tempted by this raging Roman soldier who stalks him? And this Jesus likes to shed his clothing and dance about the hills?

Period. But as to this specific book... this is actually the fifth book about the Chanur clan. Reading the series in sequence would be my recommendation (The Pride of Chanur, Chanur's Venture, The Kif Strike Back, Chanur's Homecoming), but it's really not necessary to do so to enjoy Chanur's Legacy. CJ Cherryh is a master at creating an alien universe and alien mindsets. One of the best things about this book (and the series in general) is that there are multiple races of beings, all fully developed in the reader's mind, and humans are not the central players. Cherryh's descriptive style, fast pace, and exploration of contrasting mindsets make this an intriguing read. You'll find it hard to put down, and if you have to, you can't wait to get back to it to find out what's going to happen next! Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Liked the action, hated the ethics","review":"I was pleased to see Hilfy in charge of her own starship; I was not pleased to see her forced out of her relationship with Tully, or her cruelty to the young male hani taken on board Legacy.

A new set of characters in the same universe, this book contains enough old and new stuff to be an enjoyable continuation. Perhaps the most interesting innovation is Hallan Meras fulfilling the part of juniormost addition to the crew instead of Hilfy, with Hilfy now being the captain.

The discs that come with the player sound like something that was made with a very cheap keyboard by a five year old and the player WILL NOT PLAY OTHER KARAOKE DISCS (we have tried over 40 other karaoke discs, it will play the video, but not the audio and you cannot get to a song selection screen on any disc other than that supplied by the manufacturer). About the only thing this player has going for it is that is looks nice, if you want a nice big paperweight go ahead and buy it, because that is about all you will be able to do with it.

Instead it feels like you're either going to run the crank lever into the hand holding the body of the flashlight OR your going to drop it.(2) The crank itself is hard to turn.(3) The light it emits pales in comparison to other led crank-style flashlights.

The plastic is cheap feeling. The cranking is noisy. The light is okay for a few minutes, but dims quickly, even after a minute of vigorous cranking. It provides no where near the claimed thirty minutes of light, unless a small trickle counts.Perhaps this is the best a three LED, hand-cranked light for around ten bucks can do with current technology.

If you have a large number of songs on the iPod (everyone does!) then selecting a song or playlist requires you to do gymnastics to try and change things on the iPod itself - the remote is really only for Play/Pause, and volume control. The number of batteries (and expense) pretty much make this music box only good for plugging into a wall socket for me.

I then had to shut down the IPOD to unfreeze it, then turn it back on, which is a real pain. Apparently, from reading other reviews of the IM7, Altec is aware of the problem but has no plans to correct it.

You would think out of courtesy they would send it to you for free, esp. since this is a known problem they just haven't bothered to fix because they apparently don't care about their customers enough to fix it, they're happy to keep charging $3 extra and making people wait before they can actually use their machine they paid for.ARG!!!So I'm going to have to wait for a functioning adapter to arrive in the mail, however long that takes.ALTEC: FIX THE PROBLEM ALREADY!

The next day used the speakers all day, it happened again! Then I tried my ipod mini on it to see if it would make a difference - my ipod mini then froze. I'm very disappointed.

The tiny wireless remote that comes with this speaker set is the ONLY WAY to change the bass/treble settings. If you lose it, you're screwed. I lost mine, and when I tried to replace it, Altec told me that they don't have replacements in stock, and they have no idea when they'll get more! The guy on the phone told me they ran out because \\"people lose them so often.\\" If people are losing the remotes that much why are they not in stock?!2. When I was removing the power brick that comes with the iM7 from the outlet I had it plugged into, one of the brick's prongs snapped off. When I tried to replace it, I got the same response as for the remote... \\"don't have anymore\\" and claim not to know when they'll get more. So now my speaker unit is a brick.This was a horrible customer service experience. Avoid these guys. A decent set of computer speakers will cost you less and provide better sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warranty troubles fixed quickly","review":"I love this unit. I have it in my office and rock on when I am working back. The only iffy thing is the mechanism that holds your ipod in. Mine broke through normal use after 6 months.

I will definitely consider their products in the future again.The sound from the unit is awesome for the money. The unit is easily portable.

The sound of this model is way better in all ways over the Bose. The high notes are crisper, the lows are deeper, and the overall sound is richer, believe it or not. AND, the volume gets louder if necessary. We used if during a party and you would have thought we had a multi speaker, high quality stereo system playing. It's great that it's so portable too. A bit heavy with all the batteries in but well worth it. We've had ours for months and are now buying more for the kids. It's sturdy enough that we feel confident it will survive them and their friends!

Sure enough, a few days ago it stopped latching, keeping the door open all the time. Bad design for sure.Great sound with the unit, though. Fills a room nicely. The open door doesn't affect playing or charging; just irritating and doesn't look nearly as nice when using it for a dinner party.I'll check the warranty, but I think it's past. I might try removing the springs that force the door open."},{"rating":"2","title":"music freak","review":"This Ipod dock was recommended by a friend. I was hesitant about getting an older, discontinued model as there are always better features on the newer models and it's generally easier to replace a newer model than a discontinued one if something is wrong with it. However, I am so glad that I purchased the IM7. It sounds great! It sounds better than any of the ones I listened to in the store. The handle is a little awkward however I won't be moving it around frequently so for me I don't mind the discomfort of the handle so much. The sound is more important to me than what it feels like to carry it around. The design is wonderful too as the speakers wrap around the entire unit whereas most of the ones I looked only had the speakers on the front panels. Not only is it powerful but the clarity of the instruments is incredible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-existent customer service","review":"This product shipped without a power cable. We contacted Altec's customer support and they apologized and said they would send out a power cable. Two weeks went by and no cable. Another call and another sincere apology with the promise of a power cable. A month later and still no cable. The unit has good sound, but eats batteries like crazy. So if you buy this item, just hope you don't have to contact Altec's customer \\"service\\" group because as far as I can tell, it doesn't exist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"I read the other reviews and thought this product must be amazing but it is only really good. It has good sound and great electrical connections. It has power plugs for almost every country. It also has a good interface with the iPOD. The drawback I had was that it did not have an adapter for the iPOD Nano gen2. You have to send away for it.The shipping and ordering were first rate. I recommend this product to others but if you have a gen2 nano, you will have to go through the hassle of ordering the adaptor."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best mobile speaker ever","review":"I am amaze with the big sound of this little thing. Is so deep that you wont believe that the sound is coming from this speaker. There are two things I think Altec lansing should improve.

The battery life seems better than advertised, as well. The batteries held up for a bus trip to So. Ca. and back, 7 hours each way, no problem. Definitely go for the handle/strap device. It holds the unit securely and adds convenience, even if it does look like an S&M device..."},{"rating":"1","title":"awesome for the first 6 months, then quickly downhill","review":"My sister bought this unit and I was blown away by the sound quality. I put it on my wish list and received it for christmas. For the first 6 months it worked great. Then my cats chewed my remote and it didn't work so I had to start using the buttons on the top of the unit. They lost sensitivity to the point where they barely worked after about 2 or 3 months. In the next month or two, the Ipod cradle got some type of short in it and only plays in one speaker unless you hold it half-way closed. Had to resort to connecting my Ipod via an external audio cable for full stereo sound, which means that it no longer gets charged while in use. If this thing cost $50 it might be worth it but since it is much more than that, my advice would be to skip it. My sister's has the same problems and mine even seemed to develop faster than hers, suggesting that the inferior quality is getting worse as production continues. Way overpriced for the quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome speakers!!","review":"This speaker system is simply awesome!!It's the best thing invented after the iPod itself.

Most recently, a friend's iPod was also frozen/stuck when the audio system was used. The last time I used the system, it froze the iPod every hour. We played at moderate levels, so volume should not have been a factor.This is my only complaint/problem with the product. Contacted customer service to determine exchange or return.Otherwise, easy to use, excellent sound with good bass, remote is helpful. Compared to other portable iPod speaker systems, this one had the best price for the features. The sound is really superior for a system of this size and price range."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad for the Price","review":"I am very pleased with the iM7. Sound quality is very good, even when played at a higher volume. The remote doesn't have much range to it, but adequate. Taken care of, this product should last quite a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY!!!!!","review":"I had thought I had done my homework before buying this item, a CNET review pick. The first time I used it at medium volume it froze my ipod. When I called altec lansing, they told me they told me they knew all about it. They said that the iM7 is bass heavy and that it can reverberate the ipod causing it to freeze. They recommended playing non-bass heavy music and using it at low volumes. I don't understand why I would want a speaker system to play music at low volumes, not to mention the fact that I was playing the music at a medium volume when it froze. Also, I can't imagine having to restrict the type of music I play on the system. The sound quality is indeed great when it is working but who needs the hassle. oh, your ipod will come back to life after the battery wears out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Sound, but it broke after 6 months","review":"I got this Altec Lansing iM7 for Christmas, and was very happy with the sound quality. Unfortunately, in June (just 6 months after I took it out of the box) some circuit inside broke through normal usage and it suddenly sounded all scratchy, unlistenable.

Be warned, keep the warranty papers and receipt."},{"rating":"1","title":"altec Lansing im7","review":"I purchased this item for my husband for Christmas and it crashed his Ipod each time he used it. We did an internet search and this seems to be a very common problem with this item. Electronics Expo refused to refund all our money for this product because I purchased it in early Novenmber, as a Christmas present, and they have a 30-day return policy. They are charging a 20% restocking fee, plus shipping both ways, which amounts to about $67.00, which is approximately half the price of this product. I would not recommend purchasing anything from this company, as you would think they would have a different policy for Christmas returns. Amazon on the other hand stated that they would refund the difference once it was processed through Electronics Expo, that is why we enjoy shopping on Amazon, they really make an effort to please the customer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Sound & Features, Bad Door Design","review":"I love the sound and the remote features and all of the ports on the back. However, after using it for several months, the DOOR will not close anymore. I have to use packing tape to keep it 'closed' and I have to use the cord that connects the iPod to the input jack on the back. Therefore, the iPod does not charge and constantly is using its own batteries. It is too bad that this system has a bad door design, otherwise, I would have given it five stars +!"},{"rating":"2","title":"iM7, the performance audio system","review":"Am satisfied with the sound quality.

While I still stand by that review, I definately owe Altec a rave review for their IM7 (I returned the former for the latter). The IM7 is exactly what I was looking for. The sound is rich and vibrant. It is way loud, and its highs and lows are better than the Bose.

The place where you insert the ipod is made of cheap plastic and the door is very flimsy. The door broke with 1 year and the item was unusable. From a company like this I would have expected better. A complete waste of money and I would suggest that you do not waste your money on this like I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Warranty","review":"A very good sounding unit, but discontinued so you cannot get warranty service. On mine, the door broke(as is common). I sent it in, but Altec says it is discontinued, so I can choose another like the im9 or m602? They are not in the same class(or price) in my experience. I will try to get my money back, it is simply unacceptable service. So if you buy one of these now, hope it doesn't break because you won't get another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent sound completely overshadowed by Product Flaws","review":"Having heard this product because a friend owned one, I knew this is the one I wanted to purchase. The sound is increible and gets great reviews on ilounge. One of the best sounding docking stations on the market. But on to the BAD. My friend had to send his back because the door holding the IPOD was broken. When Altec Lansing received it they told him that they stopped making them and the simple part needed to fix it. I was told it was just with the generation 1 stations so I decided to purchase one. Right out of the box mine was broken. I had the EXACT problem and had to return it.

A little after a year the unit started having connection problems with our iPod and the sound would cut in and out. If you wiggled the iPod you could get it to work properly. Now after 2 years the power amp has gone out. You can hear music coming faintly through the speakers so I know the connection is working. Also the power LED has gone out in conjunction with this so something tells me this thing is not getting powered properly to drive the speakers.If working right the unit sounds good, but since it doesn't work there is no use in giving it any type of accolades for sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent product, but HORRIFIC customer service","review":"I bought the iM7 system in April 2007 and like it from the beginning. It has decent sound quality. But in May 2007 for some reason the A/C power supply malfunctioned. So I called up Altec Lansing's customer service and placed an order for a new power supply on May 7th 2007. Its June 25th today and I have not yet received my power supply. I have called them 8 times over last 7 weeks and every time they sympathize with me but nothing gets done. I don't want to spend money on buying annoying batteries, which they are not ready to reimburse me for anyways. Is it going to take 2 months everytime I have a problem with this product. My final words. Good product, but just hope nothing goes wrong with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Ipod stereo on the market","review":"I had a friend who bought this stereo and he loved it. I was even happier after I purchased it myself and was able to use it for what I wanted. I used it to play volley ball in an open court yard in my apartment complex, and the sound was awesome. I had no problem hearing it, and there is great base. The unit is very portable and easy to use. This is the best Ipod stereo I have every seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect!","review":"The sound quality is amazing and the adapters it comes with does alow you to use different type ipods and they fit great. That being said a huge flaw is no display for the controls? You never know how loud it is or what the bass and trebel is set at. This has resulted in turning the ipod on with the volume all the way up twice now. If the ipod is paused and someone doesnt know it they try turning up the volume first and then when you tell them it is paused they unpause it and WOW so load! If there was a display with just a couple of leds to show you the settings and maybe a rechargable system it would be perfect. Again the sound and especialy the bass is amazing and so clear. I would still highly recomend this over any other Ipod dock speakers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound, terrible remote","review":"We really love the convenience of popping in our ipods and getting great sounding music. This system is nice because it is small and easily portable. It would've been nice to have one in black though. The main drawback is the really terrible remote. We actually called the company to get a new one because we had to squeeze the remote near the battery to get it to work. The second one is a little better but still doesn't work if you're more than 6 inches away which sort of defeats the purpose. Also missing is an indicator of bass/treble levels. It has bass/treble buttons on the remote but no way of measuring the levels except by ear. Overall a great deal, just wish the remote worked better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Design Consider Other Options","review":"I dont give many neg reviews. Ever wonder why there are so many reconditions out there? Well there is a cheap black clip the holds the IPOD door shut, I have had 2 clips break in 1 month, with less than normal use.Also the remote is a piece of junk. The only advice is one that you just set the IPOD in the dock. I repurchased the BOSE system and actually think the sound on the Altec IM7 is a little better.

And the kewl look! I'd given it 5 stars, but the instructions that come with it are minimum and need more information in them. Other than that, it sounds great, even played real loud... or soft. You can put out for a special carrying bag for it - but I just found a round type bag at a thrift store that works just as well, for a fraction of the price. (It was for a tripod or maybe one of those camping chairs, I think.)It's not too big to move around the house with me, or outside. Wouldn't take it on a plane trip though. Too cumbersome.

The remote works well and stores neatly in the back of the unit.My firends and I compared this to the Bose, plus several Logitech offerings.

Regardless of when you call, or what extension you request, the result is the same: a recorded message that says \\"all agents are currently busy, please try again later.\\" And then you get a fast busy signal.I talked to the folks at Ipod about this and I was told that they get lots of calls about Altec stereos damaging Ipods. They say they never get any calls about Bose units.If I were considering the purchase of another stereo for my Ipod, I would NEVER buy anything from Altec.

Don't forget to coat your ipod in some type of skin to keep the iM7 from scratching it (badly)."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS THING!!!!!!!!","review":"I have had my unit going on three years and it still ROCKS!!!!!!! I use it outside when doing yard work or cooking on the grill. Sounds fantastic, can get really loud and keeps my i-pod charged. What more could one want. If it broke i would buy it again. I also bought the harness to help protect it.

Now it no longer comes on or plays (no, it was dropped, spilled on, or otherwise abused). Tech support told me it sounded like and short and there was nothing they could do for me. Likewise, a manager told me there was nothing to be done as the unit is out of warranty.So, I paid $250 for two years of use. Not a good value in my book. I won't be buying another Altec Lansing product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great while it worked...","review":"....I considered this vs the Bose SoundDock, and made my decision based on on-line reviews (here mostly), slightly cheaper price, and the fact that my 50+ year old ears can no longer appreciate all the range of frequencies, especially the higher ones.I also preferred the look of the iM7 over the SoundDock, as strange as that may seem.So, for several months it served its purpose, and gave me pleasure . But after only 7 months it quit working; no sound and the door would not close. Therefore I have to rate it only 2 stars. Had it lasted, it would have been 5.I guess if I pay $200+, I expect a little more than 7 months use before taking it to a electrical recycling center."},{"rating":"2","title":"C-line pockets","review":"Great for teachers!

Unique and inspiring."},{"rating":"1","title":"deeply disturbing","review":"I was truly stunned when I was given a copy of this book. My initial impression was the previous owner had dropped it in the toilet or spilt an entire pot of coffee over it and left it soaking overnight. It was in fact hand bound, presumably by the author - possibly as part of a class project, and consequently the book flops open wherever you put it. It is impossible to keep it closed. The text is devoid of any useful information and merely contains copies of equations with no explanation of their origin. The various typefaces used throughout the 50 pages or so suggest they were probably lifted from other texts. I would find it hard to recommend to anyone unless they had a passing interest in bookbinding"},{"rating":"2","title":"Serpent kundalini","review":"I first saw this book recommended on the John Anthony West series 'Magical Egypt'. The book is somewhere between Egypt in science for the common man, and the more esoteric and more difficult to understand Schwaller de Lubicz' work on the Temple of Man (inter alia). If you are into the Egyptian religion, philosophy, science and general wonders, I thoroughly recommend this book. Get it while it's still in print!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this is fun, but Schwaller and West are nuts","review":"Schwaller de Lubicz was a genius, but a creative genius, not a scientific one.I don't dispute that there was an advanced civilization millenia before Egypt. The case for that is all circumstantial, but it is an overwhelming circumstantial case, and if historians ever get a clue the existence of so-called \\"Atlantis\\" will be taken for granted.Nor do I dispute the basic truth of Schwaller's esoteric worldview.What I dispute is the idea that the temple at Luxor has anything to do with what Schwaller says it does. The miracle of Egypt is that it is basically a blank slate. It can be interpreted any way one likes. The interpretations tell us much about the interpreter, but none of us will ever really understand Egypt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Making Schwaller de Lubicz understandable","review":"If you prescibe to conventional views about Egyptology don't buy this book. However, if you believe that science does not have the story of our origins and Egypt quite right, then this book will open your eyes.The writing style is accessible, not too technical, and not too etheric. The work of Schwaller de Lubicz is presented, along with JAWs owns metaphors, in a way to help you understand that Egyptian culture and architecture was much deeper than archeologists think.JAW is most famous pointing to geologic weathering analysis of the Sphinx show that it is at least 10,000 years old. The book stays rooted in science enough to keep the discerning reader interested. There is also a hint of the civilization that pre-dates Egypt (?Atlantis) which will also keep the alternate reader interested. All-in-all a very good and balanced book.Also recommended is 'Temple of the Cosmos' by Jeremy Naydler."},{"rating":"2","title":"for open-minded readers","review":"The author has always been an unorthodox scholar and this shines through in this work, in which he espouses the views of Schwaller de Lubicz and his own. It is a pioneering study with revolutionary interpretations. The author puts forward his case for a Sacred Science of the Pharaohs, which was conveyed through the hermetic messages embodied within the hieroglyphs. He details Egyptian science, medicine, mathematics and astronomy in vivid and concise detail. The book ends with a presentation of his views on the age of the Sphinx. This book is a must for open-minded readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book about pseudo Pythagorean mysticism not ancient Egypt!","review":"This book is really about some pseudo Pythagorean mysticism with very little to do with ancient Egypt. It's a shame that this book will make it easier for Egyptologists to ignore the the subject altogether.Egyptologist dismissal of the unknown civilization possibility is obviously dogmatic as is the favoring of Greek classic culture over others. However, West's theories - ranging from intelligent guesses to wild fantasies but presented as facts - is every bit as dogmatic and more.Trying to reconstruct something alien to us is usually a result of our own ideas but West take it to the extreme with nothing really to link it to ancient Egypt. This book is more like a Rorschach test...Burgess tells a story about a Moslem scholar trying to figure out the completely alien notion (to him at least) of tragedy and coming to the conclusion that it must be the art of praising something..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great playing plus a cover of Kashmir - how can you go wrong?","review":"I'm a fan of Cello music and this is VERY well played and a really wide variety of stuff which is a good thing.

It took awhile to setup and get all the stakes in the ground (it was rocky). The tent is well designed and constructed but I do think it is a little complex to set up. Fortunately my son was able to hold the one end of the poles while I did the bending. I'm curious as to what the tent will be like after several uses. The poles seem to be bent to just about their max.Regardless, this tent is a good buy for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disenchanted","review":"I'm a hardcore camper. I'm camping more often than not. I realize that I'm putting more wear and tear on my tents than the average person, but it also gives me a chance to really get to know my tent. This tent was easy to set up, but it got a hole in the floor the first time I set it up. I swept the area for sticks and rocks, and put down a ground tarp; still something managed to poke through the bottom. Those floor vents are really nice for letting in a cool breeze, however they also let in rain if you forget to close them. Backsplash off the ground, so it's not just rain, it's mud. And yes, I did tarp over the tent as well as under it. The way the rainfly attaches over the doors puts added stress on the already flimsy zippers. They haven't gone out yet, but I know it's only a matter of time. I love the layout of this tent, but there are just too many flaws to make it worth the money. I really expected better from Coleman."},{"rating":"1","title":"!!!!!!!!","review":"I cant believe it. I thought that this was a great tent but the fabric is very thin and very cheap material.

Unfortunately, the first night we used it a thunderstorm with high wind and lots of rain came up. The wind blew the rain under the fly and we got soaked.

We did love the 3 rooms.

Cardassian academies, I'll have you know, are a lot tougher than West Point or The Citadel, as you'll discover in this story. Their \\"lords of discipline\\" are what turn out hard cases like Dukat and Damar. And it's also why Garak, despite his seeming effeteness, is a pretty tough customer himself at times. I don't know if Robinson, who played Garak on the series, really is the author, or if he did a Bill Shatner and had it ghosted. All I know is if you can get past the temptation to be a purist, this book is worth the read. No matter who \\"wrote\\" it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Andrew Robinson IS Garak","review":"This truely is the best \\"Trek\\" book I've ever read! Robinson fleshes out one of the most intricate and compelling characters in all of Star Trek. I only hope that Mr Robinson continues his work as an author, and revisits Cardassia on a regular basis. For anyone who loves DS9 or Trek in general put a day aside for this book, you'll have a tough time putting it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"An above-average book by someone who shouldn't be this good","review":"When I heard that Andrew J. Robinson was writing the \\"memoirs\\" of his marvelous DS9 character, I figured it was another SF vanity project like the TekWar books or the like. Surprisingly, Robinson not only understands Elim Garak but also fleshes out Cardassia a lot more than any writer at DS9 did. He creates a world that is both believable and alien.There are flaws, such as the reason Garak was exiled to DS( and the amount of guilt that Garak feels for Cardassian misdeeds in the past, but this is a very good read and better than most of the Trek books I've read. Carey, Gray, and most of the rest have nothing on this \\"amateur\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Stitch in Time\\"","review":"WOW! What a fantastic story. Even if you are not a fan of DS9 you will enjoy this book. The character of Garak is fascinating and I really enjoyed the way the book was part journal, part correspondence and part real time.

It's infuriating to see these inane, childish books on the same lists as Isaac Asimov, Arthur C. Clark, Ray Bradbury.....and other actual writers. The fact that there are thousands of these garbage fiction books is a testament to the total lack of imagination of the modern human mind. Books based on TV series and games! What a waste of our paper resources. Actually, the best use for these books is to be recycled and something of greater quality printed on the new paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I have the greatest admiration for an actor who can put on paper the character he plays. Not only that, give the character more substance.I had always found the character Garak compelling, mysterious, and always a treat to see. I never really realized the actors talent until I read this book. OMG! This book sucks you in and doesn't let you go, even at the end. I've read so many books by various authors (including Shatner) and NONE can portray the characters as well as Andrew can. He breathes real life into the character.I'm not going to go over the premise of this story due to it being covered by several other reviewers here.This is a must read for anyone who enjoys Star Trek: DS9. All other ST books can be set aside."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plain & simple Garak","review":"If you enjoy DS9 then this is a must! Garak's intriguing and well hidden past, in a letter to Dr Bashir. The book can seem like a complicated read to begin with as it jumps from past to present and back again quite frequently.

It gives detailed accounts of Garak's past from his own point of view, but then again, is it true?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Star Trek Masterpiece","review":"Wonder deep inside the mind of the subtle yet vital Character of DS9, Elim Garak. In Stitch in Time, Andrew J. Robinson reveals the hidden inside of one of the most faschinating characters in the Star Trek universe. This is one of the most fascinating sci fi novels I have read. I could not put the book down. The author uses the best blend of in depth discreption and action. This is by far a great balance between simplicity and complexity. The author takes you deep into the childhood of Garak and shows you what formed this most devious man and then into adulthood where Garak gets banished from Cardasia and ends up on Deep Space Nine. Im not usually a sci fi reader although I love Star Trek television shows. This is one book I would recomend to any true star trek fan. Regardless if you like Star Trek the original series or Star Trek Voyager.

Well, this game helps the cuase. However, I have another theory why the game is so awfully boring. Becasue the movie was boring! I like the tv show, but the movie stunk, so the game did too. It had no action, the graphics were bad, and the fun level was quite below average, there were a few fun parts, but overall, the game was boring.

She only likes one of them - arrogant, entertaining, hotshot Davis, who has no intention of taking her seriously. Lonely, melancholy playwright Matt might really appreciate her, but he does not turn her on. The girl is a French prostitute who is quiet and sweet and apparently looking for a cool American boyfriend. The dialogue is not very interesting, pretty standard college guy talk.

And just when I think the author is going to stumble, he comes up with a few sentences like these, describing the New York Open (page 220, paperback edition):\\"The ballroom was loosely ornate.

Battery life is horrific, worse I have ever had across all cell phones I have owned. Gives about 30 seconds battery warning before shutting down.

I like the size and weight of the phone, and the sliding keyboard is OK. The Bluetooth feature doesn't support data transfer - it's only for a wireless headset/earbud. The contact list only holds 200 entries, and each one of those will only take one phone number. If you use your phone to maintain a contact list with multiple entries for each contact, forget about this one. I've had this LG PM-325 for one day - I will likely be buying a Treo next week.It's too bad these phones come with useless built in sounds and graphics, but are short on usable features. Who needs a manatee swimming away when you turn the phone off? Another reviewer called the PM-325 a \\"kid's phone\\" - I have to agree.I got the phone for $69.00 through Sprint.

I can completely power up the phone, and within 20 mins of talking the phone will start beeping because of a low battery. Sometimes the phone will go haywire and the buttons you push will do the exact opposite of what you're trying to do. At times the # button does not work. The volume on the phone may seem loud, but if you are driving on the highway, even with the windows up you will struggle to hear what the person is saying.Overall this phone is good for about 4-5 months, and then it will start to become a piece of crap. Another thing that stinks on the phone is that it doesn't take very good pictures, and there is no flash. Overall this is a cheaply made phone that does not last.

The entire book is devoted to the search for the young girl and Abby's efforts to recollect the events of that day.Sounds like it could be good. But I found this to be too long and uneventful. I had read about 250 pages and two things had happened...the girl had disappeared and a shoe was found. I felt as though too much happened too early in the book, then nothing for hundreds of pages.

Weird.She then fills \\"space\\" with endless random facts, some on memory, which after the 20th one you get the point that - Hey the main character just might remember something.I think she had a great storyline, but for whatever reason couldn't develop the characters sufficent to complete the chapters, so she through in alot of distracting information.

Although the story is primarily about a lost child, I learned a lot of useful information about memory and photography along the way. I am a special education teacher and I was interested in many of the theories of memory that were interspersed throughout the entire novel. It's always a bonus when a book read for entertainment takes on an educational bent and provides me with new insights that may help in my profession. Overall, I gave this book 4 stars because it dragged on a tad too long and the ending, while moderately fulfilling, could have packed more of a punch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Longest short-story I've ever read...","review":"This book would have made a great short-story. As a novel, however, it's more like an exercise in tedium. I think the publisher has it right, The Year of Fog is a real \\"spare page-turner\\" (it has a lot of spare pages). Aside from the fact that there are at least 70 chapters wherein nothing happens bookended by two major events, the author seems to lack experience in writing authentic dialogue. I didn't believe any of the conversations that occurred and I felt too often like the author was trying too hard to impress her readers with all the research she did upon writing this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Year of Fog","review":"While the book had some very intriguing parts that kept me going, mostly it was very slow. Not one I would read twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will it ever end?","review":"I certainly have a different opinion than most about this book which I found tedious and mundane to say the least. Story telling at it's longest, get on with the story please. This book could have been 100 pages shorter. Too much extra stuff no one cares about which was just plain long and unnecessary blah, blah. I wish I had the time back I spent reading it even though I have deep compassion for parents and loved ones suffering with child abductions and my heart aches for them; this book, however, takes it (my emotions) somewhere else where I was more agitated with the whole story than I was compassionate."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved it","review":"I loved this book. We read this for our book club choice, and I think everyone enjoyed it. If it seems kind of slow in places, it is because if you were someone who lost a child, time would literally stand still. I think Michelle really captures the torment, anguish and guilt that would come in a situation like this. The ending was a surprise, but could only have ended in that way. A great read!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought-provoking and well written","review":"I read this book a few months ago. While the subject matter doesn't make for easy reading, I have to say I found the book to be really well written. The author took me to the core of what the characters were going through. The book is a powerful example of how one little misstep in life, one little lapse of concentration, can change our lives forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"It pulls you in","review":"This is one of the best books I've read. Michelle Richmond evokes every parent's or caregiver's worst nightmare of losing a child in their care. I was torn between wanting to keep the pages turning to see what happens and hoping the book wouldn't end. Initially, it reminded me of Jane Hamilton's \\"A Map of the World\\", but ended up being far more engrossing - characters so well-drawn, suspenseful and emotional. I wondered if I would have had Abby's incredible, unflagging determination to find someone else's child, especially in the face of the child's own father having given up. A terrific read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehhh...","review":"This book is frustrating and boring. There are interesting photography bits, but mostly overdone. For the most part, the style of writing is bland, and though the story definitely starts off with a bang with a child's disappearance, nothing of significance happens until the last few pages of the novel. So that leaves over a hundred pages of constantly mulling over the same details and the same images of a strained relationship. It's a sad story, but mostly one-note, and I will probably never read a book by Michelle Richmond again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too drawn out","review":"The book is so slow! I would not compare it to a Jodi Picoult book and will not read anything else from this author again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Super disappointing....:(","review":"I was excited to read this book when my friend gave it to me and I started it right away. The beginning was great and I was immediately drawn in, but after awhile I became bored with the endless amount of chapters that went on and on about searching and accounts of Abby's past. Eventually I gave up and skimmed through the book, reading here and there until I got to the end. Once there I was shocked at the treatment of Abby after all she had gone though to find Emma, and especially after the fact that she was the only one who didn't give up the search for her. Jake was just basically saying \\"Um thanks for finding her, have a nice life.\\" That really angered me and made me dislike the book even more, I spent 90% of the book waiting for it to get better, then nothing. It should have been alot shorter too, 400 pages is too long for the type of story that this tells."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of your time","review":"We read this for book club, and 6 out of 6 of us HATED this book. The narrator is selfish, concerned more about how she will look at the end, than of the little girl. The reading level is elementary, chocked full of juvenile dialog. You want to finish the book and forget it ever existed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Foggy Book","review":"This book put me in a fog. I agree it could have made an interesting short story, but too far fetched. Why didn't the authorities go after the child's biological mother in the beginning? I highly recommend \\"Deep End of the Ocean\\" if you want a good read on a similar subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Felt like a Year of Fog","review":"It felt like a year of fog reading this never ending book. It started out realistic with the sinking feeling that accompanies a lost child but about 200 pages of the novel delves into \\"why can't I remember\\". I wish I could forget I read it. And please - child abduction - the FBI gets involved. Since when does the ex-wife get a free pass on that one?The ending was pathetic - thanks for proving you love us - now hit the road? Don't waste your time on this insipid story."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Love Me Book","review":"The main character in The Year of the Fog must have had a super hero syndrome. She was constantly thinking what a heroine she would be by finding the child and absolving herself of any wrong doing by not keeping a careful eye on the girl. I am surprised she would pass a mirror and keep going.Meanwhile you have to struggle through her random thoughts about things that have nothing to do with the plot but I am guessing she enjoys meaningless trivia and piling on reader.One word of advice for the author. \\"EDIT\\". Get a pen out and start cutting out mindless discussion that have nothing to do with the story.I would recommend this book as punishment only."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall a good read!","review":"Overall, this was a great book and I found myself not being able to put it down. It's a great story about how one woman will not give up the search to find her fiance's daughter after she is kidnapped during her watch. There were times when it was a bit repetitive, but it's still a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Content","review":"Great product idea, but uneven implementation. The sound quality should be much better. And some of the modules, such as reading, are pretty good. Other modules, however, are weak on content. I found that the science and nature modules are particularly superficial. Touch the wand to an animal and you get a couple of simple facts. It would be so much better to provide real insight into the animal's behaviors and habitat. So, in summary, for the science modules, you're better off buying a good book and reading to your child."},{"rating":"1","title":"quality control/durability needs improving","review":"I put the batteries in and the book started then we turned the page and the thing just quit. I have changed the batteries several times doing exactly what the instructions say and it does not work. The toy looks like so much fun I hope I can find one that works!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"While the some of the stories play with our expectations (Scott Aniolowski's and Will Murray's), too many of the rest are not much better than the worst website Mythos fiction. Disappointing addition to amazing series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun at home for Kids","review":"Its a very good buy for kids below 2 years of age.Our kid is 7 months old and we attached to an existing swing set in the backyard and it worked perfectly fine for us.He enjoys it a lot.Safety tray is good to hold.Our neighbors kid is 18months old and she tried to swing and had lots of fun with it.I cant really say how good this will be for 2+ years."},{"rating":"2","title":"great, but...","review":"My 6-month-old son loves this swing, but the ropes are a mess! As other reviewers said, the ropes are twisted or uneven or something. The swing swings a little lop-sided.

My grandson loves it! Would recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby swing","review":"The swing worked as advertised. My granddaughter has loved swinging in the swing. It was very easy to put up and start using immediately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Swing. Yes, The Ropes Are Adjustable!","review":"I'm not sure why other customers complained that the ropes were uneven. The ropes are ADJUSTABLE on the back top portion where they connect to the reclining mechanism. You simply have to pull the left or right rope at the top back of the swing to even them both out. The swing ropes/hooks arrived very uneven but this simple fix makes both hooks level at our tree connection and with even slack throughout the ropes. For only $19.99 on Amazon, we are very happy we purchased this swing for our 5 month old daughter. 5 Stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"uneven ropes","review":"As some others mentioned, the uneven ropes are a pain.The crimped ropes made it impossible to even the swing.We eventually just cut the ropes and tied knots to get the desired angle for a safe ride for the child.I would NOT recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good purchase for the value paid","review":"I purchased this swing for my 21-month old child. We installed and used it right away. It is nice, stable and secure for the child. The only thing you might want to consider is, if this swing will be installed on a swing set, the ropes of the swing are very long. My son's feet were touching the ground so we could not use it with the original ropes. Good choise for an infant swing. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero stars-This swing is junk","review":"Product arrived, attempted to install. Rope lengths are different and since they are fixed/bolted in, there is no adjustment. Swing is useless, sent it back. Pass on this piece of junk, buy the 2 in 1 Snug & Secure swing instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good buy....","review":"What a waste of money! I bought this for my daughter's first birthday and when we got the cardboard off it we found that one side of the rope was much longer than the other. It had been crimped in the wrong spot, there's no way to fix it. It also isn't long enough to hang it on any tree except maybe a small bush. Save your money for a better swing, this one's not worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Made, Good Value","review":"Very nice, well packaged, easy to assemble and install. My granddaughter loves it. It is on our porch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Swing!","review":"I bought this swing for my son for his first birthday. We both love it!

Good price.","review":"Exactly what I was looking for my toddler grands. Easy to secure the child in. Sturdy construction. Will last beyond my needs. They grow so fast!. Will pass it on to others in time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Swing!","review":"I first bought this swing 8 years ago when my nephew turned 1. He LOVED it, it was his best birthday gift. Since then, it has become our standard one-year-old gift. I've given it to dozens of children and received rave reviews every time. When a friend bought this for my son's first birthday, we were thrilled. He and his friends are now nearly four and still like to swing in it even though they have mastered the big-boy swing. My one-year-old will sit in it watching the big kids play in the garden and he is a mover - does not like to sit still at all. It is also perfect on days when the ground is too wet to crawl around (which seems like everyday lately).By the way, I read the 'upside down' post. I was concerned and tried to turn mine upside down without a child in it and the ropes are balanced that I could not turn it even empty. That family may have had defective ropes or it was installed improperly..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not safe for toddlers.","review":"We loved this swing last summer when my son was under 12 months old. My little guy is a peanut and I thought it would last a while, however, as he began to move around he was able to flip the swing. He was just over a year and leaned forward as far as he could and the whole thing flipped over. Needless to say we took it down immediately. We are now looking into a Step 2, 5 point harness, toddler swing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have!","review":"We bought this swing for my daughters 1st birthday. We hung it from the rafters in our porch. She just loves it! It is so safe and easy to use and clean. I researched lots of swings before we decided on this one. We are very pleased with our purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"My son started using this when he was 6 months old. He loves it! There are other reviews that mention that it does hang somewhat lop-sided and this is true. (About 1 inch higher on one side.) However, it hangs beautifully from a large tree in our yard. It is simple to operate with one hand and secures the child easily. Other swings did not provide the same security for the child."},{"rating":"2","title":"much cheaper at Toys R Us","review":"This swing sells at Toys R Us for $22.99. Not sure why it's so much here?

I only have two gripes: the ropes to hand it were uneven (one was much longer), so my husband had to rig it to make it swing evenly and there are warnings all over the swing not to use it over hard surfaces (but realistically, everywhere in our yard is over a hard surface)."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNCERTAIN SO FAR","review":"Purchased this product as it seems it's one of those quintessential \\"toys\\" every kid should have like a wagon or trike. However, am somewhat disappointed that we have as of yet, been unable to set it up. The product comes with relatively short rope length that almost guarantees the need to purchase additional rope from the hardware store to hang at a decent height from a practical branch off our trees. Will let you know if my disappointment changes once I've put worth all the extra effort obviously involved with this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, comfy, but difficult tray","review":"I thought I would like this swing but the tray is very difficult to get on. Whenever my son sees this he gets so excited he dives toward the swing but it takes too long to get the tray apart (two handed motion and still difficult). He is comfy and I think safe when he is in the swing, but VERY DIFFICULT to get him out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy","review":"I got this for my 19 month old son. After returning two of them due the rope being so uneven I bought a differnet one. It was not worth the trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's Up With These Horrible Ropes?","review":"I got one of these today before I read any reviews on them. I took this thing out of it's cardboard and ran outside to my daughter's new swingset only to find out that the ropes were crimped IN THE WRONG SPOT on one side! At first I thought that maybe it was suppose to be like this for some strange reason. I fiddled with it until I was so mad I was ready to throw up! Then I took a deep breath, counted to 10 and decided to come inside (slinging the evil thing into the car to return it tomorrow on my way into the house) and got online to read some reviews. It seems there are other people who wrote reviews with this very same rope crimping trouble. I think there are some major quality control issues with this swing because the majority of the reviews listed are written by happy campers with no rope drama. I'm not going to buy another one of these because I will surely have a meltdown if the next one is like this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as happy as I had hoped","review":"The swing was easy to install and I did not need extra tools or help. Unfortunately the tree branch was not exactly horizontal and so it was difficult to make the swing horizontal. It was even enough, however, and I put my daughter in. The swing was tilting a little far forward but I could not adjust it. The worst part was getting her out. The tray was near IMPOSSIBLE to undo from its locked position. I guess I did not need to worry about her falling out, I was just wondering if I would be able to get her out at all. I'll be donating the swing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Swing for the Price","review":"I purchased this swing to match one that I already have. My only faux-pas is that it's very hard to adjust the ropes to make them even.

One side of the ropes for the swing was longer than the other side. Once I hung the swing (had to hand with additional rope one side longer than the other the swing set up too far didn't matter which position setting I had it on. I ended up purchasing one a walmart that I should've gotten in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life saver","review":"I purchased this swing for my grandson who was 4 months old at that time. Two of my granddaughters were visiting also. They were 2 and 1 year old. All three kids really enjoyed the swing. The swing was almost never empty. My son had a pull-up bar installed in the door leading to the kitchen from the dining area. I hung the swing on the pull-up bar. When we ate our meals we would put either the 1 year old in it or the baby. It is also a very good containment device if you need your toddler to be contained while you are doing something else. The babies loved going to sleep in it. I tied a 5-6 yards rope to the swing's rope and then I could just sit a few feet across from the swing and pull the rope to rock the babies. It was convenient. I could fold laundry or do other chores while swinging the baby in the swing at the same time. I recommend this product to all parents. The price is great and it will make your life easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun but tends to tilt","review":"Love this swing but I found it to tilt sometimes. We try to fix it but does not last long. My kids love it and always want to sit in it. I would buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great swing","review":"My son loves this swing, and so do I. We found it easy to install (hanging from a tree in the yard), and so far we've had no problems with safety. I feel like my son is perfectly safe when in this swing, thanks to both the safety harness as well as the lock-in-place tray, and he'd rather be outside than anywhere else, so we're both happy! Good buy, especially for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful swing","review":"I bought this swing for my 6 month old grandson. It arrived very quickly and in perfect condition. Excellent for babies and young toddlers. I am glad I purchased it. The only thing I would like is a little padding for the back of the head, but I guess it would raise the price too.Excellent quality all over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't be happier....","review":"We are extremely happy with this swing - my daughter just loves it, and on a nice day will swing forever and even fall asleep in it. We had no problems with hanging it or adjusting it at all - the one's who do are simply not reading the directions. I would recommend this to all my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"We LOVE this swing!","review":"I haven't encountered the safety issues that other parents have noted, perhaps it is due to our application of the swing. We got it as a Christmas gift when our daughter was 14 months, so we haven't ever tried it with an infant. I promptly asked my husband to install it in our barn. My hobby is horses and my daughter loves to swing while I feed and groom them. We sing and play while she's in it, and she really loves it. She's almost two now, and still enjoys spending time in it. We haven't had any safety or durability issues, but ours is hung in a way that's probably different when compared to swingset applications. I couldn't spend any time with my horse without it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING! NOT A SAFE SWING!","review":"We bought this for our daughter when she was 4 months old. She loved to swing in the reclined position. Our daughter has spent many hours in this swing, and we never had any problems, I always thought it was very safe. We will never use this product again. We were pushing our daughter just the other day in this swing, it was in the upright position as she is now 28 months old (23 pounds, well within the limits of the swing). We were not swinging her high or dangerously, just pushing her like normal. She leaned forward over the tray, and when the swing swung back, it flipped upside down. Thank goodness we were right there next to her and caught her, I don't want to even think what would have happened had she fallen headfirst out of the swing. Do not buy this swing...we used it safely for over 2 years, then out of the blue it just flipped upside down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twin boys LOVE this swing!","review":"We have 10 month old twins-one very active, the other more laid back and not crawling yet-both are VERY different in their current growing stages. Although they are quite different, they BOTH love this swing! We bought two of these swings from Toys R US (cost 2.00 more in the store than online- not sure why but SO glad we found them in the area-no other store had them) Very easy to install on swing set, great secure seat belts -but still easy enough to get them in and out of the swing. The table adds a more secure environment for them as well as very NICE to have for snacks or for the twins to hold on to. The recliner slider on back of seat is easy to adjust and GREAT to have as one twin prefers to sit up, while the other prefers to lay back. Also, one twin quite larger than the other making this swing great for little and chubby alike!"},{"rating":"1","title":"t-bar swings are better","review":"I had bought this swing and returned it the next day. Everyone on the block has the old model of the swing with the t-bar, and that is what I wanted. I put my son who was 7 months old in it, buckled him up, and I felt like he was going to fall out or end up dangling somehow. He had figured out how to get the stationary swing to move when it wasn't on, by moving himself forward and backward. Also fisher price thinks the snack tray is a benefit, but it really isn't. You are supposed to feed your child while they are sitting still. What if the baby chokes while they are swinging and eating? I think the directions even say not to leave your child unattended and to only have food when the swing is still."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it...","review":"My daughter loves this swing.

And if you have a very short tree. Very short. :)The swing we received has ropes that are two [very] different lengths, and like previous reviewers mentioned, they are crimped so that they cannot be fixed. Also, as I mentioned, your tree branch would have to be VERY low to the ground for this swing to work at all. Perhaps it is meant more for use on play swing set structures, but I have seen many of these swings (or similar ones) hanging from trees in my neighborhood, so I assumed it would work. Should not have assumed, obviously. Good luck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Toddler swing","review":"It's a great product . The kids love it. Must have supervision!. Gave two as gifts.

I recently purchased this swing for my 6 month old son. It looked safe enough at first glance, however it is not stable, even when used with a swing set that provides an even and balanced support surface. My 6 year old daughter was gently swinging my son (under parental supervision thank goodness) when he leaned back, suddenly tipping the swing UPSIDE DOWN! Had I not been standing right there my son would have fallen several feet to the ground as there are no shoulder harnesses for this swing. I can assure you that this swing was installed properly by their every safety direction, but still failed miserably to perform as it should. PLEASE DO NOT BUY this swing! Look for one that utilizes the shoulder harness feature at least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun until it flips","review":"Watch out for it flipping upside down. I have this swing and the Little Tikes one (both similar design), and whilst the Little Tikes one seems very stable in terms of keeping the kids upright, this Fisher Price one has tipped my kids upside-down on a few occasions. When they are swung far back, if happen to lean forward just before they start coming back forward again, this is when it seems to lose balance and leave them suspended head down. Thankfully the safety straps and the tray table HAVE remained in place to hold them in. If you do buy this item, I would recommend you make sure it is mounted high enough so that they didn't hit their head if they end up swinging upside down and freaking out. Supervise. And follow Fisher Price's caution of having it above a soft surface (eg chipbark or something)."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great swing!","review":"We love this swing! So does 6 month old Jake! He sits in it and just swings away! When his average size 3 year old cousin came over, she decided she wanted to swing, so her older cousins helped her in it and pushed her back and forth and she loved it! The swing has held up very well! The only thing that is kind of difficult about this is getting the yellow part off to get an older and bigger child out. This is probably a good thing, though, so that a child cannot fall out. We have it attached to our back porch. Swinging in this has provided lots of smiles from our little boy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for us","review":"I bought this swing for my 10 month old. Even though she loves swings we used this one only 2 times. First of all, if your child is more on a chubby side, it will be very hard to put her in or take her out of the swing. Also, there is someting sharp under the little tray. I still can't find what it is, but when I picked my daughter out of the swing, something scratched her and now she is afraid to come even close to it. Maybe we just had bad luck, but we are definitly not going to use this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Concerned Parent","review":"My husband and I purchased this swing for our 14 month old daughter. At first we liked it, but yesterday we changed our minds. Our daughter can unbuckle the belt. We are very concerned about this. If she can do it what is stopping an older child from doing this and getting hurt. Thank God my husband was standing there or she may have fallen out. I called the company and they said they would refund our money after they got the swing. Please if you own this swing, don't leave your child alone. I am hoping Fisher Price will recall it and do something about this problem. We are going out this weekend and look for a new swing. Please Please watch your kids.

Not only are some of the answers wrong, but in some cases the information completely contradicts itself. I've read several certification books from many different publishers, so I believe I have a good idea of what a well written book is, and this isn't a well written book. I wouldn't suggest it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"The content is nicely presented. Real life problems are discussed in detail.

Up until now, I would have continued purchasing Osborne books. However, this book is VERY poorly written. There are blatant grammatical errors, and many of the sentences are so poorly written that, at times, my friend (who is an MCDBA) could not understand some of the concepts that the author was attempting to illustrate. If you are looking for good books to study for 070-228, you should definitely look elsewhere!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Its ok. Not bad, not great...just \\"ok\\".","review":"I used this book to prepare for the SQL 2000 test (70-228) and it seemed like it was a very informative book. That is until you actually begin to use what you get from the book against whats in the test. The book doesn't cover quite a bit of material that is on the test, and gives you very minimal information about other things. It does cover replication quite well, and it has good information on setting up jobs/alerts/DTS/etc... It's a big book, but the vast majority of it is \\"filler\\" that uses overly complicated descriptions and LOTS of screenshots to walk you through tasks. Also, the included CD is useless. It has an a copy of the book on CD, and ONE sample test with just 45 questions (many of them from inside the book). I just passed the test with a 950, but thats only after I used several other resources to fill in the many gaps. Overall 2 1/2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs Improvement","review":"If you are new to SQL server and want to know the basics of the application then this books if your you. If you want to pass the exam however then I suggest you look else where. The material is too simplistic and there are too much typo errors.

A complete waste of money, avoid this book like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't compete with many other better books","review":"There are better books to buy.This book is too simplisitic to be of much help with the exam.

David certainly sets the standard for a first works. Definitely a winner. His genuine mastery with swordsmanship is obvious in the battles and provides a great deal of realism not normally found in many of today's \\"Contemporary\\" authors.

I look forward to reading his next book \\"Immortal Blade\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sosarme: wonderful Handel","review":"This two-CD set has apparently been released for some time, but is new to me. It affords the superb American soprano Julianne Baird yet another wonderful opportunity to shine as this country's pre-eminent Handel soprano, and the bonus of internationally recorded tenor John Aler as her partner is a real coup. This coupled with the knowing leadership of Handel veteran conductor Johannes Somary, who was unearthing works by this great baroque master long before the Hogwoods and McGegans got in on the act, makes for a terrific listening experience. And, oh yes, there's a dynamite Italian Handelian score as well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"more than one line, many views","review":"This is a tentet, larger than a combo smaller than the full orchestra he used on the earlier Black Saint classics \\"Blu Blu Blu\\" and \\"Hearinga Suite\\". Abrams uses a large sonic pallette including harp, accordion and violin in addtion to standard reeds/brass to explore a variety of group texture, tone colour and space. Some quieter tracks \\"Hyperdepth\\" and the title cut seem developmental, scored material mixed with open, abstract improvisations, others deploy complex charts featuring individual solos like the rhyhmically powerful compositions \\"11 over 4\\" and \\"The Prism 3\\", drummer Reggie Nicholson's seething cross rhythms cook on this one.the last cut \\"Ensemble Song\\" is collective improv + text ending on a earthy piano/trumpet duet over a basic blues. Another fine disc by a contemporary master composer player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating Read","review":"Wonderful telling of the life of the last true Habsburg emperor. Although the author allows you to be sympathetic to Francis Joseph, he makes no excuses for his shortcomings as emperor as well. I bought this book as a guide for an upcoming trip to Austria and eastern Europe. It not only made me look forward to my trip but with the historical events that I got from this book in mind, I had a deeper perspective of the many sights that I visited on my trip.

Nice to see him working with some jazz elements for a change too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Personal career strategy tool","review":"I love the COMPASS tool. As a career development consultant, I like the creative way that the tool can help people with their personal career strategizing by looking at multiple angles/issues that are involved in the career/transition process. It's easy to use, clear directions, and very fun and creative because of the visual focus of the tool. For folks wanting to do some right brain strategizing about career directions, this is the tool to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT IN STOCK","review":"My class starts today and still no book is available to purchase.

There is a great balance of the Austen-like restraint we expect and the interesting, passionate thoughts of Darcy that we don't get from the original. This is worth the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Confession of Fitzwilliam Darcy","review":"This was a narrative from Darcy's point of view and was it was not well done. I have read better P&P variations from Darcy's point of view. The story dragged and was not that interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh version of Darcy's perspective","review":"Pride and Prejudice retold through the eyes of Mr. Darcy. I love seeing what other authors will do when it comes to Mr. Darcy.The beginning was a bit slow and Darcy was pretty boring and broodish and arrogant. But by the middle it was starting to get pretty good. I liked hearing his thoughts, but I thought she rushed the book a bit and left out details I would have liked to known. She just gave brief summaries of what he was doing when he wasn't with Elizabeth...so I would've liked to have seen and heard and experienced what he was doing. That's why I really enjoyed the Fitzwilliam Darcy Gentleman Series by Pamela Aidan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Misprint","review":"I was really excited to read Darcy's viewpoint, but then realized that the last 3 chapters of the book were a repeat of chapters 11, 12, and 13. So, I couldn't even finish the book. I really liked what I read up to, but was so disappointed to find that the book was a bad misprint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother!","review":"Basically an awful retelling of Pride and Prejudice with hardly anything new to add, and definitely nothing new of consequence or interest to add. Not worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Romp!","review":"Fitzwilliam Darcy speaks! He is hilarious in his weaknesses and delightfully confused as he awkwardly and resentfully awakens to the reality of his own, and his family's, glaring limitations. The expressions and sentiments resonate as genuine and the characters, though lightly drawn, are themselves. Darcy blusters, stumbles, and finally begins to right himself as we experience the eternally fascinating dynamics of P&P - from his point of view. Charming! My thanks to the author for her delicate handling of the P&P story and characters and for entertaining me with his foibles while still allowing me to admire and love Mr. Darcy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Confessions of a spin-off junky:","review":"Granted I had just read two VERY POORLY written P&P spin-offs shortly before reading this one...therfore; my review may be slightly colored. Yet, I declare it was pleasantly mild and entertaining. It will not suit those searching for the steamy details of a true-love marriage, and it will not sate the appetites of those who feel the need to find some psychological or sociological deviance in the beloved characters... which may be exactly WHY it provided such a breath of fresh air for me. It was a quick and enjoyable extension of a story I love. The characters were not perfectly upheld (who but Jane herself could truly do them justice?), and there was not much of climax to the story. But a nice visit with old \\"friends\\" in a style that was not unpleasant to read. Best of all this is truly an extension of the book, not one of the movies (especially the K.Knightly version which is hardly a true retelling in itself)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Followed Jane Austen's story line very well...","review":"I really enjoyed this simple version of Mr Darcy telling the story himself. The author didn't create a storyline outside of the original, which I appreciated. I enjoyed reading Mr Darcy's own account of his feelings and emotions during his revelation of a world outside his own immediate circle. This is a very believable account of Darcy's struggle to overcome his prejudice and eventually win Elizabeth's love. I totally enjoyed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jane Austen Lovers Think Carefully","review":"This was an unimaginative book, which just rearranges many of Austen's memorable lines. Somewhat boring, even for Darcy fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"STAY AWAY!!!!","review":"It would be great if you had negative stars for this one.

So, one minute I enjoy the chatter about worsted weight versus sport weight yarn and in another moment, I laugh out loud at the discussion of \\"hot dishes\\" (called casseroles by the rest of us in the USA).Ferris is improving with each episode. In this book, Betsy keeps having scary \\"accidents\\" and can't figure out why someone would be out to get her. We, the readers, know of course. It's fun to follow the twists and turns as Betsy figures out what's up. Catching the culprit is almost an anti-climax.A fun read with lots of snow and Christmas for atmosphere.

More recently, it has even outpaced such newer contributors as Kim & Mauborgne, Collins and Kaplan & Norton. I knew I was reading a well-rounded strategy book when Mr. Raynor explains that he paid as much attention to failed strategies as he did to successful strategies (as Rosenzweig did in \\"The Halo Effect\\"). But, I believe he nailed it when he clarified that companies shouldn't become overly dependent on performance or risk as much as they should develop a balanced view between pro-action and reaction (i.e. strategic focus and flexibility are not mutually exclusive). Mr. Raynor's approach is clear, easy-to-read and well researched - a refreshing departure from typical trade books. His solid writing style acts as a great foundation to get out the new word on executing strategy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly Academic. Highly Acclaimed. Little value.","review":"The Strategy Paradox is a waste of your money and time! I do not know why this book has received such popular acclaim. Michael Raynor is extremely \\"academic\\" and seems to possess little knowledge of the real business world. He repeatedly misuses words in the English language, including \\"profound\\", \\"robust\\", and \\"ecosystem\\". Raynor attempts to impress his readers by talking about quantum physics, game theory, and natural selection but instead he confuses them. Raynor seems to write with an air of authority that few people could have about the subject, and than concludes the book with a philosophical lesson on the value of \\"humility\\". Raynor, take your own advice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Key Concepts Make it Worth Buying","review":"I enjoyed The Strategy Paradox, and have added it to the Pearls of Wisdom page on my site. Powerful concepts in the hands of enlightened leaders, particularly those leading large organizations:1. Extreme strategies do not come without risk2. You don't have to predict the future to be successful3. Divide responsibility for strategy formulation by time horizons4. Give your organization a chance to adapt and succeed in the most likely future scenarios through options not commitmentIn my mind if you get come away from a business book with one or more useful insights, then it was more than worth the time invested.

It's hard to believe that anyone with a firm grasp of the history of the last 250 years of Western culture would find this book anything more than a diversion worthy of maybe a couple of arguments in the pub.

Wes is a masterful songwriter, and has perhaps released his best work yet with this one. To say John Wesley Harding is easily one of the best and most talented singer/songwriters out today is not an overstatement. My wife and I are looking forward to yet more great releases from Wes, as well as catching him live. Here's to you Wes!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in Trimec Plus versus plain Trimec","review":"Very Disappointing! I have used regular Trimec many times over the years and it killed the dandelions, crab grass, clover etc very very well. However I was sold the Trimec Plus by mistake and I didn't notice the difference until I had it opened and ready to use. Unfortunately even though I use this product at the same time of year I used the regular Trimec but the PLUS did not perform well at all and I will need to redo the application."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work at all","review":"The local feed & seed recommended this as a generic version of Round Up, saying that in about three days all my weeds would be gone and my Bermuda grass would be able to take over. 4 days later not a single weed or other grass shows any signs of damage.

The set could have been done in someones basement, and it looks like the actors had one run through before they filmed it. At times the routine is simple, but at a few times, they do very advance positions. Also, The guy in charge doesn't explain which sex muscles the positions are building, which is kinda why you are watching this in the first place. Overall, this is a yoga tape not quite for beginners or advanced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Grade Video Quality","review":"This video both sounded and looked very amature. The sound had a lot of echo, definitely not created in a studio. At one point you could even hear someone talking out in the hall. The video quality looks like it was shot with a for home vhs video camera. The editing was also poor. This reminded me of a home made video. Most of the workout was very easy and basic, with two difficult moves thrown in. I'm glad I got this video first, because if the rest of his videos are as low quality as this one, I wouldn't want to waste my money. He does speak very fast throughout the video. And if you are looking for at least a hot guy to watch working out, you won't find him on here. If you're serious about some good yoga workouts that are worth doing, I highly recommend Bryan Kest Power Yoga first and Baron Baptiste second."},{"rating":"2","title":"frank is good.","review":"you have to really hear him read if you ever have the chance.his voice makes the poems a million more times real. when i read them now... all i can think of is the colour red when i reflect. they are very strong and he has a command of language that is moving."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tepid Boogaloo Joe","review":"The way to go with Boogaloo Joe is to buy the Legends of Acid Jazz Vol. 1 compilation. That stuff is smokin'. This one has its moments, but is uniformly less fun than the Legends compilation. Some of the cover versions of then/formerly-popular songs are dangerously close to elevator music (especially \\"He's So Fine\\" & \\"My Love\\"). Also, a couple of the slow ones get way too slow for this kind of thing. \\"First Time Ever I Saw Your Face,\\" a great (& slow) Roberta Flack song, seems interminable.

The song 'Witches Dance' sounds like a Leatherstrip demo from the 80's. This album is a perfect example of why people are sick of Industrial music; it is cliched, boring, and totally lacking any imagination. There is only so much one can do without evolving before becoming redundant. Wumpscut is obsolete. If he were to make an effort to build on what he has accomplished then it would mean something again and be a step in the right direction. This album is not it. Look for 'Black Light Twilight' or 'Faith In Motion' by INDEX, instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good compilation","review":"This cd is really good, actually better than I expected. I like all of the tracks, but 'Outside' is an exceptionally beautiful piece, and 'escape'. 'Deadmaker' was not as good as I thought it would be, I thought it would be a very exciting, different song, but instead it is repetitive, but NOT as repetitive as 'witches' dance'. I like that song to an extent, but you don't want to listen to the whole thing... It gets old fast. 'I want you', despite the porno audio clip, is a brilliant song. I love it, maybe the clip is just proving the 'maturity' in Rudy's genius."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rudy in a creative crisis?","review":"This definitely is the weakest :Wumpscut: record so far. His previous output Embryodead like Eevil Young Flesh did not revolutionize EBM, but at least it was heavy, evil and violent. EYF is none of this. The lyrics (like always) are placative, the groove is poor and the ballad \\"Sag es jetzt\\" causes pain in my ears because of the gothic-like female vocals and the far too simple music. But there are some (yet few) really good songs on the CD, like \\"Flucht\\" and \\"Zerstoerte Traeume\\", which I am sure will be played in EBM-Clubs regularly. But the new :W: definitely lacks the aggressiveness, the groove and the ability to create a gloomy atmosphere which he had in former times. And there is absolutely NOTHING on this record which we haven't heard on other records earlier. Remember, Rudy: Wer zu sp?t kommt, den bestraft das Leben."},{"rating":"1","title":"one long gripe","review":"Sometimes, after a rough day at work, it's nice to come home to your spouse and just gripe about all the idiots that flushed your day down the toilet. That's what this book reads like; one long, nine-year complaint. If this guy was my husband and I had to listen to this garbage at the end of every day, it would be nearly impossible not to tell him to suck it up and just work like everybody else has to. Any chance at humor is overwhelmed by his negative attitude and abundant use of profanity.

As Halpin steps up the ladder he goes from a soft student teacher to a hard inner-city educator. There are many situations which will make you laugh, and others that will make you want to never go to school again. Halpin also touches on the fact that there really are A LOT of \\"bad\\" teachers out there. This is an excellent book for anyone to read - parents, students, new teachers and experienced teachers.

There are many current and coming GameCube games that would have benefited from online play but none of them will. To Nintendo's credit some games do support LAN play, but that requires multiple GameCubes and TV's hooked up together in a single location, an unlikely scenario.

And then follow up with slitting your wrists? Yes, we all would - because she's the most vacuous excuse for a filmic character in the history of cinema! The dead boyfriend has more screen-presence!The film blows!Montaigne suggests that two passes are required for a difficult author, but no more than this...I gave the film three viewings, and to paraphrase Montaigne, it's no longer a problem with me, the problem is with the film, the director, the actors, and the sound-man - also, the BBC must take a hit for this atrocious production (you actually funded this $#@^?)The film blows!Have I made myself clear?To conclude and reiterate: The film blows!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I found this film to be one of the most baffling and off-putting pieces of cinema I've ever seen. The beginning is intriguing enough, as Morvern discovers her dead boyfriend and decides to go on living in their apartment with his corpse in plain view. She reads a note he leaves for her on his computer, along with a manuscript of a novel of his. The movie could go in a multitude of directions after this, but this character sucks the life out of the movie. I had trouble staying awake and keeping my sanity during viewing it. And funnily enough, this seemed exactly like the kind of movie I would usually go for--quirky, independent, different. The problem seems to be that the director attempts to show us how Morvern becomes unhinged and lost after her boyfriend's suicide, but the movie itself becomes meaningless and without an anchor or any grounding. It too is lost.Do yourself a favor and avoid this like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why the fuss?","review":"This film is definitely not a masterpiece. I found it incredibly dry and incomprehensibly over-rated. Yes, the film was bleak but inexplicably bleak. To make matters worse, the main character seems to resolve her numbness almost out of nowhere. Perhaps I missed something gigantic because I was trying not to fall asleep while watching this drag on but I would not attempt to see it again. However, there were a couple of memorable scenes.I would strongly advise renting it before purchase.

In fact you can be quite intelligent and educated and well versed in foreign films and hate this movie.

Sometimes my favorite parts in movies are the quiet one's. Movies with great moments of silence are great if they're necessary. Unfourtunately, while i appreciated the quiet introspection, i could not tolerate a whole movie like that. I will say Morvern Callar has a great opening, one that makes you wonder.

Nothing was gained or lost, or learned.I cant recommend this to any one, unless you have to see every movie ever made."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor sound, no subtitles","review":"I could not understand the dialogue on the dvd. It was mixed too low and the British slang and accent made it impossible to understand.

You probably won't know which side you'll be on unless you see it yourself.I most definitely am in the love camp. Others have already summarized the plot here, so I won't do that. I will tell you that for me, this was one of those rare movies that made me look at the world differently when I emerged from the theatre. Though the subject matter is grim, the movie managed to convey a great appreciation for the beauty in the world, and after watching it, I was more in touch with that myself.A previous reviewer mentioned having a \\"hangover\\" after this movie.

The director does not appear to be able to commit to any particular scene or mood. There are scores of scenes where Ms. Morton appears to have been directed to just \\"do anything while I pan the camera over you.\\" The one potentially interesting development of the plot, Morvern's sale of her dead boyfriend's novel manuscript, ends up leading nowhere. There are brilliant, unconventional films where the visual fabric dominates the conventional storylines, and then there are films like this that get by on being so jarring and pretentious that viewers are afraid to say it sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Credit for acting but not for much else","review":"The cast is quite good in this film, and perhaps some of the music, but the rest of it is unfocused, plodding, and trying to look artsy and mesmerizing by having no sound at all in the early scenes and then showing the main character examining twigs or windows or other things, as if it were meaningful to do so.It's also impossible to be interested in the protagonist, who disposes of her suicidal boyfriend's body after leaving it in their flat for a while so she can go out and party for the sake of distraction. Then she replaces his name on his novel with hers, gets it accepted and gets the money and credit that should have gone to him.Later, she drags her best friend out of a hotel in Spain, gets them lost in the wilderness and then abandons her pal.Sheesh!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't compare to original","review":"This is a pale imitation of the original cast recording.

He has destroyed his family by using his wealth to kidnap his daughter from her loving mother using the court system as his weapon of choice. He claims in court to be \\"BROKE\\" and therefore cannot afford the $60 dollars per hour to allow his daughter to spend time with her mom. How can he be \\"killing it\\" in this market while claiming in a court of law to be broke? Michael Parness only tells half the story. He has kept his daughter away from her mom for more than eight years; taking her while she was still being nursed by her mom and then seperating her from her other sister. I have watched this mother, with no money, fight for the rights of her children to spend time together and to no avail. He has been relentless and his attorney a lying shark to do everything to seperate these children from their loving mother. Before you do business with him, know who he really is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"First of all, this book is (or was) available for free through ads on various financial web sites. However, once Parness and/or the Trendfund people get your personal information, they will hound you with high-pressure phone calls attempting to get you to commit to becoming \\"a partner\\". The shtick is similar to tactics used by penny stock mongers and various scamsters who rely on the phone and finely crafted scripts to manipulate others into sending them money.Michael Parness does have a compelling story. However, you have to ask yourself: If this guy is really that good at \\"power trading\\", why does he and/or his associates need to use high-pressure sales tactics to generate income from others?"},{"rating":"1","title":"TREND FRAUD!","review":"Once again, the much heralded and much hyped about January Effects list was a bust out! Parness got many lambs to join his service once again, and after all was said and done the list LOST one more time and the lambs were slaughtered again! Way to go WAXMAN! What amazes me is so many people actually fell for the scam once again! Parness claimed he made a fortune, but that is because he bought before he gave his reccomendations out and sold into the buying frenzy he created, while never telling anyone where he sold. I have already alerted the SEC to this, and hopefully he will get what he deserves which is arrested, fined and put in JAIL. Save yourself the money and go buy a book from a real trading teacher like Van Tharp.

It is made up of four chapters and an introduction. The text is heavily footnoted but, fortunately, they appear at the bottom of the page.

Often, it isn't quite clear just what he is getting at because of his continual use of metaphor. After the reader gets used to it, however, the writing takes on a charming -feeling-, and the style is familiar and expected.He paints vivid, full-sensual portraits of scenery and characters, going as far as to describe scents and lighting highlights, the fog and atmosphere, the sweat in peoples' hair, et cetera.The mystery isn't over-complex, but isn't quite simple, either. This book (like Burke's others) are not just about the murder mystery, theyre a story told about characters. And you want to keep reading, even after the book is over, to \\"keep in touch\\" with the cahracters he has created and richly portrayed.Burke is one of the better mystery authors writing today. This is a great book, but certainly none of his should be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely the best!","review":"I don't know anyone who tops James Lee Burke for excellence in crime fiction; his characters, their development from book to book, the relationships, the dialogue, the humor, the setting, the language - as far as I am concerned, he is absolutely at the top of his class.

I love the settings of his books although I have never been to New Iberia Parish or even Louisiana. No one can describe a sunset or bayou like James.How can you not like Dave Robicheau? He isn't one of the fancy detectives. He struggles with his problems like the rest of us.The confederate part was a bit odd but it did not play a large part in the book. I rate most of his books \\"excellent\\" and this is no exception."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding Novel, Burke Delivers","review":"Mr. Burke's novels are always a pure pleasure to read, and this one is no exception.

The detective's conversations with the civil war general were especially good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dave Robicheaux goes Hollywood - almost","review":"The interplay between Dave's past acquaintence with Julie and the present really makes Dave a real person. The feeling of being torn between pity for Julie (the way he was treated as a kid) and hatred for the murdering crime boss Julie has become.

A great example that shows how a Christian can love the poor and care for them while not neglecting eternal matters and boldly proclaiming the message of salvation in Christ as the foremost priority. The phrase \\"so heavenly minded and no earthly good\\" is proven wrong by the great eternal AND earthly benefit of Miss Pullinger's mission. This book is both exciting in action and deep in its content.

I was able to get most of the stains out but some I couldn't. I hope it will come out. Perhaps I was not using them properly, but I haven't used them in hot weather so the ink didn't melt, and I don't know what else would cause them to stain.

Most of Chen's research spans around the Northern dialects such as Wu as they exhibit some of the most interesting and complex sandhi phenomena of all the Chinese dialects.

On the flip side, Southern dialects such as Cantonese are virtually untouched by sandhi and have rich tone inventories inside and across word boundaries and have preserved much of the flavor of Middle Chinese.All in all an excellent read for serious scholars of Chinese languages.

There is not enough information in the book to make it truly useful. Readers interested in Japanese manufacturing methods had best go elsewhere. In general, \\"lean methods\\" don't work in the US simply because of cultural differences which are very important to sustaining/implementing \\"lean\\" and because American companies often use \\"lean manufacturing\\" as a euphemism for \\"downsizing\\".

Within the first 2 week both of our handles broke, the little magnet for the nail set fell out and the stupid little skull fell off. I took the hammer back to the store where I purchased it and was told that the manufacturer will only cover a cracked head. So they glued the nail set back in and I installed a new handle. Back in business, yeah right! Another broken handle and the nail set fell out again. So far I have replaced 3 handles and I lost count of the little nail set magnets, but I have learned that Gorilla Glue works the best.

The Arcturians are the Master Builders of energy, of connectedness and of healing resources. And they are the designers of the prolific spate of Crop Circles emerging all over the world every year at harvest time. I can only guess that back in 1997 there were very few of us aware of what 2012 held in terms Earth's Ascension and how that would impact our own evolution into the 5th dimension of consciousness.

Maya who loves and yet hates what Ilan is to her, what he evokes from her, the depths to which she's allowed herself to go because of him and yet when he's gone, the darkness isn't and she's left to confront and process her own part in the trauma he's wrought in her life.The book is beautiful in a completely unique way, the writing is wonderful, the story is haunting and gut wrenching.

It consists of a very eclectic collection of short essays that I think can be illuminating in a myriad of class settings: science, critical thinking, philosophy, math, and journalism, to name some.By its nature, however, it can be somewhat redundant. Also, the point of a good number of the essays seemed elusive at first reading. I found a lot of his footnotes more interesting and worthy of further discussion, and would've liked them to become expanded into their own essay.Besides the print media, his criticism and advice can be suitably applied to the electronic media and beyond."},{"rating":"2","title":"An old but still good book","review":"This book has been written before the Internet era. So the author talks about the newspaper and other ways to receive news, but no Internet. However the underlying mathematics is still valid if you extrapolate it for the Internet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and instructive","review":"A very well written book, both interesting and instructive. Full of common sense, the author provides a plethora of reports commonly found in almost any newspaper, and highlights errors of facts, of inferences from bad assumptions, of statements supported by little or no evidence, of our poor grasp of probabilities of events, and of much else. An excellent read that will make us more critical in our reading of newspapers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who would have thought a Mathematics book could entertain?","review":"Strangely enough (or so one might think) I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I even caught myself chuckling aloud a few times. A Mathematician Reads the Newspaper de-mystifies the role Math plays in our everyday lives, and sheds a little (much needed) clarity on many of the \\"truths\\" behind the statistics we hear about all the time. I highly encourage anyone (even self proclaimed or closet mathematophobes) to read this book. It teaches a little, encourages a little, explains a little, and entertains a lot"},{"rating":"1","title":"the Voice of Poet Robert Frost","review":"Well to be honest and to be fair to the poetry, Robert Frost may write well but his presentation is disappointing, also I was a bit disappointed with the selection. this is definitely one case where one was purchasing a pig in a poke had i heard and seen the segments i would not have bothered.marie ryanthat is not to say another maybe more erudite person might love both the selection and presentation."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed","review":"I rented the CD at the local library and could not wait to get home and play it. Was I ever disappointed! I could not get over the poor sound quality. It sounded like Mr. Frost was sitting in a huge room, far from the microphone, recording his wonderful poetry into a cheap cassette tape recorder. Really, he was too old to record (poor vocal quality) and in my opinion, he read too fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"Frost has never been one of my favourite poets / writers, though I do read and enjoy him and appreciate a lot of his work constitutes a landmark in 20th century literature. In terms of voice I didn't know what to expect. I put the cd in my laptop and my attention was grabbed from the moment he started reciting until the recording was over.

I am always on the look out for recordings of accessible repertoire sung by professionals with sound technical skills. Unfortunately Mr. Guarino's inability to execute the demands of the repertoire at the mp, p, pp dynamic levels denies the music its charm and very purpose for study. (The quality of the audio recording is poor as well.) The music is beautiful, but executed as orignally composed with all dynamics observed, it can be breath-taking. A tragic missed opportunity.

I anticipate we will have the e-z up dome for many years of use. We had previously purchased a screen tent that took nearly an hour to put together and fell apart. We spent about 40 dollars on sale for that piece of junk. The dome takes two people no more than five minutes to fully assemble. When we took back the screen tent we decided to spend the money and get a quality product. The blue dome has survived three camping trips (one in the rain) and several outdoor barbeques. It has also come in handy in the yard overtop the kiddie pool to provide some shade. We plan to purchase the screen for the dome from the manufacturer on their website (costly though). If I could give it 10 stars I would. Oh and by the way, the storage case it comes with fits it perfectly.

Anne Butler (who also writes excellent textile books as Anne Morrell) here shows that the laborious preliminaries of design are unnecessary; that a child properly directed can work freely and creatively at once. Aimed at children aged up to thirteen, the book deals with fabrics, threads, stitches, embroidery pictures, the use of materials, and three-dimensional embroidery. The quality of the examples reproduced shows how successful this approach can be. Teachers and parents will value the book as a source of stimulus and guidance towards the production of comparable embroidery by the children for whom they are responsible. At the time of writing, Anne Butler, now Professor Morrell, was Head of the Embroidery School at Manchester College of Art and Design. Her pioneering work in this field is unmatched."},{"rating":"1","title":"sloppy work","review":"The guy who wrote this obviously isn't a true Bama or Auburn fan. Too many small factual errors, and its obvious that some of his write-ups were based purely on the box stats rather than having watched the game or even talked to someone who saw it. For example, he writes about Auburn's 31-27 win in 1996 without mentioning the late Alabama drive that almost won the game on the last play. He also doesn't seem to have paid much attention to these two teams generally. For example, he writes that Bama beat Tennessee in 2000, and ended the year 5-6, when my beloved Tide lost to the Vols and ended a miserable 3-8. I saw similar mistakes about Auburn's history. But it is a comprehensive review of the entire series, and it has a summary at the end showing the scores of all Bama and Auburn games from the 19th century through 2000. I can't recommend buying it, but if you get it as a gift, like I did, its worth flipping through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my Favorite","review":"I have recently become a huge fan of Kristin Hannah and have been reading everything I can find of hers. I love her character development and the layers in her story telling. BUT I was left looking for something else in Angel Falls. I found it almost boring. The whole secrets and lies and undying love and dedication was over the top and unrealistic. I felt like she was grasping to make it 'juicy' and it just fell short! One of my least favorites by her."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Touching Story","review":"This book brings Mikayla's life into the open. She is a loving wife with two children and known throughout the small town of Angel Falls. She suffers from a head injury and goes into a coma.

The only word she says is \\"Jules\\" and her husband figures out, with the help of her mother and a dress he found in her closet, that she was once married to movie star Julian True. At the end of his ideas, he calls Julian, hoping he will remember her and come to visit her and be able to awake her. The family is tested as Mikayla has to choose which life she will return to and where her love and loyalty lie. Her husband's love never ceases and he put himself on the line for her, but will it end in her leaving him behind?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Angel Falls","review":"Depressing novel about wife in a coma.

Given the choice between reading this and licking a Chicago transient's backside, I highly suggest the latter course of action. Fully given from a feminized point of view, the plot unfolds in expectation that years of a wife lying to her husband should and will be easily forgiven. Highly unrealistic and socially dangerous feminist sentiment abounds in this novel, cover to cover. Men are soulless, accepting drones. Women get away with whatever they choose.

First, the movie star guy was so awful and two-dimensional that I couldn't figure out why the heroine EVER fell in love with him in the first place. (So I lost respect for her.) I had the same problem with the \\"hero\\" in Ms. Hannah's HOME AGAIN. He was never redeemed in my eyes and quite frankly, I didn't care if he got a heart transplant and lived or not. I also thought the conflict in this book didn't really start until Michaela woke up from the coma, then the book ended too quickly. I think the writing was very good, but the book needed more genuine sentiment and less sentimentality. I did love Dr. Liam and also loved the main message of the book which is that true love isn't the fireworks, but the glowing embers that can last a lifetime."},{"rating":"2","title":"ANGEL FALLS","review":"This is a fantastic read. It will make you laugh and make you cry. It pulls at your heart strings. When Mikaela gets injured and goes into a coma her family all has to learn to deal with it in their own way. Its what Liam finds out and the decision he has to make that could make or break this family. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her finest effort","review":"Coincidentally, I read ANGEL FALLS consecutively with Barbara Delinsky's COAST ROAD, so maybe it wasn't a fair contrast, but both novels deal with virtually identical themes, a wife/mother who lies unconscious in a hospital. How the women get to the hospital differ, yet that's just a detail; the exploration of the impact of the enormity of their illnesses on their families, and the uncertainty as to whether each woman will survive, are absolutely the same. Delinsky's characters were far more believable and sympathetic--even, in the case of COAST ROAD, the self-absorbed ex-husband. Her characters evolved in response to their crisis. Again in contrast, the most intriguing plot point in ANGEL FALLS, the hidden first marriage of the heroine, could have, should have, been explored with far more information and interest. Fans of Kristin Hannah may be disappointed in this eagerly awaited novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book.","review":"Sorry but this bookwa boring and slow.

The symbol descriptions are brief and include both the psychological and mystical meanings. Having studied both, I'll say that they are accurate enough. The introductory chapters cover the basics of dreams and dreaming in simple terms for the beginner.

Six people having sex through most of it (no, not all together) but heard and seen by others, in a snowbound mansion, a supposed crime scene which fizzles out to nothing, lots of talk about how cold it is inside because the electricity is off yet hot showers are taken a surprising number of times, a supposedly large, active spider in a huge web outside a door in a frigid snowstorm and threats of bears getting them if they go out at night.

I think the movie would have been more successful had it been called \\"Pretty Boys\\" instead. That's the point of this movie anyway. The point surely wasn't to entertain or to scare people.

It's less than B grade, but still has a few good moments. Very few.

And not because it's bad. To me, movies are NEVER so bad they're good; if they're bad, they're just bad. This one is amateurish and dumb, but it's also sexy and fun.

The acting was high schoolish at best. The actors gave the impression of remembering their lines before they spoke. The settings were the same ones with different angles or even close up shots. really no imagination to the sets. There was very little interaction with the people of the supposed town and so that gave the impression of the cast being the only ones in the town.Finally the fact that the beautiful bodies get naked was not enough to warrant buying this movie or seeing it.

He is a salesman (excuse me - wealth advisor) for separately managed accounts SO no wonder he hates mutual funds. They are his competition.What could have been an objective discussion of the pros and cons of each degenerates into an infomercial for SMAs and bashing of funds.If you're an investor seeking objective information, look elsewhere. Beware the praise here from other financial salespeople."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slanted at best","review":"The author provides a great example of a Fallacy of Composition argument. An equivalent book on pet ownership would be \\"Stop risking your life on dogs: Cats - The Smart Alternative.\\" This book would then proceed to describe the dangers of owning pit pulls based on real statistics. No mention of low-cost houses (Vanguard, TIAA-CREF, Fidelity) or ETFs, just as no mention of cocker spaniels or poodles in his \\"no dogs\\" book. I guess if you sell managed accounts or cats for a living, this is good marketing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing effort on an interesting topic","review":"Not knowing much about separately managed accounts (SMAs), I got this book to shore up my knowledge. I was not at all satisfied with it. Its central points about the advantages of SMAs over mutual funds could have been made in 20 to 30 pages at the most. However, the author stretches out the main text (not counting appendixes) to 220 pages by repeating himself over and over ad nauseam. I hate to slam an author, but I was actually insulted that Wilkinson wasted my time by putting out such an inferior product. His publisher (Dearborn Trade Publishing) should be ashamed as well. It's time people involved with publishing books on the financial markets take their mission a little more seriously and stop producing such dreck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weigh the risks and the rewards","review":"On page 16, the author urges the reader to \\"Face Facts\\", noting that, \\"A mutual fund portfolio that loses 25 percent in a single year needs to return 33 percent to get back to where it was at the beginning of the decline.\\" Umm, that's not unique to mutual funds. If I own four cars and one is stolen, a decline of 25%, I will have three cars left. Replacing the fourth car represents a 33% gain (one divided by the three remaining cars). Mutual funds certainly have drawbacks, but like any investment, the investor needs to weigh the risks against the rewards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book's thesis is nonsensical","review":"Wilkinson spends most of the book deriding mutual funds and selling the idea that (if you are already wealthy) you should place your investable assets in seperately managed accounts. Strangely, the reasons he uses to slam mutual funds apply equally to SEPs.Wilkinson blames high fees, incompetent or corrupt fund managers, and investor ignorance for mutual funds' supposed poor performance. His answer? Invest your money in your own account with broker's fees, an account manager to guide you, and your own investment decisions.The audience for this book seem to be people with around $100K to invest, who are savvy enough to handle their own diversification and investment strategy and make sure their broker is on the level, but are unable to track the performance and diversify their mutual fund holdings.If you are wealthy enough to safely follow the ideas in this book, chances are you don't need the advice in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book changed my investment strategy","review":"After perusing this book and researching the merits of this \\"Smart Alternative\\" to Mutual Funds I concluded that there were mostly Pros and very few Cons to rethinking my current investment strategy.

I'm glad to now own this on DVD but wish the transfer were a little better. From Beyond has an excellent transfer, this one is acceptable but nowhere nearly as nice.And for people that would compare a 30+ year old movie to something new, you've got to be crazy. Of course low budget movies from the 80's shouldn't be comparable to new gen movies.

Based on H.P. Lovecraft's work, it's a latter day Frankenstein story that is genuinely scary but it's frights are leavened by superbly macabre humor. Jeffrey Combs is terrifying as psycho-nerd Herbert West obsessed with life even if he as to kill tenfold to achieve it. Barbara Crampton may be the sexiest screen siren you never heard of.

Based on a short story by H.P. Lovecraft, Re-Animator contains all of the essential attributes of a great horror movie. Zombies, severed heads, science experiments, and excessive gore make this an over the top movie; one that went far beyond anything created before it."},{"rating":"2","title":"80's horror hit.","review":"Stuart Gordon's first is a must see. Definitely If your big on horror, If yout not well don't. Great film that's totally over the top but in the way that it should be. It has it's oh s@*t moments. The effects in this movie are great to this day, ofcourse they are. They were never bad effects to begin with. The story is obviously great and is based on H.P Lovecraft's series of stories , Herbert West The Re-Animator. The acting, direction, and cinematography is to die for. I'd say it's a hell of a film premiere. I'd be proud to hail this as my film If I'd directed it. I'm sure Stuart Gordon is. If your into movies like Scanners, The Thing , Return Of The Living Dead, or any of Romero's zombie films check this out. Definitely If your someone who likes vintage horror movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weeeeeessssssstttttttttttttt!","review":"Re-animator is a tour de force of gore and mayhem and is derived from a story by the horror story master H.P.Lovecraft.

See this movie today it will be worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"thrives off its own anarchistic world view","review":"Ghoulish and morally defunct, this finely acted and directed wonder revels in its testing of taste limits.

This movie entertains from start to finish, thanks to great acting, direction, professional work by the crew... Heck, what's to criticize? It's little short of magic that a story like this proceeds merrily along despite scenes that - if you stop to think about them - should be either too repulsive or too ridiculous to keep an audience enthralled.

This movie was incredibly bad. If you want an 80's style version of a Lovecraft movie you'd be far better off with The Unnamable, or you you want a Lovecraft movie truly in keeping with H.P. Lovecraft's work, then go with the recent The Call of Cthulhu.

This version is unrated its not rated R and has all the gore in the movie as well. This is the 86 min version the version the makers of the film wanted. The 96 min version is a joke all thats added in is storyline no gore. The makers cut all that because it was to much story. But if you want to see it its on the second disk under exstended scenes. This movie was never subimitted to the ratings bord. They relesed it unrated becuase they new if they wanted to get a R rating they would of had to cut gore and sexuality out to aviod geting the old X rating they did not want to do that.

A combination of grotesque and camp, the serious questions it raises are buried under an avalanche of hilarity and gore. Herbert West, a medical scientist, arrives at the Miskatonic Medical School to continue his research into bringing the dead back to life. With his glowing green serum, and his talking a fellow student into assisting him, he proceeds to disrupt the school. There is nudity and worse in the ensuing melee.

I finished the film feeling sorely disappointed. Why? Well, as a horror/comedy, it's not very funny, and it's certainly far from frightening. Some moments are no doubt quite manically inspired, and Jeffrey Combs delivers a tour-de-force performance, but sadly, the thing that maintains most interest is either Barbara Crampton's nude scenes or the visual effects. The least this film could have achieved was work as a thrill ride, with some good zombie action, but even at that it's underwhelming. Either go back to Romero's Living Dead series or check out The Return of the Living Dead as a great example of how to mix horror and comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stuff!!","review":"I remember when this 1st came to video here in the UK, great film but sadly, as per usual, CUT!

However, to get up close and personal and to feel the human element involved nothing beats personal narratives. They tend to be more in depth than battle histories. The down side to \\"Trial by Combat\\" is the frustrating sentence structure and punctuation. It is very distracting. The grammar is not the best either.

Reason being that I almost never won when playing a 4 deck or more game. Mr. Thomason's system allowed me to play 6 deck games and walk away a winner in 7 of 10 sessions on my last trip to Vegas. His system makes no claim to being better than card counting even though it out performs the card counting method used in the book. In my past trips, playing as a flat bettor, overall I was probably even of just a little better. This last trip was significantly more profitable. Was it luck or the system? I think the system.

Like the real life artisan company Wingnut, which was responsible for the movie props and costume designs, the toy makers put a significant amount of detail in the clothing and props for these figures, especially Galadriel and Eomer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Philosophy vs. Memoir","review":"Storm of Steel, Junger's more famous WWI memoir, is an excellent book, capturing a young patriotic German's response to trench warfare. It's full of details of daily life in the trenches and has a particularly good passage of his involvement in the Kaiserschlacht offensive. By comparison, Copse 125, only contains a few pages of war memoir. The balance of the book is philosophical tract based on zealous nationalism. If you want to read several hundred pages of why Imperial Germany deserved to win the First World War and rule Europe, well, be my guest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watched the season in 1 weekend!","review":"We are Dexter-fanatics. We hadn't watched the show at all until we heard several different people comment on how good the show is. So, early 2010 we bought seasons 1-3 and watched them rapidly. We couldn't wait for season 4. When we received the box from Amazon with season 4, we knew we had to cancel our weekend plans. Instead, we stayed home and watched the whole season. Knowing we couldn't wait for Season 5 on DVD, which presumably will be Aug. 2011, we went ahead and ordered Showtime so we could watch season 5 as it's happening. It's a sickness, I know, but I don't want the cure....I want Dexter!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Awsome","review":"My husband and I were on the edge of our seats during the whole season. John Lithgow (as always) is AWESOME adversary for Dexter! So many twist and turns you can't imagine...I would highly recommend purchasing, if you have not seen it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Many Coincidences","review":"I was a Dexter die-hard. What a creative show: original, smart dialogue, dark humor, intellectual, thought provoking.Season 4 lost it. It slowly slipped away and fell off the cliff with the surprise (and disappointing) finale.Throughout each season, the viewers have had to deal with some unbelievable coincidences, but you could get by them because the show was so good.The Ice Truck Killer is Dexter's long lost brother and now engaged to his sister??? OK, I'll get by it because the show is too fun to let that drag me down.It's over for me in Season 4. Dexter has too much baggage now. It's piling up and impossible to believe that everything can tie up so perfectly and neatly for him that he evades the law."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't live up - Ruined the series for me","review":"It took half the season to finally get interesting and the season finale... I wish I hadn't watched. I've been a really big fan of the Dexter series and have been recommending it to friends and family for years, but this season was a total disappointment. If you like Dexter, do yourself a favor and watch the first three seasons over again (well worth the time) but skip season 4."},{"rating":"1","title":"Edited and no closed captions?","review":"I love Dexter. It's one of my favorite shows. I had to drop all of my movie channels, Showtime included, because I recently became unemployed. Was happy to find Dexter; but miss the unedited version and being I have a 45% hearing loss I also miss the closed captions. Wish this will get rectified! Otherwise, I love to thank Amazon and Showtime for allowing us fans to view these shows!"},{"rating":"2","title":"F yes","review":"Dexter is one of the best tv shows.

Second season was still amazing, Third season kind of dropped a bit, and I waited to get the fourth season. While it's not quite up to the home run of the original season, it's solidly good.When you finish, HBO has a preview of the first episode of season 5 up online. It gives me the impression that a lot of season 4 was the harbinger of what's to come in season 5, because it blew my socks off, and I wasn't even wearing socks at the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some shows just can't stand editing","review":"I have really enjoyed the show, and am a regular viewer. This episode was a joke, however, as so much of the dialogue was blanked out. It was like listening to a really bad cell phone connection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Highly edited version","review":"There is a notice at the beginning that this version has been edited. I didn't expect it to be edited this much. Lot's of language, etc.If we are authenticated by age and we are purchasing this stuff I don't want the G-rated version! C'mon showtime!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"dexter season 4","review":"I like the series, but the picture quality of this dvd was bad. I expected high definition picture which this was not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Picture quality.","review":"While playing it becomes very pixelated. The picture quality was not great. Plus it was full screen. Said it was wide screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dexter Season 4","review":"Disc two and disc four were duplicate discs. While it was marked \\"Disc 2\\", the content was actually that of Disc 4. A BIG DISAPOINTMENT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dexter!!","review":"Love love love this season! John Lithgow was ah-mazing in this season to the very end! This season has a very shocking end but it was spoiled for me before I even got to see it. But it was still a very good ending nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dexter Rules","review":"I couldn't believe my eyes when I saw this episode.

But if you have a sense of humor that is slightly askew, and if you're bored with the ordinary it's a really good time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dexter Season 4","review":"Season 4 of Dexter was epic!!!! John Lithgow plays the role with such conviction that you'll forgot that he ever played that forgetful role in 3rd rock from the sun.Season 4 equals more drama more bodies and of course more blood!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, Innovative Series","review":"My girlfriend introduced me to Dexter, and I'm not complaining! Sure, Dexter's obsession is being a serial killer, but we all have obsessions. Dexter does a great job of portraying a person and how they balance their life with their addictions. I have seen every episode of Dexter and it is great. The great writing and acting is evident. This show has a great cast and you immediately care about the characters. Michael Hall and Jennifer Carpenter are great and they really hold their own in season four. It is no wonder they are married in real life. This season is a little disturbing than the other seasons, which I LOVE. I am extremely anticipating what season five has to offer. Let's hope season five is not the last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Just started watching Dexter this year. Watched all four seasons. Season four was one of the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Season 4","review":"This was my favorite season so far, but I think I say that every season. I thought John Lithgow was brilliant as Trinity, and I love that there is always a \\"bad\\" serial killer pitted against Dexter's \\"good.\\" There were a few times this season that I couldn't watch because the scenes were too graphic (which isn't surprising for a Showtime series). The scene when Trinity kills with a hammer was one of them.Spoiler alert: I cannot wait to see what happens next season now that Rita is gone. It'll be interesting to see how Dexter copes without her around. I was personally getting a little sick of Dexter with a family, but I did always like Rita and was sad to see her go. All in all, fantastic, unique series that I recommend to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite Season!","review":"Season 4 was my favorite season of Dexter. John Lithgow played his role flawlessly. I thought the suspense in this season played out better than in previous seasons. Sometimes the grisly aspects of the show get to me, but it's entertaining and definitely holds my attention!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Who doesn't love a grisly killing??","review":"Dexter is charming and affable in a bungling school-boy way, plus he's a serial killer, but only of those who are truly deserving... He faces his toughest opponent yet in season 4, racing toward the jaw-dropping conclusion. I won't give it away. You simply must view this for yourself. Best series on TV, but not for the squeamish, or feint-hearted (or grandmothers, either....)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved the First 3 Seasons, Hated This One","review":"I am a huge fan of the first 3 seasons, but I'm really disappointed in this last one. I could go on and on about what I didn't like about this season, but I can boil it down to this. Seasons 1-3 were masterpieces in dark humor. In season 4, the humor is gone and only darkness remains. I won't spoil it for you, but I also hated the last minutes of the last episode: seriously depressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forced Failed Marriage. Again.","review":"Trinity makes for a sicko, which is great and adds suspense. Deb is charismatic and excellent. Dexter is Dexter, and Michael Hall continues his supreme excellence.My trouble sits with two issues. For one, not nearly enough bad-guy killing, and it's not even so Dexter can find himself this time.The main issue I have is with the whole Rita fighting with Dexter. It feels like the producers are trying to force their marriage to fall apart. The arguments are weak, the conflict feels forced, and it's just stupid.Honestly, I stopped watching it after four episodes because the acting on Julie Benz's was not convincing at all.Also, the Batista x LaGuerta thing is annoying, but the former does a decent job with making it feel important.All in all, the romance sucks and lacks emotion, and there's not even any action to make up for it. Just... lots and lots and lots of crappy romance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dexter: The Fourth Season","review":"The best season yet by far! Does not slow down a bit. The ending is unbelieveable. Season 4 is a must watch before starting season 5 or 5 won't make a lot of sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm totally Dextered!","review":"Yikes! I'm sooo addicted to this show! I'm never bored with it! I don't want to give away too much, but.........I don't think the Trinity Killer has anything to do with the last murder of this season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dexter: The Fourth Season","review":"I bought this DVD set for my son, who is on a humanitarian voyage with the US Navy. In his free time, he watched all the episodes and thought that this season of Dexter was outstanding. So, I get a happy US Navy Corpsman from this transaction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best season yet","review":"Terrific! Favorite show on cable currently... the pairing of the Trinity Killer matching wits with Dexter was great suspense!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dexter keeps getting better","review":"This show is consistently fantastic. I got into it a few years ago, and have loved it ever since. The writing is fantastic, and all of the shows actors are really sliding into their roles. If you're looking to get the fourth season, and you're unsure about it, it means you've watched the previous three. Why am I even convincing you to get this? You know you want it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Season","review":"My husband and I watched the dvds in 3 segments ... it's so addicting! Now I wish we spread it out more. I'm so bummed that we have to wait another year for the next series. This one really had us glued to our seats. The ending took my breath away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Apallingly bad TV","review":"Don't watch this - Dexter series 4 is a total waste of time and will leave you infuriated and unsatisfied! The ending is really bad, but it never actually gets any good. I loved the first 2 series but wow they went completely off the tracks here and series 3 isn't much better. Be warned!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's finally jumped the shark","review":"I've loved the first three seasons. I've never been so riveted by a television program. When I heard that Jon Lithgow was joining the cast I became nervous; bringing on a well-known actor is a classic sign of jumping the shark. The producers hoped to reinvigorate the brand by bringing in outside help. If that was all they had done, the season would have been bearable, bland, but bearable.Instead, the show commits a mortal sin--it destroys its winning formula in a desperate attempt to win viewers for the next season. It won't work. The series is doomed. It really is too bad they couldn't resist the urge to milk this cow to death.The real show ended in season 3. If you want to remember Dexter as a great show, walk away at the end of season three. Not only will season four be less enjoyable that the previous three, its needlessly harsh \\"shocker\\" ending will make you like the previous seasons less.Just walk away. Watch something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dexter: Season4: Disc 4","review":"The entire Dexter series is truly a unique story line and captivating all the way through.My only problem is with disc 4 of the fourth season. There seems to be a manufacturing defect on just this one disc. It does not load, so consequently it does not play. At first I thought it was a problem with the set I purchased from Amazon, so I ordered it from Netflix and that one did not load/play. I ordered a replacement from Netflix and sure enough that one also did not load/play. So after attempting three discs I must conclude this is a manufacturing defect which needs correcting. Needless to say I would love to discover how the seasons ends...but alas I cannot (I do not subscribe to premium cable channels).This item received one star due to the problem with the fourth disc...otherwise it would have received five stars.When this problem is rectified would someone kindly let me know so I can re-purchase this item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failure of Disc 3 (again)","review":"I've enjoyed the series immensely, and was on to the final disc of this set, but the last disc simply will not load/play. It hangs on a black screen and does not progress further.This was purchased last week (8/17) and the replacement was delivered today (8/25)This is the second attempt (this is a replacement from Amazon), but this copy has the same issues as the first set. I've seen plenty of customers that have enjoyed this season, and only a couple dealing with this defect (from both Amazon and Netflix). I suspect this defect is related to this current batch, but that still leaves me unable to finish the series.If you purchase it and find the same problem with the last disc, it means you received one from the same defective batch.I'll wait and try again later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dexter Blu Ray Season 4","review":"I have a new sony Blu Ray and two orders shipped didnt play. Sent the last back for a credit. The Sony Blu Ray player also has a wi fi so I watched Dexter in HD from Amazon web site actually for less money than the DVD. Still waiting for my credit though. There had to be something wrong with the shippment. Unless they sent the same one back to me. The 4th season is great though."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is a reason why this show was banned!","review":"TERRIBLE TERRIBLE Show! And yes from cable TV this series was banned for many reasons and both CBS Showtime's sister network would also be reprimanded if this show ever aired prime time on other channels! The main character is so disgusting and despicable its not even worth talking or writing about. You want a good show check out Rescue Me, or House, or heck even old sci-fi series like the Invisible Man and Star Trek are leaps and bounds better than this garbage!"},{"rating":"2","title":"PHENOMENAL show; best season yet","review":"I own Seasons 1-3 on DVD and have watched every episode of Dexter to-date.I must say that this show is THE most entertaining hour on television, period. Extremely well-written, with top notch performances by Michael C. Hall - and, this season, John Lithgow. Their cat and mouse game was riveting. The season finale was a shocker - but, it was perfect. The writers didn't cop out.I think in terms of favorite seasons of Dexter, here's where this one sits relative to all:#1 - Trinity (Season 4)#2 - Ice Truck Killer (Season 1)#3 - Miguel Prado (Season 3)#4 - Doakes (Season 2)I cannot WAIT for Season 5 to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's Dexter Buy It All Ready!","review":"Serious it's good.

Loved the show but don't expect to be able to stop between episodes. Eagerly awaiting the next season."},{"rating":"2","title":"This without a doubt is the BEST season...","review":"With John Lithgow as the evil doer what more can I say? We've got all the prior DVD Sets and without a doubt this Set (SEASON 4) is the ultimate BEST; I can't imagine how they'll continue DEXTER after this Season and still develop the proper plot and interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"First Breaking Bad, now Dexter :(","review":"worst season, especially the first half of the season. lithgow was no big deal, the directing bad, writing was dumb with stupid connections and lame scripts for the actors, a lot with dexter and his in mind thoughts. seasons 1 thru 3 are great. i dont get how people can be so wrong sometimes, best season yet? no way. The best thing they can do to come back from this so so season is to have dexter snap and go on a whole season killing spree, no code. then of course goes back to the code and being good. i can go on and on about how bad the first half of the season was and how so so the second half was, but it should be common sense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"I expect Amazon to make sure their products that are purchased new are NOT defective. This dvd was skipping at the first and second scenes. Worst purchase ever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cannot skip previews at beginning of Bluray version","review":"First of all, Dexter is a great show, don't get me wrong. This season, in fact, is worth a five star review for the excellent plot lines, suspense and execution. The blu-ray also has wonderful picture quality so good you can easily tell some of the scenes that are green screen. The audio is also excellent.HOWEVER, the Bluray version of this season FORCES you to watch a 10 minute advertisement every time you put in a disk! I already know about the other shows on Showtime, I don't need to be reminded. When I set aside an hour to watch an episode, I don't want to waste 10 minutes of my time waiting for the menu to load. Showtime/Paramount evidently does not value their consumers' time.I recommend NOT buying the blu-ray version of this product because of the horrible forced advertising at the beginning of each disk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dexter is becoming \\"unbelievable.\\"","review":"Okay, first a Dexter watcher has to accept the premise of the show. But within the parameters set by the writers, there is no way Rita would accept Dexter being gone so much--not with the previous admission of drug use. Sorry, but this glaring flaw combined with the ridiculous coincidences in the Trinity case, I fear Dexter is becoming silly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Edited version!@","review":"I hope that this is edited only because this first episode is free. If not can you edit out all the blood and violence also. Then I can watch it while eating dinner, that would be great!P.S.

Right now, she and her husband are enjoying the cd and I feel great about sharing."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Dexter Please.","review":"Man, I'm really addicted to this series. Funny trying to put his persona from the first couple of season into place seeing him as a father. He was great with Rita's kids but the sleep deprevation of a new baby is different.

I wonder why!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Season 4 blew me away -- I had heard it was a very good season and \\"they\\" weren't kidding.(trying to avoid a spoiler) -- I just wish they could have had the story without all of the reprucussions for what it means to the main character"},{"rating":"2","title":"Season 4 gets Dexter back on track!","review":"After the crapshoot that was season 3 of Dexter, season 4 was a HUGE relief for me to watch! This one gets the show back on track with introducing Jonathan Lithgow's character, and Dexter getting back to doing what he does best; being a vigilante serial killer! After watching season 4 you will see why Michael C. Hall and Lithgow won Golden Globes for their performances.

I hope that all the fine actors that were in this movie move on to something more exciting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch Sky High instead....","review":"Thankfully rented for free from the library, we watched Zoom last night and found it falls rather flat for all audience levels. A poor knock off ofSky High (Widescreen Edition), it may have been meant for a younger audience - like under 6. The only bright spots are the actors who were limited by the poor script and special effects. If you like booger humor than maybe you can get through this one....rent Sky High instead!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!","review":"I saw this movie with my son & we both enjoyed it thoroughly.

It's definately not brain food, but he watches it through, writes \\"zoom\\" every chance he gets, and organizes his friends to be the characters from the movie.

If you have a young kid who likes superheroes, this is perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real stories","review":"I actually met the author on the street and talked to him for about 15 minutes and bought the book right then. He is very interesting. This book was insightful and I learned some things about myself that I wasn't intending. He is an excellent writer, although some of the writing may have been written under the influence and is a little hard to follow. All in all, if you have even gotten this far, then by all means purchase this book. You will not have the chance to ever read a similar piece of literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Interpretation from Heidi Skok","review":"I really love this cycle by Ned Rorem, and any fan of 20th century american art song will like it as well I should imagine. Heidi Skok has an AMAZING voice, it is rich like chocolate and so emotive. Her high notes soar and still have the depth of her low and mid-voice. Martin Hennessy does a great job accompanying. This is seriously difficult music and they manage to make it sound rather effortless.I'm not quite sure yet what to think of the songs composed by Martin Hennessy--he certainly writes beautiful music, but it does not have the character that Rorem's compositions have. Also, he has certain whispered sections in \\"In the Stillness\\" which could not be performed live because of balance issues. Still they are enjoyable, my personal favorite being \\"Sonnet for Micheal\\" with text by Edna St Vincent Millay.If you are either a fan of Rorem's or simply of 20th Century american art song, this is an essential recording. I am eternally glad that I own it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light weight backpacker","review":"At age 55 and chasing SCOUTS all over the country, I need a light weight edge to keep up. I had a EUREKA ZEUS single wall but did not like the slight condensation that accumulated inside nor the inabilaty to take off the rain fly. I like to be able to star gaze and avoid the bugs. On our last adventure, to the Chiago Basin in Colorado, the Spitfire kept the rain out during frequent thunderstorms and the bugs at bay. It is as light as the single wall and I had the ability to fold the rain fly back for some fantastic night time views of the sky. I had NO condensation problems at all. The onlt problem was the stakes it came with were steel. Phurchased titanium stakes , Problem solved. GREAT BACKPACKING TENT"},{"rating":"2","title":"Eureka Solo Spitfire Tent","review":"I really like this tent although I do wish it was a bit more roomy. There is just enough room inside of it for me and some basic gear like a water bottle and a jacket. There is also enough room between the tent and the rain fly to keep your boots dry but out side of the tent. I am very happy with the weight and the bulk, well worth the reduced space. I plan to get the foot print for it because I noticed some water on the ground after the second or third night, although I suspect my camel back was leaking and this was not the tents fault. Very easy to set up by your self and pack into the sack. If you are looking for a relatively inexpensive solo tent and don't need to store gear in the tent with you this is the one to get."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do everything tent","review":"I just got this tent and took it out for the weekend at the lake. Not only did the tent hold up under crazy freezing rain and high winds the inside stayed pretty dry with the flap open. I left the flap closed one night to test the condensation factor and it passed the test and kept warm in 24 degree weather. A disappointment was what they call a vestibule that is extremely lacking but thankfully I sleep with my legs on my pack. Another great thing about the tent is the inside space. It is all that and a bag of chips I slept two people comfortably (with some snuggling).

Would highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, Probably the best back country purchase I've ever made.","review":"I bought this tent in 2006. I've used it for the last 6 years heavily. I've probably put around 500+ miles on this tent and I can honestly say it's one of if not \\"the one\\" best pieces of gear I've ever bought. It's light weight, compact and warm. It has such a tall floor 'rim' that raises 6-8\\" up the sides which helps to trap the heat since the fly can be tightened down to just an inch or so off the ground. There are lighter one-man's but not by much with a full fly and enclosed tent. The cost difference is extreme for the 6-8Oz you might save IMHO and this tent has durability. I can't say enough about this awesome tent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bitchin' tent!","review":"I'm so glad I bought this after seeing all these positive reviews.

When Lindh was in school, this book was widely used in his home state of California, having been the only book approved for use for middle schools in that state for several years. In writing my article, I did a textual analysis of the chapters on Christianity and Islam, counting the instances in which the words \\"persecute\\" and \\"tolerate\\" were used in their various forms. By my count, Christians were said to persecute people 10 times while Muslims were described as tolerant 10 times. Even worse, Christians were never described as tolerant and Muslims were never said to persecute people. So there you go."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clearly a pro-Muslim book","review":"I have read all the chapters dealing with religion in this book very closely.

After reading just a few pages, I was taken back, but I wanted to make sure and I read all of the chapters dealing with Islam and Christianity. I found that not only did the book portray Islam in a positive way, it portrayed it as almost the \\"best\\" religion.Not stopping there, the book slammed Christianity anyway it could when it talked about it a few chapters later. All I saw about Christianity is, \\"Crusades\\", \\"inqusitions\\", etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Parents be Warned, check for yourself","review":"This book is a Pro-Islam/Anti-Christian text book. It states as fact many Islam beliefs. It is not a balanced, multi-viewed text and it treats Islam like a great religion and Christianity as a bad religion. It is humiliating to Christians. It teaches our children how to pray like a muslim, but never gives Christianity equal and fair time and information. Don't take my word or anyone elses word for this. Check it out from your school and look it over for yourself. This should not be required reading for public schools."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outraged","review":"I find this book to be an outrage to any United States citizen that beleives in \\"One nation under God.\\" It's already illegal to teach Christianity in our public schools, illegal to pray and now our schools want to use this book to teach the children how to pray to Allah when our country's founding forefathers knew that the only way to the Father is through the Son, Jesus Christ.

Not only is it nice to not have to lay your bike on the ground if there isn't something handy to lean it against, but, if you ride loaded with panniers and such, this little item actually works as a bike stand so you can fix flats and such without completely unloading the bike and flipping it upside down!It has a load limit of 25 Kilos I believe and that is way light for a touring bike, heck I can put 25 Kilos on my front rack alone! But even though it is a bit wobbly with 40 - 60 kg on the bike they held up.

There are obvious and (as I learned from the book) not so obvious reasons why children need both same- and opposite-sex role models. I really had never considered that rough-housing could be a teaching mechanism rather than just a testosterone-laden way of bonding!

Unlike other publications that look at the archecture elements or design elements, I believe this is for folks interested in preserving a shrine to the '50s and '60s life-style.

It's almost the author's fantasy scenario about extreme liberalism coming to dominance in the Catholic Church, right down to a Spanish Pope who wears business suits and who used to be a married husband and father. This far-fetched novel has so little material on which to construct a plot that Greeley concocts a love story around his Papal election politics. There is a reconciliation of a married couple on the outs, and a half-hearted aside into a secondary plotline about a man who wants to murder the next Pope. Oh, and Father Greeley drags his favorite Chicago Cardinal into the book to fill more pages and gives the poor old man a life and death personal crisis. This soap opera could have been a good short story but it's a dismal novel. Virgin And Martyr and Angels of September are better books by Andrew Greeley, and a few of the Blackie Ryan mysteries are fun, but White Smoke is a clunker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Partly interesting - mainly trite","review":"Yes, I read it through to the end - but, while the premise may have been fascinating, the plot was dreadful.Vatican politics are as old as the Church, but the absurd vision of a situation where a handful of radical conservatives are depicted as having no redeeming qualities, yet the entire balance of the Church is eagre to support one candidate for the papacy, is beyond belief.If ecclesiastical politics are as old as Christianity, sex is as old as Adam. Perhaps Father Greeley could remember this, and stop creating characters who seem to think they invented it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A hackneyed \\"expose\\" of papal politics, tho' with some charm","review":"This may be one of the better novels of papal election I have read in a while (except Hadrian VII by FW Rolfe), but it suffers from Catholic moralizing and a sycophantic fascination with the Roman class system. The inevitability of the plot and the predictability of the characterization may draw the reader on, but for all the wrong reasons. Nonetheless, there are some pretty set pieces and the atmosphere of a conclave will of itself always cast a spell."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is awful","review":"Vatican liberals plant stories in major U.S. media and portray anybody who disagrees with them as crazy assassins who'll stop at nothing to get a more moderate pope elected. Meanwhile, the book's central character (a newspaper reporter) is obsessed with sex. What a story line, what a concept! And this is the future of the Catholic Church that Andrew Greeley wants to see? How do I get my money back?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Burn it.","review":"While the story of the Vatican election is interesting, the work as a whole is painful to read. The love story is contrived and completely telegraphed from the start, anybody could scribble the subplot on a napkin after 10 pages. And the \\"action\\" part at the end is unbelievably trite. The right person shows up at the exact right time needed to avoid disaster and dispaches the villain with a smile and a quip to boot. It's nauseating!And one more thing: Andrew, lose the cute and perennially changing nicknames for Herself, The Princess, Her Highness, etc. etc. It just doesn't work. But then, apparently, neither did you when you wrote this abomination."},{"rating":"1","title":"I got to page 50","review":"It may be unfair of me to rate and review this book, since I didn't finish it. But the fact that I couldn't get past page 50 or so tells it all.I've liked some of Greeley's books in the past, but this one was so dull and preachy that I didn't know -- or care -- who was who or what was happening.The characters were pure stereotypes and the dialogue was as unbelievable as I've ever read. Who talks like that!!!Life's too short to waste on books you don't really like, so my advice is to pass this one by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle typos","review":"I suppose it isn't fair to write a review of a book and not mention the content of the story, but the typographical errors in the Kindle version of this book are so plentiful that it has had a profound impact on my reading experience. I have hundreds of books on my Kindle and this has, by far, the greatest number of errors of any I have yet read. Case in point, when one of the characters appears to be wanting to say \\"Really\\" they mysteriously end up saying \\"Redly\\". And this is but one example among many. Perhaps at some point I will actually be able to review the STORY when I am past being aggravated over the formatting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mascots & Nicknames","review":"This is ONLY the Mascots names and nicknames. There is no history of how the nicknames and mascots came about. I really want to know how they got the names and mascots and what they mean to the colleges and the community that they are in."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all that","review":"The story is that the 'plain' sister decides to raise her 'pretty' sisters baby. The pretty sister is so rotten that its almost too much to be believed. Then the so called hero Royce comes into play. He is the plain sisters boss and is a total degenerate. I realize this book was slightly before the AIDS epidemic but I would not have touched that guy with a full bio-medical suit on. Anyway, as usual once they give the plain sister a hair cut and some makeup she turns out to be a beauty. Royce keeps heeping abuse on her thinking that she slept with his brother (while the entire time he is keeping time with the nasty sister). Meanwhile his family blackmails her into marrying Royce so that his mother can get remarried and she (at the ripe old age of 23) can take care of his five siblings and her sisters baby. Nice huh? She would have been better off finding a nice home for her nephew and kicking her nasty sister to the curb and actually living her life. To me this book was sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy!","review":"Don't buy this video! Even though the author describes this as some unique version of the Yang Long Form (I was hoping for a unique form that I am currently learning), it turns out that not only is this like every other version of the Yang 108/88 available on the web, the performance isn't that good, the quality of the video is poor (hardly qualifies as SD), and there's no commentary or anything. Probably taken by a friend with a VHS video camera on the Marin Headlands on a sunny day. Nice view of the Golden Gate Bridge, if that's appealing.And if you buy this as a download, you can't get a refund or anything. You're just out the $40.Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different!","review":"Just wanted to add to the score. Also to say, that I'm delighted that we are finally getting good quality gay themed movie shots in close to high def."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I expected so much more from this film caught on the Sundance Channel which generally shows some wonderful Asian gems as Ghost Actress. This one was muddled at the start; the photography was so dark and the storyline was not that linear or clear.My first reaction at the site of the house is why he didn't sell it right off. Talk about white elephants; this house could have held a couple of herds of elephants.As for his leaving or selling the house, I can only conclude that, other than plain stupidity, he might have been under the curse and really not able to leave, letting the curse play out. The fact that their friends were pulled in reminded me of The Grudge where everyone who enters the house suffers the consequence. But the Grudge was a far superior movie.Rent this! You'll only watch it once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, linear, and boring without suitable atmosphere.","review":"This movie is slow, boring and mostly predictable ghost story. There are not many scares. That's not necessarily a bad thing with most atmospheric horror films, but this one really doesn't build much tension or mystery. Its told in a style where flashbacks reveal most of the turns in the story. Also, I ended up empathizing with the antagonist in the film, which isn't really a good thing when attempting to build a sense of dread in the audience.There was a neat ad-hoc dead baby in a vase mausoleum, which is something I've never seen in a film before.Some of the filmmaking is rather nice, but too bad the story's mostly a dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recieved this bible...","review":"I am a Jewish parent who is homeschooling my 6-year old son. I was (and still am) looking for something I can use for Bible studies and was given this book from a friend. This is a terrible book for someone looking to learn or teach about the Jewish religion. It is skewed from a Christian perspective. If you are looking for something which truly introduces or explains the Jewish religion, then AVIOD THIS BOOK."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am a Jewish parent who was mislead","review":"I should have examined this book more closely before I bought it. I didn't realize that it wasn't truly a Jewish Bible. I would not have bought it. When I read it to my kids, I edit out the parts I do not endorse. Eventually I will probably give it away and get my kids a real Jewish book. A pity, because it has nice little stories in it. DK was very deceptive when marketing this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Jewish children!","review":"I thought about buying this book for my daughter until I read the introduction. The introduction is definitely written from a Christian perspective, and I don't feel that it is appropriate for teaching a Jewish child about the Tanach. Obviously, Jews don't recognize the New Testament, but the introduction states that the Bible is divided into the Old Testament and New Testament. As another reviewer noted, such references to Christian beliefs would be proper for a book on comparative religion, but not in a book purporting to teach the Hebrew Bible to Jewish children. My advice to Jewish parents: look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"More DK Deception on their web site","review":"I agree with the other reviews that DK Publishing does deception by putting the Rabbi's name of the cover. On their web page they even go as far as to say that the Rabbi is the author. For this reason, I would NEVER purchase any books by DK Publishing. This is a great book for a Cristian child, but do not buy for a Jewish child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Accurate and yet age-appropriate for preschoolers","review":"I looked at approximately 20 children's bibles before selecting this one to read with my pre-schooler. It does not assign a gender to God, the stories remain true to original form and yet are written in an age-appropriate format for children. My daughter enjoyed the pictures and I enjoyed the historical information in the margins. I would reccomend this book for all faiths, but especially for parents who want their children to get an accurate exposure to the Old Testament and the Israelites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teach it to your children.","review":"Great childrens bible! I highly recommend it. Makes the stories understandable without losing depth of meaning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive repackaging of DK Illustrated Children's Bible","review":"Recently, I went searching for a simple introduction to the Christian bible for my 6-year old. I first picked up the \\"Illustrated Jewish Bible\\" and thought it was perfect, except that it only consisted of Old Testament stories. I then found DK's \\"Illustrated Children's Bible\\". Out of curiosity, I went back and compared the \\"Jewish\\" bible to see what differences there were in presentation and content. I thought I might buy both books to compare and contrast Judaism with Christianity.To my surprise, I found that the so-called Jewish bible was an exact duplicate - page for page - of the Old Testament portion! DK is a good publisher, but in this case, they clearly went for a quick product offering, not even bothering to reset the type from their Christian edition. Shame on them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"There needs to be a 0 stars button","review":"I bought this book and we noticed tonight that there are Christian pictures in it. For the story of Isaac they have a picture of Jesus being circumcised!!! What the heck is that??? Also some of the other pictures are of people like Isaiah (I think) with a sundisk behind his head, clearly a Christian artist. I am shaking my head. Annoyed. This book is for Messianic Jewish children."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but somewhat disapointing","review":"I expected the Bible stories to be more from a Jewish perspective. Unfortunately, much of the stories seem to have more of a Christian perspective. For example, the Ten Commandments follow the traditional Christian understanding placing \\"I am the L-d your G-d\\" in the preface and starting with \\"You shall have no other gods before me.\\" There is very little use of the Hebrew names - Adam and Eve, not Adam and Chava, Esther, not Hadassah, etc. These are minor distractions, but overall I recommend this as good to read to Jewish children. The stories are short but cover a great deal of the Tenach and the illustrations are appealing. We read at least one story to our boys every night before bed and more on Shabbat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rust on wheels","review":"This thing works great at first, good length and quality.

It was the correct length, durable and the blue coated line looked great. I have had this product for four weeks. Today I tied up the dog to go outside to go to the bathroom and 2 minutes later the dog was gone! I ran outside int he snow to look for the dog and luckily after 4-5 minutes I found the dog safe. When I returned to the house I found that the lead had broken off at the base which allowed my dog to wander off. As I mentioned, I have had this new product for four weeks?

Too bad that Amazon couldn't actually serve it up after I purchased it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good charger","review":"This charger works pretty darn well. It has 4 circuits. Thus, I recommend charging only 4 cells at a time, rather than as many as 8. With C cells, they need to be tilted up slightly so that they contact-a minor design flaw. Also, you can only charge one 9V cell at a time, and it sticks into the charger perpendicular to the other cell bays, which means you can't use the cell bays closest to the 9V. Other than that, it does seem to be built well and is good quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavily used and still works great","review":"I have owned the 8-position battery charger for almost 3 years now with heavy use. We have 3 kids 6 and under with many toys that require constant battery changes, etc. Obviously, we own a lot of rechargeable batteries in all sizes.

There could have been more instruction on how to assemble but my husband was able to figure it out. The mechanism works very nicely - very easy to change the height by holding and lifting. Changing the slant of the keyboard tray not too difficult (involves a lever that works like a ratchet), and very easy to swing the keyboard tray from side to side. Overall, I'm very happy with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"You get what you pay for","review":"Simply the best keyboard tray on the market. Easy to install, stable, sturdy and comfortable. This will adjust just about any way you want it to. very happy with it and very high quality. Make sure to have some extra screws as they include 6 or 8 but the unit is pretty heavy and it takes a fair amount of pressure to adjust it. I've got it installed on a pretty cheap pressed wood desk and haven't had any issues but made sure to make sure it was firmly attached."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bulky and heavy","review":"This product is too bulky and heavy.

I also found the instructions were seriously inadequate. The biggest problem was the adjustability of the height -- I could never get it down to a comfortable level. This would be a good tray for very large desks and for those who need the tray to be at a higher level, but I do not recommend this for anyone with a U-shaped desk or anyone who likes a tray height that does not stress the shoulders."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movies","review":"What can I say.

These Christmas classics, along with A Christmas Story, and White Christmas are such a tradition in our family, and watching my cousins and their mom watch them for the first time really put me in the Holiday Spirit. I feel like nowadays every cartoon is dumbed down and politically correct. This hearkens to a time when Christmas was Christmas and classics were classics - and yet, it is in new technology form!

This Legolas is awesome! Yes, it only has one dagger, but it gave us all a chance to get the saught after fellowship Legolas! He looks exactly like Legolas from the movies, and he is highly detailed. Elven engravings on his biceps and his elbows have a very nice looking silver color. He has green cuffs with golden engravings on them. His hair has the exactly right color and has a blowing in the wind look. He has 3 arrows, his mirkwood bow, and his elvish dagger. For those who have read the book, you know Legolas only carried one dagger, so maybe that's why toybiz released him with only one? His dagger slashing action is very smooth and looks great. He can be posed in many poses, with 2 daggers(I stole one from my TTT Legolas), with one dagger and a bow, shooting his bow, and loading his bow. Simply my favorite Legolas figure. Also he's a pretty rare piece so get him while you can. Thanks for reading my review!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A review by Legolas' true love","review":"I gave him a five star rating for everything.He's durable, fun and even educational because you might just learn how to fight like a real elf when you go into your own play world of LOTR!Now, toy biz didn't make his face perfect like the later Prince Legolas figures but he's still totally cute and he's very hansome.When you hold his legs together, he has arrow launching and dagger slashing action.He doesn't come with the Lothlorien long bow and quiver with arrows like the later Legolas'.He is the Fellowship Legolas.This is based on when he has his Mirkwood weapons.This cute little wood elf is a true delight.Im surprised he's not out of stock at the moment since just about all the other new trilogy figures are and with him being Legolas too...but it might not be long before he is so grab him up and give him lots of love, or else!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even bother","review":"This product did arrive right on time, and is the only reason it has stars.

No one really taking it seriously except Bergen who learned it too late. Everyone else just accepts and moves on. I couldn't understand why Silver motivation for anything especially his anger. I understand their father's influence over the children and how their parent's violent relationship had traumatized them forever but beyond that. I just couldn't get into, maybe if the incestous relationship was taken out I would had understood it better. I read practically all her books this is not her best try, \\"Here on Earth\\"(excellent), \\"Second Nature\\"(breathtaking)."},{"rating":"1","title":"White Horses","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. It is hard to identify with any of the characters; I didn't find even one I really liked. Well, maybe Harper. The theme was depressing, even if true for some people. Usually I can't stop reading and am sorry to have a book end. With this one, the end couldn't come fast enough. Usually I like Alice Hoffman's books, but this definitely isn't up to her usual level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Even Bother","review":"I loved \\"Here on Earth\\", but I was just disgusted with \\"White Horses\\"... The fact that an incestuous relationship is treated as 'normal' really bothered me... so much so that I stopped reading half-way through the book, and just skimmed to see what happened. I'm glad I didn't waste any more time on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the White Horses???","review":"Rarely do I read a book that I find so underdeveloped as this one. The characters drift along without making any kind of decisions about thier lives, except bad ones. The relationships that they have are unrewarding, and unexplainable. Teresa and her brother Silver have an insestual relationship that is impossible to understand. Dina marries King Conners for no apparent reason, King Conners leaves for an unexplainable reason, Dina falls in love with Bergen, and I don't know why. Silver marries Lee- but he hates her- Teresa almost marries Joey and that relationship is a rediculous sham. At the end of the book- I wanted to shake everyone into reality- at least all of the characters that were left. Most of them just quietly disappeared from the pages, except Dina, who died. This was truly a rediculous story, with unlikable characters in search of mysterious men, or was it white horses? Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR KIDS!","review":"My eleven year old grand-daughter loves horses so \\"White Horses\\" was among the books she chose for me to order for her online.

I am not sure how an older book like this one goes from written to electronic version, but I have a strong feeling off-shore assistance was the reason. But whatever the reason, it is really irritating!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"A fan of Practical Magic, I looked forward to this lesser known work by Alice Hoffman, and since I live in Santa Fe, I thought I'd enjoy the book's New Mexico setting. Unfortunately, the book depicts Santa Fe architecture and the surrounding landscape inaccurately and is poorly edited to boot. There is a typo on almost every page of the e-book, as if someone scanned a hard copy and didn't proofread the results. I'm not finishing White Horses, and it was a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"White Horses, by Alice Hoffman","review":"I am a sucker for anything by Alice Hoffman. This was not my favorite book of hers, but like all the others, it is absorbing and hypnotic.The characters are real and trying to make sense of their lives.

The $3.99 Kindle edition is FULL of typos! In some places you can't even figure out what its trying to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"A haunting story of survival","review":"I'm glad I read this book even though the life of the main character, Teresa, is so troublesome and painful. Her physical/mental ailment and her family's breakup tear her life apart. She keeps looking for the ideal man (on a white horse), but finds only abusive males, including her own brother. Although some readers may be repulsed, as I was, by the incest in the book, it's a reality many people face. Alice Hoffman is so diverse in her writing. I enjoyed this book more than her Here On Earth. The book does, I think, end on a positive note, and I keep thinking about Teresa's endurance."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved the way Theresa smelled like roses when she slept.","review":"It is rare that you hope for a romance to suceed when it is tied to one of the last remaining tabos; incest. I felt for Thersea. She was raised to love the poorest of biological choices; her own brother. I believed along with her that he was the only path to happiness. Hoffman proves that she is as adept with southwestern folklore as she is with the New England variety in this parody of Sleeping Beauty. This book explores many of the same themes as \\"Here on Earth\\". Both heroines are fated from their youth to love the wrong man but I feel that the heat of the southwest adds an intensity to this story. In this setting, anything is possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Real Princess","review":"I looked only at the tale called The Real Princess. I have looked at mnay other versions and this one is my favorite. It would be especially enjoyed by a young reader because it gives just the right amount of enformation without changing the plot. It holds true to the magical feeling of the fairy tale genre and is crisp and fun to read.The remainder of the stories contained in this Book are most likely written in a similar fashion and should be fun to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A childhood delight","review":"Enid Blyton's are always a delight when you read it, especially for children. It will bring them to times of fairies and witches, and there is a lot imaginative fun.

I really enjoy the way enid blyton puts us among the subjects. When I read her books my senses are momentarily cast adrift to the fun times and adventures my friends and I had as kids.I also really enjoy her thrilling and exciting ends to the stories. She also has a way of keeping your hair standing up. She also has a way of potraying different shades of charecters in her stories. I really think that the world today is in great need of writers like enid blyton to take us back to our childhood days and to show the kids how to have pure,plain fun,especially in a taut situation like today,s!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"Although the seller shipped promptly and I have nothing against them, the fit of these thongs is terrible. They are too tight in the pouch and the thong strap is very irritating. I wear thongs daily and love the feel, but these are going in the garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"My junk doesn't fit!!!","review":"I bought the blue/brown tie-dyed pair and was thoroughly disappointed with them. Now, I am not claiming to be the most well endowed fella on the block but I simply cannot wear them due to the lack of a front pouch and how low they set in the front. I even bought the XL's for that reason. Waist-wise I can wear the L's but many such undergraments require me to purchase a size larger, hence the XL's. Guys, if you are packin' hardly anything then I'd recommend looking into a different pair of underwear. They look really cool in the packaging or just laying in the dresser drawer but the looks definitely don't out-weigh the discomfort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just plain bad","review":"\\"very loose fitting, the elastic going around the waist is way too slack. A very bad fit. I do not recommend to anyone"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good buy for a little fun","review":"Title says it all. For the price this item was perfect.It doesn't feel flimsy when wearing it, and for a thong I'd say it fit quite well. Don't worry what you read here or there, order your standard size and everything fits fine.Shipped fast and arrived in a discrete package.Girlfriend got a good kick out of these, definitely worth it for those wanting to throw a little spice into the bedroom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Immensely Disappointed","review":"I have always felt that the \\"Dr. Phil\\" hype is out of control. Given the author has been married for 30+ years, I thought she may have had some good advice to share. While her father was an alcoholic and her mother very brave, there is really nothing remarkable about Robin herself. Just because there are so many who choose to fail despite wealthy/powerful ties, is no reason to extol one who's made use of these advantages...The good advice she did offer could be reduced to three pages. It is most certainly not worthy of a reader's time. I returned this book for a full refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Making that choice!","review":"sometimes is so very hard! Today, I can make a choice of what I read and write. This book was a bit general, but if you listen to Robin on Dr. Phil's show, she writes as she speaks! Robin is a classy lady who obviously adores her family. Thanks Robin, for sharing your story as a mom and a wife. I really appreciated her positive attitude in everything, reminds me of what my grama used to say, \\"If you can't say something nice, say nothing.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"For the Curious - What is Robin Really Like?","review":"If you've ever wondered what Robin is like, here's your chance. She shares small glimpses of her life with the famous Dr. Phil and her children, and shares sometimes painful childhood memories. It's a life story that inspires you to take charge of your own life. She's assertive without being aggressive - some women will embrace her as a role model. You won't find advice to solve your problems. You need to find your own path, and she encourages you to take the first step.I was impressed by her attitude toward others. She cherishes \\"family\\" and goes the extra mile to understand and help them. Does she take on the school on behalf of one of her sons? Yes. I also like her ideas about mothers-in-law. No wicked MIL tirades here.I'm impressed with her empathy and willingness to meet all people half way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Psych 101 - Lite","review":"I love Dr Phil and have no problem with watching Robin on his show, but to ask me to fork over money for a book that was probably written in a week (if that long), that doesn't go into any depth ... what a waste! Her advice to make \\"good choices\\" is fine, but extremely simplistic - something most of us already know, but I guess not, considering all the rave reviews. Reading the reviews is just as good as reading the book, because there is very little depth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of touch","review":"Sorry, I am a Dr. Phil fan and enjoy the peeks he gives us into his family but this book just got me angry. It does repeat constantly...how much Phil loves her, how wonderful a mother she is, how all around wonderful she is. You know, you can make the best choices throughout your life and still not end up in a fabulous life - like hers. Her attitude is lacking reality - perhaps her childhood was painfully real but her \\"confidence\\" rubbed me as arrogance. As a previous reviewer suggested, I think it would be a whole different book if she lived on $30,000 a year...oh, ya, that's right, she wouldn't make that \\"choice.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your time or money","review":"This book is one of the worst books I have ever read. I bought it because I heard she was on the Women of Faith tour and it was endorsed by Max Lucado. I was disappointed that it was not a Christian centered book but I do enjoy secular books also, so I got past that. I seemed like it was written in a couple of days. Robin sounds like she loves herself way too much. The entire book concentrates on how wonderful her life is because SHE made all the right choices. She lacks any humility or modesty at all. While I agree with being in charge of your life, she is completely disconnected from real people and the real world. She comes off sounding like a spoiled little rich girl, and I was surprised by that. I painfully read the entire book because I paid hardbook price. Do not make the same mistake!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment","review":"I bought this book as soon as I saw it because I have always loved Robin and her deep passion for being a mother. I started reading right away and couldn't believe how this book has little to no substance. I'm not really interested in how she met Phil and where she worked, we all have these stories. I thought this would be more about her convictions and devotion to her family. Instead I was bored, not interested and quickly realized this book was an ego boost more than a helpful read. I have yet to finish because it is so difficult to trudge through."},{"rating":"1","title":"humanism","review":"Save yourself the money in buying this book. I read it and it smacks of humanism and the \\"just do it\\" mentality. A cash cow book and we've heard it all before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intimate","review":"I did not want this book to end. I have a thousand more questions I would love to ask Robin after reading this. She shares so many intimate thoughts and practical day to day experiences. She demonstrates that no one has a \\"perfect\\" life and that it takes grit and determination to face life's challenges with grace and integrity. Robin does that beautifully."},{"rating":"2","title":"Uplifting inspiring read.","review":"The book was very fast and enjoyable reading book. It contained a lot of humor and overall empowering women no matter whether they chose to be a doctor or a housewife. It was a different look at the other side of Dr. Phil. He definitely is not \\"Dr. Phil\\" at home. I think she demonstrates how women should require others to treat them with respect."},{"rating":"2","title":"A blessed marriage!","review":"Robin's attitude & determination has created a blessed marriage.

Give me a HUGE break. How convenient that he's a bajillionaire, and now you \\"choose\\" to get botox injections from the looks of the book cover. No one cares how you live.

This book was so inspirational. I found myself wanting to be a better wife, mother and friend to the ones that I love after reading this book. It just made me think about how lucky I am and how we should all cherish everyday with our loved ones. Our parents pass on and our children grow up but they leave us with such wonderful memories and life lessons that we can use to help and encourage others. Thanks Robin!

Instead I read a sugary sweet version of her life that fell into place because she decided to be a strong woman. How very simple but unrealistic. Who has such a perfect marriage and children? Happy or content I can understand...but perfect? I would have rather read her mother's story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inside my heart","review":"This book made Robin McCraw look like she has a huge ego. She thinks she does everything right. I think she's controlled. The part I really didn't like was when her son was projectile vomiting and she took him to a doctor who did nothing really. I had the same situation, my doctor told me to go straight to the hosptal, an infant can become completely dehydrated in 24 hours. This should be called, \\"another stepford wife\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed....","review":"I LOVED Robin's talk at the Women of Faith conference, so I bought the book. And I was disappointed. At Women of Faith, she really proclaimed her Christianity. In the book, it seems watered down, almost hidden. I guess I was looking for more meat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"As a mental health professional who believes that Dr. Phil takes a realistic, common sense approach to life, I purchased this book thinking it may be valuable. I have yet to finish the book, because I have found it to be of little depth and not much value. My initial impression has been that this book is more about how wonderful \\"Phillip\\" is, how he is really just an ordinary guy, etc... and less about life lessons. Since I have a positive opinion about both of these people, I am disappointed, could not recommend the book to anyone and am sorry I spent the $3.99 on the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Robin has too many \\"yes\\" people around her....","review":"If Robin wants attention, then she should get her own show. Maybe she can get on \\"The View.\\" Although Robin says that she is writing from the heart, you never feel her heart. The book is poorly written--so much so that it was either burn it or return it--so I returned it for a full refund. Robin is much more inspirational verbally than she is in writing. A good editor would have gone a long way in helping to resuscitate this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Robin McGraw's Inside My Heart Book","review":"I thought the book was absolutely wonderful and I do not like reading books. She shared different situations and experiences she has had with her husband that shows how they handle things as a couple which I found very helpful to apply to my own marriage. She is motivational because she shows you how she has overcome trials and made them her reasons for being the way she is. There are also some very sweet stories she shared about things her husband has done for her which were very nice to read as well as them together as a family facing scary times with their young children. I have recommended this book to lots of people so far and will continue to do so. I think its a wonderful book and that Robin is an amazing woman with a terrific attitude about life and relationships.Shawna Hodges"},{"rating":"2","title":"Priceless","review":"I, too, wasn't sure what to really expect when I purchased this book. But, after listening to it (audio book), I realized that this was one of the best audio books I would ever own. This is something that is extremely easy to relate to and it is one of those books that you can cry, laugh and take some time to really examine yourself for who you are. It allows you to search for your inner strengths, really think about the choices you make and improve on the things about yourself that aren't the best that you can be. I say priceless because, this has helped me look at what I want in my life for me, and to get my priorities straight. Her story in itself is extremely inspirational, but not because she \\"had it soo hard\\", but because she lived her life by the choices she made. You will understand if you purchase this book. 100% recommended by me.

I think she came across as a fantastic wife and mom. Even though she is more traditional than I choose to be, I liked the message about proactive life choices.

She doen't engage the reader in anyway. I don't find her little stories about her and Philip that great. To her definse, I guess it is hard to write a book someone would throw themselves into. I don't quite know what I was exspecting, but it wasn't this, it's only about her not how you can relate to it to your life at all. This is NOT a self help book in anyway.

Very down to earth and very easy to read and relax too. I sat down in one evening and read almose half the book in that one sitting. Robin McGraw does a fantastic job of letting you see into her life and making you realize that she is just like anyone else. She gives an emotional look into her childhood and the strength we as women have. She also shows how she set boundries in her relationship with Dr. Phil. Letting him know what she wanted and she as will to let him go if they didn't have the same goals in mind for life. I see all to many woman let the man dictate the direction of their relationships and take a backseat to their own feelings. She showed how to do it with grace and still get what you want.

Robin McGraw, wife of \\"America's Therapist\\" Dr. Phil McGraw, writes her life story in simple, direct, and at times downright moving prose. She does not present her choices in life as the only valid ones a woman can make, which is good because not all women choose to become wives and mothers. She does present making conscious choices about life as something every woman can and should do, making it clear that she believes many women do not do this or even realize it is possible. I found it a fast and enjoyable read, and even though Robin's life and mine are quite different I learned from what she had to say.

Decided on the new Revere...made in China... poor choice ..... the smallest sauce pan now has a bubble on the bottom of the copper, I have no idea how it happened. Only that this set cost a whole lot more than my old wedding set and it didn't last. I'm looking at another brand something made here in the states."},{"rating":"1","title":"Revere Ware Skillets Don't Stand Up","review":"I bought a set of Revere Ware cookware, pots and pans and skillets about six years ago. The pots and pans were superb, and held up fine, cleaning up perfectly, inside and out, after each use. The seven-inch skillet and the ten-inch skillets were an entirely different story. They both developed severe scratches inside--despite using non-abrasive cleaning products--and developed ugly burn-marks and unsightly stains on the outside that became nearly impossible to clean off. I had to finally give up on both of them, and pitch them in the trash. Revere is a fine old name, but its non-stick skillets degrade, rather than exalt, its fine name. I would never buy any of their skillets again."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Original Reverware Starter Set","review":"This is the original Reverware Starter Set. A must have for every newly wed couple or young one leaving the nest. High quality, durable, great for for cooking with even heat and easy to clean. Lasts forever. Look on Ebay at what the used stuff goes for and you'll know what I mean. Can easily be restored to look like new after any abuse. For many, Reveware has become an heirloom item, it's that good. You can buy cheaper cookware, but remember, you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"1980-1990 Vintage Revere","review":"Hi,Some of our Revere pieces are 30 years old, so I was thinking of a new set, but based upon the reviews, I will treasure my current set. It has served us well and keeps on going.There is quality out there, you just need to look for it and pay the price. I purchased the large (14\\"x17\\")All-clad cookie sheet in stainless last month and it is excellent, but it was expensive, $80! This was probably our fifth cookie sheet, and everything before this one rusted. This one should be our last. This should have been my first cookie sheet.So for baking, I just stick with a good stainless steel, adding one piece at a time, including some from the Vermont Country Store. Cheap stainless steel rusts. The non-stick products have to be replaced in 3-10 years. I think it is cheaper just to buy a good stainless product to begin with and not waste money on the stuff that does not last. I have a few baking pieces I have not found in a good stainless yet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Your Mother's Revere Ware","review":"I was shocked at how thin the sides and bottoms of these pots and pans are. You can actually push them in and out with your fingers. They weigh less than 1/2 of the weight of some Revere Ware pots and pans I purchased in the 1980's. They are easily dented they are so thin. Made in Indonesia? I would recommend buying another brand since these are not your mother's Revere Ware that lasted for generations."},{"rating":"2","title":"sturdy pans","review":"This purchase was for my daughter.

I burnt one sauce pan, and they even replaced it even though it was my fault--and thus generated a lot of good will.My old Revere Ware are all as new. Now I am seeking a 4 quart pot and naturally looking for Revere Ware--a Brand I trusted. But reading all the reviews it seems that quality has gone down considerably. A shame, but this is the trend--brand erosion. There are so many other choices. Too bad. Why so many companies do that does not make sense--even with All Clad--once made in China and elsewhere, product quality goes down--to save costs, yes, but dilute the quality and the brand. How does that make sense?"},{"rating":"1","title":"copper bottom disappeared after first use","review":"After the first use the copper bottom disappeared on two of the four pieces as if it were sprayed on.

I bought four boxes for Christmas gifts, thinking they were like the ones I currently own. They can only be used one time, after one use they are junk! I simmered sauce for a few hours in the large pan and four corners cracked. The frying pan browns on one side and doens't cook on the other. Mine are made in Illinoise these are made in Indodesia. I paid to have them shipped, had I known they were not Revere I would never have bought them. I asked to return them and was told I needed to pay for the return shipping. I sent mine back and it cost $12.88. I asked the company to contact me and they have never contacted me about the returns or even apoligized for selling them to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sentimental and Romantic","review":"Reading this book did not, alas, lead to the birth of pleasure. It was a painful experience. The highest value for Gilligan is the pursuit of the 'authentic self,' especially the female one, in the face of nasty 'patriarchy.' Twenty-five years ago, 'patriarchy' really meant something; it was a call to arms against those social, political, and economic structures entirely in the hands of men. But the word is at outmoded as is the sentimental and romantic stuff purveyed here. There is more to life, more to gender, more to maturity, and certainly more to human values than this pursuit of pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Moving Book!!","review":"This book is very moving, I cried!!

It doesn't hold her attention forever but it can buy 20 minutes or so in the car and it is nice that you never loose the pieces and now that she is older we can talk about the rabbit and vegetables and what it is doing and that helps hold her attention a little longer too. I definitely recommend this as a toy to keep in the car."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for travel","review":"I bought this for a plane ride to occupy my 15 month old daughter.

However, the ones that we got are NOT sturdy at all - they shake like thin, light wood tables that are not put together well. When we looked at the legs, they are standing just on little tips, so my spouse and I are now thinking of either cutting the legs a little so that they will stand flat, or somehow otherwise reinforcing the tables. In addition, one leg for the stand was broken.Otherwise, I do love the color and size of the tables, but, again, they are almost useless unless reinforced. What a pity!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality finish","review":"I ordered these table trays as a Christmas gift for my mom. When the trays came in the mail, we noticed that three of the four trays had bad finish. There were patches where the finish was rough, and it was not in the same places on each tray. I contacted the seller and their solution was to send another set of TV trays (only after me needing to send a detailed e-mail about what what wrong with their product). The replacement set was on back order and took a few weeks to reach my mom. When she opened the new set of trays, she discovered that they were pretty much the same as the first set -- one tray with a good finish, and three that had rough patches of finish. Ultimately we returned both sets (which took a week to get the labels, and two to get the refund) and purchased the product elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"damaged","review":"One of the tables is chipped, and it happened before they were packaged.

I used the free shipping option with a weekend order and received the tables 5 days later. From UPS no less!! Quality of the product is what you would expect from China, okay but rough around the edges so to say. Finish is uniform but nothing special, quality of the individual pieces is fine and workmanship is okay. The only issue we had was with the legs to the stand, the seat areas for the wood screws was made a little too deep and the screws broke through the outer surface of the stand supports. I removed the screws, filed some off the ends and reattached the legs.These stands are high, so take that into consideration, but they are solid when set up and look fine. The tops are smooth and somewhat slick, so care will be needed to keep glasses, etc from sliding off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Nice Product","review":"I received the trays in a timely fashion.

Literally, I cleaned off the desk, put my laptop computer on it, went to plug it in, and the thing fell off because that action cause the leg to break.Now, I may be an unreasonable man, but I expect that a table can withstand some light provocation.

They taper down to a sharp point so they leave marks on hard surfaces and are hard to move on any surface. Within three months we noticed that the legs were getting wobbly and unstable. Upon investigation of the problem I found that the folding leg assembly is constructed with a very ameteur version of a mortise & tenon joint. The joint is SO loose that no amount of glue can hold it together. The joints are held together by small brads and that's it.

I opened them and one of the tables the finished was rubbed off and the second table had huge raised chunks of wood. I didn't even bother to look at the other two because the situation was already ridiculous. Although the color was very nice, they honestly looked like someone took a piece of plywood and stained it. They feel very cheap.I returned them and received new ones within three days. Very good service. However, the second time i received them the entire side of the box was ripped open and had been re-taped as if someone had bought them and returned them as well. The first two tables I took out of the box had dents again.

The mineral crystal is quite thick and slightly convex, something rarely seen. The Roman numerals, hands, and bezel are all rose gold-plated, as is the buckle on the faux aligator band. The watch is approx. 39 mm in diameter, and is absolutely stunning to look at. My only complaints are that the crown is quite small and it's a little tricky to set the time, but, with Swiss quartz accuracy, you won't be doing that very often; and I wish it had a date window. But this is a whole lot of quality watch for the priced, with a lifetime warranty backed by Croton, complete with a very nice aluminum and suede-lined box."},{"rating":"2","title":"Important Revisionist Viewpoint","review":"This book makes a very important contribution to a proper understanding of the terrible events of the first half of the 20th Century.

I am now convinced that Woodrow Wilson was, indeed, the worst president in American history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak historical scholarship","review":"Having read many of the books cited by the author, I began to question the authors credentials and scholarship. What primary sources were used? It's more of a barroom argument put down in writing than a serious historical thesis. Emotionally biased phrases such as, \\"Wilson was an arrogant and bitter man\\" without delving into the causes for this arrogance and bitterness leave me flat. The intended audience for this book appears to be high school students, as it provides a general survey of modern, Western history without much detail. While I actually agree with much of the author's main points, there are much better books on the subject. They are all listed in Powell's bibliography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book with lots of fun facts and wonderful photes","review":"This book has it all.

He gets a little long winded at times, but all in all, this is a very good book and a must-have for all fans of the old USFL. Byrne sort of sets them up and knocks them down - telling the league's botching of a TV deal, the Donald Trump led campaign to go head to head with the NFL and the eventual \\"victory\\" in court. I thought he was especially colorful in the very beginning of the book when he describes Harry Usher trying to keep the 1985 championship trophy from falling apart on him while at the same time the league itself was falling apart all around him.

Very surprised that it sounds better than the Yamaha did in its' time! The cabinet seems a little big but it blends in pretty well.

I purchased a Denon AVR-591 3 weeks ago, and convinced the wife that using my old Yamaha surround sound/sub speakers with this receiver is like driving a Porsche with tires from Discount Tire Company. So I purchased the Polk Audio PSW10 along with the RM75 satellite speakers. When I started researching what to buy, I actually thought that maybe the PSW10 wouldn't be enough for my HT. But quickly I learned that I probably won't be able to enjoy the full potential of this sub. We live in a town home(end unit though) and gotta kid on the way.

I didn't realize that the PSW10 amplifier only averages 50 watts continuous and 100 watts dynamic power output.

There is a small hiss coming from the speaker as well. Believe the negative reviews because they are true. Do yourself a big favor and purchase the excellent Polk Audio PSW505 12-Inch Powered Subwoofer instead. I already own one PSW505 subwoofer and it is amazing.

I read the review about it not working well or not that well with movies, but I cannot agree with that review, we find that it works great, me and my wife hear the lows and the highs and have not heard any muded sound. Sometimes we hear a flutter sound but to us it sounds like the air comming through the port, but that is also when we have the volume up high to high. It's definately not useless as one review says.

Low pass all the way down (don't need muddy mid-bass messing things up, it sounds best using just as an 'enhancement' sub for low end, used in conjunction with quality speakers. If you just want major boom and obnoxious volume, maybe this isn't for you (but still bet it would satisfy most). For me, it has more than enough quality sounding bass.I am very happy with how it filled in the lows in both music and home theater use. I adjust the volume +/- 2% depending on whether music/movies.

It is a little but uglier than it's modern counterpart the 111, but at less than half the cost I can hide it in the corner.So good sound for a normal to small room at a price point you can afford.

No rattles, buzzes, or hums. With music with a wide range of depth, I'm glad that I opted for the PSW10 and not the PSW 8.

I'm using it in office so rarely does it thump, but it does do a very good job of reproducing low end at low to moderate volume. If you are looking for audiophile quality, you'll need to step up a few notches. If all you want is raw bass, you're probably better off with a box with a bigger amp.

I would have to either unplug the RCA cable(s) or even unplug the power cord and plug it back in to get it to start working.This continued to happen every few days so I would need to unplug cables to get it to work. I tried different RCA cables but the same problem happened.

After receiving it, I set it up with my Onkyo receiver. The bass sound is awful. When volume is low, the sound is not quite persistent. When volume is adjusted to produce persistent low frequency sound, it sounds muddy and not deep at all. Even the subwoofer came with the HTiB system sounds million times better than this one.

Recently set up a surround TV system including Polk R50's - this subwoofer compliments the setup, adding more base although the R50's alone achieve good range into some of the base. The PSW10 looks match the R50's - one of my criteria, and fits nicely in the space available - a second criteria. I am using the sub-out jack from a 70W Onkyo 7.1 receiver with a Y-splitter; depending on the TV programming & audio source, reasonably loud but very clean base response from the PSW10. Present crossover (Onkyo) is set at 100db & blends well with the R50's set at \\"Large\\" & with other smaller (Klipsch & Polk) surrounds (frequency adjustment / crossover on the PSW10 is turned all the way up).

It's great for a patio party, too, if the kids want to play in the yard while the adults can sit on the patio. Adjustable height.

So we traded it in for a smaller model. We found out that even the smallest model has a hard time mixing any regular sized batch of anything (from cookies to bread). If we leave the mixer alone, we come back and there is still unmixed ingrediants in the bottom of the bowl. It is easier to just use a hand mixer. Another problem is that it is almost impossible to add ingrediants to the bowl without buying the [optional] attachment.

While KitchenAid probably does not recommend using a KitchenAid mixer this way, it sure helps me when I have to bake and have forgotten to defrost the butter ahead of time.This is not a \\"disposable\\" mixer.

The unique name of this band comes from the vocal style of Chan Marshall, who's crooning sounds like that of a slowly dying feline. If you listen closely to the track \\"Enough\\", there actually is a cat being rung through an old-tyme dryer. Cat Power's simple bare-bones approach to music has a convienient clumping action, that will leave your box clean and refreshed.

Love \\"Rockets\\" (same track as on her other first album, \\"Dear Sir\\"), \\"Ice Water,\\" \\"Enough,\\" and \\"Not What You Want.\\" Then, out of the blue, this trio (Chan, Steve Shelly, Tim Foljahn), lapses into familiar, melodic chords sidling into an iconic cover of Hank Williams' \\"Still In Love\\"--what diversity. Buy this album, listen to it repeatedly and then view some 1995 Cat Power videos on YouTube!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Myra Lee","review":"A mysterious title for such a mysterious album. At first while getting this album I had no idea what I was getting myself into. I mean I do own some Cat Power music but this album is driven by true emotion. These emotions are not usally what people write to. This stuff is true it's driven by anger and frustration. Chan's voice gives such a great presentation of what she is feeling but also comes lightly to let you know it is going to be ok. The contrast of this album to all the others is so amazing that it could only have been done by Chan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stripling is Sensational!","review":"I never heard of Mr. Stripling until he judged the Elmhurst College Jazz Festival.

The first time I heard it, I was driving in my car. I had just arrived at the store, but I couldn't turn off this song. In fact, I replayed the track before shutting off the engine.

IMO, only the most tone deaf people would buy this load.Sexy Back is trite, juvenile and unutterably boring, the lyrics sound like jr. high schoolers panting over their personal libido. At age 25 or so, you would think Timberlake had matured a little and/or had gotten himself a bit of voice training.Not a chance.Here is a mean faced guy with a waay nasty attitude who \\"dogs\\" other artists and criticizes them for having no vocal talent.

So, since I was purchasing, I decided to start with my favorite of the four. I loved the attraction between Diane & Tennessee & the background research that EP obviously labored over was just enough to add an interesting diminsion to the story. By the time the attraction between Ten & Diane hit high speed in the love factor, I was convinced Tennessee is the hottest hero to come out of the typed word since Rhett Butler!

Then when the hero starts to treat her with the kind of indifference she claims she wants, she gets annoyed because he doesn't notice her as a woman. I mean sheez! Make up your mind, willya? She's constantly fighting this battle between her unwilling attraction to the hero and her old fears of all men. I can't identify with that kind of immature, irrational, erratic temperament.

It ain't worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Important info -- but short on story.","review":"I would recommend reading this book, if only to stay informed on the details of the characters. This story didn't really unfold anything interesting about Tennessee's history. A really great guy, all in all, but we don't know why. As for Diana, I just don't get her. Okay, her dad was a grump and her ex forced himself on her; for this, she hates and fears all men?Once she finally comes to her senses and realizes she wants to enjoy herself with Ten, then the story heats up. But the heat is practically at the end of the book!I love the way the author consistently puts so much detail about her settings into all of her stories -- the setting becomes a character. I feel like I'm actually learning something. But, in this case, the main character was the mystery of the Anasazi people and the minor story was the relationship of Diana and Ten."},{"rating":"1","title":"excellent account of Anasazi history I have ever read","review":"Unfortunately I thought I was buying a romance novel.

Not only is it quicker, but it keeps the flow up in both better."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!!","review":"I got this pump about 2 days before my baby was born.

It was working okay. It took me one half to one hour to pump about 4 ounces. It also had a few problems with the milk dropping into the bottle. These were not major problems at the time. Then, just when I needed it to pump exclusively it died. It acted like it was trying to work but had virtually no suction. No matter what we did, we could not get it working again. I would not suggest buying this pump!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"This pump is useless. It has VERY little power. Just to let you know I got 1oz. in 25 min.

It's not necessarily that it lost suction- I still felt suction, but this pump only pumped a significant amount of milk once. The other times I used it, it could draw no more than 1/8 of an oz. I was horribly disappointed, and found myself in a real bind when suddenly faced with a ct-scan and unable to let him nurse for 24 hours.

I've used it to relieve engorgement and pump extra to keep in the freezer just in case. I've never had any mechanical issues . . . in fact, when I pulled it out of storage last week I was able to pump 6 oz. in 10 minutes on 2.5-year-old batteries!My only complaint is that the rubber horn cover doesn't stay put and traps milk between the cover and the horn itself; I removed the cover and just don't use it. It makes no difference in the functionality of the pump itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, but not great","review":"I received this pump as a gift at one of my showers, and it has been okay. I rarely need to pump milk since I stay home with my daughter, but it is nice to be able to every once in a while if I need to. This pump is loud and it has to be on the highest setting in order for it to work. Mine does not have enough power on batteries, so I always have to have it plugged in. I am able to get about 8 oz in 15 minutes, but lately I think that it has lost some of it's power and I'm afraid it isn't going to last much longer. The good things about it are that it doesn't hurt, and it it easy to clean and use."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's ok for a few uses","review":"I bought this pump after buying a double pump by first years (read seperate review) to take to work. It was small and seemed to work fairly well at home. When it was used on a constant basis it slowly started to lose suction. Then about 6 weeks after using the pump it stopped completely. I was so glad I hung unto my other pump. This is not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I have used a Medela Pump in Style for two babies, but I got caught in a pinch recently and was forced to buy another pump while out-of-town. Even on the maximum suction setting, this pump barely worked. I had to massage/squeeze my breasts to express any milk. Getting any reasonable amount of milk takes a ridiculously long time and the motor is REALLY loud. I'm sure I would have been better off buying a manual pump for this occasion. I have a newfound respect for the fine piece of equipment my Medela is...worth the extra $[...]."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't work at all","review":"this pump is not worth a cent - the suction is next to nothing. i can express 6+ oz by hand in 15 min, but ZERO oz with this pump!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes Expressing HARDER","review":"As if being a new mom, working, breastfeeding, and a new baby aren't challenging enough, along comes the Evenflo Comfort breast pump! I've used a Gerber pump for 7 mos and when it stopped working I bought this one. It has been a month and a half and I utterly regret it. I pump twice a day and it is horrible! The rubber seals need to be perfectly installed and even if it works for the 1st 15 mins that doesn't mean it will keep working. You have to constantly keep an eye on it, instead of relaxing, if not you will be covered in milk (as I have often been). I normally love Evenflo products but this one falls short of all my expectations."},{"rating":"1","title":"useless","review":"I bought this pump for use with my second child. With my first I used a manual which worked well. I thought that with my second it would be nice to try an auto pump thinking,... I suppose like a man \\"more power.\\" I figured put some power behind the pump and I could pump quicker and easier. WRONG!! At maximum power this pump hardly has enough strength to pump an ounce in 10 minutes. Also the pump comes with one bottle to pump into that is a very small mouthed opening. The bottle fell in my dishwasher being destroyed ealry on. Of course it was very difficult to find a replacement bottle. Once I did I realized it was more money down the drain since the pump is USELESS! I quickly have gone back to old reliable, the manual pump."},{"rating":"1","title":"IF I could give 0 STARS I would","review":"This one is a total waste of plastic. I used it once a day and it lasted 7. I hate evenflo products but went against my better judgement anyway. The motor weakened by the day. IT IS LOUD!!! ALL NOISE NO WORK! I had to squeeze with the motor at the HIGHEST setting to get just a little.I would get about a total of 4-5oz after 30-45 min. When I called the company(which has the worst hours), they just sent me a bag of parts and said you figure it out. It took 2 wks for them to arrive. Parts made no difference. First they said no return. I said like hell you wont. Then they said only half the MSRP with me paying shipping. I still have the damn thing. Not even worth going to the PO for half the price minus shipping. I ended up with a free brand new medela hand pump from WIC(if I had only asked from the get go). With that one, I got a total of 10oz in 5-10 min. Next time around, I will fork out the money for the electric medelas. Cost more but they know what they are making."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it.","review":"This is my second evenflo pump. You would think i learned the first time. The inlet where the cord plugs into broke, and it doesnt work with batteries. It lasted three weeks. Also, the milk gets sucked into the motor very easily. Your better off spending the money on a really good one. This isnt for the serious pumper!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It works for a few months then dies","review":"I bought this pump december 12th 2005 after my 3 day old wouldn't latch on. Well I used it everyday every 2-3 hours and it worked great! I could pump about 3 oz each breast then it grew to 5 oz but the milk would get caugt in the tube all the time. First the cord started messing up. I had to twist it around for it to turn on and stay on. So I tried with batteries to give the cord a rest but the batteries didn't work. Then the cord stopped working altogether. Finally I got the batteries to work and for 2 weeks. Then one day while I was at work the suction just went from great to poor. I could only pump 2 oz then it went down to 1 1/2oz. Please spend a little more money for a better quality more expensive pump that will last longer. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone who plans on breastfeeding for more than 3 months. I guess it is ok if its just for an occasional pump."},{"rating":"1","title":"Threw it away!","review":"This pump worked for about a week. It kept getting milk sucked into the motor and finaly it just died. I should have known. I bought a meleda single pump to replace it and it works great. I didn't pay full price for this thankfully so I just threw it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only worked for a while","review":"I've only been using this pump for about 3 months now for pumping at work. It seemed to work okay at first as I tried to get the hang of how to use it being a first time mom. As time went by, the unit would make a weird noise and the suction was noticeably affected. I would have to turn off the unit, detach the plastic piece and then reattach and start the process all over again. By this time, the frustration in getting the thing to sound and suck right again and trying to pinpoint what was wrong, made my let down reflex go away. This product is a waste of time, money and a good attitude about pumping. I'm giving a manual pump a shot, by a different brand and with higher ratings."},{"rating":"1","title":"The money you think you'd save with this pump ends up being a waste of money","review":"Thinking about saving money?? (who doesn't in this difficult times?) Then steer clear from this pump. Its price may be alluring, but this pump does not work. It is a waste of money! Unless you are severely engorged and leaking, it takes FOREVER just to get a few ounces. And suction gets worse over time.The reason why I did not give this pump one star, it's because there are pumps out there that are even worse -like the Gerger pump with massaging action-."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"It's a total piece of junk and not worth wasting your money. It worked fine to start with; I used it two to three times a day. Now after about two weeks, the motor is going out. It was also extremely loud! I wanted something small & inexpensive because this is my last child so I cannot justify spending $200-$300 on something I won't be using again. I recommend Medela instead; even lactation consulants recommend that brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Ever","review":"Don't be fooled by the price. This pump is horrible. It lost a great deal of suction. It is heavy and loud. Milk flows through the tubing that milk should not even touch. All around waste of money. If you want a good pump get a Lanisoh. I have had no issues with it and can pump for 15-20 min and fill up my bottles and is much more quieter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken in 6 months- No replacement parts available","review":"Unless you only intend to pump for a short period of time and only occasionally, I would not recommend this pump for the following reasons:1. It's noisy. If you live in an apartment and try to pump while the baby is asleep, you might wake it up.2. If you lean back into a relaxed position while using it, the milk will not drain into the bottle, and may drip down the front of you.3. I was not able to get a replacement part when mine cracked. It cracked because I was using an Evenflo glass bottle with it instead of the plastic bottle it comes with.4. The Lansinoh pump I bought to replace it works much better with the Evenflo glass bottles than this Evenflo pump.5. It takes a looong time to pump, especially because you have to do one side at a time with this model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad for occasional use","review":"I brought this pump when I had my daughter back in 2003 for occasional pumping as I was a stay home mom and needed to pump to have my daughter watched when I had some errands to do. This worked good for me. Assembling the pump is easy and it took me 4-5 times to learn how to get more milk. It only has variable suction but not speed. I was always able to pump about 4-5 ounces in about 20 minutes which was fine for occasional use. The suction hurts a bit and the rubber insert was useless for me. I kept it in storage and opened it after 3 years as I had my son in Feb 07. When I pumped it for my son it gave me the same results. I am happy with this one, but now I am working full time and need a better pump."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money!","review":"The pump did not supply enough suction battery or electric wise. I found myself doing all the work anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"I purchased this pump when my first child was born 2 years ago. I was able to nurse for very long which was good because the pump died on me about 2 months later. After my second child was born 8 weeks ago, I was in need of a new pump. I gave it another try hoping the first one was simply a bad unit.I was wrong! This unit again lost all suction after 8 weeks. At 5 am when needed most. I did some research and foudn that if you wet the pieces it will work again. which it did but the suction was so low (on max) it barely did the job. DO NOT PURCHASE THIS PRODUCT! Even when it is working it has to be on maximum, the low settings are way too low. And it is loud! If you are pregant plan on spending good money to get a good pump, this one is tempting because of the price but its not worth the hassle or the engorged breasts at 5 am when it breaks down."},{"rating":"1","title":"CAUTION- THIS PUMP IS DANGEROUS","review":"I bought this pump shortly before returning to work because I travel a lot during the day and it is very portable. When I returned my hospital pump my lacatation specialist told me that Evenflo breast pumps can cause serious tissue damage. DO NOT USE THIS PRODCUT!!

The Avent Isis is only a few dollars more and much safer to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product is awful","review":"I received this pump as a gift. The first time I used it I got a few ounces from my breasts. After the first use however it was like it lost power and wouldn't hardly suction anything.

I would not recommend this product to my worst enemy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I purchased the double model of this same pump. It is not worth the money. Shortly after purchasing it, I had to go and rent a pump from a hospital because this pump was too slow to keep up my milk supply. The valve leading into the bottle gets stuck on both pumps so the milk fills up in the chamber without going into the bottle. If I leave it, it floods the motor and connection tube. I have to turn the pump off about every minute and hit the bottles on the counter so that the milk will spill out into the bottles. This is very annoying. It is also VERY loud!!! I would not recommend this product to anyone! It was my only option during Hurricane Francis and Hurricane Jeanne when the power was out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the cost!!!","review":"I bought 2 of these pumps because they were out of the double pump.

I did not have the receipts from those 1st 2 but I called evenflo anyway. They were wonderful they sent me 2 replacement hand pieces no questions asked. When they arrived neither of them worked on high only on low...and I need high. Don't buy...find something else!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great inexpensive pump","review":"This is a great pump for an inexpensive price. It works just as well as the hospital pumps if not better.

I wouldn't have minded the noise if it had pumped as fast as my Medela Harmony, but it didn't even come close. I hate that I wasted my money. If you only need a pump for occasional use, I definitely suggest the Medela Harmony manual pump, which is about the same price."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time and money","review":"Don't even waste your time.

I used this pump when we went to my in laws, so yes it was good for occasional use, I think I used it four times and the milk started to get to stuck in the valve and it vibrates! If you don't mind that, then you should get it for occasion use; I ended up getting a manual pump; which is the same price, should have just put that on my registry instead!

It has trouble picking-up PBS sometimes, which really annoys me.It was an improvement over the previous Antenna I had, that was meant for analog signals. However I bought a $20 GE Flat Panel Antenna at Target, and it worked much better than the RCA. I find sometimes I need to adjust the RCA for it to get a signal. It also seems to cut-out if people are walking around in the room. No Problems with the GE. I even attached a signal amplifier to it, and it didn't seem to help much. I would just get a another Antenna for a little more money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than its own model","review":"I purchased RCA ANT301 to replace the old one, also RCA, bought 5 years ago, that has one of the rods broken.However, the new one is worse than the old one, even with a broken wing.The screen becomes blurer with many flies flying all over.I have to replace it with the old and broken one.I do not know which of RCAs is worth buying, for the old one is now obsolete."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good UHF reception, horrible VHF reception","review":"I am about forty miles from the broadcast towers. The ANT301's UHF reception was very good but VHF reception is poor. It picked up one of the five VHF channels in the area.

If you are looking for an inexpensive amplified antenna, the RCA ANT1250 is a better choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-Priced","review":"I bought this to improve the reception of the ANT110, a much cheaper model that had good reception overall but I wanted much more. I spent $30 for the ANT301 and overall it was not worth the cost. I plugged in the amplifier and it actually made things WORSE. But when I removed the amplifier I got much better reception, but the $20 ANT103 is the same thing with no amplifier so it has similar reception. If your looking for great reception go with Trek's version but if you are looking for decent reception go with the ANT103. For this, avoid it, it's overpriced and the amplifier is worse than a push-pin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak at best","review":"I figured an amplified antenna would be better than a regular one.

They have the antennas swivel heads on so tight that they easily just snap off. This also has a huge clumsy AC plug which is unnecessary and a waste of precious plug space. When I returned this to the store, I saw another person retuning this exact same model also. GE has a much better model that I bought instead that doesn't break and doesn't have any AC plug which works wonderfully. Don't waste your money on this RCA antenna. I give it ZERO stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Terrible","review":"This antenna is a huge waste of money. I live in a strong signal area (<5 miles to the towers). On an analog tv this antenna produced an extremely noisy picture due to the poor amplifier. Without the amplifier, this antenna did not produce a picture. On a digital tv this antenna did ok. However, a cheap pair of rabbit ears with a UHF loop greatly outperformed this antenna both on digital and analog tvs. I would not recommend the RCA ANT301 to anyone, even if were free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I got this antenna when I bought the digital box converter thing. At first I thought I lived in an area of bad reception. I could only get 2 watchable channels and 2 with really bad reception. So for 4 months I had my antenna connected directly to my tv, getting regular analog signal. After reading the reviews (which are better) of the passive rca antenna that's basically this one but withouth the amplifier, I decided to connect it back to the digital converter without plugging the antenna into the power. To my surprise I am know getting 20 perfectly clear channels. Cannot believe but it is true. Go for the unamplified rca antenna which is cheaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"almost like cable","review":"I bought 4 amplified antennas to test which one worked the best for my home. This was the least expensive. It had some shadows, but it also had up to 2 channels as good as cable. I had to changing it to get a good picture, but not bad.

It would be a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"No better reception than a coax cable","review":"I decided to get rid of cable (too expensive). Living in downtown Milwaukee, I should probably get many channels with an antenna )(one would think). Unfortunately, I didn' have one.

Time to pick up an antenna.I just bought the 301 from best buy. The sales dude said it was the best on the market and he had no complaints or returns. Hooked it up in place of my coax cable contraption. It faired just as well, if not worse.I am returning the antenna and getting the 25 channel cable plan for $13.00 (the one they don't tell you about)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Geez, Why did I buy this junk?","review":"Purely, all-around, awful performance. This RCA antenna looks like it is supposed to do something -- metal poles, ring that goes around in circles, wire jack, electric plug & little dial on the back.... But any spare piece of wire stuck into your TV's antenna jack will do a significantly better job than this horrible rip-off. I'm embarrassed to say that I bought it in good faith from a Big Box store. It shouldn't be for sale anywhere. Boo hoo, my poor dollars went pay for this swiveling piece of crapolla. What's the point of plugging it in and turning some little \\"gain\\" knob when all it does is makes the picture WORSE than if you had no antenna at all. I can't say enough about how terrible this is, and how ashamed I think RCA should feel for pushing this on distributors. I will not buy anything made by RCA in good faith again because of this stupid product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Junk","review":"I went through a couple pair of these before giving up on the idea. They are made so poorly that they don't last at all. They have zero resistance to moisture, and they corrode quickly unless you remove them from the bike when you are not riding. The construction is very poor - cheap circuit board with poor solder joints and a poor mechanical interface to the LED, which acts as the linkage for the pushbutton switch. The whole assembly is flimsy and breaks easily when attempting to change the batteries.I'm really tired of cheap garbage made you know where selling at these kind of premium prices. For $30, a pair of bar end lights should be IP55 or better and use standard batteries.

The strengths of this book are its textbook format and the informal exercises that are presented for the reader at the end of every chapter. There is also a great deal of compilation from other relevant gp works presented in a localized, intra-chapter basis. The book is thus highly digestable to a newcomer, and is a far less time-consuming way to learn about GP than through the \\"expert\\" papers on the web.

The book falls short on informing you correctly about the Cisco product line (left out a lot of products) and you will miss a lot of the paperwork and planning questions on the CCDA test. I found the book to be an easy read, but it is not up to the standard that I have found with other Lammel books.

Fleming's words and descriptions do not give justice to the depth of many of the stories told throughout the novel. Tragedies such as the unexpected death of her coach in a plane crash, and the deaths of her parents are stated in a sentence or two, never getting into the emotions that surely surrounded the experiences. Readers looking for a first-hand recount of Fleming's experience with competitive skating should also beware. She just barely skims the surface of the pressures and glory of being an Olympic medal winner and World Championship title holder. Humorous and detailed stories that often liven up autobiographies are also few and far between.

Great reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and surprisingly shallow","review":"I admire and respect Peggy Fleming's skating talent and her commentary with Dick Button is legendary in the sport. However, this book was surprisingly disappointing. It is very disjointed and she basically spends too much time telling us how wonderful, determined, graceful and talented she is rather than showing us examples and stories in her life and letting us draw that conclusion for ourselves. I have no doubt she is all of those things, but the ego that is displayed in this self-serving book is unprecidented in any of many biographies I have ever read. There were a few humourous stories, and her dedication to skating and her family is obvious and admirable. The number of times she tells us how great she is overshadows her efforts to be top notch in whatever she does.

While Peggy Fleming's skating style will always be my favorite, reading this book felt like an entertainer who never really connected with the audience.The book attempts to cover a smattering of events in the author's life but it was too superficial to hold my interest. Here's two examples:-- Peggy alludes to her mother's domineering personality and provides the example of taking control her wedding, but doesn't get into any of the details or how this made her feel.-- Peggy also mentions a favorite marinated pork recipe that she enjoys making for her family, and it would've seemed fitting that the recipe be included but it wasn't.I'm not sure what the focus or the purpose of this book was/is.

There may be wood in there somewhere but it is covered with leather (that I doubt is real leather) with plastic edging. It just looks and feels really cheap.I planned on giving this as a gift and would be embarrassed to do so. I'm regretting my assumption that paying more would get me more quality. I am in the process of returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality and not as advertised","review":"This Revere \\"tri-ply\\" saucepan is cheaply made, lightweight, and not 18/10 stainless steel as the product description states. The aluminum disk is applied to the bottom of the saucepan; the disk is not integral to the pan's constuction and does not cover the bottom of the saucepan. There's more than a half-inch of space between the outside edge of the disk and the saucepan's outside bottom edge; unless very low heat is used, food sticks where the disk doesn't cover. The saucepan also discolors and the finish dulls easily. There are several cheaper, more efficient, higher-quality 1-quart saucepans available; don't waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"name brand gone bad","review":"Bought 2 of these on the strengh of a revere 1 quart pan I have had since the late 60's.

The author is clearly an amateur - I was not surprised to see this is her first book. The story barely held my interest, the characters were flat, shallow, and one-dimensional and relied completely on stereotypes. The book has a series of one-liners that you can tell the author thought were witty and wrote onto a list, then plucked them off one by one to use in her book. It appears that the writer thinks her writing is clever and witty, but it really just reads like a sad first-attempt at a novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book, reminds me of my mom","review":"love the book, however, I just want to shake the mother.

In today's day of telemarketing, the main character holds one of those most-hated jobs, relegated to calling people who don't want to be bothered. She reminds us that telemarketers, too, are humans, although treated like \\"livestock\\" on a slaughter line. Somehow she takes the story of a young woman's pathetic circumstance and turns it into a satirical sitcom that is well worth the time to sit and read. I thoroughly enjoyed being entertained by French's refreshing storytelling in this wonderful tale of comedic woe or woeful comedy.

The packaging was such that it would be very inconvenient to send it back. Much to my dismay, I noticed on the back of the pot: Revere - Indonesia. Paul Revere was all about the United States of America. That's number 1. Number 2 is: I noticed some differences between the made in Indonesia pot and the pot that was made in Clinton, Illinois, namely that the Indonesian pot is lighter in weight, the handle really does look like it would burn more easily and would break more easily than the sturdy handle on the pots manufactured in the USA. And the inside for some reason doesn't seem to be as smooth.So, hopefully, I can somehow find my way to the money it'll take to buy some USA made steel pots from Pennsylvania that I saw in a local shop.

Uh, wrong. The thin flash of copper on the Revere pots is for appearance's sake. If you want smooth, even heat you have to find the pots with the aluminum disk bonded to the bottom. Several years ago, Consumer Reports did a piece on this with thermographs of the bottoms of the different types of pot; if you're interested and in particular if anyone wants to argue the merits of Revere's copper-coated pots, it'll take some digging but it's worth it.Repeat: copper-bottom stainless is WORTHLESS for evening the heat."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Recommended for Candy Making","review":"I bought the pans for candy making.

I had problems with both of them. The bottom on these felt thinner than the original. Both bottoms warped after the first couple of uses and one started super heating the boiling water - causing water to explode out of the pan. Very disappointing.

They should pull this terrible product off the market immediately -- it's simply irresponsible for this company to sell this crap to it's customers.See attached picture -- the paper towel on the left shows how much metallic residue was on the pot AFTER it came from the dishwasher.

I was a true fan. So to open a new set at Christmas this year delighted me, right up until I used the new pans. I used only the frying pan and the soup pot. When I fried eggs in the frying pan, after I'd added the eggs, but before the pan reached optimum temperature, the whole pan bowled. We have a new flat top range, and it was obvious immediately.

The tent's sack easily holds everything with no problems. Many tent manufacturers will give you a packing sack that can seemingly only be packed by a robot with expertise in applied physics. Not this tent. It easily packs up.My only caveat is, because it's a 1 person tent, it can be snug and that means you'll rub up against the sided. Morning condensation could be your wake up call. This is especially problematic for those who use down sleeping bags that AREN'T treated. Just a fair warning.Other than that, it's a good tent if you need to set one up far off the beaten path.

Like much of Warhol's oeuvre, the Screen Tests merit sustained viewing only if you're willing to invest a lot in the experience. Vol 1 provides innarestin' background for people so inclined. Might buy Vol 2, if it isn't bloated with stuff on the Warhol-Morrissey productions."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 disks of fun","review":"We had just watched the movie Brassed Off and were inspired to look for recordings by the colliery band in the movie.

This book won the Edgar Award for the Best First Novel. PI Holland Taylor has lost his wife and daughter to a drunk driver. When the driver of the car, John Brown, is found murdered, the police think Holland is the prime suspect. To clear his name, he begins to search for the real killer. Every avenue he looks into leads to C. C. Monroe, a candidate for the governor of Minnesota. The plot is rather complex, but I really liked the novel and the character of Holland Taylor who has some personal demons that he struggles to deal with. I especially enjoyed the parts with Ogilvy, his pet rabbit, because we own a male lop-eared rabbit. This is an excellent debut novel, and I look forward to reading the next 2 Holland Taylor novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"A cluttered and disappointing mystery.","review":"Despite having won the Edgar Award, \\"Penance\\" left me disappointed. Holland Taylor, a Private Investigator who was formerly a homicide detective in Minnesota, starts off as an interesting character and the plot seems to hold promise. However, as the book proceeds, Taylor rapidly becomes less sympathetic, and his facile observations on life become grating. Morever, the plot twists are generally uninteresting, with the story ending in a whimper rather than a bang.Perhaps there's better work down the road for David Housewright, but I found this to be an unimpressive start"},{"rating":"2","title":"deeply moving movie","review":"I won't go into much detail.It was shot very well.

She is a little stiff and apparently confused.Is she a business executive or a femme fatale. She wears a backless dress to a business meeting?Dave wears womens shoes, which everyone knows are more uncomfortable then mens shoes.The opening line was great,But the story became confusing and boring.The person who kills the scientist is not much of a mystery, and the psychopath remains at large.I would hope that the characters become more realistic,fun, and caring as the series continues.A good beginning,average middle, and strange ending with many loose ends."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reprint city...","review":"This book has 5 condensed versions of previously published books (meaning old). I bought it thinking it was a new collection of stort stories. Not only were the stories previously (and I do mean previously) published, they were condensed to the point that they were silly. As I was reading, it was very obvious when the story was being condensed, as the continuity of the story was ruined. If you like Jayne Krentz, and/or the other authors in this book, buy the previously published non-condensed works.

The telescope manufacturer offers the T-mount, and then you adapt your camera to it. I later learned that I could have just used my OM to E-volt adapter with my old OM to T-mount, but this way I can still keep my film camera set up for astrophotography separately. Because of the very fine threads on the T-mount, though, changing adapters is not as easy as it sounds.

I have to say I was a bit disappointed. Apparently Tess tried out romance before she moved over to medical thrillers and this is a sad mix of Harlequin romance with just a little bit of thrill worked in the story. If you are looking for a book that is more romance than I would rec. reading this one. But if you are searching for a larger quantity of medical info & thrills...keep on searching. Tess is heading in the right direction (as seen in Harvest & Bloodstream) but needs to get past the mushy romance angle. Final thought: It's not her best work, but with paperbacks it's worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peggy Sue Got Murdered","review":"Tess Gerritson is always fabulous.

Paul Kelly has been described as the Austrailian Bob Dylan, but I'm sure over there, much like it is here, that is a dangerous thing. If anything, he's a cross between a subdued Paul Westerberg and a reflective John Hiatt. Kelly has a pretty great ability to weave a tale together and blend it into an infectius melody. His lyrics, while not always complex, have a way of leaving it up to the listener to explain away, but not before he has dragged one of your emotions into the picture. If there is doubt about purchasing this CD, find a way to listen to \\"Love Never Runs On Time\\", and then tell me you don't want it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wanted Man","review":"As usual, another fabulous album from one of Australia's great songwriter/artists.

I bought one for both of my skis (2002 SeaDoo RX DI & 2009 Yamaha FX SHO) and they worked flawlessly. I was originally worried that the hook might be too small to attach to the ski hooks but they were perfect. They held the skis in place even in choppy/windy wether. I even left them anchored overnight and throughout the day when not in use. The construction appears to be solid and after a season of use they are still in nearly perfect condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"very sturdy","review":"Just bought two of these, very nice for holding seadoo.

However, the black tank design was horrible and easily leaked on the first camping trip....what a mess! Unlike a Thetford, the waste cap is directly on the back of this unit, which means any slight movement of the unit will begin to unscrew the cap and cause the unit to leak. The side clips and main seal between top and bottom pieces are also prone to leaks and breakage. So, I'm throwing this one out and buying another Thetford."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"Despite the other reviews, we decided to take a risk on purchasing this toilet for our camping trip.

I figured maybe I didnt have the knobs screwed on right.. but.. the 2nd time I emptied it, I really tried to be oh, so careful, and it still leaked.. was a disgusting mess.. it must have leaked through the flush hole. And then, when I thought it was all out, I went out side to take the garden hose to rinse it out. It looked like all the waste was out so I tipped it upside down and wammo! It still had waste flying out. What a waste of money. I am not using it again and taking the chance of it leaking.Going to buy one of those ones that has a bucket and empty it every day.and then , I read other's reviews... and wished I had read them before I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks like a sieve","review":"This portable toilet worked okay for first week we had it. Then, the hose inside attached to the bellows pump, fell off inside the top half (water tank) so now we have to carry water in jugs to rinse it/flush it.

It was more a history of gardens than anything else. They described historic gardens in cursory detail.

If you're looking for inspiration or how-to's, bypass this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was really disappointed in this book - it's more of an art history book than a gardening book, and it's a history of some fairly insignificant art at that (with some exceptions).

I was studying for the exam and was getting intimidated by these questions because I was answering over 50% wrong. I recently took (and passed) the exam and found those questions to be relatively simple and straighforward. Questions that you would expect in a real work environment.

In my opinion, if you want to minimize your study time and maximize your PMBOK comprehension then DO NOT USE THIS BOOK.In my opinion it is needlessly confusing and out of synch with the rhythm of the PMP exam-- which tends to have more direct questions. I used the Mulcahy book, which was more to the point and had questions that more closely resembled the actual PMP format.My Mulcahy practice exams were coming in at about 70% after the first read through of her book and over 90% after the third read through.

The cute scenarios didn't bug me as much as the lack of valuable insight into how to improve my score on the exam. After a couple of chapters, I simply stopped using it. Having now taken and passed the exam with 30 points to spare, I can confidently say this book was a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"Entirely agree with the reviewers that indicate that this guide is a waste of time and money. I found that Rita Mulcahy's book is far superior to this book. Ward's guide only includes questions and does not provide any insight into how to prepare for the exam. In fact, the questions tend to indicate that much more preparation is required to pass the exam. Many of questions reference very specific and arcane management concepts that are not useful.

Mr Faragasso's own weak drawings offered as examples should serve as ample warning that he is not in any way a master draughtsman and his instructional notes are on the same level. It is a backward, fragmented approach. How he has survived at the Art Student's League surprises me."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a back saver!","review":"My Mom bought this for her house and it is wonderful I think I am going to trade her for mine. If you are going to use the changing table it is great the extra height really saves your back. Also that you have area to put the wipes and other changing needs. And I loved that the bassinet area is the whole width vs. only half as mine (Jeep Sahara Limited XT). Don't get me wrong I like mine a lot but I love this one. This is a really well designed and thought out product."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE","review":"I loved this playard when I purchased it, but then I tried to travel with it and it is impossible to breakdown. The changer is nice when in use, but you simply can not travel with it. In fact, it will not even fit in the carry bag! Look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gift","review":"We received this P-n-P as a gift...what a wonderful gift it has been! We use it in the family room as a place to lay our son down for naps. He can still see us while in the 'bassinet' which I believe helps soothe him during daytime snoozes. The mobile is not interesting at all but I took the bears off (they are removable) and put our travel mobile on (caterpillar mobile) and he loves it!Also, the P-n-P is lightweight and easy to move if needed. We have hardwood floors so dust bunnies tend to accumulate under it. I just roll it out of it's space, dust, then roll it back...no problem!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love love love....and going to use it again","review":"So I had put this on my wish list at BRU and got it for my baby shower. I am a big Green fan so that was the ONLy reason I wanted it. When my son was born we lived in a one room studio apt and could barely move around ourselves, so the thought of setting up the massive crib we also got was just crazy. We set this up and he loved it. He was safe and cozy and wasn't able to fall out. Now that he is two... and us being from michigan.. when we go to visit families for the holidays this is his bed. It is easy and light to just collapes and carry to the car. Now that I am pregnant again. I will def be using this in our room while the baby is a newborn, and allowing our son to get used to the idea of having to share his room."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love ALMOST everything about this Pack n Play","review":"This is a great Pack n Play. We selected it because of the diaper changing station, which provided us with a complete changing area downstairs. The diaper and wipe compartments are wonderful and we have used the two pockets for storing things like rubbing alcohol, extra socks, bibs, burp cloths, medication, and a bottle of hand sanitizer. The only complaint is that the mobile requires an actual person to spin it. This is unfortunate because my 3 month old daughter loves to see those bears twirl around. This is really just a minor complaint because I've caught my daughter smiling and \\"talking\\" to those bears as they hang motionless above her."},{"rating":"1","title":"it really is flimsy","review":"I have found this to be the most impractical pack and play yet. I am the mother of five children under 6 and have three different versions for my moms house, my house and a vacation home. I am sorry I spent the extra money on this. It wobbles and truly is not good for sleeping. Wish I could return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is the worst pack and play ever","review":"I am so disappointed with my purchase. FLimsy and trendy. New moms don't be fooled....this is not worth the money or any money. And on another note, I am tired of watching my friends use these pack and plays as make shift bassinets for the first few months..read on the inserts..for naps. The bassinet included in these pack and plays do not provide enough support. Care about your babies and put them in a real bassinet or the crib."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Kihoalu!","review":"Ledward is a master slack key player and plays some classics on this album.

I am currently selling using needs based (5th g) and questions based (6th g) techniques and have always felt there are something important missing. I didn't know why until I started to search for the answer and found it with Hyrum W. Smiths books (what matters most and the 10 natural laws of successful time and life management).Then I stumbled onto 'clients forever' and discovered in a revelation that it is exactly the missing link. I tried it on some leads and it works! This book would be able to make my life easier and my income higher.However, I would suggest that those who want to use the technique combine it with Hyrum's Franklin Planning system because they matched exactly.Well worth the time invested to learn the knowledge!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow, what a business builder!","review":"Clients Forever is a hands on plan to increase your productivity and customer satisfaction. I was shocked to get results before I finished the book! Read this book if you want to satisfy your number one client - yourself. I have continued to re-read sections of this book to keep my focus on behaviors that will net my clients and myself the most amazing results.I also enjoyed the author's humor and enlightened perspective on the driving factors of customer satisfaciton.Flo Ligon"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nursery School hops with the hippos","review":"I bought this book to read at my nursery school.

Both adults and kids will love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Booooooooooring","review":"this DVD can be sumed in one word,snorrrrrrrrrrrrre.I had to force my eyes open just to make it through the first scene.And why call it blood sister of \\"LESBIAN\\" sin when there is no one lesbain scene except when sister anger kissed the other girl??? I forgot her name???? any way DON'T BUY THIS DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont Buy","review":"This is the worst movie I've seen. There is just one short lesbian scene with kissing(...)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely awful","review":"There's almost nothing to recommend this film. A few pretty girls, not that you can't find prettier elsewhere. No decent acting. No decent plot. Not even any decent sex scenes if you got it for porn value. No actual lesbian scenes -- the title is nothing but false advertizing. No humor, and humor is the saving grace of all the worthwhile Troma films (\\"Cannibal: The Musical\\" and \\"Class of Nuke 'Em High\\" being my personal favorites). I've seen some turkeys in my time, but I've never felt so cheated as in this film. AVOID!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fab Ugly Doll!","review":"Very cute, soft, squishy. My 9 yr old daughter is nuts about Ugly Dolls-- and this one is no exception!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So fun!","review":"A great unique stuffed toy, that prompts imaginative play with my children. The Ugly Doll series is a great alternative for kids. It makes playing with monsters fun and not scary. We have this one, as well as a few of the others. Totally worth the money and the children are never disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even teens can love toys!","review":"I am in college and have several ugly dolls and absolutely love them. They are adorable, soft and even come with names and personalities. Peaco is very cute and cuddly. He is made of a soft fleece that ages over time, but is still in great shape. The only thing that worries me is that the arms and ears are a bit narrow at points, so I worry about them maybe coming off. They are so ugly they are cute!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very interesting book on this topic","review":"The text is quite advanced but my 12-year-old granddaughter was enthralled with this book, which she used as a reference for a 6th grade report. Nice pictures!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money!","review":"The pocket chart itself it really nice and seems durable. But the cards are a complete waste. First, they are paper thin and without laminating they would not last long. Second, the font for the numbers is horrible and the six's and nine's look the same. Not good for teaching little kids... and Third, the numbers are colored all crazy and confusing and really not needed. I had a pocket chart for my kids at home and the numbers were made on hard board and with good font so I took them into my class."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY?","review":"Why would anyone pay for a CD of programs that are available online? All the recipes can be googled. My main problem with Melissa is that she lacks originality. She has a large stock of books and old cooking magazines and repurposes recipes giving herself credit for ideas that are NOT hers. For instance, her picnic in a mason jar was published in Gourmet Magazine in 2005. She fashions herself after Ina Garten yet there is no way that she can come anywhere close to Ina's style, panache and winning personality.If you are cooking, you want a recipe on hand and you don't want to have to use a CD. So, if you are one of the loonies who feels the need to pay $500 for a CD, you can find the printed recipes online. Who would be so stupid? I can't watch her on tv. I have never seen anyone hold a knife and cut like she does and when she eats, she stabs her food like she is out cutting hay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much Love shared","review":"I also really wanted to like this book, it was readable, but I really didn't care for or empathize with either the H or the h.Both Rafe and Carin behaved badly. He expects her to comply with his every demand and basically acts like a brute. She acted immaturely and deliberately provokes him, then acts like the wronged party.At a time when Carin, a new mother, would be taking comfort in her much wanted/loved baby the child, Amy, isn't mentioned for a large chunk of the book.It was hard to believe that they loved each other and that their love would last."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sandra Marton Has come full circle with The Alvares Bride","review":"I was very impressed with \\"The Alvares Bride.\\" Carin and Rafe's characters were very well balanced, their issues were written out, not implied... The fact that Rafe actually had emotions, and was pained by Carin's words made him very realistic. Carin should have told him of her highly paid Investment broker occupation to his face, instead of just implying that she was more fortunate, etc. I am very satisfied with this book, which is something I haven't felt, despite the fact that I buy most monthly Harlequin Presents. Thank you Sandra Marton,YC"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sandra Marton comes through again!","review":"This is a really good one in the continuing saga of the Barons.It's a wonderful love story that captures the essence of true love between two strong characters. You won't want to put it down till it's done....the story is that compelling.Sandra struck gold here...this will be a worthy addition to your library...guaranteed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommended","review":"I have been using this for several months. We are adjacent to a 1 Acre pond and wetland in eastern North Carolina which typically produces abundant mosquitoes. Although they have not been eliminated, their numbers are greatly reduced making evening activity in the yard possible. Unlike some other models, the screen that catches the mosquitoes that have been trapped does not have to be replaced. This unit is less expensive than most models, but does a very good job in a mosquito rich environment."},{"rating":"2","title":"No more mosquitos!!","review":"Friends of mine bought this last summer and raved about it. After visiting their home on muggy August evening, I was convinced. I have been looking for one ever since, and I am so excited to finally find one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing","review":"This product, while it worked, failed to reduce the numbers of black flies in my yard. I still had to douse myself with deet to avoid being bitten. After 10 days from new, the gas flame went out. I tried changing the gas tank, cleaned the unit as instructed by the manufacturer, but still no results. I have stopped trying to make it work. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland","review":"In all honesty I don't know why you'd make box spaghetti when you're already most of the way for making real spaghetti after cooking the meat. For me it was absolutely bland and flavourless. I would never recommend this. I think next time I'll just stick to making spaghetti with regular sauce and noodles. The nice part is that it doesn't take long to make I guess. I was incredibly disappointed with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT AS DESCRIBED","review":"This is NOT the \\"original\\" spaghetti as pictured. It is the \\"Italian\\" Syle Spaghetti.

Look elsewhere!","review":"My average builder put this in and I've replaced it 3 times in 7 years.

I had another contractor put a different system in another area that gets used much, much more and it has lasted 16 years. This system sucks!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Blessed Assurance","review":"One can almost hear the familiar refrains \\"This is my story, this is my song. Praising my Savior all the day long\\" echoing throughout this book. Kudos to Peter and Stowe for having the courage to share what must have been a reliving of a painful past so that others might see Christ. What a compelling story of a dark past transformed into a beautiful swan of testimony!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a bit different","review":"This one's a bit different because Miss Silver is there before anyone turns up dead, a bit less than 1/4 way into the book. She is a houseguest at the Priory when the assorted romantically involved young people arrive. The Priory is, oddly enough, the never-before-seen property of one of these. In a house full of cousins and couples, how long can it be before someone gets murdered over jealousies old and new?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not if you want a real challenge","review":"I like Kimberly Spreen and have worked out with her before. I also enjoy other videos in the Self magazine series. However, if you're looking for a workout that will get your heart pumpinig and your muscles really working, this one isn't for you. I felt like the routine spent way too much time with simple hip-rotations and slow step-touches to be an effective workout. I felt like my time was being wasted more than once during this 49-minute video. On a positive note, this might be a good workout for someone who's looking to get some light activity in their day instead of sitting on the couch. Kimberly has a great attitude, and the outside setting is pretty. It's just hard to recommend this to intermediate/advanced exercisers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for cats who insist running water","review":"I purchased a waterfall style fountain for my cat. It was horrible. On the highest setting it barely made a tiny stream.I picked up this fountain here, and my cat loves it!

You won't have to put up with the \\"turn the faucet on for meee!\\" kitty dance ever again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy pump!","review":"I'm sending this back as the pump is very loud--louder than my refrigerator when it's struggling..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A saving grace for this cat owner","review":"We've had our cat for 6 years, and were growing tired of her hogging the sink to get a drink. The Drinkwell provides her with plenty of fresh flowing water, it is easy to clean, and we no longer worry about her when we're away from home. Her intake of water has increased and she sure seems healthier! I use a toothbrush and baby bottle brush to clean the crevices and holes. You have to change the filter every 4-6 weeks or it will get really gunky and the cat will revert back to the sink!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Already bought the next book.","review":"Melanie Schuster is a very throw writer. She leaves nothing out. She could have ended the book/story several times but she answers the question every romance read asks, what happens after the \\"I DO's\\". I know when I really like a book I often continue the store for myself.I really loved Bennie. She is the true meaning of stand by your man. She is also her own person. Her father is a true A** but his love is true no matter how twisted. I'm from a very large family (12 kids); the book had me missing them all.I will share this book with my book club.The only negative for me is that it went on and on. A bit to worded. She did not have to give every little detail.However I am starting the next book tonight.P.S. I knew Dr. John was Big Benny's son. My mother says when you point one finger @ someone 3 more are pointing back @ you. I hope Melanie talks about it in the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great to be Lucky in Love","review":"This is the first book that i've read by Melanie Schuster BUT certainly will not be my last!!

I liked the fact that Clay and Bennie faught for their love and won. I loved the fact that there wasn't the usual drama that romance novels bring. The story was unique and believable. The main characters were not the only intersting stories in the book. Martin had an interesting story, as well as Lilian and Bump along with Andrew and Renee. The book left me feeling like I not only knew the main characters but all the Devereaux's and Cochran's.
