I stopped reading this book on page 183. That's when President Ryan spews forth all of Clancy's anti-abortion rhetoric to the less than convincing arguments of his chief of staff.This is Clancy's last war for this reader.

I took this book to Hawaii and tried to read it on the plane. Then I tried to read it on the beach. 150 pages into it and it was still going nowhere. I left it at the condo for the next poor unsuspecting sap to pick up and try to read. Clancy has gone seriously downhill since Red Storm Rising."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Slow read","review":"I have been an avid Tom Clancy fan since \\"The Hunt for Red October.\\" I have read all of his single-author books and many of the earlier books for which he is a co-author, but I had to really work to read this book. I must admit that I was not greatly impressed by \\"Rainbow Six\\" when I noticed an increased tendency for Clancy to include more foul language than he had in earlier works. One thing I miss is his clean concise writing and character action and development. I felt like I could read his books and enjoy their inherent complexities and character development without having to work my way through character after character swearing with and at each other. This book also delves into sexual encounters quite early.I greatly enjoy Clancy's other books, but this book is a very bad read. You may call the dialog in this book reality, but I can do without it in my pleasure reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't put it down","review":"I got this book on Monday and finished reading it at 2AM this morning. Once I opened it, I couldn't put it down. For once, Clancy did not spend pages and pages covering technical data until the eyes glazed over. My eyes glazed over, but from fatigue since I couldn't stop reading it. This is a story that once you get into it, you won't want to stop until it is over. I do not know it the hardware described in it is either available or in development, but if it is available, war just won't pay in the future for anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jingo Tom and the Magic Dragon","review":"Unbelievably I continued to read and finish this piece of garbage. Besides the incredible shallowness of the characters and the increase in profanity (I don't think Nixon swore this much) I continue to be deeply disturbed by the overt racism Jingo TC shows toward Asians (Chinese and Japanese in particular). Besides using \\"Chinks\\" and \\"slant eyes\\" as descriptive terms he tries to cover up by making nice talk toward African Americans...sorry can't buy the rich white Baptist Minister trading pulpits with Rev. Jackson in Mississippi...things haven't changed that much in the south...don't know where Tom does research but it isn't below the Mason Dixon. His making the Russians our good buddies now only reinforces the fact that caucasians of any flavor can be trusted and other races are demonic little yellow people.TC needs to grow up and get a new career...this one isn't working."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened To Jack?","review":"Although I made my way through The Bear and the Dragon out of an absurd sense of loyalty to and fondness for the character of Jack Ryan, and for what I knew would ultimately be an exciting world-on-the-edge-of-disaster tale, I cursed Clancy far too regularly throughout the book. How did it happen that all his characters have come to share the same endlessly repeated attitudes? Could every man in the military worth his salt truly despise the \\"tree-huggers\\" and think of women with patriarchal disdain? Even if that were true, must we endure countless repetitions of internal dialogues, irrelevant to the plot, relating to a rehash of Clancy's values that have contaminated all his worthy characters and succeeded in erasing their individuality? Stop the pontificating! Shame on you, Tom Clancy, for turning a wonderful character like Ryan into a flat, faceless drone indistinguishable from all the other single-minded drones in this book. Where in the world was your editor???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hopelessly dull...500 pages too long","review":"A couple chapters into this book it becomes apparent Clancy is coasting on his name and reputation. This book is WAY overwritten. At over 1000 pages, it's a test of endurance to keep turning the pages. Clancy lays down page after page of irrelevant macho jargon when really he should be developing something resembling a plot. It's a mystery to me how anyone could stay interested in this book long enough to finish it. Hey Tom, cut the next one down to 550 pages and maybe I'll consider reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yak, yak, yak.","review":"I put it down after struggling through 600 pages of talk, talk, talk.

Well, I have it now, and what a disappointment it is!To be brief: Mr. Clancy is getting old and grumpy and uses his writing to express his rather boring, old fashioned and conservative political ideas. This must even be a bore for any US reader, but for an international reader it's like reading a 1100 page column in a local small town USA newspaper.Oh, by the way, this book actually features a story somewhere between the lines. And yes, all our favourite characters are in it. It's a shame they are used as background figures."},{"rating":"1","title":"A decent author gone south","review":"Having read most of Tom Clancy's earlier works, I was sorely disappointed by this effort. In fact, I felt cheated. Where in the past Tom Clancy has written books with a good plot and exciting action, this book spends a great amount of time on Clancy's sexist, xenophobic and otherwise unecessary political views. This large tome (1000+ pages) could have been toned down to a few hundred if these distracting comments had been omitted. I would not recommend this book for anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Racism and tiresome main character sink this book","review":"I have read every Tom Clancy book since the beginning. Everyone knows his strengths and weaknesses, so there aren't many surprises. I do expect to be entertained by his books, but I wasn't this time. I simply can't stomach the endless racist remarks; Executive Orders got by with only a few references to \\"ragheads\\" to refer to people of the Islamic faith. Here, however, there are constant and ongoing racist and cultural slurs against Chinese people (I won't dignify them by repeating them). Also, Jack Ryan has become incredibly tiresome. He has turned into a self-righteous, ultra-right-wing character who loathes anyone who disagrees with him and spends all his time whining about how he doesn't want to be President. It's time for Clancy to move on from this series and get back to writing entertaining thrillers with interesting characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tom Clancy's worst, boring predictable drivel.","review":"Tom Clancy's works where always known for having all the little things go the right way for his hero's, but in this book he takesit too the extreme. He spends too much time and effort into demonizing the PRC, harkens back to the Fu Manchu racist stereotypes of old. And the war at the end (as every other reviewer states it takes how many pages to get to that?) comes off as far too easy. Predictable, I yearn for Clancy's days of old Red Storm Rising and such..."},{"rating":"1","title":"My last Clancy book","review":"It would be hard for me to improve on the several hundred other reviews of this book, so I'll just hit the lowlights:1) The book is waaaaay too long for what little \\"content\\" there is. Clancy definitely needs an editor.2) Clancy has gotten waaaaay too preachy, using every inconsequential shred of dialog (and there are many) as an excuse to inform the reader of his view of \\"how things should be done.\\"3) The story is too contrived. He really has to try hard to make this one believable and fails miserably.4) Clancy's prose (if you can call it that) is ridiculous and, in many parts, dwells way too much on parts of the male anatomy.'tis a far cry from Hunt for Red October. You'd really have to try hard to write a worse book than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"FORGOTTEN THE RULES!","review":"The basic rule of the thriller apart from good characterization is the tautness of plot, that is that every paragraph, every page should advance the story. Sadly Tom Clancy seems to have forgotten this and treats us to a 700 page preamble that had me wondering if I should sign up to save the rain forests. The paper used in the last third of the story was worthwhile and that's about the best I can say for it. Even so I often wonder how such works receive such tremendous critical acclaim - it is no different here in Britain or the rest of Europe. For anyone interested in how you write and produce a work far superior to this and in half the pages I urge you to read English techno-thriller writer John Templeton Smith's 'White Lie' - JTS is one of the most underrated of writers, but then we Brits haven't got a clue about marketing. In the meanwhile, may I respectfully suggest that you wait for Harrison Ford in the movie (I'm a big fan of the popcorn!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Clancy is an extraordinary storyteller, but The Bear and the Dragon doesn't cut it. 700 pages of buildup to one battle that fails to create any suspense. The few scenes with the Navy, are short and unexciting. The Air Force is tremendously outnumbered, but the air battles lack any real suspense. The tank battles are so one sided that I wonder why Clancy didn't simply say, \\"All the Chinese tanks get killed.\\" and be done with it. That is the way you want a real battle to go, I'm sure, but this is entertainment, not real life. The Chinese politicians are so dense that never once do they make a correct decision. And like most of his last few books every character he's ever written is back. It feels like a high school reunion. People you didn't really care that much about in the first place are back, and now you have to spend a couple hours with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"This is first Clancy book that I could not only put down but also the only one I didn't care whether I picked it up again or not. The story moved so slowly and some parts had so little to do with the plot I got bored reading. I could only recommend this book to someone having trouble sleeping at night. I will have a difficult time convincing myself to buy his next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"the bear and the dragon","review":"I have read most of what clancy has written and in this case, feel he has out done himself in delaying the action in order to provide himself with a forum for his conservative views.Of the 1024 odd pages, the action didn't start until I had fought my way through at least 720 pages of really boring dialogue dealing with issues such as Jack Ryan's views on Roe V Wade. To me ,everything has a place and clancy's views on that subject do not belong in an adventure novel, fiction at that. Whether I agree with clancy's views or not I bought the book for pleasure not to listen to his political opinions. Once the action started , I don't feel he was writing at the level of \\"A RED STORM RISING\\" OR \\"RED OCTOBER\\". Those stories had you right in the action racing to the next page.it didn't happen here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total disappointment","review":"I had read all Clancy's books, and I am so naive to think that he always did a detail research before he writes.I had no problem with the plot, I throw this book away without finishing it because I know that Mr. Clancy have not visit china or meet and talk with any chinese for the last 15 years. It's a pity that I had to give this book ONE Star to show this review."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Longest Book","review":"Clancy's first and maybe best \\"Hunt for Red October\\" was 382 pages, the story was tight and exciting, \\"Bear & Dragon\\" is 1028 pages, about 3x necessary to tell the story, tell us Tom does Putnam pay by the pound?"},{"rating":"1","title":"POTUS ? SWORDSMAN? Jack Ryan ? Oh Please, Give me a break...","review":"I struggled through the first 180 or so pages of this very very excrucitaing book. I did not mind the endless repetitions, the unworthy whines of POTUS(!), very loose, very offensive, very vulgur way the whole darn globe was talking..did not even mind the racial coloring of the book...But then along came Jack Ryan alias POTUS alias SWORDSMAN complaining about ABORTION....That was the moment I tossed the book away. I mean what the hell has that got to do with Chinese attacking Russia ? And who wants a president that whines his days off.. I could not believe it was the same Jack Ryan. May be movie makers should consider Anthony Hpokins (a la Remains Of the Day) instead of Harry this time- if some one is incredibly stupid to make a mpvie based upon this pile of junk that is.

I wish i had read them BEFORE i wasted my money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clancy needs an editor!","review":"This book was entirely too long. As someone else said 400 not 1K pages. In addition, the only suspense in the book was waiting for something truly interesting to happen. This book was Euclidian--it went from point A to point B in a straight line. There were no plot twists. It seems the only inner conflict for jack Ryan is the hemmed in feeling he has in being President. After this book and the last one (Rainbow Six), I will wait until the reserve list in my local library drops to zero before I pick up the next Clancy novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cardinal of the Crap-lin","review":"\\"Not his best work\\" is being generous. I've been a Tom Clancy fan since I first read \\"Red Storm Rising\\" while deployed along the Inner-German Border at the height of the Cold War. But this is easily the worst Clancy I've ever read. The editing is horrendous, if there was editing at all. The sexual innuendo is laughable at best, and totally unnecessary. The plot lines drag along with no apparent direction or cohesion. To top it off, it appears that Clancy's main goal was to include every character that had ever appeared in a Ryan novel - except Marko Ramius, I think. And the abrupt ending just left me cold. Bottom line - it's not worth the effort to read. I struggled through it, hoping to see the Clancy of old. He's not there. Don't waste your time. Better to pick up a Dirk Pitt novel by Clive Cussler - at least there's some excitement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even up to Op-Center standards","review":"Sorry, but Tom has been mailing these in for awhile now, and this one is just beyond belief. At least 300 pages too long, packed with errors and inconsistencies, and worst of all, the Jack Ryan that I used to enjoy has been transformed into a foul-mouthed shrew, obsessed with sex.Please, can /anyone/ imagine an American president saying to the British prime minister 'Thanks pal!'.And the 75 references to 'Japanese sausage'? Ending the book with that???Not to mention the endless and shrill political diatribes in which we get to learn yet again that Clancy despises tree huggers, abortion, liberals and queers.This was a sad, sad effort. Or rather, lack of effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Longer isn't necessarily better","review":"For the first time, a Tom Clancy novel is dragging me as a reader. And, getting dragged over 1000-plus pages of mediocre story telling is really chafing. The spelling mistakes are annoying and all these knowing looks between Jack Ryan and his crowd is cloying. The good guys are too good and almost cartoonishly overdrawn; the bad guys are too bad and paper thin. The Bear and the Dragon doesn't measure up in terms of pace, suspense or character development with my Clancy favorites: Red October, Cardinal of the Kremlin, and Clear and Present Danger. Do I detect that Tom is tired of this line of novels? After reading The Bear and The Dragon, I'm thinking I will not be rushing out, as I did last week for this one, for the next Clancy novel. I'm disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clancy is a master storyteller","review":"This is another winner by Tom Clancy. The plot is convoluted, with several different stories going on at once, and each one captures you. Clancy moves back and forth from one to the other, and interconnects them skillfully. Amazon's editorial review pretty well covers it.Clancy is the master storyteller. He has no peer when it comes to action stories and contemporary situations. He has done his research. His characters live and breathe, and his situations are plausible and well-drawn. This is a big book--over 1,000 pages--but it will hold your interest to the end.Joseph Pierre"},{"rating":"1","title":"The money has gone to his head","review":"I haven't read the book yet; I just bought it at a book signing Clancy was doing here in DC.

I eagerly awaited The Bear and Dragon because I had really gotten into these characters. I had to stop reading less than half way through the book. The language was consistently foul and just that, foul language. The story was extremely interesting and I did try to stay with it; the language intruded so much I finally quit because it was overriding the story. I have no objection to strong language when it helps the story; this does not. Language in the military and in government office circles is not as depicted by Clancy. I will not be buying another of his books (and I own all the others)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bomb","review":"I am a long time Clancy reader and a former fan. The story line was excellent.

Yes, the whole world knows the extreme Republican Right Wing knows what is right for EVERYONE.

Must try harder, Tom!","review":"I am a big fan of Clancy, Clear and Present Danger is awesome, but with The Bear and The Dragon Clancy appears to have stopped trying. Compared to his previous novels this plot is predictable and lacking in his usual cunning twists. I found myself waiting for something unexpected to happen but it never did. I know Tom is a patriot but I don't think one American soldier died in the entire book! He repeated himself far too often. Yes Jack I know you hate this job, it's the fifth time you have told me. I understand! At one point Clancy says that even scratching an American warship is tantamount to war. That's funny. Someone blew a hole in one the other day without retribution. I think there is a bit too much of how Clancy would like America to be as opposed to how it, and the world, really is. Still, if you like Clancy it's worth a read. I just hope this is only a smudge on an otherwise fantastic career."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and boring","review":"...This book is a massive disappointment, it is extremely predictable almost an insult to the reader.

This is my last book by Mr. Clancy. He's apparently run out of ideas with Jack Ryan and company. Since the Russians are our buds now it's the evil Chinaman that we both hate! What outrageous use of Yellow Peril race baiting that Clancy employs in this book. It's probably Causus Belli for the Chinese against us already. I'm sure if somebody in China had written something as scurrilous as this about Americans we'd all be up in arms. Oh and please tell Clancy to stop trying to write about sex, it's really a turn-ff.

I grew up a Baptist and they do go on too longbut these two were simply padding to Clancy's belief that it's his way or you are bad. The hero is always superman with some help from wonder women and come in White, black, and Asian types. The bad guys are murdering sexual perverts with no redeeming characteristics. A nice simply world where the hero doesn't know where food comes from. Adds may pages of anti-abortion rhetoric and the opinion that American schools need ruler welding nuns to get a good education.

Otherwise, the next one may be the last I read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bear and the Dragon just couldn't be the work of Clancy","review":"Having read all of Clancy's novels (Many several times over), I was sorely let down with The Bear and The Dragon. The crudeness displayed by my favorite author really knocked me out of the box. His previous efforts have always lent themselves to trying to explain the thought processes of \\"The enemy\\" (Soviets, Druggies, Eco-terrorists, the IRA, or radical Arab elements, etc.) and what America, in the guise of Jack Ryan or John Clark, should do to counter them. But other than stating outright that the Chinese just plain think different than we do, he simply denegrates the novel by resorting to name calling. \\"Joe Chink\\" and \\"Japanese Sausage\\"....please! This is the first of his novels that I would not recommend on any level. It appears to have been ghost written by a name-calling, racist and not the strategic thinking techno-novelist that I've long admired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Romantic Japanese Sausages","review":"Clancy is known for his generous understanding of technology and unique ability to apply it to cool dramatic stories where Jack Ryan nearly always saves the world.Clancy is not known for his romance writing. During the romantic interludes between a Japanese/American CIA agent and a Chinese assistant to the People's Politboro, I found myself going eeeYhuuuuuu more times than not. Multiple references to Japanese sausage was nauseating and basically summed up the entire novel when reference to the sausage was the last line in the book. Clancy can do much better and should leave the romance to others. This is by far his worst novel to date. What happened?"},{"rating":"1","title":"That's the last of my money Tom Clancy will get","review":"If you didn't know Tom Clancy's personal politics going into this book you will know them afterwards. I tend to lean to the right, but the numerous references to Clinton/Lewinsky go too much even for me, especially considering there was never a Bill Clinton in Clancy's alternate universe.This book was needlessly long. Without the constant melancholy reflections by President Jack Ryan about how his life had changed and what a prison the White House is this would have been a couple hundred pages shorter. Another hundred pages could have been trimmed from the predictable military engagement described in ultra-technical detail at the end of the book.

I don't know yet how it ends, and I may never know at the rate it is going. It is a disappointment for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Clancy ever","review":"If you have read the last eight Clancy novels, prepare for a disappointment. In contrast to his other work, this one is full of stereotypes and predictable throughout. It does have some suspense, so you keep reading and waiting for the major plot to begin. There is none.

Red October was the first 'non-required' novel I read. I have come to appreciate the detail he works into his plots, but this was rediculous. The first 500 pages were not only slow, but boring. I got tired of hearing how Jack Ryan hated being President, how much Nomuri enjoyed having sex, and how much money everybody could be making if they did not work for the Government. Slow, redundant, painful. Keep this one in the bathroom and work through it over the next year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my god, what C$#P!","review":"I read and enjoyed all of Mr. Clancy's novels, that is, until the abomination that was \\"Rainbow Six\\".

Now Clancy has Jack Ryan as the military dictator of the U.S.; he is able to make alliances and join a war with nary a mention of Congress. Given Clancy's obvious love of the Rush Limbaugh view of America, this may not be surprising, but it doesn't make for a very good book. There are some good, if farfetched, descriptions of battle, although it is hard to believe the Chinese would be quite as stupid as Clancy would like us to think. As much as Clancy wants us to think of Ryan as a right-thinking hero, he seems not to realize what a fascistic character he has created, one whose own stupidity and unilateral actions lead to a nuclear threat to Washington, D.C. The hope that the Clancy of Red October will ever return seems utterly forlorn."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's Just a Bad Book--Regardless of Politics","review":"As a Libertarian, who generally votes Republican, I think that this book is virtually unreadable.

It really falls down with respect to his other books.Weaknesses:* Other books (particularly Cardinal of the Kremlin) have elaborate spy-counterspy operations. In this one, an overtly foreign agent walks in and finds crown jewels completely unguarded. Unbelievable. Also, does China really let foreign news vans drive around unmonitored?* Russia is given a free pass on Chechnya and the Mafia, even as China's lack of respect for human rights is savaged, in order to justify the plot.* Several characters repeat the same aphorisms and quotations to the point where it's distracting. None of the quotations are attributed, an odd lapse for a detail man like Clancy.To me it looks like Clancy's suffering from the grandiosity that many writers of ongoing series fall into. I thought his switch to John Clark in Without Remorse and Rainbow Six was a cure for that, but apparently not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unremarkable in every way possible","review":"Numerous plot lines come together too easily, others go completely negelected.

Aegis cruiser shooting down ICBM!!?? PLEASE! The excessive expresion of his right-wing politics does little to help the narrative (or lack thereof). An insurance salesman is now telling us how we should deal with foreign policy and it is *ugly*.

The language could fade wallpaper, boring, boring, boring. Page 250 and the best I can say is I've had a wonderful eduation in the purchase of undergarments for Chinese women. If Tom did indeed pen this effort, looks to me like he's fresh outta ideas. A waste of money and time.

I can't bring myself to pick it up again. This is a far cry from Clancy's early novels which kept me up into the wee hours. I don't find any of characters realistic. The CIA team of Foley and Foley are particularly nauseating. Clancy uses this novel as a soapbox and his preaching became truly tiresome as the novel progressed. Maybe I will use it as a doorstop..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vulgarity and style","review":"I, too, have read and bought all of Tom Clancy's books and enjoyed them. However, this novel was full of unnecessary vulgarity. His previous novels kept me riveted and expectant; I usually finished a book within 1 to 2 days. It seemed to me that he was trying to bring in another audience, maybe younger readers who like this type of vulgarity in their movies. It took me over a week and a half to read the book because it simply did not keep me expectant or anxious to follow all of the subplots and characters. This novel was way below the standard of Tom Clancy who I had considered the best novelist of our time. The ending left me irritated. I felt cheated out of his usual style and angry with the last few lines of text. I will, however, be awaiting another release by him and give him another chance to return to the top of my list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"Don't bother reading this book even if you like Clancy novels--which I do. This example of longwinded, repetitive, pandering prose needs to be edited to two-thirds its current size. There isn't a redeeming character in the entire novel which is full of gratuitous profanity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Clancy, please think of your female readers!","review":"While the plot is good and we have quite a bit of Jack and his handling of the world, I was let down that there wasn't more of his home life which made EXECUTIVE ORDERS such a wonderful book. While I realize that Mr. Clancy's audience is mostly male, there are female readers who enjoy his stories and there would be more if he would include other things besides graphic descriptions of weapons and battles, which I admit I usually skim over.

Maybe it could have been a tad shorter??"},{"rating":"1","title":"The book where the Ryanverse \\"Jumped the Shark\\"","review":"I read this book when it first came out, years ago. I had been a big fan of Clancy's work until I read Executive Orders, which was not nearly as good as his earlier work. However, the Bear and the Dragon was even worse, for several reasons...1) The plot was even more preposterous than Executive Orders.2) It was far too long & 80% of it was uninteresting.3) To pass the time, I started counting how many times Jack Ryan called the Chinese, umm, crab suckers.4) By the time the plot finally started cooking (around the 1000 page mark), the suspense was derailed by the random use of a weird obscenity.Anyway, it was clear that the Ryanverse had \\"jumped the shark\\" with this book and I have not read Clancy's books since."},{"rating":"2","title":"great story from start to finish","review":"it's been a while since i've read it but i remember it was a slow start but once it gets into the meat of the book it's a definate page turner. mystery suspense and animosity toward China. what more could you ask for. once i got into it i couldnt put the book down. great read like i said it's a slow start but give it a chance"},{"rating":"1","title":"THE BEAR AND THE DRAGON","review":"A slow and long winded book with a \\"right-wing\\" political agenda and a sequence of highly improbable events.

Nope. Instead he becomes even bolder, despite the fact that every one of the conspiracies he was involved in had exploded in his partners' faces. It just didn't occur to him that somehow once his other conspirators were brought down, he was the only one left. Just because he came off unscathed, he thought he was immune from detection. Because he was blinded by his sense of infallibility, he thought he was undetected all the way to the very second of the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"How the mighty have fallen","review":"Tom Clancy used to write really good books but his last few have been on a downhill trend.

Unfortunately, this is not one of his better works. It is slow to develop, makes too many references to previous books, and asks the reader to believe a quite preposterous notion of the our Chinese friends. If I had to rank the Clancy books: 1) Hunt for Red October, 2) Patriot Games, 3) all of the rest, Last) Bear and the Dragon."},{"rating":"1","title":"TC should go back to his old day job","review":"Long time TC fan here. I have to say his work has been slipping for some time. His latest book is not only boring, it is long and boring. TC needs let Jack Ryan and all of his friends die off and start a new setting w/ new characters... or go back to his old day job. Where will Jack be next if TC is allowed to continue, president of the world?Getting back to the story, it lacks the depth and intrigue of his earlier works like Red October, etc. The plot and characters are extremely transparent. I think at this point TC is putting out a poor story and living off his repuation from past works.I would not recommend this book to former or new TC readers. If you do want to read this book, save yourself some $$ and wait for people like me to dump our hardcover books off at the second hand book stores!-Lee (a former big time TC fan)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Clancy should write comic books","review":"Clancy is now like reading Clive Cussler, although Mr. Cussler doesn't try to pass himself off as writing anything other than adventure fantasy.Clancy has gone downhill since \\"Hunt for Red October\\"--a truly wonderful and exciting read. Now, he writes these epic novels comprised of superficial plots, silly dialogue, 2 dimensional characters, a peppering of Clancy's own conservative political views, and way way way too many words.I have one word for Mr. Clancy: EDITOR. I read the first 10 percent of the book. Then I started to read the end of chapters and chapter sections. No one should be surprised that I missed nothing in the plot. Although I may have missed out on a few Tom Clancy political lectures as told by his alter ego President Ryan."},{"rating":"1","title":"A cheap Jerry Furland imitation","review":"I have the upmost respect for Mr. Clancy's literary genius. I probably would not be a pawn shop owner if it were not for \\"Cardinal of the Kremlin\\". However, I have been compelled (out of respect for Mr. Jerry Furland, the author of the novel \\"Transfer\\") to offer my first ever negative critique of a Clancy novel. Mr. Clancy displayed a complete lack of scruples in stealing the story line from Transfer. It appears that Mr. Clancy's well has dried up and that he has lost his creative edge. Sad as this may be, I cannot condone, and will not stomach, the rape of Mr. Furland's novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment in need of serious editing","review":"As you've probably read below (or will read in a moment), this one is a huge disappointment.

I should have just listened to an abridged version. Recommend that you do that instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bear & Dragon Cliffs Notes","review":"China invades Russia. Russia joins NATO.

Clancy hasn't lost his ability to design a compelling plot, however the book leaves much to be desired.Like many authors who write formulaic bestsellers, over time Clancy has gotten caught up in his own grandiosity and therefore won't let the publisher edit his books. This one REALLY needed a strong editor. At 1100 pages, it was too long, with too many subplots, too many long soliloquies of Clancy's John Birchish political philosophy, and too many repetitious banal catch phrases uttered by characters.Clancy has been headed down this road for some time--really since putting Jack Ryan in the White House--and I had vowed to stop buying his egotrips, and getting this one as a gift has only reinforced this stance.This piece is hugely disappointing for one who's read Clancy since The Hunt for Red October. Clancy either needs to get back to his roots, or give it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing...","review":"After Rainbow Six, I told myself I would never read another Tom Clancy novel...but I gave him one more chance. I think I wasted my money. The Bear and the Dragon is dreadful slow to develop, wooden characters with wooden thoughts and wooden dialogue, too many sub-plots, anachronistic (has Mr Clancy been to China recently --- his China is not today's China at all). What's happened to Jack Ryan? Where's our decisive man of action gone? The book is far too long for the story. It needs a good editor with a sharp pen."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Sum of All Formulas","review":"I have long been an admirer of TC as a plotter and writer, despite his occasional lapses. [But never an admirer of his \\"as told to, but written but someone else\\" Op-Center products.]With Bear-Dragon, TC has fully descended into Clavell's Disease - that syndrome which causes formerly creative and exciting writers to ACT like they're being paid by the word, which one should not do, even if one IS paid that way. Too many words (a fair-to-good 500-pager fluffed to 1 kilopage), too many subplots, too many characters, too many moral lessons.And the editing! Are TC's editors now afraid to point out to him that he's used the same phrase, metaphor, simile, or analogy several times before - a few hundred pages ago? It's distracting and it's unprofessional. Sure people will buy the book anyhow, because of TC's name, but those loyal readers are owed a better book - I suggest we are owed a better book with each outing. Bear-Dragon isn't it, Tom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Rainbow Six","review":"Now that Jack Ryan has been President for a while, it's hard for Clancy to produce really great stories where we admire Ryan for playing the valiant underdog. Nevertheless, Ryan's role in Clancy's latest book is thankfully more prominent than in Rainbow Six and the result is a great story. I found the plot more believable and engaging than eco-terrorists. In any event, Clancy is still better than anybody else out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"old and tired","review":"Clancy has gotten boring!!! Just pages upon pages upon pages... Improbable plot, unbelievable characters. He has previously given us Japan attacking the USA, right. Get real, make it at least possible. And Jack Ryan was once a great character but did he have to become president? what is next, Ryan as Pope or just God?The book is way way to long and after the first 100 pages fatigue sets in. Skip to the end. Or better yet, just ask someone who has read it to give you a two minute overview."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Clancy's best","review":"I was very disappointed. Definitely not up to the caliber of Red October or Cardinal -- or even Rainbow. The plot development is weak. Actually I think Clancy has become such a popular writer that his editors might be hesitant to make suggestions. Personally, I think Bear and Dragon could have benefited from losing 300 or so pages. And what about that Gogol character? He's really interesting and Clancy passes up a great chance to develop him. Also Clancy's knowledge of China is a somewhat dated. Politburo members dress in suits, and their secretaries would probably dress to the nines, too..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Isn't the Gore/Bush race enough politics for this year?","review":"Okay, I normally get through a good book in a week, with one this long, maybe 2-3 weeks, but it's been 5 weeks since I started this book & I'm only on page 191 (out of 1000+). This book reads more like a political statement than a novel (e.g., abortion, foreign affairs, the economy - & remember I'm not even 200 pages in yet). A suspense thriller is not the right place to get up on a soapbox Mr. Clancy. Your views, and your need to express them so strongly in your book, is making you predictable, sir. And being able to surmise the trend & tone (if not the events) of the rest of the story is the last thing I want from this type of book, especially with 800 pages left."},{"rating":"1","title":"PURE DRIVEL","review":"This is by far & away the worst book Tom Clancy has written. I couldn't even finish reading it. After 300 pages, I gave up. I tried to get into the story but there's way too many sub-plots and political rants instilled by the author. He also should find a new editor, this book could have been more enthralling if you throw out 500 pages of it. I guess I should be thankful Clancy used POTUS instead of actually writing out the full title, \\"President of the United States,\\" otherwise this book might have been 1500 pages long."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really tried to like this novel.","review":"I just couldn't. Maybe Clancy has tired of writing exciting novels. I certainly tired of reading The Bear and the Dragon. A friend recommended that I read this novel because of the recent diplomatic problems with China and the American spy plane. The book pales in comparison to the real drama.Jack Ryan has been a great character in the previous novels. In this one, his age shows badly. He's a character that has lost his shine. In the story, Ryan has reluctantly run for and been elected to the presidency. He doesn't really like his job. By the end, I wish he had just resigned. Clancy uses abortion in a very inflamatory way to paint the Chinese as horrible people. Clancy should have saved his opinions on this issue for a letter to the editor. Instead, he should have written a compelling story. Skip this one. If you're new to Clancy, read his earlier novels, like Red October. They're much, much better stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Sad Effort","review":"I have read all of Mr. Clancy's books and like others have become disappointed with the quality of writing not to mention the disjointed story line. How his editors allowed this novel to be published is beyond my comprehension. It seemed the same phrases were used time and time again to the detriment of the book. Finally I think its high time Mr. Clancy retired Jack Ryan. I have never, ever, been a fan of Ryan, reading the books more for the other characters Mr. Clancy created. If I have to read one more time about Ryan's character I will gag. Personally, every time the book reverted to the White House where Ryan was wrestling with some dilemma I breezed through the segment hoping to read something more interesting then Mr. Clancy moralizing to us through Jack Ryan's character. Do us all a favor Mr. Clancy, if you are unable to write to your previous high standards, just stop and run for office since it appears you think you have all the answers."},{"rating":"1","title":"jarring drivel","review":"The Bear and the Dragon take Clancy's stock players into new positions of power. Clancy however has gone far beyond any of his previous works in his jarring sophomoric political and philosophical drivel. The story line is constantly slowed down by his political meanderings which have absolutely nothing to do with his story . The book could easily be half as long and twice as readable. Even if you try to discount these meanderings they are so jarring and inappropriate that you are quickly torn from the narrative and feel you have just listened to a bad political commercial. If Clancy was not already successful this book would not be published as it stands. Read it as your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well of Ideas Drying Up? Extreme Racism?","review":"I have noticed a steady decline in the quality of Tom Clancy's work. His early books were some of the best I've ever read. However, as time progresses, it is clear his well of ideas is drying up. His books are beginning to look the same. The same basic story line read over and over again.Having said that, I think The Bear and the Dragon would have been an interesting read if it wasn't for the extreme racism prevalent throughout the novel. He insults almost every religious and ethnic group he can.I'd say its time for Tom Clancy to retire gracefully before he causes any more damage to his reputation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contractual obligations","review":"The above can be the ONLY reason TC wrote this. He obviously didn't enjoy it, and didn't care if the reader did or not. Aside from the Phyllis Schafly anti-abortion screeds, the \\"media are a pain\\" asides, and the execrable dialogue, its just not a good story. BORING. Wait for the neighbors garage sale, and pick this up on the bargain table if you absolutely must read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed it","review":"Despite the whining about Clancy's lack of political correctness in this book by some other Amazon customers, I read the Bear and the Dragon to the end. I enjoyed reading it and would encourage others to read it. Sometimes it's even good for a book to be non-PC because then readers can see what the world is really like: not through the eyes of some lib."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, not great, but still to Clancy's high standards","review":"Not as technical or as in depth as his previous novels, this book still kept me entranced and I couldn't put it down. The action is fast-paced (mostly), but as is usual for a Clancy book, it takes a while to get going. However, the first pages that other reviewers found could be tossed really build up the story. Not everything can be canned into quick and short bites. Sometimes things take a while to develop. In this case, one seemingly small event keeps snowballing into bigger and more serious problems and I feel Clancy does this well.Jack Ryan is the President (or Prime Minister) that every country should have - a real person, and not a politician who has never worked a real day in his life. Bravo to Clancy for creating a leader that real people can identify with.Keep 'em coming Tom! Eventually, Jack is going to have to retire - who's the next big character?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clancy Returns with power and grace","review":"Top class reading! Tom Clancy shows the struggle for a President of the U.S. in day to day life, while creating a story which will not bore even the most sceptic! With the return of Jack Ryan and family to the book series, and Rainbow helping out, the reader is kept captive.Personally, I feel that this is Clancy's 2nd best next to Red October... if you like what he has done before, you'll love this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This must be Dubya's favorite book ...","review":"...although it doesn't have pictures.Life is too short to waste your time with this book... or to write a review about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloated, B-grade Pulp Fiction","review":"With 700+ reviewers before me, I have nothing new to say. The book was an utter waste of time for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful story with 'fizzled finale'","review":"Like so many of his recent works, this starts with a great story premise and his unparalled attention to detail is there as always, but falls flat in the climax. Wars are not so perfectly conducted with no errors by the home team. The heroes, much as I'd like to know and be friends with them personally, lack the flaws of human nature that we all have to one degree or another. Rather than a crashing crescendo of a climax that builds to the final bar of music, this simply rolls down with the 'good guys' winning everything; an unlikely scenario for the large 'limited engagement' this is. I'll continue to read Clancy's Jack Ryan & Paul Hood series because I like their character and ethic, but hope Clancy does something to make the endings more realistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good but not his best.","review":"I thought this was a really good book. I finished it within 5 days I was so engrossed in it. It is a little boring at parts but thats a norm in Clancy books because of all the detail and length in his books. The climax at the end was great and inpredictable. Debt of Honor or Without Remorse are better but Clany is getting old and running out of ideas. I would put this book around #6 or so out of the 10 or so Clany novels. Better: Debt of Honor, Executive Orders, Without Remorse, Sum of all Fears, Clear and Present Danger. Worse: Cardinal of the Cremlin, Hunt for Red October, Patriot Games, Red Storm Rising."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacked some of the better \\"Clancy\\" writing!","review":"Where to begin? At first I thought that the reading would be fast paced and exciting. What did I get? SLOW, over dramatic, tedious and sometimes distracting illustrations of the setting. I am a big Clancy fan and this book disappointed me.First, the many spelling errors and grammatical mix-ups where annoying. Did he have any editors, proofreaders and the ever-important spellchecker? Where was the effort in writing this book? Or was it easy money?The simplistic plot and over dramatic descriptions led me to \\"skim\\" over many pages. I did not want to waste my time reading the many pages of \\"calamity\\" written into this book. Where there should have been more drama was in the ending not in the middle of the book. The ending was comparable to one of those movies forced under budget by having an abrupt, simple, and unexciting closure.I hope that Mr. Clancy will take the time to rectify his mistakes in the next piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"C'mon, Tom, how about some characterization?...","review":"If you have read any of Clancy's other books, you know he cannot do characters (or dialogue, and he has trouble with plot). Jack Ryan, Mrs. Dr. Ryan, the Secret Service, the National Security Advisor, Robby the Vice President, et al., are all thin, narrow, and often troubled people (Ryan hates his job, Dr. Ryan apparently has no rounds at the hospital, the Secret Service agent has morningsickness, etc.).So, does one expect better than that which has gone before? One would think that in 1,000 pages Clancy might be learning, but he is not. Too bad. Looks like I'm not learning, either, because I read all 1,000 pages, so who's the fool?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Put this tome at ground zero","review":"Predicable or not, I have enjoyed the TC novels so far. This one however gave me the feeling that the various plot lines were all written by different people. The editing in parts left me confused about where the plot was trying to go and several plot lines droned on for several hundred pages only to be left hanging. I was in the last hundred pages still waiting for the Rainbow Troopers to do their thing. After lugging this enormous tome around on the subway for the past month, I don't think I will be reading another TC novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bear and the Dragon","review":"The worst of the Jack Ryan series. None of the usual suspense, Jack & his circle know everything that's going to happen before it happens because of a conveniently placed spy. There's none of the usual multiple sub-plots to speak of, just the impending conflict between Russia & China. And even that's gets resolved in just the last few pages via the now popular 3-4 day war. The usual cast we've grown to know are all burdened with bit parts that really contribute nothing to the story, with a couple of them placed in highly improbable/unsatisfying positions. It's all the more disappointing because it appears to be the last of a very interesting and entertaining series. Definitely Clancy's weakest effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Gag me with a spoon\\"","review":"I got 200 pages into the book and could not go any farther. Even enduring a cross Atlantic flight with nothing to read was better then reading anymore. I have always found Clancy's books riveting but this one seemed to be nothing more then a venue for his political views. That wouldn't be so bad if there was believable characters or an interesting plot (Maybe it comes later, but I doubt it). It's time to kill of Jack Ryan he has become such a stereotype character he's not salvageable. My recommendation is save the money and read something interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clancy mails one in.","review":"Clancy needs an editor who will cut much of the fluff. This book was mailed in without much time, effort or thought in producing a real book. While their is an interesting story within this book,it is presented in a more unrealistic manner than in other Clancy stories.All in all not worth the time necessary to read this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Happened?","review":"\\"What Happened?\\" sums up my thoughts after finishing \\"The Bear and The Dragon\\". What happened to some of the characters at the end, the editing, the plot, Tom Clancy as an interesting author?I don't want to rehash what many other reviewers have already written - but come on - hire an editor with a #2 pencil & a good eraser, cut about 400 pages and maybe a decent book will emerge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long","review":"I have read all of the previous Tom Clancy Jack Ryan novels, and I found this to be the most disappointing. It took him 500 pages to describe to us that the US had an agent in China and that agent was getting laid, and that someone tried to kill the former KGB head. Does Clancy get paid by the word??? By the time I got to the actual battle portion of the novel (about page 850) I just wanted this damn novel to end. And the ending was rushed and much too quick. Clearly all of those early pages of writing wore Mr. Clancy out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paid by the word?","review":"With \\"The Hunt for Red October\\" I became a Tom Clancy fan. I agreed with all of the glowing reviews. And the next several books (and movies) also entertained me.However, after 50 pages of \\"The Bear and The Tiger\\" I concluded that Mr. Clancy must be getting paid by the word. After 183 pages I realized that he is trying to gain favor with the Catholic Church. His constant moralizing and preaching so clouds and distracts from the story line that one has trouble keeping one's place. He has Jack Ryan, who should personify competance, whining, and being bitter.If the book were edited to @250 to 300 pages it might be very enjoyable. Unfortunately it is 1028 pages of mostly preaching, moralizing, and patronizing text. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's Tom Clancy and Who's This Guy","review":"I've been a big fan of Tom Clancy ever since Hunt For Red October and I have to say that this is by far his worst book ever. The plot was so predictable I knew the end before I'd gotten halfway thru. The characters are beginning to resemble cardboard cutouts, without anything to make them human. Maybe Tom just needs to take a break, much like he had Jack Ryan do between Sum Of All Fears and Debt Of Honor. A couple of years to recharge his mental batteries and regain his edge."},{"rating":"1","title":"The first Tom Clancy book I couldn't pick up...","review":"As a person who studied foreign policy and military affairs in college, I always found Tom Clancy's books extremely interesting and factually accurate. Unfortunately, while he's keeping up with technological changes, this book was incredibly slow and much more overtly political. I agree with other reviewers about the unkind view of the Chinese in this one too. If you are new to Clancy's work, skip this book and go back to read the Cold War classics. I never did read the last 30 pages of the book -- I simply stopped caring what happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Offensive","review":"One of Clancy's weakest efforts. First 800 pages are full of sophomoric dialogue of characters who think and speak in the same voice. Full of racist terms for Asians but not other races or ethnicities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"Apparently 1 star is the lowest ranking you can give. This is a real waste of time. I wasted enough to read over 200 pages. No plot. No character development. Just a continual summary rehash of the events of previous books. Plenty of Clancy's ultra-conservative political viewpoint expounded from many characters - mostly Ryan. And if you didn't get the utterly predictable and unimaginative drift of Clancy's social wisdom the first time, don't despair, he will repeat it several times. This is the product of a writer who has obviously lost his muse, forgotten his audience, and delights only in listening to himself drone on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Threw this one away","review":"This is probably the last Tom Clancy book I will buy. I have been a fan for over 10 years and have loved all his other books. But this one was very dissapointing. The character development is weak, there is very little action, the amount of boring scene descriptions is staggering, and the political soapbox is obvious. He has reduced Jack Ryan to a boring politician. I have been reading this book for over a week and have only gotten about a quarter of the way through. I doubt very seriously if I will even finish it. I never thought I would come across a Tom Clancy book that I couldn't care less about reading. I think he has lost his touch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is It the Same Clancy as the One Who Wrote 'Red October'??","review":"I am (was?) a fan of Tom Clancy. Red October, Clear and Present Danger, Patriot Games are superb books. But this.. Is it really written by Clancy? Is it so incredibly B-A-D. And the China portrayed in this book is right out of the 70s. People don't call themselves 'comrade' anymore Mr Clancy. Don't buy this boring book, it just drags on and on, it took me forever to finsih it. Reading the Sears catalog or TV Guide is far more interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, Awful, Awful!","review":"I have loved Tom Clancy and all his books since very early in his career but this book is terrible. As if we didn't know it from the last book, Jack Ryan hates being President. In case you didn't get it the last time, Ryan tells you about 200 times again in this book. We all know that Tom likes describing military equipment and proceeds to do so with mind-numbing detail. In the first 500 pages only two events happen, the rest is pretty much as I have already stated. This might have been a decent book by taking out about 600 - 700 pages of filler, i.e., Ryan hates his job, military equipment descriptions, Clancy's discourse of countries he either likes or hates, etc. Tom we know you are an ultra-conservative right-wing just slightly to the left of fascism but do we have to drone on forever just to fill in a book? Are you being paid by the word?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst Jack Ryan book","review":"I used to enjoy Clancy books for its engaging plot and ability to make you wonder if something like that could really happen. This new book is nothing but trash and while most of his writing has been fiction, it would appear that Clancy has delved into the realms of fantasy. While he has always stereotyped to a pointdifferent race and nations, this book is basically a list of his perceived problems that people who are not red blooded American have. His racism is evident and his story is lacking. While I the basic plot of China invading Russia for resources follows from his earlier book and could have been a very interesting story, it appears Clancy just didn't try. I use to really enjoy his books, but this will probably be the last one I buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre work despite an interesting premise","review":"Clancy appears to have decided not to put a great deal of effort into his latest work, borrowing liberally from one of his first efforts, _Red Storm Rising_. Unfortunately, this book doesn't quite match up to that earlier work. This is a long book, not just in the number of pages, but in the feel. Unlike most of his past efforts, it's in no way a page turner, but instead you read on simply to get to the end. And when you get there, be prepared for disappointment. After setting up an interesting premise, Clancy wraps everything up more neatly than most Christmas presents. The only plus to the work is the characters long time Clancy readers have grown to know so well--they remain generally the same, and are fun to follow, but their talents could be much better used. Perhaps it's time for Clancy to start a new series, as he appears to be tired of dreaming up new problems for Jack Ryan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Long? Too Short?","review":"The book takes an inordinate amount of time to build to the climax, then it is as if Clancy realized he had used 990 pages and had to end the book in the last 30.When you sit through the first part of the book, you expect the story to be completed.Mr Clancy should realize that \\"The Hunt for Red October\\", easily his best, ran only 387 pages in the hardcover edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"bear and the dragon","review":"What were you thinking, Tom Clancy? At 10028 pages this book is much too heavy for the \\"I only have time to read before I go to sleep crowd\\". My husband loves Clancys books, but holding THIS tome aggravated his carpal tunnel syndrome causing the book to fall on his face cutting off his respiration and might have resulted in unlawful book death had I not detected the lack of snoring. He refuses to pick the book up again, so we will have to make do with the audio version. My advice is to take S. Kings advice: If the book is too big---make it a serial---or, make it part one and part two--if the story is good, we will be there to buy the book. At this size, The Bear and the Dragon is too dangerous to read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"tedious and unfocused","review":"Tom Clancy has always delivered a great plot, but with The Bear and the Dragon, the plot can be told in about 50 pages of the 1028. Characters, who continue to enter the novel even on page 800, are too many; the plot is tediously expanded with overdone details of military equipment. The plot becomes hard to follow and takes concentration when reading - when all one wants is a good, fun plot as Clancy has delivered in the past. And the overuse of the \\"f\\" word gets old."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOO MANY PAGES - TOO LITTLE WAR","review":"Tom Clancy is in dire need of a Book Editor. This novel reads like an Unedited first draft - needlessly overlong, overwritten, with too few incidents occuring and a sluggish plot that never rises to the occasion (not even in the end). It's simply not worth 1,028 pages - and your time. It could easily lose 400 or so. It seems Clancy did a lot of research and dang! if he isn't going to include each & every thing he learned. Back off, Tom! I loved his previous novels - but with this one, he shows that he's rapidly losing sight of simple, good story-telling. This is not a worthy successor to his previous novels. It's slow, excessively wordy, and too thin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Different Book, Same Plot","review":"OK, I have read all of Clancy's fiction, and have enjoyed them, but he is in danger of becoming the Neil Simon of thriller novels. Like Simon, who has written many plays and movies with essentially the same plot, Clancy reuses an old plot, in this case Red Storm Rising, only changing the location and character names. He did the same thing in Rainbow Six, which was essentially a cross between Executive Orders and Patriot Games. I won't even get into the constant moralizing that he beats us over the head with during the course of the novel. We get the point Tom, you don't need to belabor itAlso, no novel needs to be over 1000 pages long. Someone needs to remind Clancy that a wise man once said \\"Brevity is the soul of Wit.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Profanity Detracts","review":"I was a Clancy fan up until this book. There is too much profanity, repeated and unnecessary. Sometimes a point can be made by it, but its excessive use caused me to begin just skimming the book after 300 pages.A good page-length for this book would have been 450, not 1000+."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring....Boring....Boring....","review":"The first 800 pages are pure drudgery. Not one exciting moment. Just trivial dribble and pointless dialogue. I've read every Clancey book but this book is horrible. When the action does finally start it has to be rushed to a quick conclusion because 900 pages have already been written. The battlefield scenes are shallow and undetailed. Don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rainbow Six Wasn't the Detour, It Was the New Direction","review":"With this effort, Tom Clancy has dropped from my \\"automatic hardback purchase\\" list; the sneering, soulless _Rainbow Six_ has given way to the appalling excesses of _The Bear and the Dragon_. The primary plot line, as usual, is aggressive and intriguing, but the villains' brains in Clancyland have apparently not paid their oxygen bill for a couple of books now. Even worse, one of the subplots -- the one which closes the book down -- is leeringly written and utterly offensive. There's a decent story in here somewhere, but only an editor with a red (pen) army could have salvaged this book's feng shui."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a (poor) rewrite of his previous books..","review":"No new plots. Clancy's annoying habit of pontificating the rights and wrongs of the world culminate to a new high. The plot lines are exactly the same from his previous books, i.e. stupid_event + news_coverage = threatened_econmic_collapse_so_we_go_to_war_and_get_soundly_defeated_without_scratching_the_paint_on_a_single_American_tank. Clancy has such an unrealistic view of war and such an overwhelmingly overly optimistic sense of American fighting power that it is hard to stomach. Dont waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Trash","review":"Boring, long drawn out sleepy book. Thank goodnes I can speed read. I feel sorry for those of you that have to suffer through the tedium of this thing. From racial slurs to swearing that just doesn't fit the situation. The only highlight was the new pig bomb; and the other pig, Ming. Japenese sausage? How freaking juvenille. This book smells of a ghostwriter, or Clancy is out of original thought and is done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed ....","review":"I would always look forward to the Clancy books but sadly, this is no longer true. Completely disjointed, shallow, simple plot with no real satisfying ending. Barely worth reading for die hard fans, but wait for paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clancy and right to life?","review":"I have read and enjoyed all of Clancy's books, own the movies and rushed to buy this one. Now I am rushing to return it to Costco.Page 181 and Mr. Clancy decides that the right to lifers deserve a forum. There were references to the Chiense and killing new borns early in the book, but when Jack Ryan descides the Supreme Court should reverse Roe vs. Wade I had enough.Mr. Clancy has done what my wife and children have tried to do for 30 years, make me a democrat. Monday I sending a $100 to AL Gore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally the Russians against the Chinese","review":"Clancy seems to have found a new plotline in this installment of the Ryan Series. Instead of having America directly attacked whether via biological, nuclear or financial terrorists, the target is the fragmenting former Soviets republics, specifically, Russia itself. China enters the scene as the main antagonist bent on securing Siberia for their own purposes. A welcomed respite from the destruction America has had to suffer throughout Clancy's yarns. Well worth the read, especially since American soil is left alone and other parts of the world are allowed to take part."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think Tom is bored, and would quit except it pays so well","review":"I am a Clancy fan and have read all of his single author work.The book dragged. It took a long time to get going and then it didn't last long. Mr. Clancy is famous for the techno thriller genre. In this one he forgot the thriller and the techno.His hero Jack Ryan, shows up to be a chain smoking, alcoholic, sexist, preacher for a watered down Roman Catholism. He is willing to comitt suicide, rather than be thought a coward. The villians are all shallow dirty old men. Two of his best characters are both gunned down early in the plot.There a long poorly done uneeded seduction scene. There is an account of diplomacy which if accurate would seem to indicate that all diplomats die of boredom.The story is pedicatable and not very interesting.Please Tom, we know you can do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long!","review":"As Mr. Clancy ages he seems to ramble...This book could have been much better with fewer words."},{"rating":"1","title":"enough is enough","review":"i had to express my opinion on this one .to me it seems that clancy writes to get the approval of those who make his life easier.this bs with clark and chavez is a joke . im sorry but the conservative ideals he champions just make you pray that clancy's political ambitions match his pro sports acheivements thanks jhg"},{"rating":"1","title":"MUCH TO LONG","review":"I have been a Clancy fan from the beginning. But I thought this book could have been compressed to about 500 pages and nothing would have been lost.Very repetitive. I hope he hasn't burned out from the good old days."},{"rating":"1","title":"A let down from a talented writer","review":"I have been a TC fan since \\"Red October\\" (read when I was still in the Navy), and that's why I'm so bothered by this book. I won't argue the political leanings, but I was offended by some of the language in the book. The cracks TC had Ryan make about his secret service agent (when she's discovered to be pregnant) were fairly far out of bounds, but the most offensive of all was the final sentence in the book. It was just plain vulgar, and to no good point.And, as much as I hate to say it, I think it's time to retire Jack Ryan as a character - he's simply no longer interesting to me. He's become predictable and inflexible, and just not that much fun to read about.This is a shame, because the overall theme of the story had all kinds of great potential (and, admittedly, some was followed through on), but so little was done with it. What a pity."},{"rating":"2","title":"No one makes music like this anymore (almost)...","review":"Looking for information about this band on the web I found this phrase \\"no one makes music this heavy anymore\\".I guess for someone who listen to the music played on the mainstream media it is true. But the fact is that even thought heavy music is released in several underground labels, black elk plays a different kind of heavy music. Music that defies classification. So, in order to makes this easier I would say that black elk plays some sort of sludge metal that in some parts can be very rocking, specially the last track \\"who knew?\\" which is the most easy to listen and quite a surprise.If you like sludge metal or and willing to hear different approaches to heavy music give black elk a chance, you might find a quite loud and great surprise.PD: the artwork is also great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"This guy has a nasal kid voice that sounded better in Zoinks!

All of the plans a basically the same with a few changes to give it a different look. You could say it was not what I was really looking for.

They have taken a basic design and reworked it to have a few different designs. This book is good for non-woodworkers who do not want to spend the cash on an entertainment center (actually this is partially true, since you will need a router, a table saw, a band saw, a drill press and clamps... so you might as well buy the entertainment center!)It has an okay section on making cabinet doors and building drawers.I guess my major gripe about this book is that I really don't like the basic design, and all other designs are rehashes of this one. I have build my entertainment center without using this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Effectively Not Red Elvises","review":"Quite simply, this is not really a Red Elvises album. It was an album written entirely by Zhenya Kolykhanv, who left the band shortly after to pursue other projects - and you can see why. The Red Elvises has always been about fun live rock and roll, and this is a mellow pop album.Now that's not to say that this is bad music. But those who keep spamming the review form about how great this music is, and how horrible it is that the Elvises don't play it live, should check out Zhenyas new band Zeerok, and leave the Elvises to do what they do best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zhenya bad, Igor good...","review":"The problem with this CD isn't that the band's style has left them, but rather that Zhenya has written all of the songs. Don't get me wrong, I love him as a member of the band, but he just has a pop style that doesn't fit the Red Elvises at all. Existing fans must not be put off! They released two albums simultaneously this time, one by Zhenya and one by Igor. All of the songs on Igor's new album, Welcome to the Freakshow, shine with classic Red Elvises style. Look into it instead, because I'd give it a 5!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Change for the worse","review":"Now, I'm all for a band to change its style and take some risks. I love that. But with the Red Elvises, when you listen to them, you expect to hear a certain sound. This album finds the band going towards a more \\"grungy\\" bar-rock style and puts its emphasis on the lyrics. LYRICS. Ever hear a Russian try to sing about a hot-dog stand girl? Not pretty. And when they sing about a fun night on the town consisting of doing cocaine in the limo, it makes you wonder what the heck they were thinking. I bought the album hoping to smile and laugh, but instead, this one is destined for the trash heap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Foot stomping fun","review":"Slade were the archetypical Glam Rock group with their huge platform shoes, glitter and 'over the top' dress style. Sure they were older than most of the bands of the time but somehow that didn't seem to matter. They certainly had the energy and sheer sense of fun that any younger band would have envied. This album features there greatest hits, of which there were many. From the loud and lively tracks such as Cum on Feel the Noize and 'Get Down and Get With it' to the more gentle 'Everyday' and 'How Does it Feel' there is something to suit every taste. Great fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Humvee of bottom brackets","review":"This bottom bracket is built like a humvee, overkill for most riders, but if your like me, you gotta have one.

It should be titled \\"How to Exploit the Poor for Maximum Profitability\\". He specifically targets low to moderate income neighborhoods, and then offers a variety of ways to nickel and dime the tenants. He basically states that they expect less, so he gives them less. If they want what would be minimal accoutrements, he charges them for these basic amenities. Then he touts rewarding tenants who comply with his \\"principals\\" modest gifts-through his \\"incentive programs\\". I think these gifts are to soothe his conscious. Don't be taken in.

It's full of the kind of fishing and sailing detail of Moby Dick, but without Melville's nuance or complexity. Instead, we get an insignificant frenzy of unrelated \\"facts\\" that we might expect from someone in a drug-induced state, who imagines that each experience during that time is fraught with deep significance.

Just a little hard to read, but very interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trawler: A Journey Through the North Atlantic","review":"Redmond O'Hanlon lost me on this one. There are a handful of fine vignettes of daily life and duty aboard the ship in \\"Trawler: A Journey Through the North Atlantic.\\" But those few succulent morsels are seriously outdone by a ponderous, rambling narrative, dashed off late at night which he never revisits to polish up, which simply, tires you out.I was disappointed because as an armchair adventurer, this could have been the type of tale I relish. But O'Hanlon's writing here is sloppy and loose, unstructured with lots of tangents that lead to dead-ends. It was too heavy to shake off.I can't recommend this book as a book of its type. There are many other seafaring adventure tales that \\"tell the tale well.\\" You might glance through this book and find the few juicy morsels but that's it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made me seasick","review":"This book has an interesting premise, adventure journey in the depths of winter into the harshest gales with the most foolhardy of fishermen on the North Seas. It's not an easy read, the narrative is disjointed and erratic. It's difficult to comprehend the purpose of most of the author's rambling passages other than to give you that woozy sense of nausea. At that, it succeeded. Like some of the other readers, the most pleasure I had from this book was realizing that I did not have to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed expectations","review":"More pictures(they supposedly took tons of pictures of things you don't see everyday) would have made this book of incoherent babble more interesting.I finally tossed it aside before I finished.Overall disappointing compared to the early reviews.

Fancy a run with some real life salts who face whatever the hurricane ravaged winter seas throw at them? Well don't go looking to Redmond O'Hanlon's \\"Trawler\\".O'Hanlon takes two potentially fascinating subjects - trawler fishing and the biology behind the creatures of the seas - and blends them into a putrid stew of nothingness.This is a very difficult book to read. Physically difficult! Aye! O'Hanlon's pointless, manic use of exclamation and emphasis - EMPHASIS! Aye! - lends nothing to the story but then there is so little story, it's really no loss.\\"Trawler\\" dredges the bottom of literary technique and hauls up nothing but stream of consciousness drivel. I found the book a total waste of time and will certainly never read another piece of work by O'Hanlon. Aye! I won't! Never!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad case of sleep-deprived testosterone poisoning","review":"I usually like O'Hanlon's books...I usually can't put them down. But this one...well, I'm just not sure I like it at all. Written in what O'Hanlon, I'm sure, thinks is a style akin to the sleep-deprived ramblings he must have encountered on the trawler, the book instead veers into incoherence and becomes only annoying. Revelations only work if you feel some sympathy and identification with the speaker and I found the speakers, with one exception, highly uninteresting and unsympathetic. Only big Bryan held my interest and I wanted to hear more from him.I found myself heartily sick of Luke, the walk-on-water marine biologist...he was like an orchestra work comprised of one note, played over and over and over. Jason the skipper...same thing. O'Hanlon invests them with a false nobility that just grates on the nerves after awhile.I can't recommend this book, but I heartily recommend O'Hanlon's other works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Broader, Wider, Better...","review":"...than any other fishing story I have ever read, including the one about that big white whale.

It's an improbable book,completely fascinating. Read it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"This book was an extreme disappointment. It is a series of manic run-on sentences that are extremely distracting and hard to follow. It does depict some of the danger and difficulty inherent in fishing the North Atlantic in winter but deviates so often from the original topic that it is a waste of time. The author spends too much time trying to be eloquent and witty that one loses track of what he is trying to communicate."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring incoherent mumbling","review":"The author travels on a British fishing trawler through the Atlantic. He glances over all the technical details of the fishing, and concentrates on the conversations of the crew. This turns the book into an incoherent rambling, jumping from topic to topic. It's never quite clear what is fact and what is lore. The book is similar to listening to random conversations at a cocktail party where you don't know anybody, except it is mainly about mating rituals of different fish mixed with British accent swearwords.I would much more recommend \\"The Hungry Ocean\\" and \\"Lobster Chronicles \\" by Linda Greenlaw, or \\"Working on the Edge\\" and \\"Coming Back Alive\\" by Spike Walker."},{"rating":"1","title":"I jumped ship","review":"I went fifty pages. I'm very interested in maritime lore and sea stories, but this was rough going. The narrator's friend Luke is made to spew lots of didactic talk about things the author is too lazy to show us. His emotions are conveyed through the constant use of italics, and he begins every sentence with the author's first name.Potentially very interesting, and apparently enjoyable to some, I thought this was a mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"parentheses overload","review":"I found this book to be unreadable. If most people are like me and hear a little voice in their head as they are reading, the parentheses the author uses in practically every paragraph means a constant interruption of the flow of the idea and presentation. O'Hanlon seems to believe (or maybe assumes) that we are interested (and need to know) in what the heck (hell?) he is thinking (doing, looking, analyzing) every minute as he sails (vacations perhaps?)across the Atlantic. He should just tell me what he wants me to experience; there is no need to suggest alternative thoughts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"Let me begin by saying that I absolutely love travel/adventure books, especially books at sea. So I was really looking forward to this book. I have never read a book more disappointing. The writing is almost impossible to follow. The setting (North Sea during Winter with tremendous storms) should have been spellbounding. Instead most of the book involves long discourses between crewmembers as if no one is listening to the other person. I believe only once does the author go above board and then only for a brief spell during a storm. This book is not worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY FROM AMAZON","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS AMP FROM AMAZON. I purchased this and received my amp and it DID NOT WORK!

I liked the movies okay. But this series is a travesty! I've watched six eps of the first series and have yet to see a race (and it's not as if it starts where the book did). They talk about racing; they seem to be on the fair circuit, which is a huge problem for me. The acting is horrible. They yell at each other all the time. Alec is unbelievable. Mickey Rooney makes William Shatner's Denny Crane look restrained. Every plot is like an after school special. This is not the black stallion and Alec Ramsey I grew up with and I'm not going to bother to finish this series because I'm so disappointed. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"15 minutes of info in >2hrs.","review":"I bought this video to help retrain my bass drum technique. I for one was very disappointed with the limited scope and how much excruciating detail is put into obvious and natural motions. The video doesn't go into any detail on more advanced applications such as repeated bass drum triplets, 32nd notes, or even touch on double bass drumming.The instructor talks WAY too much in a very monotone delivery. For every section, I've had to fast forward just to get to actual playing. I honestly believe I could get the same info from a shorter presentation on Youtube.At the same time, I purchased Jojo Mayer's \\"Secret Weapons\\" to develop hand technique. Jojo's video is superb and in comparison highlights what little info is in this DVD (but in excruciating detail)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably bad!!!!!","review":"When I first read the review of this documentary I thought,\\"Wow! I have to buy this\\". WHAT A MISTAKE!!!This is by far the worst piece of crap I've ever purchased. The \\"film-making\\" was absolutely horrible...Shaky, amateurish edits done with what looks like a cheap, home video camera. It literally looks like someones 12 year old kid put this together. But even if you can stomach the amateurish production, the bad story telling cannot be overlooked. The film-makers seemed to lose focus after the first 10 minutes of so....Very little meaningful insight into the man behind the music. All in all...a horrible document of a great musical talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been so great","review":"I love Steve Earle, and was really interested in a backstage look at his politics and tour.

Some great footage though, especialy the bluegrass show."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad, really sad...","review":"... and there was such great potential here but none of it was realized. Poor sound, poor camera work and way to much of Steve just jabbering on. Where there was finally some music as often as not there was taking over it too. I watched it once and sold it. If you want a lesson in Steve's politics, this is for you. If you want music, forget it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go rent something else","review":"Let me preface this by saying I love Steve Earle's music but this really is an appalling DVD.No doubt like many others, I was looking forward to this DVD, hearing Steve speak about making this album and it's subsequent reception from the public, the press and the politicians here in the US.What we get is a jumbled collection of live footage (which at times hints at how great a Steve Earle concert can be but generally falls short, especially with the Doctor Who-like effects) and some video that looked like it was shot with a Sony Handycam. I have no reason to suspect otherwise. The film has no thread and completely fails to draw you in. Poor sound, poor footage and poor editing will leave you wondering why you wasted two hours watching this - its not 2 hours long but you keep on rewinding because you can't hear what was said. This DVD is the musical equivalent of someone being given a fine piece of steak and deciding to make a sloppy Joe out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pretty good guide to commercial leasing","review":"This is a pretty good primer in commercial leasing. You have to start somewhere to get information, and this book is a good start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satire in its most nightmarish form","review":"Naked Lunch is, to say the least, not for everyone. One of the main addictions featured in it is of course addiction to heroin, but the novel is about so much more than that. It's about addiction of any kind whether it's to drugs, money, power, or sex. Here we are introduced to Dr. Benway (a behavioral conditioning freak), a man who teaches his rectum how to talk, and to a group of people to hang themselves to feel that final orgasm which is rumored to be more powerful than any others you could ever have. In this book Burroughs also takes a swipe at the media and the written word (or \\"word-virus\\") in general, trying to destroy the importance of the narrative. Burroughs believed the media used language to control the way we think; I read somewhere that he called Time and Life magazine \\"some kind of police force for the mind.\\" Some call this paranoia, others call it genius. I suggest you read this book and decide for yourselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Journey to Interzone","review":"The first time I read \\"Naked Lunch\\" I was 17 years old and wouldn't know \\"cut-up\\" from \\"collage\\" either in painting or in literature. I did, however, enjoy the book immensely and the images and sensations (some would say thrills) it provided were enough to get my teenage mind going in all sorts of directions.Five years passed and as I now read it again I can feel the same exhilaration I felt then. Surely it's a masterpiece, a truly innovative book that opened then, and should still open now, new paths for written expression. The subject matter may offend you, since it's very graphic in its descriptions of homossexual sex, drugs and other \\"violence\\".Just one last tip. As the author himself writes this book should be read not linearly but randomly, so to speak. Just open it on any page, any paragraph, any line, any word and start reading. Why should the way it was written not be the way it is read?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Scary","review":"I find it very scary that William S. Burroughs lived his life in the grip of these heroine-induced hallucinations, and that people walk around everday seeing the things that are documented in this book. Some of the parts of the book were very funny, some were stomach-turning, and most were unintelligable."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Kerouac lover's library MUST HAVE THIS!","review":"I must admit, I only grabbed this book because a character in another book I read was into Burroughs. That, and he was compared to my favorite author and thinker- Jack Kerouac. Even people that don't love the Beat generation will fall in love with Naked Lunch. It is very descriptive and will put some pretty crazy pictures in your head. No, its not for everyone, nor do I think people that aren't interested should read it. But, it is a definate beatnik classic- so fellow open-minded thinkers- READ ON. And if you're worried about its profane nature and illicit foulness, fear not- I read it in ninth grade, and am letting my ninth grader read it now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not certain of its value toward mankind.","review":"After reading the introduction I assumed (stupidly) that this book would be a worthwhile endeavor. After reading the majority of it (it is required for a course in literature) I felt as if it were useless trash. I understand the ravings of a junky could be wild and yet I find no value in this book. I dare not consider it literature and I am uncertain as to whether it should be considered fiction. Did this happen? To whom? My professor claims it to be satiracle and yet this is not to be remembered (much) by the author. I suppose that it has left me confused and astounded. Perhaps I am more of a prude than I would have imagined"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite possibly the WORST book yet written!","review":"This book is one of those books that people talk about a lot, but probably never actually read. If Burroughs's intention is to shock, sicken, and disgust the reader, then he accomplishes that task. Not only hard to understand (does it even HAVE a point??), but grotesquely profane, \\"Naked Lunch\\" isn't worth the paper it's printed on. Save yourself the money, and rent the film instead, which has absolutley nothing to do with the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"definitely entertaining...","review":"hard to follow in some parts? Oh, yes. Insanely incoherent in other parts? You bet. But, somehow, for some odd reason, I did like this book. There were little meccas of comedy, and strange, perverted truths scattered throughout the text.Alhtough we all know he was on drugs when he wrote it, it's worth a try. If you don't like it, trash it. But you just might, so give it a shot, even if you don't normally read Beat-Gen stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Depths of Insanity","review":"I have read this book three times and every time I feel something twisting and breaking inside of my head. Like I'm losing part of my sanity with each passing sentence. It is one complex yet enjoyable read. It's disturbing and beautiful.

But it happens. And boy has William Burroughs dropped a real stinker here. 200+ pages of utter drivel. no plot, no sense, nothing but sentence after sentence of peurile made-up nonsense that a retarded monkey tapping away on a laptop could come up with. and there are serious literary critics out there who thought this was 'one of the most important novels of the century'? .... what sort of 'junk' were they on? in fact, why weren't they characters in this gigantic turd of a novel.VK, London"},{"rating":"1","title":"Man what was that all about?","review":"I freely will admit to most people that I am an almost rabid consumer of literature. (as the hero in this book was a rabid consumer of drugs) Rarely do I come across a book I can put down, let alone quit reading in the middle of. But this book sent me packing! It really coins the word \\"trash\\". Also, until now I believed a book could never be to sexually explicet, but this novel changed my mind. It's downright shameless in some parts. I love the avante garde poetry of the author's buddy, beatnick Alan Ginsburg, so I wonder how this guy messed up? Oh it must've been the drugs. If you're looking for a good drug saturated book, try \\"Fear and Loathing in Las Vegas\\".

I gave it my shot, and found it to be a meaningless book. His writing is very good, but reading this book is like listening to a junkie ramble on on the bus seat beside you. I don't consider it art to see how chopped up and weird you can make something. Only a select few, I think, can really get the point of this book and enjoy it. There are better books out there, so why waste time with one that makes no gd sense? To Burrough's credit, I did give his novel \\"Junky\\" a try, and found that to be very good.

The author knows a lot of ten dollar words but there isn't a story here just many passages that just ramble on and on and further on.

I cannot believe that I made it through, but I did. When I was finished, I was exhausted, perplexed, and startled. At first glance the book looks like a novel, but it reads like an array of short stories interlaced. The scenes jump around so much that you get the real idea of what goes on in the mind of a heroin addict. Burroughs is one of the most masterful poets in the world. My recommendation is do not try to read this book to find a plot, understand the characters, or make sense of what happens. Just read the book word for word, sentence for sentence, and paragraph for paragraph. Take it at face value and you will enjoy the book thoroughly. Try to think too deeply, you will not be able to take it, and the book will anger you to no end. Definitely a good read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sold on name alone","review":"This book takes on an interesting point of view, but its sole quality is the descriptive power of the author. This alone will should not create a classic. Naked Lunch is read and applauded simply because of its unconventional approach, and not for its content. It has been considered controversial ever since the first printing, and is still admired solely for that reason. If you needed to read the entire book through to get his simple message, then you probably never got it, anyway. If this book was rewritten, with the same message, but minus the gratuitous sex, it would sell about a dozen copies."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's certainly a classic","review":"A classic of the Look at Me Look at Me I'm Going to Shock You Out of Your Bourgeois Complacency School of Literature. Ground breaking only in that Burroughs was one of the first to get this kind of book published. If you enjoy having juvenile social commentary screeched at you with all the intensity normally reserved to angry and deep high school juniors, with the added bonus of having it obscured by scatological metaphors whose referents reside mainly in Burroughs's drug addled brain, then read this book - there is no better.

I have seen very intelligent people rave about this book, but I just can't get into it. I do think it influenced Layne Staley of Alice in Chains though, so all you Dirt fans might want to check it out.

There is no real storyline one could easily explain, nor are the characters defined - Burroughs instead creates atmosphere, litle bits of subreality, and ends up with a world that is in a way more real than it oughta be - he is not afraid of loading it with an oddball mix of tiny stories, poems, events, descriptions and dialogues that dont have much to do with the 'main' story - as long as it's one huge nightmare, he keeps pushing it - and you simply have to enjoy it, even if you cant really tell why.

It shows humanity as its uncovered self, and exposes the bizarre society He has created. This book is deliciously warped and will blow your mind with its awesome descriptions and well-selected scenes. It is drugs sex and society. It is life. I highly reccomend this to anyone looking for a life-changing book. This book had me spell-bound, nothing like anything I had ever read before. I'm immediatly going to buy \\"Junky\\"-its sequel- now that I've finished \\"Naked Lunch.\\" This book is a lot like one of its main characters (heroin) in how damn addicting it is.

But after a while i finally grasped onto the pace of the book and what was being written about, you can't attempt to make sense of what you are reading or you will be confused you have to just let the words grasp and play with your mind and you can try to make sense of it all later.

Some of his prose was pure poetry. when I finished this book all I could say was wow, you don't have to follow a set of rules about writing to create a masterpiece. sometimes all you need is orginality.

After suffering through this horrible \\"work\\", underground (DEEP UNDERGROUND) is where this tome belongs. Basically, the book is an unending montage of nonsensical images spliced in with bizarre homosexual occurances. You could literally pick out a page at random and still have an overall feel for the book. It can be simply described as a junkie with homosexual tendencies who prattles on and on, thinking he's interesting. Many have tried to have this book censored from schools, but that should never happen. Far from it. All juveniles should be FORCED to read it to see what happens when you're constantly stoned. A stronger anti-drug message could never be made.

I had to force myself to finish this book, because it just did not really hold my interest at all. Although I could appreciate the dark, twisted, imaginative imagery, there was just no real story to speak of. There were hints of satire here and there, but then the prose would just descend into an incoherent mess. I can only recommend this book as a cautionary tale about the nightmarish, horrifying, delusional state that being a heroin junkie must put you in.For a more clear and coherent surreal pornographic nightmare, I'd recommend \\"Story of the Eye\\" ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"I dare you to read it...","review":"This book is both a test of the metal of \\"open\\" minds and a bath in a world that existed. A previous reviewer asked \\"Did this happen to someone?\\" Yes, it did. Naked Lunch is a collection of visions William S. Burroughs had in his many many years of hard core drug abuse.

I forced myself to read it far past where I wanted to put it down. The style of writing was confusing and prohibited access to the larger meaning of the novel. I understand that many think this is a revolutionary piece of work. I gave it a two because I thought it took a chance, but I'm afraid if the reader can't stay involved than ultimately the author has failed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn....","review":"Having occasionally shared neighborhoods with junkies, I have always been amazed by how thoroughly uninteresting their lives are. This book confirms my view. It works really hard to make lives of junkies literary interesting, but fails since the material that the author works with is intrinsically dull. One cannot but help shedding a tear for all the trees that has been wasted making this all too thick book.(A disclaimer: If this book picks up in the second half I may be a bit unfair.

It begs to be read as an example of how you can fool people into believing you have something to say. It is just a long trip from old William, but heck, anyone can get high and write nonsense. Besides, irreverent tone (remember the accursed poets?), rupture of the traditional narrative (remember Joyce?), surrealistic experience (remember Breton himself?)... let's face it: William Burroughs was a rebel, and an elocuent icon of what contemporary ideology hates, and an incredibly strong figure at that; however, that does not make him a good writer, much less a literary vanguardist, only a critic. Naked Lunch is the living proof of the author's wit, given his ultimate status as a popular icon... evidence of how something exotic or irrational can automatically be taken as interesting or avant-grade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Naked Illuminati","review":"Probablythemost creative book ever written up to that point.Or as creative(2)you click clickclikcprofiles theexploits ofthe exploitation ofstripping bloodlines oftransformationgood4learnin'.profiling thenaked illuminaticlicking to locate the naked illuminati(name and address)my bloodlines: kennethbruce updike, jrHesse, St Luke, Bauer/Rothschild, brainwashing minions,not willing to mainstream the one black sheepon the profile,the link to the documentation.A meal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Awful","review":"I was tempted to read this book after reading several of Kerouac's, but was dissapointed to find nothing but the incoherent rambling of a brain dead dope fiend. It was neither enjoyable nor interesting. If this book had not been charged with obscenity, I doubt if it would be read by anyone at all. A Reader describes it excellently, \\"to manipulate words into incomprehensible patterns of incoherent ideas.\\" It does not describe what it is like to be alive and free thnking; the book describes (poorly) death and the enslavement of the will by addiction. To make oneself unable to think and communicate by surfeiting on drugs does not make one a genius or an artist.

I expect a book which discusses the daily life of a drug addict. I was very dissappointed.Aside from a few circumstances the book was little to do with drug addition. Instead, the book spends most of its time discussing homosexual experiences of a drug addict. The book is largely incoherent. However, it has been suggested that this book is best read like poetry.

The picture quality is quite good, but since the movie has a very filtered/processed look, don't expect to see as much detail as you might on other Blu-ray releases.

The major difference is the increased production, FX, martial arts choreography, and campiness. It truly is amazing for a movie to be some awesome yet contain so much cheese (the sound effects are atrocious). The combined \\"talents\\" of Jaime Pressly, Devon Aoki, Holly Valance, Sarah Carter, and Natassia Malthe blend seamlessly - and sometimes bralessly - with the nonstop action expected from a video-game adaptation. The fact that Eric Roberts - a man who oozes cheese out of every pore - is the main antagonist only amplifies the direction and feel of the film.With no blood, no real nudity, and everything mentioned above, this is not much more than a guilty pleasure. And that's why I loved it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Better than I thought it would be\\"","review":"That's what everyone that has seen the movie is saying. And they are right. Those same words came out of my mouth. I'm a fan of Sarah Carter plus I'm familiar with the Dead or Alive games so I was interested in seeing the movie. And I thought it was great. The fight scenes were so good I could feel the punches. I haven't felt like that during fight scenes since The Batman and Superman Anmated Series. If the movie was 3D I think I would've came out with a black eye. The hits were unbelievable. The story was good, it did not drift apart and bore the hell out of you. I was looking out for the story and I can't complain. I look forward to seeing this on dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun & Enjoyable Movie","review":"If you're looking for an enjoyable not-serious action movie with really hot girls, then this is the movie for you.

The picture quality is fairly poor, but the sound will knock you on your butt for sure. The short \\"making of\\" featurette is worth watching, but there is no other speacial features on the disc.Overall I would say that anyone who likes the games, likes Hong Kong style movies, or just likes seeing hot chicks kicking a$$, should buy this movie.

Just add it to another item to get over $[...] and you don't have to pay for shipping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie!","review":"I bought this sight unseen.

When comparing it to a broadcast version of 1.33:1, you can clearly see that the top and bottom are cut off on this dvd. This is especialy evident when viewing Jamie coming out of the water in her first scene. Face it, 90% of they buyers want this movie for the girls. Cutting off parts of their anatomy is just plain wrong. For those looking for the fights, it also cuts off action too. It is amazing that they actualy released a blu-ray of this. Silly predictable movie. Of course a clearer view of the girls is always prefered but why make it clearer if you don't see as much? I'm assuming that the blu-ray listing of 2.35:1 is correct for \\"that\\" release.I would like to see this in the aspect of the \\"original un-masked celuloid negative\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please just say you're sorry and I'll forgive you","review":"We all know why we bought or rented this flick.

First, the hero and heroine smoke, which may not have been a big deal in the 1990s when this was written, but by today's standards it's a jarring note. Second, the heroine's charming father drinks.

It forces you to either see children as blessings and gifts from God or as necessary burdens we must bear in this life to somehow prolong our names. After reading this book, my husband and I not only had a different outlook toward our own children (and as to how many we have), but it also gave us a new outlook on children in general. I think all Christian couples should read this book to help balance the perspective of childbearing we have received in a world that tries to pawn our children off to others as their responsibility."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspirational and challenging","review":"This was one of the most challenging books I have ever encountered. I read it as a new wife and was suprised but refreshed by the notion of trusting God with the size of one's family. Not using birth control was something I had formerly considered a poor use of judgement. My heart and opinions have been profoundly changed since reading this book three years ago. We now have two beautiful children and I'm so thankful and blessed I opened my eyes to what a blessing children are (and what a burden they are NOT!) :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Life-changing!!","review":"If you don't want what you've always thought challenged... if you want to keep your head in the sand about what God says about children... if you want to miss out on unqualified blessings... don't read this book....

The follower's of Jesus did not all have a quiver full, but their lives still had a great purpose for God! Depends on God's plan for your individual life.sex=babies...it would be selfish of me to not use birth control and God-given common sense for basing how many kids the Holy Spirit has impressed upon me to consider having. If left to God's laws of nature and not His Holy Spirit, I would have more than He's purposed me to have, by the laws of nature He's put into place. He is in control of my heart's desires too and Lord of them...I can trust in His still small voice for His wisdom in this matter, too. (For example, gravity is also a law of nature, and yet we are expected to work with it too using our God-given common sense!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misguided and judgmental","review":"This book, whilst sincere and helpful in small parts, is sincerely misguided.

The world needs less children not more.God gave you a brain, a sense of self-restraint, and hopefully, common sense. Pumping out kids simply because your biology allows it is both irresponsible and in this age, arguably unethical. The endorsement of such irresponsible behavior certainly is. Yes, if you try, the bulk of you can breed like rabbits, whether you pray to God or not. That doesn't make it a good idea, for you, your kids, or the rest of the planet.Moderation, folks.

I would give this book about five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best books I've Ever Read","review":"I first read this book as a teenager in Junior High school and have read it many times since in the past 10+ years. It is a wonderful story of an abused boy and a gruff old man who find in each other what they have always wanted, a father for the boy, and a child for the man. Both boy and man have been damaged and they help each other heal and grow. I just love this book and would recommend it to anyone, child or adult. It is a very heartwarming, at times vividly graphic depiction of child abuse and the aftermath. Take heart, it has a happy ending!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Goodnight Mister Tom Rules","review":"Goodnight Mister Tom is a novel and a history all in one. No it is not a true story, but the way Michelle Morgan tells it, it almost is. It's about the abused Willie Beach who gets evacuated from London during World War II. He stays with a grumpy but nice old man named Thomas Oakley. There he learns to be happy and how to live life to its fullest. I would suggest this book to ages 10 and up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Graphic scenes are unnecessary","review":"This novel details a wonderful relationship between a boy, and a man and his village who open the boy's eyes to the world outside of his mother's over-zealous religious thinking. My problem with the book is the chapter called, \\"Home\\" where the author goes into great detail about the physical abuse the boy went through at the hands of his own mother, and the image of an infant dying in the small boys' arms. Who wants to read violence against children in such great detail?Overall the story is nice, and provides a good fictional overview of WWII. The author took the mother's religious overzealousness way too far in the descriptions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goodnight Mr. Tom, the Worst Book Yet","review":"i think that this book was a very boring and meaningless book. the characters had no significance or any special character traits. alos, the writeer does not know how to catch the reader's attention even in the most tense moments. its a shame that this book was even printed out for readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A meaningful story of hope, love and courage","review":"This story really is a touching story of a little boy and his new father.

But while most of the book is taken up with William's recovery (both mental and physical), Magorian is not afraid to show us what happened to him. It is a true mark of her skill as a writer that our brief glimpse into this darker side of the story is done with a very light touch, making it completely believable, but not at all overwhelming.

When I got to many parts, I was shocked. I am a Christian, and I didn't agree with th author putting all those gay couples in the book.

Everything in Dual was stolen from evangelion, the main character was a shinji ikari rip off, and the two girls were EXACTLY like asuka and Rei. Even the mechs they had looked like evas. Its a pity that people would give this 5 stars. The length of it was also lame, it had 13 episodes, yup 13! and I think they chose 13 because its an unlucky number and the stupid fans would think this is creepy (something evangelion always has been)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor choice","review":"I have owned this for a about 1 year and I have yet to get it to work.

Defying the New York art crowd, Kiss put real muscle behind their image, as evidenced by this show. The black and white footage gives a surreal feeling like you're watching Kiss in a parallel universe, a feeling also enhanced by the way they perform some of the songs. The one hadicap of this thing is the terrible instrumental interludes done by the fan that put this DVD together.

I tried to create a label using the stick on labels but they will not stick to the surface and the fit is not exact. The size of label I used may be my fault but I am sure I used the right size and no matter it still don't stick on the surface. I tried going to a print shop to see if they would print a label on these cds and they said no. The only way I can see to get a label for these cds is to have them printed online from one of the specialty cd providers and print shops usually used for mass production. In closing if you want to make a small quantity and your own labels use the round 80mm mini cd.

There is no doubt that kids at this age may be exposed to some of this- but not to the extent of the descriptions in these stories. The stories will make students very uncomfortable and not because of the dilemmas so much as these references; parents will definitely oppose this as well.

I watched many films like this but of poor quality and in black and white, when I lived in Hong Kong 35 years ago. It would not be accurate to describe it as soap opera but it is certainly melodrama.There are many better films than this coming out of modern China.

The message--this is a birth of a simple man, just like you and me, and who's life is just as important as yours and mine. No Hallejujah Choruses, just beautiful music.If you want a different feel to the Christmas feeling, listen to this work. You will be pleased.Just to mentioned other classical works that involve Christmas abd great, great music.1) Ralph Vaughan Williams-A Fantasy on Christmas Carols2) Honegger-A Christmas Cantata3) Hely-Hutchinson-A Carol Symphony.

Had to remove the battery just to shut it up! Wish I had read the reviews prior to purchasing. Nixon may be the cool watch to have but this model is very poor quality for $90.00 plus shipping! Went to the Nixon website and they want a $67.00 pre-authorization on my credit card in case the repair doesn't fall under warranty.

One of my favorites for the last few years. I have to say though, the writing for this season was about 2 rungs lower on the ladder than any other season. What's to blame? Was it Dee being pregnant? Was it the fact that her husband (Mack) is the main writer for the show? Are they struggling to find new ways to push the envelope? Have they developed the existing characters as far as they can go?Regardless of the cause, I'd say that if you're a casual watcher of this show, purchase a different season and maybe wait until this season is played on Comedy Central. If you're a die hard fan like me, I'm sure you've already seen this season and will buy the DVD just to keep your collection intact."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good season","review":"I've always been a Sunny fan but notice that this past season wasn't as great as I had hoped.

Again they are able to tackle unpolitically correct issues with little taste in a hilarious way. very funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Season 6 is not that Sunny","review":"The critics of this season are correct, but with one caveat: Your frame of reference. As a follow-up to seasons 1-5, the sixth season of It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia is a big disappointment. The previous seasons set the bar high, and as long time fans sit down to watch this season, they expect that same level of greatness. The cast, and especially the writers, did not deliver. The performances were phoned-in, the stories were lacking, and the season finale was rehash of year old special that many fans had already seen. However, for many, this will be their first exposure to the show. For people who don't know any better, it will be funny and entertaining (and not a let down). In a way, these people are lucky, because as they watch previous seasons they're in for a treat.So the bottom line is that this season is not as good as past seasons, in fact, in comparison it's bad. On its own, it's just okay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully Unfunny Season 6","review":"I cannot recommend the first five seasons of It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia more. They are just the best of the best when it comes to a comedic television series. This season, however, is flat and painfully unfunny. I don't know if the cast is too involved in side projects, if there are new writers, if the first five were writen closer together, or what the case may be, but it is a shell of what it was. The dialogue and jokes are basically reused from the past five seasons and the storylines, although funny on paper, are flat and \\"by-the-number\\" in Always Sunny standards. Please come back next season, because Season 6 is a total, and consistant, pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brilliant moments but probably the worst season yet","review":"I love the show but I have to agree with most of the other reviewers.

That being said, this season had a few great moments, but really felt like it was lacking. I wish Kaitlin would have taken a break this season instead of parading around preggers. I applaud her for continuing to work through her pregnancy but it left a bad taste in my mouth as it felt like they were using her unborn child to sell the season. The last episode made me want to vomit. It was incredibly formulaic. It makes me sad that every episode was entirely predictable. One of my favorite things about the show was how shockingly funny it was. Instead I wish I could erase this season from my memory. I tried to tough it out to the very end, clinging to the frail hope that they would WOW me and it fell flat. If I were that child I would be furious and feel used."},{"rating":"1","title":"It may be always sunny but NOT always funny!!","review":"Not sure exactly what happened, but no where near as funny as earlier seasons.

It is similar to Rainbow Six but I found H&D to be much easier to set up teams and weapons and to map out strategies. The scenarios are all different and pull you in (unlike Delta force where each mission seemed like the one before).

You can even pick up weapons from your oponents dead bodies (nice touch). The germans even have different uniforms! You can drive a variety of tanks, trucks, and cars. You can even set up what part of your team is going to do (example: You can have them follow you, lay cover fire, or even move from one place to another) while you take one of the team to accomplish the mission.

If you want to get into the donnas, don't go for this CD first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Third-Rate Ramones Sound","review":"Now, I am a fan of punk rock and girl groups, (which is why I bought this CD in the first place), but I am not a fan of this album. To me, \\"The Donnas\\" sounds like the Ramones would if they were A)bad and B)girls. This album is also quite long considering the fact that basically all the songs sound the same. From what I've heard from them The Donnas have improved greatly since this album, and I wouldn't discourage anyone from getting into them...I would, however, discourage them from buying this specific album. Go for some more recent stuff and maybe work your way back to this one eventually."},{"rating":"1","title":"4 Girls Imitating The Ramones - badly","review":"Sorry, but the only gimmick these girls have going for them is their youth. They're just a Ramones rip-off! They're not even as clever musically as the Ramones... yikes.

It's nothing but the same songs over and over agin. The same lyrical material in most of the songs makes for a boring record. They're not even comparable to the Ramones because at least the Ramones had the brains to add a little diversity to their songs. Don't buy this CD. If you want a girl band, try the Red Aunts, Sleater-Kinney, Babes in Toyland, or Fluffy. This gets two stars because they have enough talent(? ) to get signed to a label."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reel and Raw","review":"People who are criticizing this for being raw, simplistic and poorly written do not understand what punk rock is and have been raised on the shopping mall version. This is real and cool, much like The Ramones in their early days but from a bratty teen punk chick perspective. It's high school punk at it's best and the tracks that are recorded the worst(reminds me of The Germs first 45, maybe recorded worse!!)are actually the most interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Donnas","review":"In my opinion this is much better that American Teenage Rock n' Roll Machine. The songs are raw and don't suffer from overproduction. The songwriting is awesome and they just seem to have more spirit on this one. This is one of my favorite albums ever: every song is great. Some of them could have been recorded better, but this is the catchiest stuff they've done (although I haven't bought the new one yet). Many of these songs (i.e., Lana and Stevie, I Don't Wanna Rock N' Roll Tonight, High School Yum Yum ...) are classics in the girl punk pop genre. Very worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"underrated and raw","review":"The above reviews are far too harsh. This album is pure punk, in style and spirit. Their later albums veer more towards KISS and AC/DC which is all well and good.

At least with FS98, you can load it and play it off your hard drive. Iv'e spent more time loading and, swapping cd's than I have playing FS2000. Nothing too \\"whoopee\\" about their so called improved graphics either. A few little \\"frills\\" here and, there.

Who ever heard of flying anything with the fuel pump turned off and instruments working with the Pitot Heat switch in off position? Graphics detail? Where is the Mississippi River? I can't find it and it should be 3 miles from the main runway at St. Charles County Smartt Field. It's trash and I am going to mutilate the CDs and ship the game box back to Bill Gates. I have my pride.Sierra Software pioneered the flight simulator and for many years was quite successful with it. It's unbelievable that this product put Sierra out of the flight simulator business.

New 3D Landscape, Real-world weather, two more planes (4 more on pro ver), High resolution destinations and much more. If you have played FS98, you will feel the difference. The worst part is it has EXTREMELY HIGH System Requirements. I have PIII 600Mhz, 128MB Ram & 16Mb V3 3000. Frame rate was 18-24 at 1280X768 when i first played it (Full Screen increases perfromances). Then i read it on the manual that for the best performance upgrade your drivers and install FS2000 upgrade too. Then the frame rate was 28-36. WOW!

It is an incredible ammount more realistic!!! If FSX is too powerful for you, I suggest getting FS2004. It is a great program, with TONS of addons and a great comunity around it.

With this program, you can take a private pilot checkride, and upon passing, be presented with a printable award. You can then go on to get an insturment rating, commercial license, and air transport license. The planes are equipped with gps and moving map display, which really helps navigating. The weather effects are much better with this program, you can actually see the rain, and the wind shear is very realistic. You will need a fairly quick computer to run the program, in order to get a decent frame rate. I use a 400 mhz machine and get about 27 frm/sec, which looks OK.

I will continue to use F/S 98 . I hope that Microsoft can work out the kinks in the program. It does seem like others have had these problems.

It's been too long between albums and I hope it won't be so long next time. I love the Luther Vandross song and my other favourite is Boston. If you like soothing, soulful music, then this is for you. She's a great talent and she's always getting better."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the love of melancholy...","review":"The Luther remake is solid, but not spectacular. After that, its little more a litany of music and lyrics about love gone bad. No dynamics, and very little real emotion. Perhaps indifferent or apathetic could be used to describe the feeling this record evokes; a feeling that is neither too hot or too cold but not just right. Fortunately for us, Lalah's voice is just warm enough to prevent you from wanting to spew this disc out of your collection. She has yet to release record as good as her debut. But then again some of her father's records were a bit uneven, so I guess those genetics extend to Lalah's music also. Still, I'd buy this just because she is just plain beautiful, both physically and vocally. Hopefully the music will catch up someday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stellar!!!","review":"Amazing, amazing, amazing!!! Did I say amazing? Lalah Hathaway, by far, is the world's best kept secret!

However, seeing as how her appearances are so few and far between, I will find satisfaction in the laid back, melodic, smoothe, accurate, authentic vocals she offers on her CDs.

Many of the songs tendto be \\"I thought you loved me...\\"Remember when we loved eachother...\\" typical fair.

Anyway I got this and couldn't wait to hear what this beautiful young lady had in store and I was blown away of how boring and depressing this was.This CD has 1 good song and it's that one single that overplayed on the urban stations. The same single, by the way , is available on the Luther Vandross tribute 'For Always , Forever , For Luther'.I expected more of a Regina Belle vibe but what you get is the same,same feeling of depression all throughout.For music lovers who want to feel the different moods and the burning flames of a woman in love , then I urge to listen to the latest outing by Regina Belle , 'Lazy Afternoon', a true masterpiece."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok","review":"Its an ok album.

Multiplying the amount by ten gives no advantage to the body, considering the body's tissues cannot even uptake more than the RDA. There is no clinical evidence of vitamin C, of any amount, as a cure or prevention of any major disease, or the common cold. Its clinical uses are limited to aiding the body's absorption of iron in the GI tract, and acidifying the urine. Excess doses can also lead to the formation of kidney stones.(Sources: Walton and Gisvold's Textbook of Organic Medicinal and Pharmaceutical Chemistry, Ch 28; Harper's Illustrated Biochemistry, 29th ed, Ch 44)"},{"rating":"1","title":"DIDN'T ORDER THIS","review":"I DID NOT ORDER THIS ITEM BUT GOT CHARGED FOR IT ANYWAY.

Just makes you want to stick your tongue out, and put your horns in the air!!!!In fact I don't know why people say it sounds old, or 80's style, it rocks pretty damn hard! Let's get the pretentiousness out of the way--when did Saliva ever put out a thought provoking album? The only person out there putting material that's thought provoking is probably Marilyn Manson, and he gets no credit for it because of his stage antics, and persona... SOS reminds me of the old school KISS albums, with some AC/DC, and every other party band. They are not here to change the world. If you want salvation then go buy Radiohead, or some other crap like Incubus!This album is for those who want to rock!!! In fact I'll be playing this album next time I have a party.

I had seen them twice in concert and thought they were pretty good live and had much more intensity live. I can see where this CD may be a little hard to swallow for the teenie mall-core rap-wannabe crowd. This CD just rocks and doesn't try to pretend to be nu-metal for 14yr olds. I imagine the people who love this CD will be the older true rock n' roll crowd and the kiddies may be turned off by it.

Back into Your System = started to turn commericial... but still good. this album = trash. I'm not sure what exactly they were trying to accomplish with this album (retro 80s rock i guess?) but they failed. The music seems very un-natural for josey scott and to be honest i don't think he's enjoying himself on this CD. I hope they found what they were looking for because i sure didn't. goodbye saliva."},{"rating":"1","title":"Survival Of The Sickest","review":"You can tell touring with Aerosmith and Kiss had a big impact on these guys. With this album they tried to do the whole \\"rock and roll\\" sound. The only problem with that is that Saliva doesnt have nearly enough talent to do this type of music. All of these songs are ruined by Josey Scotts whiney, nasal and terrible vocals, and the guitar solos are a joke. The thing is that some of the songs here are decent. Rock and Roll Revolution would be a good song, with a new vocalist and new guitarist. These guys really just need to stick to nu-metal, thats the only genre they have enough talent for (which doesnt require any). And yes...Saliva did steal the riff from \\"The Fight Song\\" by Marilyn Manson. Listen to them both and compare. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money...","review":"The worst saliva cd yet to date. Theres best hands down is back into your system. This one just sucks. Plain and simple.

'Every Six Seconds' and 'Back into Your System' had such great cuts with great harmonies and you could just totally rock and roll with each song. This, friends, is garbage.

Pity."},{"rating":"1","title":"I second the fact that this is a ripoff","review":"Ok, normally I do not do these type of reviews, because I don't like when people bash bands that I like simply because they don't like the music. I have no hatred for Saliva, I just think that the whole world should know that Osmun315, who posted a few months ago, is right. I just got back from a Marilyn Manson concert and on the ride back heard the Survival of the Sickest song on the radio. My friend and I immediately thought we were listening to Manson's Fight Song, but it turned out to be something different entirely. I think it is quite pathetic that these guys can't come up with something original, but at least they stole a riff from someone great like Manson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Umm...","review":"I'm not really into Rock music but I got Saliva's \\"Back Into Your System\\" and loved it! I wanted some new material so I got \\"Survival of The Slickest\\"...But it's a little too much for me. That's not to say it's a bad CD, but I only like one song...It's just too rock, I guess.

The effects are awesome.HAVE A CIGAR: One of the most well-known Floyd songs, also a catchy tune.WISH YOU WERE HERE: The title track, and probably the best song on here.

I am 20 now, and I still love their music. I have just one thing to say about this album. This is their *only* album which can never be given anything less than a full 5 stars, by anyone who rates it honestly. Look at all the reviews before this one. Pink Floyd does not get any better than this. All the music in the world does not, and most probably shall not get any better than this. If they sound like strong words, well.

A wonderful tribute to Floyd founding member and soul--Syd Barrett","review":"This CD is a fantastic follow-up to Dark Side of the Moon. It is also a wonderful tribute to Pink Floyd founding member, the heart and soul of their music, former band member, the now late, great Syd Barrett. This is or was, I should say, an often overlooked diamond within Pink Floyd's music catalog. It has withstood the test of time well and is finally receiving the attention it deserved when it was first released. This is an essential Pink Floyd album and in many earlier Floyd fans' opinion, no disrespect meant to \\"The Wall\\" which began a more Roger Waters-driven era, the last great album the band produced."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album by a great band","review":"This album only contains five songs, but it is great from start to finish.

(But it sound ever better now thanks to CD quality sound.) That description sounds \\"out-there\\" - but this album, each song individually & also as a whole-album experience, is what I consider to be one of the best ever made by any artist. Beyond a great classic; a real work of art."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you, Roger","review":"Pink Floyd released in 1975 one of their best albums. With tracks as \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\" and \\"Welcome To The Machine\\", this is absolute psychedelic.

This is a must for fans of GOOD MUSIC."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Wish You Could Hear\\"","review":"The previous reviewer by \\"The Lightning Bug\\" doesn't know what he is talking about, or at least what he is listening to.

Granted Floyd is an Icon and we all appreciate their music and Gestalt, but this is rather weak. Some of the 1 Star reviewers said it well. However, back in 1987 Chris Pederson and I traveled the country on his AMEX card and he LOVED this CD. That, coupled with the daily discount price got me on-board. Chris...I miss ya buddy.

I have an older Onkyo reciever whic does not have an HDMI connection and with which I have watched a lot of movies on Blu-ray and DVD and have never had an issue getting a surrund sound. I have been using the optical connection for sound. So, is this lack of the more recent technology on my receiver the reason for not getting a surround sound?

That album was beautiful and kaleidoscopic. This one is boring, long-winded and mean-spirited. The first song alone must go for twenty minutes! And the \\"best\\" song here, the title song, sounds like a Wallflowers castoff. A lot of people love this album, but I don't know why."},{"rating":"2","title":"A both moving and cynical masterpiece","review":"Let me begin by saying that although the album is flawless, and is best when listened to as a whole, for me the most moving songs are \\"Shine on you crazy diamond\\" and \\"Wish you were here\\". \\"Shine on you crazy diamond\\" is my favorite song of all time because of it's message, and the way the guitar almost says more then the lyrics. \\"Wish you were here\\" plays like a bittersweet love song, wrenching out tears because of it's beauty. This album, as well as \\"Meddle\\" are the group's best efforts. I over look Dark Side Of The Moon because it is almost to well known and sterile. Buy these two albums to truely experience Pink Floyd."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Follow-up to the \\"Dark Side\\"","review":"\\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" is Pink Floyd's a masterpiece and best album, but as a follow up \\"Wish You Were Here,\\" doesn't disappoint. In fact, the middle three songs, \\"Welcome to the Machine,\\" \\"Have a Cigar\\" and the title track are as good as anything on \\"Dark Side.\\" The rest of the album is taken up with the lazy noodling nine-part (in two sections) \\"Shine One You Crazy Diamond,\\" some of which is very good, but as a whole is a bit trying to the patience. Overall, a very good album."},{"rating":"2","title":"See other 5 star reviews for details","review":"The other two previous 5 star reviews do a much better job of discussing the individual songs on this CD so look there for more of that kind of information.I remember the first time I heard this album as it was also the first time I had heard any of its songs. It was the end of 1975 and a local rock station, K-99 in Birmingham, was just starting up and was playing entire albums uninterrupped. I remember listening transfixed to WYWH that first time and thinking, it just can't get any better than this. And for those wondering, I was stone-cold sober at the time (that time anyway).Now, it is over 30 years later and I can still listen to WYWH and not tire of it and I still remember the details of the first time I heard it like it was the Kennedy assassination. Albums like that don't grow on trees."},{"rating":"2","title":"an emotional extraordinary album, by far the best","review":"When i first got this CD i only really listened to \\"Wish you were here\\" and Cigar, but then i listened to the rest of the album, and i am obsessed.

The recording sounds fantastic, easily superior to a CNET half speed mastered copy I have. The down side is RTI. They can take a fabulous master and screw it up. From scuffs on new vinyl, to bubbled and lifting labels, I swear, do they just ship everything they press? Does anyone look at the vinyl? Any time I see the RTI pink vinyl sleeve I cringe and expect to find some manufacturing defect. They are 60/40 return rate in my experience.Oh well, thanks to amazon I can get another copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"a brilliant follow up to Dark Side....","review":"Probably the most melodic Floyd album. The band members collaborated on the music, and it shows. The lush keyboards of Rick Wright and the bluesy guitar of David Gilmour, while seemingly at odds, mesh quite well . The lyrics are at times incredibly cynical ( especially on \\"Have A Cigar\\" a diatribe against the music business and \\"Welcome to the Machine\\" which makes the listener for once feel a bit of pity for the mega rich rock star, no small feat in itself) and at times quite sentimental ( the title track, split into two different sections, is an affectionate ode to Syd Barrett, their leader in the very early days of the Floyd.) Another great Floyd album.Essential. I think it's my favourite."},{"rating":"2","title":"my introduction to Pink Floyd","review":"this was the first Pink Floyd album I heard all the way through. I listened to it about ten times one night when I was camping. It always will hold a special place in my heart, but I perfer the early Syd Barrett years. ROger Waters is a bit of a control freak.

I love the chilled out first 4 minutes of \\"Shine On\\" with Wright's hammond and Gilmour's liquid cool guitar (Shine On Part I, I guess). Makes me think I am laying on my back in a 1970's Apollo Program spacesuit, floating out of the solar system...The rest of Shine On (Parts II-V) is also quite good. I like the lyrics/vocals and also the sax to close out Part V. \\"Welcome to the Machine\\" is one of 70's Floyd's most progressive songs, and thus the least commercial and accessible song on this album. \\"Have a Cigar\\" is another good one - Gilmour's closing guitar work is excellent. \\"Wish You Were Here\\" is obviously one of Floyd's greatest achievements, and contains some of Waters' best and most starkly poetic lyrics.Closing with \\"Shine On (Parts VI-IX)\\" takes you back to where you started. The way the songs flow seamlessly together throughout this album is another Floyd trademark.Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the rock???","review":"What type of hard rock band is this?

I've done careful evaluations of the Mastersound edition against all of the other versions available, and there is no comparison except for perhaps clean vinyl LP of WYWH on a top-line McIntosh tube system.Think about it. What do a scarf, set of coasters and three marbles have to do with this album? It's a desperate and cynical attempt by the music industry to resell classic albums over and over to \\"completists,\\" when all they really need is the music itself, not a $100 box full of useless swag.Listen to the lyrics to \\"Have a Cigar\\" again and hear the irony of it being associated with this ridiculous consumerism-driven box set."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"Masterpiece is the word to describe this album..

Although it has only 5 songs, it's longer than the 10-song Dark Side of the Moon!SONG LIST:SHINE ON YOU CRAZY DIAMOND PT. 1: Being about 13 minutes long, its the longest song on the album. Lots of moving music, great lyrics, and a nice saxaphone solo at the end.WELCOME TO THE MACHINE: Tells about the band's negative feelings toward the music industry. Nice guitar and synthesizer effects, and it has a powerful feel to it.HAVE A CIGAR: Another song attacking the music industry. Great rock song with nice vocals. \\"We call it riding the Gravy Train!\\"WISH YOU WERE HERE: My favorite song in the album. Great music and moving lyrics.SHINE ON YOU CRAZY DIAMOND PT. 2: Second longest song in the album, about 12 minutes. Just as good as the first.Overall, it's an awesome album. Do yourself a favor and pick this CD up today!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe Pink Floyd's Best","review":"It has about as many lyrics as three normal songs but that doesn't matter.

'shine on you crazy diamond' is probably the best song pink floyd has ever done (in terms of instrument playing, structure, lyrics, and flow.) 'welcome to the machine' and 'have a cigar' are direct and to the point, giving the listener a sense of feeling. and the title track is simply amazing, with an eloquent acoustic guitar, and the lyrics are short, but amazingly potent. deep stuff. all in all, this is a huge tribute to syd, and the best tribute he could have gotten, this is truly what he deserved."},{"rating":"2","title":"One for the Madcap","review":"This album is basically a period of great catharsis. Syd barrett had sunken deeper into his drug-createdpsychosis (\\"Now there's a look in your eyes/Like black holes in the sky\\"), and all members of The Floydhurt because of their fallen friend.Waters dedicated Wish You Were Here to Syd. All of the songs and music was a personal tribute to the Madcap; this set was Waters's own want to tell Barrett's story, and every note of this great session (like DarkSide of the Moon before it) drew a grave, yet proper and provocative, portrait of the man whose entire bodyof work was the main blueprint for acid and space rockers everywhere.This set was Waters's answer to \\"Oh, by the way,/ which one's pink?\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish You Were Here","review":"Wish You Were Here being Pink Floyd's 1975 and their follow up to the epic release Dark Side of the Moon is like the prior album a magnificent album. The booklet is really strange with many artsy photos. All the lyrics are included but no listing of whom plays what which is a shame. The sound is a mix between, Bowie and Kraftwerk and being that I like both of these artists it was natural for me to also like this. 4/5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish granted","review":"Cut-for-cut, this is probably the best album Pink Floyd ever released: passionate, pained, straightforward, and even powerful in a way that doesn't require the listener to be hyped up and out of their mind on LSD. The merits of \\"Shine on You Crazy Diamond\\" might be debatable (less so the second half), but there's no debating the power of the rolling satire \\"Have a Cigar\\" or the even poignant \\"Wish You Were Here.\\" The effects-heavy \\"Welcome to the Machine\\" even hits the spot. It's ironic that the band members have said that they weren't really \\"here\\" during the recording sessions, because they've never sounded more \\"here\\" on any other album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well rounded, excellent album","review":"Wish You Were Here is not Pink Floyd's best work by any means. With that said, it is still in my top ten rock albums of all time. Overall, the quality of the record is increadible. The twenty five minuet \\"shine on you Crazy Diamond\\" takes you on a journey through soundscape after soundscape, inviting you on a voyage into the regrets and hardships related to the loss of original band leader Syd Barret. The only weak link in the chain may well be \\"Welcome to the Machine\\", a good song, but by no means up to par. \\"Wish You Were Here\\" is quite possibly the greatest song ever recorded, and not for its musical content. It has this strange habit of being associated with people/ places that you miss dearly, and often triggers a flood of memories from times well spent. Buy the Wall or Darkside first, but add this to your collection shortly after."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawed re-ssue?","review":"What a beautiful album it is but in \\"Crazy Diamond Part IX\\" at about 11 minutes 30 seconds there is some distortion and it's not synth."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very brave album","review":"Personally, I think following up the success of \\"Darkside of the Moon\\" with an album of 13 minute songs was a risky move, and i guess it worked considering that this is now thought of as one of Pink Floyd's classics. The album starts with part 1 of \\"Shine on You Crazy Diamond\\" This is one of those lengthy, dramatic songs that Pink Floyd's good at doing. From it's classic 4-note intro to it's blues jam to it's haunting lyrics, it's awesome. \\"Welcome to the Machine\\" is a song that truly innovated the synthesizer. The noises on this album are still ahead of our time thirty years later. \\"Have a Cigar\\" is a great one, with great keybording hormonies. \\"Wish You Were Here\\" is the gem of this album. It has so much emotion in the vocals and guitar, that no one could resist this. on top of having a classic intro. The second part of \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\" is all about the psychedelic soul organ jam. This is the only difference between part one. The album rocks, frankly."},{"rating":"2","title":"beatiful,fantastic,superb","review":"wish you were here was one of the greatest albums from pink floyd along with the wall and the dark side of the moon.songs like wish you were here and shine on you crazy diamond have made this cd an immortal classic which should be there in your cd collection.highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"pink floyd at their absolute best","review":"\\"wish you were here\\", along with \\"dark side of the moon\\", represents pink floyd at their absolute best. every note on \\"wish you were here\\" is perfect -- and all the players, especially guitarist david gilmour, are playing at their finest.this is a concept album on the grandest of scales, with two of the five tracks exceeding ten minutes in length. the first, and best song, \\"shine on you crazy diamond (part one)\\", is also the longest, and is an extended blues jam with a few verses of lyrics at the end. this song is, quite simply, one of the greatest songs in rock history. its entire atmosphere is incredible in its emotive power. the other four songs are nearly as great; pink floyd's sound, combined with their great songwriting and playing, makes \\"wish you were here\\" one of the greatest rock statements ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Pink Floyd","review":"This is a classic Pink Floyd album. True to Floyd's style, there are a lot of tranquil guitar riffs and floating melodies. And there are some good lyrics, too. Sure, it's not as big as the Wall or Dark Side of the Moon, but the music on this album can definitely hold its own in the Pink Floyd catalog.The best-known track on this album is the title track, Wish You Were Here. This is one of those classic rock songs that will forever be getting stuck in your head. It is perhaps the only single on the album. The rest of the tracks fit together nicely to make this an all-around great classic rock experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pink Floyd's 2nd Masterpiece Album","review":"This album contains some of the best music ever made, hands down. You have \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\" probably the best song ever written of any genre of music or poetry, \\"Welcome To The Machine\\", one of the scariest Big-Brother referenced tunes ever made, \\"Have A Cigar\\", the closest Floyd could get to disco, and \\"Wish You Were Here\\", not just an ode to their lost Gigolo Aunt Genius, Syd Barrett, but to all the people doing their thing in the 60's, where are they now (1975, that is), what have they been doing since the dream was over? It makes you think how much Syd was not just an influence on his band and friends, but to all the hippies, beatniks, and psychedelic everywhere. And what also is far-out is that Syd showed up while the group was finishing up \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of Floyd","review":"This is Floyd at it's best. The guitar work on \\"Shine on You Crazy Diamond\\" is beautiful,the lyrics are great, and if you don't like this CD then go and listen to your Backstreet Boys crap because this is great music,none of that **** that dominates the radio today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated","review":"You may not want to buy this album because it only has 5 songs, but you must realize that tracks 1 and 5 are about 13 minutes apiece, and the album itself is nearly 45 minutes long. I have yet to see someone who hates this album. You haven't lived until you have heard Rick Wright's solo in the middle and at the end of WELCOME TO THE MACHINE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing.....","review":"Dark Side of the Moon is indeed an amazing Pink Floyd album but I connected more with the lyrics of Wish You Were Here. This album starts off with one of my favorite Floyd songs, 'Shine On You Crazy Diamond' and inspiring song that is tributed to the genius, Syd Barrett. The one song i felt was Roger Waters best song ever written is 'Wish You Were Here'. Sometimes even I feel like a fish in a fishbowl with no direction at all. My two cents, buy it, you'll thank me."},{"rating":"2","title":"50000000000 Stars To This Album!","review":"What can I say that hasn't been said before-- the peerless Pink Floyd reach unparallelled musical heights in this album, which I happen to be listening to at this moment.

Will you really listen to this that much? Spend your money on a watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"This album is awesome. The music runs the gamut from slow, jazzy rock on parts of \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\" to an energetic, fast-paced \\"Have a Cigar\\" to jarring and discordant sounds on \\"Welcome to the Machine\\" (don't take that to mean \\"Welcome\\" is not an enjoyable listen - it definitely is). And then of course there is \\"Wish You Were Here,\\" a song to which I would not do justice if I tried to describe it. There is not a false note on this album, and it's lyrically strong to boot (\\"by the way, which one's Pink?\\"; \\"would you exchange a walk-on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?\\"). Wish You Were Here is a cut above almost everything else out there. Highly, highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING!!!!!!!!!","review":"I bought this cd 6 months ago at a used record store. When I brought it home and listened to it for the first time,I was truly puzzled as I still am today as to why anyone would give this cd up. I'm 14 years old and proof that this cd appeals to young people just as much as it does to those who got to experience Floyd back in the 70's. This album is so good, almost to the point that it makes everything else in comparison sound bad. So before you go out and spend 15 bucks on the worthless crap that's being produced today, why not instead spend it on a timeless classic made by possibly the greatest band of all time. I also reccomend Meddle and Animals. Darkside of the Moon and the Wall are pretty good as well. Hell if it says Pink Floyd on the cover just buy it, you can't go wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needs a sixth star","review":"This was the album that started it all for me -- my love of progressive rock, my love of Pink Floyd, my love of concept albums.

It still holds as much significance today as when it was first released."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the only 70's CDs I like","review":"I would like to start by saying I was not around for this time, and most of the stuff I listen to is 90's nu-metal, but this CD is just amazing...It's very different from most music today. I can see where bands like Tool get influence now, THIS band.My favorite songs are \\"Welcome to the Machine\\" and the classic \\"Wish You Were Here\\".The only other 70s CDs I like is this, Dark Side of the Moon, Animals, and Led Zeppelin IV. Get this today"},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly masterpiece","review":"I am writing this as I am listening to \\"wish you were here\\". This is truly a masterpiece.

Here is my thought of each song individually...1.'Shine On You Crazy Diamond (1-5)'- An Outstanding Opening Song To The Album. Starts Out Calm, And Continues At A Minimum Pace. Great Opening!2.'Welcome To The Machine'- A Great Mix Of Sound FX In This Song! Cool Sounding Vocals and Instrumentals! The Robotic Sounds Are Cool! Great Song!3.'Have A Cigar'- A Cool Up-Beat Song. Cool Vocals, and Keyboard FX. A Cool Mild-Speed Paced Song. Another Great Song!4.'Wish You Were Here'- A Nice and Calm Song. Performed Outstandingly! A Great Sub-End Song.5.'Shine On You Crazy Diamond (6-10)'- A Terrific Ending! Same As Shine On pts. 1-5.....Begins Calm, and builds up a little, but remains calm. A Very Cool Ending To The Album!IF YOU DO NOT OWN THIS ALBUM, ESPECAILY IF YOU ARE A PINK FLOYD FAN, GET IT AS SOON A POSSIBLE! YOU WILL NOT REGRET IT AT ALL!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great surround experience","review":"This SACD recording makes a classic even better and more of a dynamic listening experience.

I love absolutely every song. I didn't like Have a Cigar at first, but like a lot of floyd songs, if you listen to it twice, it becomes great.

Every time I listen to this album, I simply cannot grasp how it even EXISTS!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"This album is the best Pink Floyd album except for Dark Side of the Moon.What makes it so great is it's emotion. It's so, this may sound strange, moving. Wish You Were Here (the song) is so full of emotion and feeling it's unbelievable. There are no words to describe it.Many prefer this album since it has a warmer feeling to it. Not such a dark almost despairing feeling as the others, mainly because of the lyrics. Them, mixed with the hearty, warm guitar (accustic) makes this an album that still has to be reckoned with.Those who love the performance of Jerry Garcia and his guitar in The Grateful Dead, will love this masterpiece.Those who like Loggins and Messina's lyrics will also like this album.This is, in my opinion, the peak of Water's songwriting career. The words flow and dazzle like poetry.This album is highly recommended for everyone. Move over The Who, here comes Floyd."},{"rating":"2","title":"brilliant","review":"This is a must own for anyone that likes the surround format for music.a) this is a sensational album.Shine on is a brilliant soundscape. Welcome to the machine is a brilliant cynical observation. Have a cigar is one of the best songs about the music industry ever put together.

This CD, 45 minutes long with only 5 tracks, is packed with absolutely amazing and awe-inspiring music. \\"Shine on You Crazy Diamond\\" is 25 minutes long, and divided into 2 parts. It is mostly instrumental, and the music is so good you'll forget you're listening to it. \\"Welcome to the Machine\\" dazzles you with amazing sound affects, and the other two tracks bring out sentimental feelings you never knew you had. It's brilliant. That's all there is to say. Absolutely brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Absolute Must!","review":"Sure everybody has \\"The Wall\\" and \\"Dark Side\\" and to most people this is all the Pink Floyd that they know. This is quite possibly the most musically diverse album in Pink Floyd's repertoire. the guitar work is absolutely soaring, and is not bogged down by Waters' moody lyrics. David Gilmour absolutely wails throughout the guitar parts on \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\".\\"Wish You Were Here\\" is quite possibly the best single track from ANY album.Sure, most of the album is an an instrumental, but it is some of the best music ever presented by Pink Floyd. and I own them all.If you are interested in Floyd and have not looked at this album, check it out. It is well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good!","review":"This is a must have for all the pink floyd fans. This is the best CD i have ever heard, my fav one is , have a cigar.

The album begins and ends with the two part \\"Shine On You Crazy Diamond\\" a tribute to original band leader and acid casualty Syd Barret. In between are several tracks that reflect the evils of the music industry. This is another very strong disc that pretty much every progressive rock fan already owns.

Its easier to play this with 2 players then 1.Loc and Tak both have different powers, and you need them both to get through the game.And the end demo derby is difficult...but its a really great game.

While Jesus spoke more about spirit and the Kingdom of God than anything else, traditional Christianity hardly addresses them. We have little chance of understanding Jesus without looking at these phenomena. I do tend to differ with Davies when he states that Jesus was not a teacher. I see no reason why he couldn't teach both verbally and experientially. I would recommend this book to any serious student of the real Jesus, and I am disappointed it is not more widely available. The Parables of Jesus by Richard Q. Ford is a good companion to this book.

For a while it worked like it was supposed to. Then one day it just dropped off the door. I found that I could put it back by compressing the sides a little to put the screw brackets under the screw heads again. I tried tightening the screws but the metal bars and the screw heads are flush; they won't go any further. I stripped a screw trying to get it to go in further. Unfortunately the screws won't hold the rack on if I put more than 3 full rolls of any kind of wrapping in there. It's too short to put more than 3 regular-sized rolls in. I use it for one regular roll of wrapping, one small one and one box of sandwich bags. Inevitably someone will bump it though and everything falls out. I wouldn't suggest this item. If they made the screw brackets into screw holes instead this would work better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too small!","review":"Easy to assemble with good hardware but overall it was to small.

Also, the controls are just plain stupid, I would have NEVER been able to figure out how to use them if I didn't watch the tutorial. I honestly HATE the controls.

It is more about straining your eyes to see little tiny fences then designing a zoo, let alone interacting with the animals.... It utilizes none of the potential that the DS has as a platform. It is hard to control, and very easily boring. I am normally very tolerant of bad graphics, but this game is beyond bad. You can see the pixels, and even the colors scheme is annoying.

To me it was easier to understand and the controls are really good, I just couldn't get into the PC game. The biggest problem is the no saving more than one game at a time.Even tho this is a fun game the reason I gave it two stars overall is because I can never finish a game. I get the highest rating for my zoo, I have plenty of money, I have no more than 7 or 8 exhibits, and then it won't let me buy anymore, not even a trashcan. This is extremely frustrating. This happens every time I start a new game. I have friends who own this game and they don't have this particulat problem, but they have other glitches.

The novel is a subtle study in human character and Short expertly details each of the novel's characters with a deep understanding of the human psyche that makes an ordinary range war tale more interesting than it should be. The common threads of human behavior are on display, the noble and the ignoble, as the story unfolds towards its inevitable denouement. The honesty and dedication of a cowhand in standing up to a murderous bully and his thugs is the theme here but the rich characterizations of the players herein make this fine work one of the best westerns ever written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't read this... Unless you have the time to read it all!","review":"What Rick Furmanek has done with this manuscript is simply majestic. You are there in the Russian flat, you are driving along with Andrei, smelling, hearing, feeling. Rick has a gift for making you an observer through this part of his life and times in Russia, not just a reader of yet another book. This is a wonderful journey into a land hidden in mystery and media cover-up's. This story (I am reluctant to call this just a \\"book\\"), not only shows you the human condition most prevalent in daily life, but the dangers of life in this turbulent country as it evolves from the long embedded communist ideals to the beginnings of democracy. Stranded in Moscow is a MUST read. However, beware, you will not want to stop reading once you have started! 10+!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Compelling Read...","review":"This book jumps right in - Rick Furmanek really knows how to hook a reader and keep them hooked. This book is facinating because it shows you what's beneath the headlines, and gives you a perspective on life in post-communist Russia that only a resident could give. Rick's style and flair for descriptive writing will keep you enthralled for hours, and I am eagerly awaiting his second book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Great Pretender","review":"I really wanted to hear what Mr. Furmanek wanted to say, given his televised interviews all over Russian TV. due to his Brother in Law's death. Unfortunately, I came away extreemely disappointed. I have been in and out of Moscow over 50 times on all different kinds of business deals involving all kinds of people throughout all of the 90's. I feel therefore, fairly qualified to say that Mr. Furmanek is an amatuer of the least qualified regarding Moscow people or anything about life at all in Moscow. Sure, his old school mates may have a few positive things to say, but I will bet that even they, after being in Moscow for less than 3 days, will know as much as Mr. Furmanek. One of his prized photos are taken from a tour bus for crying out loud! In short: Bad book, amatuer and inaccurate feeling of Moscow, simple writing... hot topic.

Burners including the piping and valves all are suppored by two very small screws under the center of the burners. The leverage of the control valves against these screws is huge. The gauge of the bar this all is attached to is much less than it should be so as a result everything in the burner assembly is wobbly. The screws that release the air control disk so that you can adjust the flame mixture cannot be accessed without dismantling part of the supply pipe since the fitting is tight against the lower screw. To really make it funtional I will have to re-pipe the supply and add some support to hold the weight of the control valves and burners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as Good as Two Singles","review":"I had the single-burner version, and I bought this to cook bigger stuff.

It only list a very very few specification for a few models and gives hardly any detail on options that were available through the years. The same could be said for any reviews on the cars. The XJ12 info was especialy lacking, and this happens to be a model of particular intrest to me. There was no mention of problem areas for this model, such as where they rust, what common mechanical problems they have ect. The last two books I have bought in this series were disappointments.

In another cliched scene, a hooker arrives at Mahowny's room wearing nothing but a fur coat.The cliches mount and all interest in the psychology of Mahowny and his downward spiral disappear.Save yourself the money and buy \\"Stung\\" the book that this disaster was based upon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be Afraid of What Owns You","review":"This little film leaves behind a huge impact. It is a tale of addiction and failure that will make you think.The ever interesting Philip Seymour Hoffman plays a stuffy bank loan manager who succumbs to the addiction of gambling. He spends weekends in casinos, hides his problem from co-workers and his girlfriend and suffers at the hands of his own actions. Hoffman is absolutely great in this role! Minnie Driver plays Hoffman's enabling and stupid girlfriend who believes in the lies more than what is before her eyes. Driver looses her savings and her life along with Hoffman in the spiral of gambling addiction and despair.This is one of those films that seems absolutely uninteresting but is deeply embedded with messages for us all. Gambling isn't the only addiction capable of destroying a beautiful and successful life so the mistakes seen in this film can certainly apply elsewhere.

Then I read the book, which had this and many other details that were totally let out of the movie. This was a poor production which skimmed only the surface of the true story, put too much emphasis on one night in the casino( when he lost $1 million the day he was finally arrested) and in the end, made him out almost like a martyr when he was in fact a person who stole $13 million of other people's money and destroyed the lives of others, including his mentor who for all the help he gave the culprit in advancing his career at the bank, ended up in the end being sent to far off other part of the country as \\"punishment\\". He eventually committed suicide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow is spots and probably won't hit home with people who have problems","review":"This movie was not made for common everyday people who have a gambling problem. It is not for those who have issues with slot machines, or simple cards games, or for people living paycheck to paycheck.

Dan Mahowny stole from the rich and gave to the bookie. I suppose we all can get soppy about a fat fuzz ball loser that can't stop gambling with his bank's money. The film is non-stop losing all day - all the time. No psychosis is more devastating than suicide by chance. The fellow gives it away in a perpetual state of orgiastic losses. He doesn't necessarily hurt the rich woman he is pilfering, but he does ruin his career and love life.I wouldn't get real excited about this film. There is no character, including Philip Seymour Hoffman you really care about. It's not a comedy and certainly no drama. We know what's going to happen."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is what SINGLES should be","review":"This is a great SINGLE to own. Here you have great songs like ZERO, MARQUIS IN SPADES, MOUTHS OF BABES, PENNIES and GOD.

So sure, I was a little bummed that the Zombies have no downloadable content on Amazon. I figure their label isn't keen on DRM free yet. So imagine my SHOCK to see that 'Time of the Season' in DRM-free form is availible from iTunes! You guys need to get on that! Don't let iTunes have some DRM free content that you don't have!I am no fan of AAC, even if it is DRM free now in some cases... so please, pretty please, get stuff like The Zombies available as a DRM free MP3!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Why is this the best Stretgy game I have ever played?","review":"Two reasons:1. I have been playing it for over 6 months almost every other day and I still love it - in 15 years I have never had a game that survived on my pc for that long2.

The second one just plain sucked. Sure it has good graphics and an easy to use interface, but the game would always crash both of my computers.

My computers are not old either, one is a 300p-2 160megs ram 17 inch monitor, voodoo3 etc. The other is a 450 amd k6-2 96 megs ram, Ati graphics, 15 inch monitor.

Give M$ their props on this one, it works better than their operating systems."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can I say?","review":"That already hasn't been said? Coming from Age of Empires I had certian expectations about the quality of gameplay and interaction. I have to be honest and say those were all shattered.Microsoft has definatley stepped up to the plate on this one, making the charecters and story lines more interesting and complex. This game takes the expectation of your typical rt strategy game and truns it into a RT Rpg Strategy.The AI on this thing is so enhanced you really don't want to be caught with your pants down, and the graphics, well, don't get me started on them. I must say, this is a great game, an awesome sequal to Age Of Empires I.MS has certianly raised the bar as to gameplay, graphics quality and style of real time strategy games. I can't wait untill the next version!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Game, but...","review":"This game is a true classic. I bought it when it came out and played it until the disc was accidentally thrown out. I recently bought it again for nostalgia's sake. Still the great game I remember.

The product shipped expeditiously and plays marvelously. I like the earlier version because it keeps you hoping since you have to do everything manually - like moving pieces on a chess board. My favorite is Random with two allies against two enemies. My toughest challenge is getting the Mongols to find a way to beat the Chinese. They did in the real world, but in my Empires world they keep being defeated. So the game is still a challenge to me: Never Give Up!

There's no end to the posibilities and different combinations you can use and play in AOK. I just can't wait until the expansion...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game","review":"The bottom line is that this is a great game. It has many improvements from the first one. First there is no longer a 50 person population limit. It is now 200 and is not that annoying. One of the only problems is that stone and gold runs out in a matter of minutes. Fortunitly there are trade routes. You build them at a market and they go and the gold appears out of no where. Not realistic but makes up for the lack of raw matteralis. You can buy and sell goods at the market. One of the only problems is that when you play anything but renicide people quit at the begaining of the game. This was ment to happen so you didn't have to hunt down every last peasent before claiming victory but is annyoning sence building a wonder will never win it for you. But over all it is a great game"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good For Real Time Addicts","review":"There\`s no denying that AOE 2 is a great game . I have spent many a sleepless night staying up playing it . One word of warning: Don\`t download any cheats from the internet !. I did this and it spoiled most of the challange of the game because I could award myself unlimited resources and arm myself with machine gun toting sports cars !As good as the game is I could only award it 4 stars because I prefer turn based strategy games like CALL TO POWER . I also found the terrains a bit too similar for my liking . But if play turn based strategy games you\`ll like AOE 2. If you play real time strategy games you will love AOE 2"},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems","review":"At first the game was great I had lots of fun.

As a reminder type \\"boldface\\" to access the code during the single-player game."},{"rating":"2","title":"BUY THIS GAME!","review":"My Dad bought this game because Starcraft was getting old, and when I started playing I was blown away! This game has so many factors that it takes strategy to win the levels. You have four reasouces: wood, food, gold, and stone, instead of other games in which you only have two resources. The graphics aren't great but they are pretty good for a top view game. When you are playing you have four ages (or stages) the Dark Age, the Fuedal Age, the Castle Age, and the Imperial Age. With an age change you get more warriors, buildings, and upgrades. Plus there is tons of civilizations with their own unique warriors and upgrades. Overall this is the best war game you can buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! A lot more than expected!","review":"I recently borrowed this game from my freind thinking it was going to be a boring warcraft/starcraft wannabe what I got was even better than I expected!

With no doubt!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Microsoft and Ensemble does it again...","review":"This game is bears a tremendous amount of fun. It's complicated, but only for newbies. Experienced players know that this game is about 90% strategy. I got bored with some games, but as I was looking through the CD rack I thought I'd give AOK a try. I hadn't played with it in a long time. I had more fun than I ever did with it and possibly any other PC game. The price may be high, but it is a must buy. One of my top 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"AoK: Better than ever.","review":"I have played both AoE and its expansion pack RoR. The first day that AoK came into stores I bought it. And let me tell you, I am very much happy to buy it the first day. If you are a lover of Real Time Strategy (RTS) games genre, this game is a must-buy. The advanced commands that are available for your military units make it much easier for you to mount a well-managed attack on your opponent. With 13 civs to choose from, you can never have enough of the game. Beware: Age of Kings is an addiction. Its hard to stay away from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Age Of Empires II","review":"Microsoft has really outdone themselves this time. I've been an Age Of Empires fanatic for a long time. When I heard AOE II, Age of Kings, was coming out, I had to get it. When I popped the CD and started a game I was overwhelmed. I took so much time analyzing the new and improved features I forgot I had opponents and was deimated in the first few minutes. But that's not the point. First off, they have male and female villagers now. Another great feature is the better balancing of the civs. Each has a unique unit that corresponds to that civ's history. I also love how each civilization talks in their language. And the multiplayer features are a breath of clean air. The Zone is a great place to play, and the modem connection is better than ever. Overall, this game is great, so if you're a RTS player, this game's for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great war game","review":"This is a wonderful game, you can choose who you are and which map you want to be on, there are different levels and campaigns in which you conquer people with Gendhis Khan and there is even a beginers campaign to learn how to play.

ROCKS!","review":"My name is Robert Davis and I got this game from a freindwho did'nt want it, so he gave it to me.

I like having allies when Iplay because it's fun to see Trade Carts going back and forthbetween your and your allies Markets. The instruction bookletis really detailed so if your in a jam just pause the gameand bring it out. The fighting is good because the good graphices( they don't just go up to each other and just standthere, you see them swinging their swords!)

It's definitely five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Prefect But Still the Best","review":"Well, this is the best game Microsoft has ever published! The battle system is near perfect but it still has that \\"The player with the most units wins\\" theme which is typical for most RTS games. There are four resources to worry about (wood, food, gold & stone), and that is pretty cool. Also, there are tons of units and sides to choose from. Graphics and sounds are superb even though voice actings are not perfect. Enemey and unit AI's are pretty good too (with great path-finding and collision-detection). The missions can be really tedious sometimes though. (Btw, you can enter \\"robin hood\\" at the chat menu if you don't have enough guts, heh heh). If you are an RTS fan and wouldn't mind a complex battle system, get AOE 2!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good game 4 1/2 stars","review":"aoe 2 is better than the original one, because you have more control over your army you can garrison units and there is an idle villiger button witch is really useful, not to mention the graphics are incredible, and what's neat is that each civilisation has an unique unit and advanteges in the game.the only bad thing is there should be more civilisations to chose from. I would recommend this game to anyone who enjoys real time strategy games."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't see the big deal","review":"This game has to be one of the most overrated ones in recent history. The graphics are simple, 2D, and not very detailed. The least Ensemble could have done is add visual effects, such as weather, to make the game realistic. The civilazations give you close to no variety except for one unique unit which doesn't make a big difference and some special abilities that don't make a difference either. There is also too much micromanaging that you must do to suceed which gets boring after about ten minutes. I played this game for about three days and stopped because it just got frustrating. With four different resoures the game can get very time-consuming and complicated. Add that to wimpy weapons and a lack of strategic elements and you have one pointless game that takes up a ton of unesscesary time. Go buy Tiberian Sun instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"All thumbs down!","review":"This game totally s****, when I bought it I thought It will be better.When I installed and started to play it, then I have found out thatthe buildings are so sick and big that you cant see your guys!

Dont buy this game, it is totally messed up you will only loose your money. Another thing is that its impossible to beat all the scenerios on even medium! Thats insane! This game is too complicated and hard, and you always dont have enough of food! Please people dont buy this game. I would rate this a big zero..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poor Sequel","review":"I bought this game because I really like the first one. This one doesn't compare.

I was really disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"actually about a 3 1/2","review":"I would give a four if it wasn't for some annoying things that happen in this game. After a while I realized that my army was blowing up MY army durring battle. When I tried to make the soilders hang back so they wouldn't get blasted they would run up again. I guess what I am saying is that whatever controls your armys when you are not is very idiotic. I don't know if people like it like this or not but I don't. Please don't get me wrong. I think this is a very fun game that is very addictive (it's 4:30 in the morning right now and I just finished playing). Anyway I would suggest that people buy this game because it really is interesting and fun AND challenging.Just be prepared to get a little frustrated but not too much because it isn't the worst thing that could happen and doesn't ruin the game, just makes it harder.My two cents."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Coolest game of history!","review":"Now, a LONG LONG LONG time ago, other countrys were either at peace-or war.

And you can always make your own levels with scenario builder, so the game only half dies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but takes too much time","review":"Indeed, this game is really STRATEGY. Or as close as the games got to it yet. I mean, take WarCraft II, for example. The strategy there is to build as many units as possible, and kill your enemy. Here in Age of Empires all different tactics are possible, and it's cool! The bad part is that one game takes too long. On average, a WarCraft game takes no more than 60-90 mins.

Fight alongside of Joan of Arc and Gengis Khan and others. The graphics are astounding. I gave it a four because of its slow loading time to start the game. Everything else is perfect.

The ways you can play the game are in a form that even if you've played the scenario before there will always be a thing to surprise you. In this game the most intensifying games are when everything starts out simple and then slowly comes up to the point where you and your enemy have destroyed each other. I have a game right now, where I'm the Mongols and my forces are right on the Chinese borders. You can chose from any of 5 campaigns. For beginners, there are the William Wallace campaigns and then things get tricky. The Joan of Arc campaigns come next. You can also play in normal games: Death Match, Regicide and Random Map. You can learn a lot of history and have fun at the same time with this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful game!!!","review":"this is the best game i've ever played. i think the single player is good and the multiplayer is excellent. if u are a strategy game lover, i recommend this product to you here are the ups and downs of the game ups-extremely addictive,very good features, many kinds of choices, the campaign is wonderful down-when you have many units the game is very slow"},{"rating":"2","title":"Age of Empires 2: Age of Kings By Microsoft","review":"A Great game well worth every penny spent on it.

My favorite part is the campaigns- you are William Wallace, Joan of Arc, Saladin, Frederick Barbarossa, or Ghengis Khan and you play a series of scenarios based on their real life exploits (for example, in the first Joan of Arc scenario you must escort her to Chinon without her being killed by the British or the Burgundians). Another great feature is the gate, which you can build into a wall. The gate automatically opens for you and your allies, but enemies must knock it down with their battering rams."},{"rating":"2","title":"Age of Empires 2 Review","review":"I thought that Age of Empires was an extremely good game. I would have liked to name it a 4 1/2 star rating but the computer didn't have it.I like it because it has so many civilizations that you can play with. My favorite is the Chinese. It also has campaigns that you can do that have many famous people. There is also a map editor that allows you to make certain maps that you can play on. There are three ways to play the first is a regicide which you want to catch the king. The next is a death match which is when you have to destroy everbody and everything. The last one is campaigns which is when you have to do what the computer says. THe one bad thing about the game is that it may take a little time to understand everything. You can't just sit down a play easliy. I would suggest using the handbook. Overall, I would have liked to give it a 4 1/2 but the computer didn't have it. I also thought that it was a really good game and is definetly worth its money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wowzers","review":"This game is so much better then AoE.

There are only a couple problems; on my 333mgz, 32ram it gets pretty slow after you get to around 70 units. Also it can get sort of boring if you play it a lot. All in all, this game was worth its money. I suggeset that you buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Hesitate!

I played Age of Mythology in a store once, but I still like this one better. Granted, there are some annoying aspects to Kings, such as replanting farms one at a time. Also, if you use a group of villagers to do a task, you have click each one at a time to spread them out. The Conquerors expansion corrects all this (see my review). You can get both Kings and Conqs in the Gold Edition. The games are old enough that they should work on just about every computer. For parents, the blood and gore is so miniscule it's nothing to worry about. This is an easy game to learn, and a fun one to play. Check it out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AI at it's best","review":"This is a much better upgrade and a very robust game. For all the players who might have enjoyed AOE's later concepts this is going to be an another great boon for them.

As a whole this is a terrific game with some purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 2nd favorite RTS Game","review":"When i first played Age of empires i knew the 2nd one would be a hell of alot better than the first. It was so much better. The resolution was better, the castle age and imperial age are an excellent add on.(The dark age and fudel are just like the ones in age of empires 1.) The new weapons, buildings, castles are my favorite. This game has no end to the limits. Multiplayer is so much fun except when there is lag. This game deserves to be honored with 4 stars because of its authentic gameplay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Strategy Game","review":"It's a LOT like the first game, which was great. But I would have preferred if we had been given more technologies to research. All the discovery seems to be over a bit too quick before each game boils down to the standard 'smash the enemy to pieces' part. In this respect it game become quite repetitive, especially when you consider how long it takes to get a good game going. The only alternative is to try out different civilisations. And only then it's just the architecture that's different.I do like this game a lot but I just wish for a bit more diversity and more surprises in the next one (as in Age of Empires 3, not Age of Mythology). I've not played the expansion pack yet but if it gives us more to work with then I'll definitely check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"My own empire, really","review":"This game let's you make your own civilization where you control them and what they do.

Given today's advances in diabetic treatment much of the information is sadly out of date.If you want to read a book about the old days of diabetic treatment or a book written by a compassionate mother, then go ahead. I personally find it difficult to relate to the expriences of a Hollywood actress from over a decade ago.If you want to know about today's treatment alternatives and how to deal with Type 1 diabetes in today's world, find a book with a more recent publication date, written by someone with the proper medical credentials.

The singer can't sing. The drummer is ok. Guitar riffs are so-so. The lyrics aren't very good either. There false stop is overused. Happens in every song from what I remember. I only listened to this once or twice. I Only Want You is the only good song on this cd. I felt that on most of this album the band was going for catchy driving riffs but since they aren't very good, I heard gargled guitars with the same drum beat. Avoid this please.

The Eagles ratchet up Jaggeresque lyrical machismo/decadence to an even funnier level than Mick himself does while staggering thru a noisy barroom blues practice session. Sure, there's not much \\"talent\\" going on here, but it is loads of fun, and I have always thought that was what counts. I don't think I'd be a rock fan otherwise, would I?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Glam Dancing Rock","review":"While Queens of the Stone Age are going the way of the over-praised rock bands before them (meaning they get more popular as they grow less interesting), Josh Homme drops this joyous side-project. Eagles of Death Metal features Homme in the Dave Grohl role as drummer, vocals and guitars by Jesse Hughes, and more guitars by Timmy VanHamel. Peace Love Death Metal couldn't be more fun - fifteen slabs of boogie metal, including a kicking cover of \\"Stuck in the Middle with You\\" that they've renamed \\"Stuck in the Metal\\". \\"San Berdoo Sunburn\\" takes T-Rex to the desert. \\"Speaking in Tongues\\" introduces Elvis to the Donnas. Elsewhere, the spirit of \\"Spirit in the Sky\\" takes over - it's glam dancing rock for sun damaged meth heads everywhere (metaphorically speaking)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid album overall, easy on the ears","review":"Far more pop oriented than anything else Josh Homme has been involved in. I'd like to mention that this really isn't his side project; it's the project of a friend of his and he was invited as the band's drummer. Overall, worth a listen and may well strike a chord with you. I will admit, though, that lyrics like \\"Miss Alissa..Gonna do a voodoo dance...Can you feel my power now?\\" are a tad hokey... But you'll start to feel that, if anything, Peace Love Death Metal is too short in the sense that you'd like some more to listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock N ' Roll Done Right","review":"Carlo and Jesse sure know what they are doing. The Eagles of Death Metal will rip off your face then sweet talk it and put it back on again. Only true fans rock need apply because anyone else will just not understand. You should have seen the look on the stooges face at the large corporate product displacement warehouse where I bought this fine album when I asked if the new Eagles of Death Metal CD had arrived. Trust me when I say it was priceless because the idiot had no clue what he is missing out on. Cool, ripping blues/boogie monster rock here kids. No bull mess and chicken poop fake pseudo crude rock like what all the masses of hind ends buy these days. Yeah you could call the Eagles of Death Metal a cult rock band but who is counting. So please support these two rocket scientists that call themselves the Eagles of Death Metal and maybe they will grace us with a second album of boot stomping mayhem."},{"rating":"2","title":"straight up rock n roll!","review":"Yet another side project by Queens of the Stone Age's Josh Homme. This time he takes the drum seat for this great album.The Eagles of Death Metal, are not claiming to \\"reinvent the wheel\\" of rock n roll, it is just a straight up danceable, fun, fast and energetic blend of distorted guitar and drums.It is a lot more digestable and a lot easier to get into than any of previous QOTSA or Kyuss albums. You will like this record from the first opening riff. Great rock for partying.Cheers"},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive, uninspired, sleep-inducing","review":"Having bought this album on the basis of amazon.com reviews, I have to disagree with all the four-star givers out there. I'm a big fan of Rock, blues and country sounds among others inc. QOTSA but this album is POOR. For a start the songs are boring and uninspired. Jesse Hughes is no Josh Homme in the guitar, vocal or song writing stakes. The same effects are used on most of the tracks and the guitar sounds plastic and flakey. Also, Josh Homme is no Dave Grohl when it comes to hitting a drum kit, the beats are pretty lame. The recording is rushed and unlike certain great albums (like Beck's Mutations) which benefit from this approach, this album sounds like it came from somebody's parents garage.

The title has nothing to do with it ladies and gentleman, I wouldn't go out and buy this album simply because it has your favorite genre in the title. Eagles of Death Metal are in a sense goofy garage rock with rather minimalist chords and funky beats.

This probably should have just been an EP with a few of the better songs. When you hear one of the songs on a radio station it sounds pretty good because there is contrast.

Maybe because in production they take out a lot of the crowd noise. Not so here. It's all crowd all the time...a 13 year old crowd. Screaming. Constantly. The most annoying instance of this?

Just irritating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy Room for Squares instead","review":"Save your money & buy Room For Squares instead. I love John Mayer's music. This CD is much of the same music on Room For Squares, without being \\"all John\\".

This CD is a disapppointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bargain at Twice the Price","review":"I bought the Any Given Thursday DVD and fell so in love with the live versions of old favorites and previously unreleased songs that I had to get the CD too.

It's the next best thing to being there."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Up Close and LIVE","review":"For all of you who are Mayer enthusiasts this album is a must have. Filmed at the end of a long tour season, it sounds great. If you ever wondered what seeing John in person would be like, then definitely get this. His tunes are not sickeningly remixed like studio work...this is the real thing. I saw John live and this album brings it all back like it was happening all over again. \\"Covered in Rain\\" (which is only availabe on this and his other live album from 2004 \\"Is As Is\\") is undoubtedly wistful and wonderful showing some of Mayer's great guitar playing. So if you like his other work or are a fan of great live music this is worth every dime."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Surprise","review":"I had not heard of him until \\"Daughters.\\" A friend (who was my very own version of John's song \\"St. Patrick's Day\\") turned me on to his music by telling me about \\"Your Body is a Wonderland.\\" I caught John's performance on the PBS show \\"Austin City Limits.\\" I was blown away. I ordered \\"Room for Squares\\" then \\"Any Given Thursday.\\" I've been a fan ever since. This cd is very good. I like it a lot and it will be in my cd player and DVD player too. Check it out if you haven't. Good choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth checking out...","review":"If you haven't seen John live before or just know his \\"hit,\\" album, you will be very surprised, and in my case, completely blown away.

I should add that I'm probably not in the \\"prime,\\" demographic that Sony is marketing John to. (I'm 30.) Everyone my around my age who's heard him loves him.I have to make one complaint about the DVD. The 5.1 mix has some problems. The engineering itself sounds like it was great at some point, but it sounds like the bit rate of the Dolby Digital stream is low. (It sounds like a bad MP3.) There were a few points that the right channel distorted.

It is much of the same music as heard on Room for Sqaures, except it has the typical concert components---times the crowd sings the passges, etc. (Great if there in person; annoying when listening to a CD) If you are just trying John Mayer for the 1st time, buy Room for Squares instead-- it is a 5 star CD!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fine if you like bootlegs","review":"Okay, I'm disappointed. Very disappointed. This sounds like it was recorded off the mains. As far as I can tell, there was no post-production, no mix, just a couple mic's stuck hanging from the rafters (at least it's in stereo). The vocals are buried, there's something banging along in the background which sounds like a drum set. Can't really hear a bass at all. Every once in a while John's guitar gets punched a little to make it out of the muddle, but all in all, it's a .. recording effort. Buy everything else by John Mayer, but unless you prefer the bootleg sound, not this one.

The best part about buying this is the dvd. I find it funny to watch all the faces John makes when he sings. He looks like he's going to hurl. Some great great comedy. Unintentional comedy at it's best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought this CD for the songs No Such Thing and Your Body is a Wonderland.

They were better as recorded. I was really disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this CD!","review":"This CD is the worst thing you will ever hear.

His voice sounds constipated and it drove me insane. i would seriously rather listen to math lectures than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Full of himself","review":"I thought that John Mayer was a fairly decent guitar player, and bought his first album - against the recommendation of several reviews. I then heard him in a radio studio, playing and being interviewed. While the DJs poured on the compliments of his guitar playing, he showed no humility at all. For example - when they said that he was one of the BEST guitar players of all time, his response was \\"thanks, but not yet\\". Anyway, he needs to struggle a little more before he will be able to convince me with some real feeling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emotionally and stimulating for your senses.","review":"I loved my new cd. It is fabulous. There is a song for all moods. Every track I listen too brings the Nikita episode into mind. It totally blew me away.

This is something every Nikita fan should own."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSURD","review":"I really enjoy the CD. In fact I have marked all my video recordings with Title and Music in it.

Just so I am able to listen to their music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating and Spell-binding","review":"I love the show, and I love this CD. Yes, as others have said, more music should have been included. I think we all would have bought a two cd set despite a higher price. I would have liked \\"Crush\\" by Garbage to be included.

I hope they come out with a second cd, but this one is a definite MUST buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loving It!","review":"Even though sometimes I like the show more than others, I always like the music that they play. I brought this CD immediately after it was released and I was not disappointed. I really like the song by Morcheeba \\"Fear and Love\\". I would recommand any of their two albums, which I purchased and listen to regularly. I also loved the song by Beverly Klass, \\"Temple\\" (Unfortuantely her album is no longer being produced.) And I must not forget to mention Depeche Mode with \\"Love Thieves.\\" Listening to it, I can just feel Michael's pain when he thought there was a possibility that Nikita didn't make it out alive(Ep #122 \\"Mercy\\"). The reason I gave the CD a four was because of the fact that they excluded a number of great songs like Sarah Mclachlan \\"Do what you have to do\\" and Rhea Obsession \\"Cun Lacoudhir.\\" However, the music on the CD is great and I advise anyone who loves alternative music and the show to buy it. It will definately be worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I like this CD","review":"Being a huge fan of La Femme Nikita, I, of course, had to get the cd. While my taste in music normally runs toward hard rock and metal, I really like this music. It has a nice techno feel to it, with a little alternative thrown in for good measure. I especially like \\"Beyond the Invisible\\" by Enigma and Depeche Mode's \\"Love Thieves\\", and Curve reminds me a lot of Garbage. While I think this is a great cd, it has one glaring omission: Filter's \\"Nice Shot\\". Maybe the producers weren't able to get clearance on the song, but it should have been put on the cd. Maybe if there's a second release, it'll be there. You don't have to be a fan of LFN to like this cd, so go out and get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall Mood of LFN Captured Beautifully on CD","review":"This cd is wonderful. There's a great mix of music on it, a nice balance of techno, rock, and slow ballads. In fact, I'm listening to my LFN soundtrack as I type this. When I got my new rockin' Aiwa stereo, complete with two smaller speakers and a subwoofer, the first thing I did was put in my LFN cd and it was awesome. My floor was quaking. You can listen to this music any time and it'll fit your mood. I highly recommend it to anyone, fan of the show or not.

Because the plastic on the charging plug (where it plugs into the iPod) is too wide!Now, you may think \\"Well, that's the fault of the case.\\" I don't think so, because all my other charger cords fit, and I suspect that Marware considered this type of issue. The recess on the case is just right for standard chargers.I suspect that the makers of this charger did not follow the specs.I was able to kludge this to fit by cutting off the sides of the plug.But if you have any type of permanent case on your device, buy a different charging cord."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"Good thing I ordered two of these cables - on the first day of use, one of the ends on one of the cables broke, rendering it useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"This lasted about a month.

Disappointed, as I read the reviews from others complaining about the same thing. Well, I am not going to return them as that will probably cost more to do so than to keep them.

Basically, a snippet of plot description from \\"The Sopranos\\" is used as a lead-in to each chapter, which then heads into dry sociological analysis.Why is it I have the suspicion that this book originally lacked any mention of the Sopranos, but then received the snippets, the title, and the heavy promotion to get some portion of the Soprano fan market? I guess it worked, I bought it without taking too much of a look at it.It isn't even very good sociology. It makes all sorts of claims and statements without citing statistics or having footnotes.Not really worth it. Browse it in the bookstore and decide for yourself, but there really isn't much here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tony Soprano Would Take Action","review":"This is an awful book. It purports to be some kind of sociological analysis of the cultural forces shaping the Sopranos.It is, instead, a slanted political diatribe, essentially blaming all our ills on a loss of collective social sensibility and retreat from political liberalism.That's rank B.S. I consider myself a liberal (believe it or not) but do not blame the forces of social disintegration solely on a recent shift in our political winds.I don't know that I even agree with one of the author's key assumptions: that we care less about one another now. Some communities and neighborhoods are more tightly knit together than ever before. We move steadily toward a more orderly, efficient and respectful society, despite our mistaken retreat from social liberalism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I have ever read","review":"This book represents a new low in social and political commentary.Disguised as an analysis of the Soprano's success and how that reflects on American Society is a complete farce. The irony is that the author is pushing his Western European Socialist agenda using the guise of one of the more sucessful and profitable American TV shows of the past decade.Would anyone buy this book without the Soprano's hook?It's not even well written. The Soprano's themes don't even fit into the commentary that follows in each chapter.

Mostly the book is sensory rather than descriptive in that the author creates an emotional state for the reader rather than conveys information. For example, I understood the interior world of the main character, but I had a hard time picturing her surroundings. It's also challenging because the \\"story\\" is not linear or very satisfying in the end. I imagine The Drowning Room would be better in one sitting, rather than over a few months like I read it.

The first thing that I noted is that it's as easy to set up as my old system. The most obvious sound difference is in the subwoofer. There is solid deep bass without the flabby boom of lesser subwoofers, such as in my ACS340. These will also get loud without sounding strained. The mids are less forward and more natural. The highs are present without sounding artificial. Now don't get me wrong. These are not as good as Polk Audio LS series speakers, but for a budget computer system these are awesome. I don't know about the newer Soundstick IIIs with their clear acrylic led lit frames, but these rock my world. Any upgrading will be years from now for me.

The only down side (which is why i rated it at 4 stars) is the condition it was in when it arrived. The paper roll looked as if it was rolled by hand, i mean it is not bad looking, but the sides were not flush. Normally when a machine rolls paper, or at least cuts it, the sides are flush. When packed in the shipping container, the roll of paper must have jostled back and forth a bit compressing and wrinkling the very ends of the roll. The rest of the roll is fine.

Shipping was fast, I think it took 3 days or so to get to me. All items came in the box as indicated. The fryer worked excellent. It took me about 45 min to fry a 12-15 pound turkey. The only bad thing I can say about this is that the design is such that a small breeze will cause you to loose a lot of heat creating a longer cook time. I fixed this by using two pieces of plywood to create a wind break. However, I would not call this a deal stopper by any means. I paid $81 for this kit and saw it in one of the warehouse clubs (BJ's) for $99. Overall, I would highly recommend this fryer. Why I didn't give it 5 stars? This fryer did not exceed my expectations. It did what it was supposed to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Kit","review":"I received this fryer in August as a birthday gift and I am very glad that I did. The kit comes with everything you need to get started, minus the propane tank and oil. Assembly was a breeze and only took around 10 minutes at the most (I assembled it while relaxing in the garage).As some reviewers have stated after the first couple uses some of the paint for the stand was burned off resulting in it no longer appearing new. I can see how this would bother some users but for me it did not detract from the quality of the product. I am more of a function over appearance kind of person and the paint burning off did nothing to take away from the function of the stand.I see the price has gone up (it was $80 when I got it) maybe since it's closer to Thanksgiving, but even at the higher price I think it is worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bayow Turkey Fryer","review":"We were most happy with the way Amazon replaced the first one we ordered because of damage in shipping.

Lucky I didn't get killed.Under no circumstance should a pan with any chance of melting be sold at any time, especially when it's an item like this!! What the hell is wrong with these guys? So now as I descend into customer service Hell, I want forwarn anyone who is thinking of buying this flamethrower to think twice before you spend your hard earned cash on this Chinese piece of crap.Amazon's return policy and customer service makes it next to imppossible to return an item such as this,so I'm afraid I will likely be stuck with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow to heat","review":"Instructions state that pre-heat will take 15-25 minutes. After 90 minutes the oil only reached 300F. I could not delay Thanksgiving dinner any longer...put the turkey in...temperature dropped to 250F and never got much hotter. The burner was on full blast the whole time. We needed to cook about 20 minutes longer. It did taste fine once it was done. I am thinking I have a faulty regulator."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken Thermometer","review":"Got the product, did not have problems with the bolts as others seem to have had. But I went to BOIL WATER in it and I used the thermometer to know when we'd reached the boiling point without having to continually lift the lid. Thermometer went to 150 and never moved, even after the water was over boiling. It is unconscionable that they should ship a product like a turkey fryer with a defective thermometer. I am EXTREMELY lucky that my first use of the fryer was to boil water and not to fry with oil. Someone could have gotten VERY hurt. Would recommend buying a new thermometer or at least definitely test your thermometer before using it for frying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bayou Classic","review":"This fryer does it great! The hardest part is trying to figure out how everything goes back into the box. The burner did a great job of heating the pot for frying a turkey. The paint on the burner will burn off within the first 10 or 15 minutes of starting it. I recommend doing this prior to actually cooking anything on top of the grill. I cleaned the aluminum pot after draining the oil when it was still slightly warm. It cleaned easily and quickly. I haven't had an opportunity to use the steamer but will this summer. I highly recommend this to anyone looking for a cooker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love my Turkey Fryer","review":"I was making a turkey at least twice a month.

When viewing it, try to forget what you know or have learned since 1944. No, it's not the best documentary out there, but still worth a look. I'd recommend renting it or instead, see one of the best documentaries on WWII, the classic \\"World at War\\", narrated by Sir Laurence Olivier. It provides better scope & understanding of the war, seasoned by a 30-year gap between the events & the reflections."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good supplements for hacker and cyborg characters.","review":"Good supplements for hacker and cyborg characters and fairly easy to integrate into an existing campaign.Note: The book is not harcover, it is paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"(too) many faces of...","review":"Mr. Snowboy has been around. He has done this and that. Snowboy has made himself a known figure/musician of the latin ACID JAZZ era, which is (un)fortunately dead. In this album, Snowboy has collaborated with many musicians - D-Zine, (most of the) James Taylor Quartet, Bob Batterbee and many more, musicians that come from many music styles, in order to make a colorful and imaginative album. The buttom line is that this album is not homogenous, and misses it's purpose. The latin tracks (TRAPUCADA, JAZZAKUTI, THE NEW AVENGERS), in which snowboy leads the gang are not new to the ear, but never the less - energentic. But when programming, scratches and rap blends in (I AM THE MAN, HAVANA), it doesn't sound natural. Pity. A nice album which doesn't survive the changes in music since 1996, so this is not the one to start with, but maybe the one for a very non-formal evening, when you don't want to impress too much your guests."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for camping","review":"Used this to waterproof my car top carrier purchased for camping.

The stories werevery interesting and intriging to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow character","review":"The book started out ok and promised to be a smooth read and it was, but I lost my interest in reading it further when it brought me to the part when Laura takes off with Sebastian, whom by the way she meets the same very day, they go for a car ride, after which she gets into a cold fountain naked to get a coin. Notice, that Laura is not a child but a young woman.Laura's character is undeveloped, poor and unbelievable. I stopped reading the book after two chapters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horribly bad book","review":"I picked this book up because I was in the library and a little bored, and I had a dim recollection of thinking that Dailey had good characters. As far as 'dim' goes, it was a 5-watt idea.The plot is something like an heiress named Laura is traveling Europe with her father's first wife, Tara and two guys, both \\"sultry,\\" handsome and sexually magnetic, fall in love with her, the night they meet her. What's a girl to do?Why should you never pick this book up? Because Laura's character has no depth--she's not even \\"too perfect\\" she's just too dumb. With her astounding good looks--\\"she knows it\\", her 'charm', her continuous conquests, her stupid jump in the fountain, I literally tossed this book aside in disgust.I'm sorry Dailey. I respect you as an author and am sorry to see you not equalling the potential your earlier books showed. All readers out there, if you're looking for books with good characters and engaging stories.... look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"No more Calder Saga for me!","review":"The first Calder book I read was Calder Pride and I immediately fell in love with Cat and Logan story.

My first read of Jane Dailey (given to me by a friend). I gave it back to my friend half way thru. What a selfish heroine and dull romantic leads. Laura and Tara deserved each other. This book and its characters are boring, self centered and have no redemptive value. No entertainment value either.Can anyone suggest a good Calder book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite up to par...sorry, I love this series though!","review":"I, too, started reading this series when I was just a kid, sneaking into my mom's \\"secret stash\\" of romance novels she thought she hid from me! I just knew at an early age this continuing series was something great! But, I am so sorry to say I am disappointed with this latest in the Calder family. This girl is rather annoying, she thinks she says clever things and acts tantalyzing, when she is completely immoral! How is she playing hard to get by stripping naked to retrieve a coin she tossed into the Trevi Fountain!? I will most likely read the next book as it is about Quint Echohawk and the Logan/Cat story was pretty good. If you have to read this because you hate to miss anything in this series then please pick it up at the library in the free pile or library book sale like I did (sorry amazon, I do love you though)I give this 2 stars because I just love the Calder's."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG disappointment","review":"Do not buy this book, not new, not used. If you just have to read Janet Dailey check it out from a library. There is nothing in this book that is remotely interesting, and the main character is totally unlikeable. Ms. Dailey has lost her touch, I suspected so when the last Calder book was less than expected, but this one isn't worth wasting time on."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Calder Promise\\" Promise what? To get worse?","review":"Where's the story line? I don't feel as though the first part of the book had anything to do with the second part. Introduction of characters really. Bury a family member....no tears/emotions.....They are a strong, close family but not heartless. Plot just kinda dwindled down at the end w/strangers really with the hubby abusing wife....who were these people? Ghost town inhibitants. Hope it gets better with the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"My Least Favorite of the Calder Books","review":"There were no real redeeming qualities to this one--no endering characters, no emotional tugs, no interesting plot developments. It was just several hundred pages of the narcistic heroine and the emotionally detached machinations of the people around her. A hundred pages into it I found myself wondering if we would ever get back to Montana where there were at least characters I liked. (We did, eventually, but all those characters were unfortunately marginalized even then.)Because I had already bought it, I followed this up with \\"Lone Calder Star\\" and liked it much better. I wish I had just skipped Laura's story. I have a suggestion: if Ms. Dailey insists on killing off main characters, I vote for Laura and Tara."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY disappointed","review":"I've always been one of the first to buy Janet Dailey books and have read all of the Calder writings. This in NO way compares to her previous Calder stories, in fact I had to actually make myself finish it. No real point of the story unless we zero in on Laura and her inability to choose which one of the available men to sleep with ... and how soon. It will be a LONG time before I buy another Janet Dailey book -- believe she's lost her touch -- it's time to look at other authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Calder Promise","review":"This was my least favorite of the Calder Series. Laura Calder did not come across as an endearing heroine as did Lorna, Maggie, Cat, and even Jessy. Even her twin brother, Trey, is not thrilled with her overall behavior. I would suspect if Janet Dailey writes a story about Trey, his sister's treatment of men will become an issue for him when he tries to fall in love. The first four or five books in the series were very good and loaded with interesting information about the geographical area in Eastern Montana. I am happy to say, Ms. Dailey's last Calder book \\"Lone Calder Star\\" does come back around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Calder Promise: The letdown of the Calder Series","review":"I purchased Janet Dailey's complete 10 volume Calder Series because of my love of western/ranchland fiction. This, the 7th of the series, diverts the reader completely away from the plains of Montana and centers around the hoidy toidy carryings on of aristocratic Europeans. If I had been interested in this type of novel, there are plenty others out there. There was no need to stray so far from the central story-line of this series. I found myself reading entire chapters then realizing I had no idea of what I had read. This installment was a waste of her time as a writer and my time as a reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"One [angry] off lobster by the director of Friday the 13th","review":"A group of underwater construction engineers unleash an ancient creature which soon attacks their underwater habitat. The giant monster, which resembles a massive lobster, is the real thrill in this blatant copycat of the MANY underwater films of 1989. Starring Miguel Ferrer, Matt McCoy and Nia Peebles. The only reasons to rent this film are to watch McCoy get munched by the lobster in a JIM suit and to watch Ferrer get a real bad case of the bends.The DVD is as plain as it gets, if you want a better underwater thriller get The Abyss or even Deep Blue Sea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misguided premise deepsixes DeepStar","review":"DeepStar Six would have been better served had it simply tried to go the way of an Irwin Allen style disaster flick instead of the monster movie route, ala 'Alien' and 'The Thing'. Alas, stupidity has a way of getting what it wants and it wanted DeepStar Six to be a monster movie. So instead of an average undersea adventure story we get a two-dimensional bunch of Navy divers battling a ridiculous-looking sea monster (which isn't even mentioned, let alone seen, until about an hour into the movie!). Too bad, because the acting isn't bad nor are the production values. It's just that everything could have been salvaged as a tale of deepsea divers trying to survive structrual damage to their habitat. Instead, the misguided monster movie premise deepsixes DeepStar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely horrible","review":"Deepstar Six is one of those ripoffs that tries to earn as much money as possible before a quick fade which is exactly what happened to this movie. Heck, I'm the only reviewer. What happens? A bunch of researchers underneath the ocean must fight off an amphibious creature. That's about it. What really made this movie so bad was the fact that no one is really concerned about this monster until the last forty minutes. As a matter of fact, the hour before it is very boring and the rescue mission is just trying to take up time. This is also a very predictable movie. Who survives? Take a guess. I'm sure you'll guess right. Don't waste your time with this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Weller Flick","review":"Ok so this movie is not for everyone I understand that. But one thing that is fun is to ponder how much better this movie could have been with some slight tweaks in the script. I thought this film had heart, especially the two survivor characters. I remember as a child being scared of this film, and it still rings true today.When you put together the thought of being crushed by the weight of the ocean, of not decompressing while racing to the surface to escape a nightmare, its freaky folks. I think if you \\"get into\\" this movie then you would enjoy it. In order to do that you must suspend judgment. Star Wars does not have the best special affects anymore, but its a classic tale. Maybe this one is not classic but its very imaginative."},{"rating":"1","title":"DeepStar Six","review":"This movie is a copy of such films as Leviathan and The Abyss. It is entertaining but lacks the true suspense and quality effects found in The Abyss. I was greatly disappointed that this is not presented in wide screen format but rather formatted for TV. If you want to watch a movie that has the made for TV feel then this is OK But if you want a good viewing experience watch The Abyss."},{"rating":"1","title":"seems familiar","review":"i was just curious about this movie since i did not see it in the theatres. it seems like it is parts of other movies. good popcorn movie with spouse"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another derivative Alien rip-off","review":"Director Sean S. Cunningham (the original Friday the 13th) helmed this derivative Alien clone, in which an underwater crew encounter a slimy alien-esque beast with a taste for human flesh. Deep Star Six is just one of the countless movies that exploded in the 80's after the original Alien became a massive hit. But, as you can see here and in plenty of other of these types of derivative rip-off's, the same formula doesn't always work. There is some nice tense moments and some nice blood and gore, but for the most part the cast is beyond bad (Miguel Ferrer looks more bored than ever) and the monster looks ridiculously lame. Do yourself a favor, stick with Alien and Aliens."},{"rating":"1","title":"not widescreen","review":"hey dont rent or buy quitly is bad and not widescreen.. cheaper to buy it on DVD then on here.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good B movie","review":"A good little B movie from the man who brought you Friday the 13th.

When I originally saw this film on pay T.V. I was surprised at just how good it was. I found this movie very tense, edge of your seat scary entertainment. You know something bad is about to happen when a crater is created in the bottom of the ocean floor, somebody has made an a creature very t'd off. This is when the mayhem begins, out of the abyss comes something very bad.Don't count this film out, I think most will enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucker for creatures!","review":"Remember watching this flick in LA, could'nt remeber if it was a hit, or one of those U just could have skipt all together.

It quit grinding beans after about the 3rd day, and now it won't work unless it gets a throrough cleaning before each use. And I mean empty all the beans out, take the whole thing apart and brush out the grinder and clean out the output area. Even after that, it can never get to the end of one cycle to grind enough coffee for 8 cups. Oh, it's hideously loud as well and sprays grounds all over the counter. I gave it one star because zero stars was not an option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality, bad design","review":"First. the beans have to fall around a 'guide' in the hopper that can cause the beans to stop falling into the grinder altogether. Second, the catch-bin doesn't fit the main housing very well. Third, the electronics are poor. I encountered a failed power connection and it shipped back for repair. Received repaired after two weeks only to have a similar electronic failure a couple weeks later. Skip this product and buy a Barazta.

More rock then punk. No whining, screeching, thrashing; she is in control. Guitars sing out with soaring purpose. Rhythm section is rock solid, confident, never pushed.

One of her best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another brilliant recording from Patti Smith","review":"Patti Smith follows up \\"Gone Again,\\" a masterpiece, with an almost equally brilliant recording. Where it may not possess as much raw pain and power as it's predecessor it is equally outstanding in it's writing and performances. Smith is in fine voice, both written and sung, and the band, led once again by Lenny Kaye, is equally terrific. Peace and Noise and Gone Again are two of the greatest recordings of the nineties.

If you are going to buy this burner, make sure you keep a very very VERY close eye on it until the paint burns (not melts, burns) off. I'd even advise trying to scrape the paint off as a precautionary measure.Other than that, the pot and accessories served their purposes well.

Sure Demi,Cameron,Drew, and Lucy are some of the best looking women in Hollywood. But that does not excuse this waste of money and film. I am not even going to give you a plot summary, because you don't even want to have a sliver of interest in this film.

This movie, on the other hand, is a perfect example of what Hollywood does best: take something that works perfectly fine - and screw it up!Instead of spending all that money on a good script, they gave it all to the Special Effects and Stupid Stunts Department and let them run amuck - and amuck they ran.

I actually spent more time trying to see if I could count the number of cameo's then paying attention to the film itself. The movie was way over the top. There were just too many things in the second film that seemed unbelievable, but maybe that was the point. It was a point I missed. Crispin Glover as the Thin Man in the second film. I did not understand why his character was in this film. Was I too believe that the angels could be 1. Flung through a window at high speed, 2. fall down some stairs at high speed. 3. pull a piece of glass out of her stomach fight the bad chick, then change and appear at a Hollywood screening unscathed? Some of the fighting scenes were cool, but the movie IMHO was not as good as the first one. Someone compared this movie to face off. I'm sorry the two movies do not even compare!!! Face Off is a much better film."},{"rating":"1","title":"CRAP","review":"I have to say that this movie is the worst piece of crap ever made.

Not only is this a travesty of film making (the story is barely patched together, a lot of it doesn't even make sense, at one point it looks the the Angels can actually fly! am i missing something?) The subplot with John Cleese is lame (poor Mr. Cleese, at least Shia Lebouf or whatever his name is can blame his youth on his cameo) The movie is just plain dumb...at least the first one was original in it's idiocy. And let's be honest, Drew is a an attractive woman and will turn heads pretty much everywhere, but when you team her up with two supermodels in Cameron and Liu...well...come on...

But it's Charlie's Angels. Therefore, we're supposed to ignore everything bad about it and have fun. The only fun I had was watching Crispin Glover, and they probably purposely made his spot small, so as not to take away from the \\"fun\\" of the rest of the movie. Seems like every scene is a music video, with enough ridiculous wire moves and slow motion to fill up 4 or 5 other movies. Four people will enjoy this movie:1.) Teenage girls2.) Teenage boys3.) Men without girlfriends4.)

James Bond movies carry unbelievable stunts, but at least those movies keep some sense of reality. This movie doesn't portray any sense of reality to absolute impossible stunts that could never happen. But it wasn't just the over the top stunts that stunk up this film. A combination of sudden magic when the girls would be in one place then all of a sudden somewhere else, then poof, they disappeared to another location. Bad acting and Demi Moore overshadowing the main stars, and forget about any story or plot. There isn't one. And by the way, what the hell was the point of Crispin Glover's role? What a stupid movie...Please don't make another sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh... oh dear lord, no","review":"After the first 5 minutes of this film, I heard a little voice in my head say \\"WHAT!?

Tim Burton really messed up making this one. Now, I know this is supposed to be a review of Charlie's Angels Full Throttle but I got lazy damnit so this is a review of Planet of the Apes instead. Now, I have yet to see Full Throttle but I don't really like Cameron Diaz Bernie Mac or females in action pictures in general, So I give it one star.

The women are secret agents but their half-naked in ever scene. If I wanted to see porn I'd go on the 9,000,000,000,000 plus porn sites.

Or even Kate Hudson or Brittany Murphy with dark brown hair. DUH."},{"rating":"1","title":"Charlies Angels: Dull Throttle","review":"Apparently, nowadays to have a money making movie, you just need to add a cool name and some hot stars. This movie is a sequel to the 2001 movie Charlies Angels. Neither of these movies had the greatest plot but this one has the weakest. The movie starts out somewhere in Mongolia. Two of the angels are trying to rescue an important person held hostage while the other one rides a mechanical bull in a skimpy fluffy white dress. Moving in slo-mo for many scenes in the movie, this movie is usually hard to follow. The all-out action sequences are sometimes cool but get tiring after they repeat themselves. Sure the babes are hot but to keep an audience happy and pleased for an hour and a half you need a good plot to hold everything together...(a bikini strap doesn't count). This movie may be enjoyed if your just looking for some fun on a rainy afternoon but other than that I would avoid it at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken License","review":"Amazon will deceive you with this Video on Demand version of \\"Charlie's Angels Full Throttle.\\" I bought the video and downloaded it along with many other films (including the original C.A.).

But it is nothing like the first one. If you are looking for this movie to be as good or better than the first, it's not going to happen.There is about as much action in this one as the first, maybe even more. But there really is no story line going on. They had good intentions, but it doesn't really go anywhere. It's supposed to be a continuation from the first and in certain parts you get maybe a little hint here and there, but mostly you find you have to remind yourself what is going on. They actually repeated a lot of scenes from the first one but did so in a different light, angle, degree, concept.This move is just okay. I recommend renting or borrowing, but not buying this. No where near as good as the first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey, this isn't art.

And the very fact she needed 100K's worth of plastic surgery to make her look \\"young\\" again is demeaning to women especially in this day and age where small children start to show signs of eating disorders. Apart from this gripe, which I could put aside as Demi Moore is only one women, but the plot is unsalvageable and only falls further downhill as the movie progesses. This movie may have made money, but not sense. At least in the first movie suspending disbelief was possible (and Sam Rockwell, a great actor, made an amazing villain, unlike Ms Moore and Justin Theroux- he was just too much), but in this one forget it.On a better note there are some good moments in the film notably when it's doing the comedy thing... maybe thats something to look out for if your forced to watch this movie! Also the leads are good and with a proper villian next time maybe this franchise could be good once again."},{"rating":"1","title":"About the same as the first","review":"They should have stopped at one film, it would have been enough, but if people will go and see sequels, I guess, why not make them?

Of course there is some more to the story but if you're like me you'll probably just won't care what they are after watching thirty minutes of this god awful movie. I like the three main actresses but it's no surprise that there is no talk in the works for Charlie's Angels 3. Spare yourself the money and time and just buy some other action movie that is truly worth it"},{"rating":"1","title":"God Awful","review":"This was quite possibly the worst movie that I have ever seen. After watching nearly 20 minutes of pure crap I was forced to turn it off. I don't understand how anyone can be stupid enough to derive entertainment from this. It seemed more like a randomn rush of trendy images than a coherent film. The movie jumped from one idiotic scene to the next. Please don't waste your money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Charlie Angels 2","review":"I have seen this DVD and I find it so stupid. It is not worth the value of money after doing \\"Matrix\\" and stunts. It does not related to the original Charlie Angels.

In Barrymore's interview, she described it as a movie that has something for the girls and the guys.Girls, don't bother. The movie was like soft porn (plotless) or a Mariah Carey music video gone bad (cheesy). Stiletto heels, too many girl on girl innuendo's, and bad lingerie. Think Victoria's Secret Angels that spank each other. It's a men's magazine cover brought to life.I've always been a fan of Drew Barrymore, but she has lost me on this one. It seems wrong to be told that this movie is empowering for women or that this is the James Bond for women. James Bond is not performing stunts half naked and in shoes that make his legs look longer :-) We understand that the movie is a campy play on the original, but don't try and tell us girls that it is anything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy of being... Charlie's Angels","review":"A surprisingly good film considering it is a sequel, Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle, provides us with another adventure involving the dynamic trio.Cameron Diaz, Lucy Liu, Drew Barrymore, Demi Moore, Matt Le Blanc (!), and the rest of the cast carry out their performances very well, allowing for a highly entertaining movie. Be sure to keep your eyes open for short, but sweet guest appearances by celebrities.On the negative side, Justin Theroux as the Irish (???) villain and Crispin Glover as \\"Thin Man\\" (???) are ridiculous to say the least, and take away from the overall enjoyment of the movie!In short, the plot is average, while the setting, the special effects, and the music are EXCELLENT!Overall, though not a masterpiece, it is definitely a movie worth watching, as it will surely provide for an evening's entertainment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh - Charlie's Crapfest","review":"Hard to think of a worse \\"big name movie\\" than this one. Everything was bad. It has Matt LeBlanc in it. The stunts were in the kung fu mode, and worse than the Vin Diesel \\"XXX\\" crapfest, if that is possible. Falling off the dam into the helicopter was the first clue of up-coming dreck. The moto-cross action was way over the top. If you expected to see much female skin, forget it. Demi Moore has fake breasts - silicone valley. The \\"unrated\\" rating refers to the fact that it has more violence. Did I mention everything was bad? It has Matt LeBlanc in it.I recommend watching any other movie except Lost and Delirious, Black and White, or Armageddon. People that make movies like this should be neutered and given a celluloid enema of their own film."},{"rating":"1","title":"almost 3 stars for a funny and sometimes entertaining film","review":"It's not a good sign when you fall asleep while watching a movie. The 'disposable' plot certainly did not help keep my attention. I decided to finish the DVD a few days later as I did find some good laughs before dozing off. This is a good comedy-action film. Though some of the action is so outrageously impossible that you could probably call it comedy! The cameo appearances and the featurettes added somewhat to the DVD. Overall this film was a disappointment when compared to the first Charlies Angels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make up your mind Mc G","review":"The wonderful remake of Charlie's Angels was phenomenal. They took a touch of unreal things and blended it with a beautiful high tech secret world. The sequel however, is skimpy outfits, bad acting, fake effects, and nothing much else. Firstly I would like to tell you why I give it two. Demi Moore looked great! She never delivered an evil role so beautifully and didn't deserve her Worst Supporting Acress Razzie. Drew Barrymore stayed deep and serious in her character, but Lucy and Cameron came out with stupid ditzy performances that didn't make them as smart as they were in the original film. One thing that could've made the movie better would've been less stupid effects, and a more touch of reality like we saw in the first installment. Not even B worthy, I give this film a D-"},{"rating":"2","title":"A rocking Rock N Roll good time.","review":"This movie gets 7 thumbs up from our household. My 20 year children liked it, mom and I liked it and the little ones liked it. The only foul language we noticed was from the mouth of Bosley. To bad. There is sexual inuendo, but it is subtle enough for younger viewers.The action and the rock and roll music are terrific. This movie is fun to watch, almost as much fun as the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Charlie's Angels Full Throttle Fails.","review":"I am a huge fan of the first Charlies Angels. It was funny, exciting, clever, and Drew, Lucy, and Cameron were hilarious. However, what made the first film so much fun is completely gone in the second and it gets old real quick. The slow motion special effects, the constant giggling between the 3 girls, and the lame jokes all get annoying. Theres barely a plot, and the film just moves from one fight scene to another, so after about 20 minutes, I lost interest. Demi Moore is the only thing the film has going for it. She is evil and sexy, but is underused. I recommend seeing this film for Demi Moore only."},{"rating":"1","title":"The dreck that is Charle's Angels","review":"The Angels must recover a pair of rings that hold the code for unscrambling the Witness Protection Program database.

Lots of action, lots of FX, lots of noise - but makes no sense. The action is SOOO over the top, it is like a video game; the only place you could watch this stuff and buy into it. The problem? Unless you control the joystick - its stupid to watch! I like Barrymore, Diaz and Liu, but all they do here, is change clothes, speak in third-grade-level double entendres and hang from invisible wires. (Damn Crouching Tiger ...!) John Cleese? Why is he here? They don't even give him a funny line! Bernie Mac (God Bless Him) tries really hard, but he is fighting a losing battle. Crispin Glover? Can anyone explain to me what/who he is in this movie? I still have no clue. An Demi Moore? Well, she looks great and actually injects the most life of anyone into this puddle-deep film. Her revenge? She got lots of s**t for her 12.5 mil. payday for the awful Striptease. BUT ... Cameron Diaz got 20 mil. for this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"it was painfull to watch angels this time","review":"This is the worst movie I have ever watched..

I really did not want much from the film, just to be entertained. However, while the first Charlie's Angels film was mildly entertaining, but this movie manages to be both insipid and boring.

I ended up just channel surfing the night away. I can't believe crap such as this gets made year after year, guess that's what happens when you replace studio heads with clueless MBA clones that can't make a decision without consulting the day's horoscopes. Even more upsetting are \\"directors\\" like McG who kept getting gigs without showing an ounce of ability to tell a story, or direct for that matter.

It's great if you can watch both movies back to back."},{"rating":"2","title":"The girls are back.","review":"The action three return for another round of fun and sillyness in Full Throttle. However the return of the resculptured Demi Moore as the good former angle turned bad is what this movie will be remembered for. Her high impact entrance in a Bikini is attested to this and she nearly upstages Diaz in the best body stakes.The DVD is packed full of information and all in all a great Chic action flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-stop action in a pathetic plot","review":"This feature is a far cry from the funny, action-filled, successful first installment in this series. It's been nearly two days since I've seen it, and I am having a difficult time remembering the plot. That should give you some kind of idea of what this movie is all about. What it does best, it does really well. That would be the action scenes involving our three heroines. Of course, the fighting and chasing scenes are incredibly unrealistic, but this movie is definitely not about realism. Rent it if you'd like to see some incredible, albeit computer-generated, action sequences. However, to those discriminating movie viewers, rent something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"as good if not better than the first","review":"So then why do I only give it 4 out of 5 stars? It's because of the DVD version. I couldn't tell any difference between the unrated version and the theatrical version. It seems like the unrated title was slapped onto the cover just so more copies would sell. Anyway, on with the review: As I said in my title, Full Throttle definately lives up to it's predecessor. The returning characters in Full Throttle are Bosley who this time is played by Bernie Mac, which I prefered him as Bosley over Bill Murray and the Thin Man played again by Crispin Glover from the first movie. Demi Moore does a good job playing the sexy villain. The new disguieses and the motorcyle race are also a plus. I can't believe the number of people who gave negative reviews towards this movie! In my opinion, Full Throttle is one of many examples on how sequels aren't always a bad idea. As for specail features on the DVD, the unrated and theatrical version aren't much different."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charlie's Angels: Full Throttle","review":"I must say that this sequel to the original in my opinion was really awesome with the exception that when I saw it at the theater, it didnt look as fake as it did on the DVD version. Otherwise the only other problem I have with this film is that at certain points in the story, it gets confusing. Demi Moore's character was cool and the new Bosley was way better than Bill Murray's version of Bosley. Bernie Mac was funnier while Bill Murray was too serious. All in all I thought the movie was great and hopefully they will make a Charlie's Angels 3!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quel navet!","review":"Give yourself a favor... save a few dollars by not buying this film. En franais, a s'appelle un NAVET!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I liked the first \\"Charlie's Angels\\" film. All three lead actresses were charming and had great chemistry together, the action scenes were surprisingly exciting and it didn't take itself too seriously. It was just fun. The sequel, \\"Full Throttle\\", however, is a letdown. Although Cameron, Drew and Lucy are still sexy and adorable, the script is awful. It's just an incoherent mess. Almost all of the jokes fall flat, and this time the action sequences are poorly conceived and executed. The only thing I really found interesting about the film was the casting of Demi Moore as \\"fallen angel\\" Madison Lee. Moore is diabolically sexy in the role, so it's too bad the script doesn't give her enough to do. With four of the most exciting actresses in Hollywood in one film, it's really a shame the writers and director couldn't make this film work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hot Chicks! Bad Flick!","review":"This film was one of the stinkers of 2003. Not a cereberal film at all but I wasn't expecting it to be. The leading ladies were of course the main attraction. Cameron Diaz is great for eye candy in this film. The Sweetest Thing wasn't exactly Cocteau but I enjoyed it even though it wasn't that good. It would've been hilarious if Sean Young was the villianess instead of Demi Moore. The plot didn't exist and Bernie Mac was annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLAIN SUCKS","review":"THIS IS ONE GOD AWFUL MOVIE. THE FIRST TEN MINUTES MADE ME WANT TO PUKE.

After a while, you forgot whether or not there was a story line. You are so side-tracked with all the constantly changing visual affects every other minute. I believe the story revolved around the retrieval of two coded rings that held the names of those in the witness protection program. A former angel (Demi Moore) goes into business for herself in stealing the rings and then selling them to the highest bidder. There is one thing I have to give the movie credit for. It provides female action heroines. They can kick any man's butt. Although unrealistic is approach, it does provide motivation for young women."},{"rating":"1","title":"a terrible movie","review":"This movie is a total mess.

To sum it up this movie is a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad is the first word that comes to mind","review":"Okay, first of all I really liked the first one. In this movie there is no story, and it really is all about sex, the jokes, the costumes, everything. I like the concept of girls kicking butt, but this whole movie was about the sex appeal of the stars. Even the jokes were about sex and disgusting. Add to that the ridiculous Bosley and this movie is not worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book is weak and doesn't always make sense","review":"As was described in an earlier review, the transformation of bandit Marcus Cole into Statesman was not adequately explained. I also want to know why Stephan Riechter, who becomes Lord Recluse, grows into a monster with metal-tipped spider legs on his back. This is not explained well either. There is also a scene where a non-super-powered reporter, who has been taking some martial arts classes, karate chops a large steel pipe or beam and bends it in two with her bare hands.Also, the superheroes that come to aid Statesman pretty much come out of nowhere. Elementar seems extremely powerful and it's surprising that he did not do anything with his powers until Statesman came along.I could go on if I felt like refering back to the book, but I don't. It's just not a very polished story in my humble opinion. I hope the author's own original works are better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"buy it now","review":"probebly the best record from the smiths. the voice and the words maken by morrisi are rare in today rock scene. you can cry from the words and feel elivated by the sound. \\"there is a light that never goes out\\" is one of my favurits songs, and oscilating wildly is great example of what good band can do with simple lyrics. enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Louder Than Bombs vs The World Won't Listen","review":"Louder Than Bombs was my first Smiths album, and it took me a while to really get into it.

This book does not put itself out as a historical writing, only one that has coordinated and organized WW2 sites in such a way that a novice or buff can find the sites and learn more. While it ranks the sites (Holocaust sites are not ranked as they could never be stratified against another historical moment in time) it does so based on the ability of one to find the site, location, physical identifiers and the learning possibilities of that site.

There's no conflict in this book, no story, and no humor. ( \\"Whimsy\\" being a very poor substitute for the latter.) Just a boring character who climbs up a tree and decides to stay there.

The author actually makes me think it's possible to live in trees as he brings a lot of everyday activities into the trees. I was taken into another realm of carefree living for a few days. The end is a bit forced, as my interest was dulled as it tried to bring too much history into it; therefore, making it less \\"real\\" in a sense.

Out of 400 pages, 44 page on China, and 38 pages on India, the two of the most significant civilizations in Asia and the world! Let's not forget they are also the two emerging superpowers right now. Don't they deserve more attention in a book called Peoples and Cultures of Asia? How many pages on Afghanistan? 88! Yes, we are fighting a war there.Also, the part on China and Chinese culture centers too much on communism and cultural revolution. Not even mention a single word regarding the new economic and cultural transition after 1990s. Do we really need to constantly remind our students of the \\"cold war\\"?There are some good chapters of course. But I would not use this book again for the reasons above."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"Out of all the songs on the CD only the very first one was one I enjoyed.

I wish Jim Boyd had some more cd's available. Maybe he will in the future ?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the movie? Get the soundtrack.","review":"Like the movie, the soundtrack seems to be a wonderfully original piece that mostly has moments of soulful beauty, grace and humor, with some purely dorky \\"you can tell this is my very first time doing this\\" moments. The electric guitar pieces didn't really fit in the movie - they seemed to be communicating the obvious in a way that was really detracting to the quality of the scenes, and they don't stand well on their own on the CD. But those songs are few and, as soundtracks go, this is really beautiful overall. The vocalists are original and really good, and make you want to find out more about them and their work. And if you loved the movie, you will probably really appreciate the CD. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie is great but the CD music fails out of context.","review":"Except for the powerful, seven minute \\"Forgive Our Fathers\\" opening suite, the music on this CD amounts to background music for quite a good movie. The musicians do an admirable job in that respect but it doesn't transfer to music that stands alone. I bought the CD just on the basis of a very funny scene, with music and irreverent singing, in the movie. This too has less impact outside of the movie context. This is often the case with movie soundtracks. The person I saw the movie with was going to get the CD but I think we'll both be glad that we stopped at one.I'd take the money and invest in some good native american music or native american rock. This is my first native american CD, and since I first heard native american rock radio in Albuquerque in 1994, I have been attracted to the genre. The movie experience and the first track of this CD now move me to get my second and third native american CD's that aren't sound tracks."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Great Disappointment","review":"For anyone who saw the movie, you would have to say it was a great film. The soundtrack, however, is a different story. The music on the soundtrack does nothing to engage the listener. At 27 tracks, it seems after a while, it all starts to sound the same. The one exception is the chant \\"John Wayne's Teeth\\", which on the CD is just as humorous as it was in the film. Overall, however, I would recommend to skip the soundtrack, and see the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding New Age Mixed With Old Taste","review":"Smoke Signals Soundtrack is incredible. I grew up on the Colville Indian Res, and was able to listen to great Pow Wow music most of my life. This soundtrack really puts my life into perspective.

If not, you may want to pick up a copy of \\"Java in a Nutshell\\" to go along with this one. It will not teach you how to program Java by any means.The only things that disapointed me about this book was that the included CD-ROM does not include anything /really/ useful. It has the examples from the book, but does not include the referenced tools (such as Forte, Apache, or KToolBox). As all of these applications are free, they could have easily been included on disk. Instead the reader must spend a bit of time downloading materials on the internet. Also, it doesn't tell you how to get the Midlets into your phone.

There is nothing good I can say about it. It is poorly written, directed and forced upon the unsuspecting audience before you know what hits you.The plot involves nine friends who get together at a cabin in the woods, \\"Big Chill\\" style but minus the style. Then we must endure cheesy dialoge while the movie plods along, unfolding new and uninteresting facts about each relationship as if we cared enough to want to know.

It was filmed a long time ago and probably not good then either. It was predictable and boring and the acting was terrible.

Skip it, by all means!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"It must be a matter of personal taste but I was not impressed with this movie at all. The acting seemed like acting, not real life. I kept waiting for something significant to happen and it never did. The plate on the porch bit was just plain dumb and the dialogue was corny at best.

It's a tremendous rock and roll record, one that had a vast influence in the most creative era of the music's history. (No small feat, considering the other records released at that time ...

Nothing about this album sticks out of the mold defined, if not started by the Dead and J Airplane.

Collectables reissued this on CD (in stereo) a while back and the sound quality was HORRIBLE to say the least, it sounded like it was mastered off a 2nd generation cassette tape. Then Italy's Get Back Records (a label known for it's shadiness) reissued it on LP (also in stereo) with slightly better results but still not quite up to par with other classic LP reissues. THEN Sundazed (bless their souls)reissues it in MONO from the best available mint copy of the original and it sounds AWESOME! I never realized the power of this LP until I heard it in this version, it's a whole new experience (really). The guitars are much more upfront in the mix, the electric jug is buried more in the backround (thank god!) and Roky's vocals sound better than ever! I can't say enough good things about the reissue.

So I tried getting this book to relearn some of the language before going back to Hungary this year. It helped me do just that, and I was able to converse with plenty of non-English speaking Hungarians. This is a well-written book.But how much will this book help you if you don't know Hungarian at all? I'm not so sure. To communicate in a language, I think you really need to hear it spoken and painstakingly learn a bunch of vocabulary words (I like using flashcards to do this). I think it will be more of a help to those who already know something about the language, or at least have access to someone who can help them practice it.I'm glad I got this book. I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little phrase book but...","review":"This phrasebook is filled with loads of well-organized information and superb vocab words - I thouroughly enjoyed reading it from cover to cover while on the plane to Budapest. However, once I arrived in Hungary I was a bit disappointed to find that everyone spoke English (at least in the Budapest area). The phrases I tried got a few smiles, but the only truly useful part of the book was the dictionary. It was quite helpful in reading signs, ads, posters, menus etc.In spite of the little use I got out of it, I would still recommend taking this phrasebook to Hungary. It provides a bit of security for the short-term traveler and would become more useful the longer you stayed (especially for those who can speak a bit of Hungarian already or those who are studying the language)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing!!","review":"I am a die hard drag racing fan.

The idea that the mind may exist outside, and maybe even in spite of, the brain certainly is plausible enough: but, Dr. Hunt doesn't present her case very well, relying too much on electrographs coupled with unreasonable assumptions as compelling evidence.

One is the well-known alternating electric current of the nervous system ...\\" In the nervous system there are no alternating currents, that is, a current that constantly reverses its direction. In the nerve there is an 'action potential' that travels in one direction only. When the 'action potential' of the nerve reaches the synapse of the target neuron, it releases a neurotransmitter into the synapse which fits into a receptor molecule on the surface of the target neuron. This in turn releases a second messenger in the cell. The neurotransmitter is then broken down and re-synthesized in the nerve terminal. There is no return of the 'action potential' to the original neuron."},{"rating":"1","title":"Witch Doctor Scam","review":"This book has a lot of ideas taken from people like Jung to make it seembelieveable.It is so good that a person like me with only a BSEE and Compute Sciencesdegree would swallow it as, except for the many technical errors and the fact that the end intent is selling a watch that is purported to cureillness is being sold at a riduculous price, with the come on that the profits are going to a non profit association.Come now.

I wanted to give it zero stars but one star is the lowest rating.There is no science at all in this book. It is pure nonsense.

There are lots of ways to be nutty but ultimately it all comes down to one thing: nuttiness."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great great film.","review":"This movie takes my breath away. I love The Road Warrior, but something about this film grabs me more -- Tina Turner's campy introduction (\\"Tantan -- play something -- TRAGIC.\\"), the children chanting \\"Walker\\" on the plane, and that ending, which I find very haunting and beautiful. It's a perfect mix of the vulgar and the beautiful. One of my favorite films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Third is the best","review":"To be short, from all the three movies, I liked this best.

A perfect example of what happens when Hollywood gets involved."},{"rating":"1","title":"a pathetic closing after two spectacular movies","review":"I wish i had never watched this at all. The action in this movie is terrible. Tina Turner is annoying. Master blaster and the actual thunderdome battle are the only interstng things in this movie and the only reason it doesn't get a 1. Also that weird little racoon eyed kid is kind of fun...he should have his own movie. The ending of the actual film is pretty but it is very childish. I swear this movie was watered down to be accessible to eight year olds. In conclusion if a 8 year old or YOUNGER wants to see a mad max movie..this would be their ideal, otherwise dont waste time...go watch THe Road Warrior again."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT","review":"Amazon was very good on getting my dvd to me in a reasonable time frame.

If you are looking for a good nostalgic flick... this isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This sequel makes no sense and panders to the lowest demoninator","review":"Some questions:Why do they HAVE TO to go bartertown to rescuse the little guy? The movie never makes it clear why he's needed. Why does Tina Turner's character go to the all the trouble to chase Max and just LET HIM GO at the end? Why doesn't the pilot from the second movie or Max recognize each other? Why does the movie try to be more of a comedy then the first two movies and then try to make some kind of grand social commentary at the end?The music in this movie wasn't bad, but it was totally inappropriate and nonsensical for the theme of this movie.I'm assuming most of the people rating this movie well were eight year olds when they saw it. I just watched it recently for the first time as an adult. It turned out to be much worse than what I was expecting. The first two movies however, are great.All things considered, this movie really sucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful....","review":"If you want to watch a Mad Max movie, buy the original because that's the only one that's worth it. This was a joke, plain and simple. Infact, it couls possibly be the worst film i've ever had the displeasure to see. The whole 'futuristic' setting is flawed with cheap and badly made costumes, make up and props such as swords and blades which look plastic. It was obviously made on a show-string budget. The filming and direction is nothing special, the script is terrible and the fight scenes are laughable beyond belief. It certainly appears that no proper training or rehersal went into any of it.And the plot is boring, and the whole film drags on and on....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mel Gibson, go back to Austrailia!","review":"What the hell was the screenwriter guy smoking (cause I need some of it) when he wrote this? Why would they burn pigs for fuel and how can they randomly find a big valley full of water in the middle of a nuclear desert? And also, how would there be a group mass of children sitting there saying, \\"Our prophecy's fulfilled. We are going to fly back to the city.\\"? Mel Gibson has got to be the worst actor they could find for this movie because he was trying to get rid of his Austrailian accent while adopting an American one, so it comes out sounding like a preadolescent monkey! All the copies of this movie deserve to be burn, the screenwriters should hang their heads in shame, and all affiliated with the production should hide out in the boonies.

Fortunately, I came on Amazon.com and found that these really cool looking black versions were available, so I trapsed out and purchased me a couple of sets. Two around the bed, one by the door, one on the shelf, and BAM! we're rolling. And now I giggle, for Greg is as jealous as can be, because his speakers look like dirty cinder blocks and mine look like Monaco headlights.Don't be a freak, give in to your inner geek!

Mine, though gets very, VERY messy. Every time you measure out the bottom of a shaker, some dust (spice) gets stuck to it and when you put it back into the stand, it gets all over.Also, there's no option for shaking out a small amount of your spice. There's a rather large pour-hole at the top, or you can measure 1/4 tsp. amounts from the bottom. If you want to lightly dust something (like paprika on the top of something) or just add a dash, you have to pour out a 1/4 tsp, and throw away what you don't use.I'm not a huge fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent Concept, Poor Execution","review":"The concept behind this is product is extremely innovative and one that could save me plenty of time and aggravation. However, the poor manufacturing quality results in a product that functions as expected less than half of the time.

It is an example of what can happen when strong acting, strong writing and strong direction are brought together by people who DO NOT aim for the lowest common denominator, but rather, for the sophisticated audience who reacts warmly only to quality performance and credible story line. I also appreciated the structure and pacing, where subplots are introduced and then intertwined, and just the right time is taken to develop characters and story before changing the focus, so I could follow it.See this for an evening of real entertainment. The only problem is, it will spoil you for any of the dumbed-down crapola that Hollywood has released in recent years."},{"rating":"1","title":"buckles need improvement","review":"Great idea, lots of room but the plastic buckles kept coming undone while we were driving.

I purchased this product and by far this is worth every penny. I have used roof top carriers in the past, but never again. This pack hangs off the rear of the vehicle and does not create any drag. You will not notice it there. I cut a piece of plywood to lay at the bottom of the bag for more support and loaded it with gear. We travelled 11 hours each way with no problems.Also, when the trip is over, just fold it up and put it away for the next use. No problems with storage like with those big hard shell roof top carriers.This is a 5 star product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"This worked wonderfully on our trip! It held 2 suitcases, 1 lg air mattress and 2 blankets. We went through snow and rain on the way to our destination and everything stayed dry.

It's a great alternative to the roof storage - and saves you the heavy lifting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great alternative to car top carriers!","review":"The packright is a great inexpensive alternative to car top cargo carriers. I cut out a thin, but strong piece of ply wood to give the bag a good base to help it retain its shape and padded the sides and corners of the ply wood with some old rags and duct tape so it wouldn't eventually cut through the bag. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because I had to do this little bit of work. Packing is a bit of an art as you have to get everything you need packed in the car first, as once the bag is on you won't be able to get to it without removing the bag. When putting the bag on it helps to have two people, but I was able to do it solo. I loaded the bag first and then hoisted it up with the straps like a pulley. Having made a base for the bag also helped it to rest on the back bumper. The bag worked great and I didn't have to shell out hundreds of dollars for a car top carrier that would have killed my gas mileage. Love me some Amazon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked well in rain","review":"Works wellIt well hold a lot of stuff and keep it dry. We hit hard rain for over hour going to the beach all was dry.

It was great to have the bag on the back of the car to reduce drag however when we got to the hotel to unload we found that the bag had collected a significant amount of water in the bottom with all of our belongings. Not a big deal since a placed most of our stuff that was water resistant (plastic or anything not cloth) on the bottom but it was still a let down. The only place where water could have entered the bag would have been where the two zippers meet. I will have to try and duct tape this point to see if we can keep all water out. I took off one star because of it not being foolproof waterproof (small gripe).FYI for those that do not use it with a minivan, we have a Honda CRV and the bag fit fine. It wasn't ideal with the spare tire in the way but the bag fit fine and we had no troubles making it work."},{"rating":"1","title":"No keyboard learning here!","review":"My child is 3 and has good mouse skills, so I thought this product is the next logical step.

Given her previous writing style, I honestly can't believe that she wrote this novel. The story is there, or could be, but the writing is so elementary it's juvenile. In lieu of \\"See Spot Run\\" she wrote \\"Hot damn. Look what I found. Ripe bananas, to go with our mangoes.

I was at least able to finish the book (which is why it got 2 points instead of only 1)... but I would not recommend this book. Her other books in this series are good.

I've read all her FBI/Mystery series and this is by far the worst. The story is all over the place and the characters are never really developed. It was very painful reading this one...really bad!

The Maze was great and after reading The Edge, you will have a hard time believing it's the same writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed...","review":"I ordinarily really enjoy Coulter's books (as far-fetched as they may seem).

I read the whole thing anyway (how can you not?), but this is not one that I will read again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbelievably bad!","review":"What a dreadful book. This is not the first book I have read by Catherine Coulter but it will probably be the last. I only read to the end because I have never been able to put a book down once started. From the beginning I was confused, first by who was actually telling the story then by the way the hero (?) Mac was able to justify the way he acted with Cal and then moved on to the supposed love of his life. Very shallow. There were so many other characters who seemed superfluous, I kept waiting for something to happen with them. And don't get me started on the whole being knocked out in Oregon and waking up in some drug lords compound in South America only to find their way to a resort! There are so many other things I found hard to take with this book that I'll leave it there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best work","review":"I have read practically every Coulter novel written.

I quit reading right after Ford moved her into his house. Maybe I'll finish it one day. Maybe."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Edge\\"","review":"Outside of the Twilight series, the next best thing is Catherine Coulter's FBI series books. \\"The Edge\\" keeps you in suspense, and I thoroughly enjoy Coulter's two main characters Dillon Savich and Lacey Sherlock minorly woven throughout the books to keep the continuity flowing. If you want an entertaining book, I would recommend \\"The Edge\\". However, if you want to start from the beginning of the FBI series using the year of release, I would recommend that too. The reader won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The FBI Should Sue","review":"Let's put it this way: if this book accurately represents FBI personnel & standard operating procedures, we should shut down the agency and save ourselves a lot of money. If it doesn't, the FBI, if it were a person, could sue for defamation of character.Yes, it's fiction. No, we shouldn't expect 100% accuracy in its depiction of the FBI. But if one is going to write a series starring the FBI, doesn't one have at least a tiny obligation to get the basics right?Please, even if you like Coulter (and this was my first - luckily a $1 buy), consider skipping this and the entire series for all the reasons given in the other one-star reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love her other books . . . not a big fan of this one.","review":"I've been a huge fan of her books for many years. In this book, I found her characters to be predictable, kitchy, and sickeningly cute! At one point, I was truly ready for the two main characters to die just so I wouldn't have to hear them be cute anymore.It's as though she took a dip in a Harlequin pond . . . and wrung her towel out in this book.I won't stop reading her books, but I will hope for more from the next one I read."},{"rating":"1","title":"She insulted my intelligence","review":"Having read almost all of Catherine Coulter's historical romances, I can safely say that she's one of the best. However, she leaves much to be desired in the ways of modern \\"suspense\\". I've read all 4 books in this series. The only one I liked was The Maze. The Edge is BY FAR the worst. The first chapter really interested me, but it just went downhill from there. The characters are horrible--in all these books they barely know each other but fall in love at the drop of a hat. And they were so poorly developed; I just didn't care what happened to any of them. But even more painful is The Edge's storyline. It is so far-fetched! There are parts that just do not connect. It really seems to me that these 4 books were not of Coulter quality. Did she have deadlines to meet?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Great Night time sleep aid!","review":"I haven't been able to make it through the first chapter. I was thrilled when this book came out. I have read every one of Catherine Coulter's past books and loved them all. I grabbed \\"The Edge\\" and tossed it into my shopping cart on the strength of her name alone. I'll never make that mistake again. I can't make myself read this book at all. There is nothing in the first chapter to catch my interest. I hate the first person. The characters are as uninteresting as dry toast. I'm not willing to throw this book away yet. Hopefully the next time I attempt to read it I'll get through Chapter two before it puts me to sleep. I am hesitant to give it one whole star but your rating system doesn't go below that."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"After reading The Cove, The Maze and The Target, I couldn't wait to buy this book. Am I glad that I read the reviews and waited till it came out in soft cover. The book had a lot of potential and it grabbed my interest with the first chapter. It was unfortunate that I ended up forcing myself to finish the book. The story not only drags but the characters are not well developed at all. We know the same amount of information about Mac, Laura and the rest of the cast at the end of the book as we do at the begining the only insight we gain is their employment history. The first person perspective was alright but again sadly lacking, normally the reader is given an indepth view into a charater when this format is used, here it just annoying and shallow. I would definatly not take this book on a train, plane, or bus where it would be the only entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book Ever!!!!","review":"This book was so awful, I wish I never read it. The character Mac thinks with something other than his brain. It seems like a teenage boy wrote this book; I think I could have written a better suspense novel!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book Ever!!!!","review":"This is the worst suspense book I ever read!!!! The character Mac sounded like a oversexed FBI agent who used something other than his brain to think. The whole book was unbelieveable. It really is a waste of time to read. I think I could have written a better suspense novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Coulter even write this book?","review":"After reading The Target and The Maze, I was impressed with Coulter's ability to pull off a romantic thriller. I assumed that The Edge, especially with overlapping characters, would be just as good, if not better. Well, to say the least, I was disappointed. The characters were ridiculously underdeveloped, even Sherlock and Savitch, about whom Coulter wrote a wonderful well-developed and believable story line. The main characters, Mac and Laura, have little to no personality, which makes it impossible to follow the romantic lead. The rest of the characters encounter each other with very poor dialogue... I can't think of one thing that will redeem the first 275 pages enough to make me read the last 75. This book must not have been written by Coulter herself, that's the only explanation I can think of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huntress review way off TARGET!!!!!!","review":"just a note to the reviewer from huntress--Savich and Sherlock were the main couple from the MAZE--not the Target--if we're to take your opinion seriously, perhaps you should get your novels and your characters straight--The Edge is still C.C.'s worst and left me grinding my teeth two weeks later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible writing","review":"I'm really sorry, but the charm and skill of this writer completely elude me. I barely made it through one chapter of THE EDGE before tossing the book aside. I swear I'm not just trying to be mean, but I've seen better and more competent writing in an elementary school notebook. To each his own, but I remain baffled by the continued success of this author. Don't not buy this book because I didn't like it. Maybe you'll have better luck with it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Little Disappointed...","review":"I just wanted to say that Catherine Coulter's The Maze is one of my all-time favorite books. I was very disappointed in this novel. The dialogue really got to me. It was a good plot, the characters weren't too deep, but entertaining. I hard a hard time getting through it, however, due to the extremely weak dialogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of loose end","review":"Coulter introduced a lot of characters, but failed to tie them together. There's the sheriff...what's her deal? Who was she really involved with and why? The old Chicago cop...he's just kind of thrown in there and written off at the end. The drug dealer...we never even met him! And, in typical Coulter fashion, she's got to throw in a little kinky sex stuff...but it made no sense to the plot.This book needed a strong editor, and a major rewrite. Just because you've got some bestsellers shouldn't let you get away with sloppy plots."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very odd","review":"The transition from the cottage to the jungle was rather jarring. The first half of the book was boring...the second half was strange but it was fun to romp through the jungle with Sherlock and Savich (I really didn't care about Laura and Ford). I got really sick of hearing about the bird and the cat. Overall, a really bad effort. On the plus side, the cover art is beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Saludos a otros Lectores","review":"A veces es obvio que el texto copiado por los criticos fué tomado palabra-por-palabra directamente de la informacción del publicista. MacDougall y Laura son moderadamente interesantes pero no como para emocionarse tanto. Su Oregon de Coulter suena más auténtico que su Costa Rica, la \\"jungla de lluvia\\" de fondo más bien asentandose al molde genérico que muchos escritores acaban por usar cuando tratan con esa región. Machetes hachando ansiosamente por las enredaderas, monos ruidos volando por los árboles en lo alto, por lo general todo mendionado vagamente. No se compara para nada con los sitios reconocibles de \\"A CAT'S FULL NINE,\\" tan gráfico y familiar como la palma de mi mano.Frecuentemente es cuestión de un escritor de romance que no puede entrarle totalmente al génerro espeluznante, y vice-versa, porque nunca pueden expresar todo al paquete con uno de éstos elementos excepto a costas del otro."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deeply Disappointed","review":"I can't believe how terrible this book was.

I'm glad didn't pay full price for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG DISAPPOINTMENT!! - WHAT HAPPENED??","review":"I am an big fan of Coulter, and I always buy anything she writes. I have followed this particular series with great enjoyment. WHAT IN THE WORLD HAPPENED WITH THIS ONE??? I did not like the writing in 1st person, you can't get into the head of the other characters. I also didn't really care for the male only perspective. Also, Dillon and Savich were great characters in their own story, but I really didn't feel this book did their characters justice. Real big disappoinment. Wish I had not spent the money. Will wait for the paperback next time...maybe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't believe Coulter wrote this book","review":"Have thoroughly enjoyed The Maze, The Cove and her other books, so was eagerly waiting for this book. What a disappointment. Am glad I borrowed it from the library instead of buying it. Kind of hokey and disjointed. The first person and from a man's point of view didn't bother me. Barbara Delinsky wrote a great book from a man's point of view. This book just bounced around and I had to keep going back to try to figure out what was going on. I thought the characters were kind of silly and was disappointed that she made Savich and Dillon so sappy! Will be willing to try another book again on the strength of her former books, but can not recomment this book in any way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, Bad, Bad","review":"I really hate to give a bad review since i enjoy reading but this was awful. The characters were so dull and not life-like. The dialog was so choppy and imature. The main character \\"Mac\\" was just unreal, nobody could survive what he did. The romance seens weren't even good, I mean \\"Mac\\" meets this girl \\"Laura\\" sleeps with her and now he wants to marry her! Get real! If their relationship was expanded on or even developed properly then it would make sense. And the FBI and DEA agents didn't even come close to sounded or acting like real agents. The book seemed to be written in a hurry. Hopefully on her next book she will take the time and do some research on her characters and story. If your looking for a good book to read, please don't waste your time on this one! You'll want your money back! No kidding!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to maintain interest.","review":"After reading The Cove, The Maze and The Target I looked forward with great anticipation in reading The Edge.

If you dislike first person narrative don't purchase this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE EDGE is a waste of time.","review":"Being a dedicated fan of Catherine Coulter I decided to ignore the numerous negatives reviews here and checked out THE EDGE at the library. One week later with fewer than one hundred pages read, I have to admit that I've been wasting my time. What a disappointment to Ms Coulter's loyal fans! After reading one third of this book I find that the story has barely progressed. The characters are so poorly developed that I have no desire to even see how the story ends. The dialogue is silly and not even believable for a man of Mac's description. Will the real Catherine Coulter please come forward and write something worthy of her time and ours?"},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORSE - SHE MUST BE USING A GHOST WRITER","review":"I have read every book by Coulter and this has to be the worse. I truly believe Ms. Coulter must be using a Ghost Writer because the quality of work has really gone done hill. The concept of the Edge was interesting and it really caught my attention but due to the poor writing skills, I lost interest very quickly. I use to be able to pick up a Coulter book and be done in a day or two. This one could not hold my attention and it took me forever to complete it. Sorry Catherine, but you better start either writing your own material or else get better ghost writers."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was work to finally finish","review":"This is certainly not her best work. I found myself interested in this story but I felt that this story was not very well developed. It had too many occurences and activities that did not make sense. I found that Mac's friends were stiff and unreal unlike they were in the novel where they originated. I think this story had a lot of potential but was so poorly written that I did not enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Someone please tell me Catherine didn't write this book!!!","review":"Listen, I know everyone has bad days, but Catherine, please tell me you did not write this one!! DIS-JOINTED, POORLY WRITTEN, does this apply?? YESSS!!! Sorry, but I really would like my money back, and I say this in all seriousness. \\"Mac\\" the hero, excuse me - but - since when does the hero in any book that's called romance, sleep around with just anyone who happens to be in heat?? Just because she's on drugs...... Get real, I hated this book, about the only thing going for it is the nice paper and print. I own many of Ms. Coulter's books and disappointed just doesn't say what I feel about this book... And what in the world happened to \\"Savich\\"?????

It was painful and incredibly disappointing--I'm praying her next novel is much, much better and that she takes her readers into consideration--the male point of view just doesn't cut it in first person for a romance novel--The Target worked with a male protagonist, but this one lost me by page 3. Please, oh, please Ms. Coulter, come back to us--where did you go?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I'm an avid reader of Ms. Coulter's, but this book was a big disappointment.

I have read many of her books now and I can't help but wonder if she had another person write this. The begining seems interesting, but it falls flat about the second chapter in. Mac is in the hospital, almost too weak to feed himself, but then he just sits up and leaves. But it gets better. In the rainforest, there are gun shot wounds and no food and the sexually aroused Mac, but miraculously, they endup at a Club Med. Now this may have all been okay, but it was written in first person from a man's point of veiw. Where did this come from? The love story and plot seemed to be thrown in at the end. The mystery was lacking, and it wasn't very suspenseful. If you want a good book by Coulter, try the first three or any of her historical romances. ...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rush job?","review":"This is the first book I have read by this author, and it will be the last. It would make a poor grade b movie of the week, absent the nudity and sex. Even the sex was bad! I got the feeling that maybe her publisher was bugging her to get this one out he door. The character development was very poor, the action was illogical and the premise was like something in a batman comic. Stark naked the heroes were able to escape from their captors twice in rapid succession using essentially the same predictable methods. How ridiculous! The period of time in the jungle was drivel.

He repeats Ian Fleming's classic description of Bond's features as containing a hint of cruelty. Bond's ordeal in this book brings the trait more fully out of him than in other novels.The first half of the book is particularly good in establishing tension. There are, perhaps, a few plot contrivances, but nothing especially blatant. I've read most of Gardner's Bond novels and would rate this very highly among them."},{"rating":"1","title":"BRITISH SNOOZER","review":"Maybe if I were British I could appreciate the style of John Gardner. He never ceases to completely bore me. I have read all the Ian Fleming's and though they are dated and quirky and sometimes corny I had a great time with them, so it's unfair to criticize the less dramatic British style of novel. But frankly I can't believe this franchise continued under Gardner. I made sure to give myself sufficient time between them, taking four years to read the first five novels. That's it. I quit. \\"For Special Services\\" is as close as I could get to be entertained, and \\"Role of Honor\\" the least enjoyable. After my struggle to get through 80 percent of \\"Nobody Lives Forever\\" I am selling off the other nine I own. Life is too short. For anyone agreeing with me I would absolutely recommend at least the first three Raymond Benson 007 books. Read them in order. Each one gets better. After a seven year absence I'm ready to start these again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great adventure for any James Bond fan!","review":"I HAVE SEEN EVERY JAMES BOND MOVIE THERE IS TO SEE.

I found the book interesting and altho it was dated a bit, it was entertaining. It was also fascinating in how it shed some light on Bond's personality.This one was frankly boring from the first part and the femalehe picks up just too true to the boring babes of past films includingher name. What really finally finished me off was the hostage scenario.Bond would need a hostage????The only thing more ridiculous than that is he not only takes her along, but he picks up her girlfriend?????HUH???When that happened I dropped the book back in the library slot, along with three others I had planned to read.I just hope Bond 22 is not based on something from Gardner."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOOOOVE THIS!!!!","review":"I love this Robathol Oil!

If you are going to visit Venice, this is almost as good as a guidebook to give you the feel of the place. I am not the only Helen MacInnes fan to spend hours tracing the locations of her stories.

It has helped me and others to see that marriage is not just about being happy, but choosing to love someone and stay committed even in the hard times. Many of us believe that a person is supposed to make us happy. Happiness is a CHOICE. You choose to be happy.

This book was certainly eye opening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sacred Marriage Book review","review":"Gary Thomas gets it right every time.

That's fascinating right now, but in 10 years this doc might be utterly forgotten. That's because a political career is not a character. Or at least it wasn't in this doc.Enron did a much better job of tracking the rising hubris and avarice of characters and weaving a compelling story from that.This doc did do a good job of noting the extent to which politics is both petty and owned by big business - without unduly underscoring it or hitting the audience over the head with it.Anyway, it's a letdown after expecting another Enron, but it's still better than 95%+ of the docs out there.

And then he lied to his fans about still being on Interscope, the only reason he finally came out and said he was on Geffon, was because by that time, it had already been confirmed so he would have just made himself look even more stupid to keep on lying.

Dont by this piece of garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Westcoast Classic","review":"I grew up listening to NWA, Ice Cube, and Ice T. This album took me back to the era in hip hop where the West Coast ruled the game. Game has put togeather a great album from front to back. There is no stand out pop single every track is quality gangsta rap. My favorite track is California Vacation where Xzibit just kills it, his verse on that song is great. This is an album to own since every track is hot, and it has a high replay value. My only complaint is Game's constant name dropping. This is a small problem I have with the album, I still give it a 5 star rating and highly recommend this album to any hip hop fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic attempt to revive a failed career","review":"The Doctor's Advocate? How can he be the Doctor's Advocate when the doctor isn't even on his album. Game was a one hit wonder for 2005 just like Mike Jones was. He's nothing now, the biggest mistake he made was turning on G-Unit and look where he is now. He went gold in his first week on his first album but that was only because he had the support of Dre and 50. Now without them, he's simply another trend that is long forgotten and replaced by the next new rapper. This album is just plain terrible. The beats are ok but Game's annoying name dropping and bad lyrics ruin it. You want a true west coast album? Buy Snoop's new album and leave this junk on the shelf because it's one of the year's worst albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Doctor's Mimic","review":"Right off the bat how do you name your album after someone who is not apart of it. But then again he couldn't name it anything else cause Dr. Dre is all he talks about and he pretty much just uses Dre's flow. I had to go back and listen the The Documentry to remember what what Game really sounds like. This man's rhyme book pretty much consist of Dr. Dre, West Coast, G Unit and 64 Impalas. He does so much name droppin it sounds like his reading out of a phonebook. this album is mediocre, it comes no where near the The Documentry. Big dissappoinment, not worth half the hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"Why does Game have to use almost the same exact cd cover as his other trash ablum? Can't a rich guy like him even come up with a new ablum? Game is soft and his raps are not reality like all G-unit lyrics are.

I would not reccomend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Game trys way too hard","review":"if Game had have came out with something different than he would have been better suited. basically he followed a blue-print. this Album&Album cover are basically part 2 of his Debut.

Too Short,Ice Cube,DJ Quik,Dr.Dre,Snoop,etc... West Coast Legends,Game ain't nowhere near that point. Game can mimick&Name Drop Dr.Dre all he wants but he has to learn to craft a Song&knock it out under his Own Vision. that is what Seperates Contenders from Pretenders."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay on the west coast!","review":"This CD compared to his last is a JOKE! take that \\"cali\\" music back, if that is what that was! \\" Yeah, I copped your CD, and now I break trees up on it!\\" hahaha if your a hip hop fan, I dont even need to say it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"4 & 1/2 stars. The Game loses his training wheels.","review":"To be the greatest you must study the greatest and Dr. Dre should be very proud of his Compton brother. This is a West Coast gem that surpasses his previous effort. He's a better lyricist and I can see that this brother has a true love for the music.

The people giving this 5 stars must be people he know. I wish i could have just found the music only. This is not a west coast classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Below All Expecations","review":"Everyone was extremely hyped about Doctor's Advocate. I mean after getting all of Game's mixtapes and promos and what not, we were really expected alot. What we got was a poorly produced, imature album that sounded like it came out of someone's garage. I mean there are 2 decent songs on the album, and they become old after the first day. It was just so dissapointing. Another issue here is the lyrical departure from the Documentary. Game's rhymes are border-line wack when compared to the verbal wizardry that you hear on The Documentary. The one thing this album showed is that 50 & Dre had everything to do with the success of Game's first album, and without them Game will never get close to the success he attained when he was a member of G-Unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest Review","review":"There is only one way to really judge this album. Forget about all the beef with 50, Dr Dre, and other drama he has been in. If you listen to it with a clear head, then you will find that this is a good CD. I think song for song, this CD is just as good as his 1st if not better. If Game would stop being an NWA cheerleader and stop trying to address EVERY negative comment ever spoken about him, then he will be one of the top 5 MC's in hip hop. This is without a doubt one of the better CD's I've heard this year. I say enjoy the music and entertainment and let these guys handle their beefs on their own."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a difference","review":"Wow, this was a huge let down for me.

Every song he name drops Dres name to a degree that is nausaitating. I've seen people say well its only Games style to name drop, thats not a style thats a gimmick. With that arguement you can say well its only Chingys style to be wack as hell. Game is a gimmick, yes the production is top notch, but the lyrics almost make this album unlistenable.

Actually, he just trys to rap like Dre (who is a sick producer but so-so rapper) and lacks much if any individuality in his flow. He keeps sweatin' Dre and Aftermath so much he sounds like a groupie. He has beats from Just Blaze, Will.I.Am, Kanye West, Scott Storch who all manage to create lame sounding Death Row style throwaway beats. Game definitely dug through the discount bins of the hot producers to get their names on his album. The song with Kanye bites an old Pac classic, which is decent and keeps this from only getting one star."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Game Keeps On Giving Real Hiphop","review":"Another great album, better than the Documentary.The Games number one after 2pac and right beside Lil Wayne."},{"rating":"2","title":"Game does it again!!!","review":"This album is bangin' despite no Dre or 50 cent. The Game went and got some hot producers to compliment his \\"ride da beat\\" rhymes. This dude took all the bulls**t from his life and smeared it all on this cd. You can really feel where he is coming from. Different topics, not to many guest, tight tracks, and rhymes!!!!This album is a 4.25 or so for me. Mos def go cop this!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Complete Mess","review":"Without Dre's quarterbacking behind the scenes, Game's album lacks direction. Many of the early tracks end up being glorified freestyles that tell no story, have no direction and are missing concepts ending up sounding like the same rhymes over different beats. And although Dre's presence is missing, his name is not. Game makes mention of Dre on nearly ever track, almost obsessively. Game does manage to put together a fairly decent album with production help from Storch, Will I Am, Kanye West and Just Blaze and caps the album with a soulful climax featuring Nas reminiscing on hip-hop's fallen soldiers and current heavyweights and a much-needed squashing of the beef between him-self and 50. The Doctor's Advocate is not worth half the hype that was made for it but is an okay listen. Game still has potential but without Dre mentoring him it's a wrap. Hopefully Dre will hear this album and accept hip-hop's prodigal son back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware","review":"Whether or not Game really did the thuggish things about which he crows on this CD, I revile his glorification of the low life.Kids don't need more negative stereotypes; or to hear African Americans debasing themselves and their women and devaluing human life.And as for the explicit language, while I have zero sympathy for Don Imus, examples like those set in this CD unfortunately gave him, other \\"shock jock\\" D.J.s, and the public, the mistaken notion that derogatory terms are nowadays okay.I find nothing artistic, or remotely positive in these cuts--or others like them. Yuck doesn't even come close to describing how awful this is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't hate the game","review":"With the Game's second album he, as in the first ablum, carries his own wait. His lyrical ability has grown, while staying the same. The production is a great relationship with East and West. Moreover, the strengh's of the record are One Blood, Let's ride, Dr. Advocate, and Why you haten on the game. However, the game seems to be holding back and not allowing his strength to come forth. He mentions himself along the greats like Pac, Big, Jay, and Nas, but those guys could make a hit that crossed over into pop clubs. The Game has that same ability I can hear it in his words, but just like those greats it took their third albums to come out before that crossover happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a fake!","review":"What a shame!

As everyone else has said, it's a long book, and it's not flashy, but its characters are enigmatic and real, and after you have read it you wish there was more. I suppose that it does in fact earn the praise given on its back cover--at least as far as my limited reading of the modern Japanese classics would allow me to judge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thomas Mann meets Jane Austen","review":"As in \\"Buddenbrooks,\\" we are introduced to a bourgeois family in decline, and through them we enter deeply into their society, so different from our own--and both societies, Germany in the late 19th century and Japan just before World War II, are about to undergo tremendous changes. And as in Jane Austen, the plot is propelled by the search for a husband, in this case for the third Makioka sister. This book is absolutely enthralling. It's long, but the pages fly by."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, evocative tale of pre-World War II Japan","review":"This has to be considered Tanizaki's masterpiece. It is a beautifully written, deliciously observed tale of the decline of a privileged upper middle class Osaka family, told through the lives of four sisters. I have read this book three times and learn someting new each time. It is a thoroughly modern story with elusive and ghostly antecedents. Although the tale takes place only 60 years ago, on the eve of pre-war Japan, it describes a world now vanished. Tanizaki's writing is fluid and clear. His description of Kyoto during cherry blossom viewing makes me sorry I've never been there at that season. The sublety Tanizaki brings to the emotions and motives of each of the persons attending Yukiko's many miais is amazing. Unfortunately, the film of about a decade or so ago doesn't do the book justice. Thank you, Tanizaki-san, for giving us the Makioka Sisters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully descriptive but schizophrenic translation","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and echo California and Hawaii's descriptions. There really is no concrete action in the book--maybe you need to be a Japanphile to appreciate the wonderfully descriptive detail of Meiji era Kyoto/Osaka. One stumbling point: I found the translation to be most inadecuate as there are many grammatical mistakes and even sentences which are incomplete. Perhaps Alfred Birnbaum could redo it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great book - horrible publication","review":"This is a fantastic book - just wish I had bought a paper copy rather than the kindle version. This book is riddled with spelling and punctuation errors on just about every page. I can't believe that the publishes ever had anyone proof-read it (which I would happily do for the refund of my purchase price!). It wasn't an inexpensive Ebook either at $9.99. My favorite error was the heading on the contents page that suggests \\"Other books by John Grisham\\" for the reader.Highly recommend the book; subtle, delicately nuanced writing; well developed, complex characters; and a lyrical and engaging plot - just buy the hard copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"much better","review":"This is the third novel I've read of Tanizaki's and it was definitely a huge triumph over the last one I read (title to remain unnamed). Though I thought that this book could've been shorter, 500+ pages as opposed to 250 or less(?), it was all in all a good storyline. Being of Japanese descent, this novel makes me appreciate the so found \\"freedoms\\" that we have today in contrast to the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"A difference of opinion...","review":"After reading the book..or rather, reading what I could of it, I simply can't agree with what everyone's been saying. I found it tedious, and horribly boring. The author failed to make me interested in ANY of the characters, let alone care about what happened to any of them. The pace is horrendously slow, painfuly descriptive, and at times confusing about who is who. There is practically NO dialogue, and character development is entirely narrative if there is any. All the reviews I've seen so far just seem to be shallow regurgetations of people who were told the book was SUPPOSED to be good. It boggles my mind how \\"The Makioka Sisters\\" won ANY awards at all. It is more of a rambaling history of every little thing that happens to a family who you really get no attatchment to at all, wether the details are relevant or not. If you insist on reading this book, check it out from the library, and save yourself some money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite possibly the worst book I've ever read","review":"I was forced to read this at school.

This book is a huge disappointment as the illustrations are unattrative, the story is silly and it teaches nothing. The back cover states it is a \\"space spoof.\\" I wish I had known that before I bought it. Nowhere in any reviews was that made clear. Additionally, my copy had 8 pages missing text.

Sadly, it also appears to be out of print and you can only find it used. It would be nice to see a reprint of the book along with a CD of the songs so you can play along. (The songs in here are old southern mountain songs which many will find obscure and a CD would be VERY helpful.) Aside from that, the book covers a wide range of playing skills from simple to more advanced.

Don't get me wrong, the graphics, planes, etc on FS2K are out of this world, but you need a system capable of running the Space Shuttle to run the thing.

I mean, betting patterns and the actions players should take are so different depending on if a game is limit or pot-limit, or no-limit. If anything the book seems more catered toward limit play (which is far less popular), but the fact that there was never a clear distinction at any time, really annoyed me. This book is way overrated, everyone said for me to read it, but I'm sure there's better Texas Hold 'Em books out there.

I thought the women in this book were as goofy as all get-out, as well as an embarrassment to the female gender. And I never cared much for that. She had all the couples climbing into bed together too soon. The plot surrounding the Three Fates was a great idea, but the prose failed to follow through. I still think NR's first books were some of her best, and I still believe she's one of the greatest romance writers of all times. I'm just not big on this book. I've read much better with NR's name on the cover."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Nora Roberts winner with an Irish flavour","review":"Nora Roberts has drawn again on her love of Ireland to depict this novel of intrigue, romance and humour.It tells the story of the Three Fates - small statues - and one family's determination to re-unite the set against the odds. Along the way, each one of the clan meets their match and towards the end are all united as a group against the protaganist who also wants the Fates. This character was a little weak in comparison to previous villains in Ms.Roberts books but this did'nt upset my overall enjoyment.There were great moments of humor and I loved the characters of Tia and how she overcomes her hypochondria, loud, brash Cleo and gentle,strong Rebecca. The three guys Malachi, Gideon and Jack were great too!!Although the characters were not as finely drawn as in previous novels - the downside to having three couples/relationships in one book - I'd still recommend it as a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's happening to Nora?","review":"I have to say that when I first saw this book on shelves, I hesitated to buy it.

It was drawn out, totally boring and could've been wrapped up in less than one-hundred pages. The characters were unlovable, the plot was horrific and I couldn't even get halfway through it. It aws the first Nora Roberts book that I remember not finishing. Save your money people, Nora has totally lost the talent that pennned such books as Hidden Riches, Montana Sky and Honest Illusions. Maybe all the fame has gone to her head and she doesn't think her fans are deserving of a well-thought out book. T ime to look for a new author which is heartbreaking because Nora has been mine for almost a decade. However, I can't continue to shell out money for books that make Nora richer and leave me unfulfilled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the work","review":"I could not get through this book which for me is very disappointing. I am an avid Nora Roberts fan. To me this book started okay but was too boring to keep going. It is rare that I will stop reading a book before the end. My time is valuable and I felt it was being wasted . I hope others do not judge Nora Roberts based on this book.My favorites of hers are:The Three Sisters Island trilogyThe Irish TrilogyThe Donovan LegacyMidnight Bayou"},{"rating":"2","title":"THREE FATES","review":"I am a Nora Roberts fan, but this was one of the best. I loved the unique and witty characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining enough","review":"I agree with many of the other reviewers here (e.g. the characters make it into bed with one another before the plot starts rolling, Cleo's character can be less pushy, dialogue can be confusing at times when all six characters are talking all at once, etc.), but I am still giving the book four stars, as opposed to three and under, because Three Fates was definitely a good read, if not a perfect one. The plot definitely takes some creative twists and turns, and Roberts has made an obvious move away from her usual only-revealing-the-bad-guy-until-the-end model, which actually enhances the plot and the flow of the story. The suspense is effectively interwoven with heartwarming romance, so even though the book does not show Roberts at her best, the entertainment value is still up there."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing addition to Nora's body of work","review":"Three Fates had the capability to be a fine book, however it reads as a jagged outline. The characters do not have the usual full development that I expect from a book by Nora Roberts. The pacing & plotting are out of step and the usual depth of imagery is missing. The potential is there, however I would call this book a first draft manuscript & ask the editor for the revisions to smooth out the storyline. I will continue to buy Nora's books but I have to say that this particular book was born to soon. It misses the mark for fully realized characters & easy transitions from place to place. I was never able to be swept into the story fully, a trait I have come to expect from a novel by Nora."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok, kind of boring","review":"I found this book kind of boring and basically skimmed the end, or didn't even finish it- i'm not sure. the three couples fit perfectly together and maybe it's because i'm used to reading books with one couple, but i felt the inclusion of three especially made the book drag. I've read better Nora Roberts books."},{"rating":"1","title":"This cannot be Nora Roberts","review":"Okay, let's put it this way. I am a big big fan of Nora's, but this was just awful. To many characters, the book jumped all over the place, boring and way to long to say the very least. I kept reading it because after all it is Nora Roberts, it just had to get better, but it didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Complicated","review":"I stop reading about 1/2 way through the book. I believe this is a good read for those who like complex plots,numerous characters,many angles to the plot going on at once,etc. Call me \\"simple minded\\" but I could not keep up with what was going on. Maybe if I had read the book in longer sittings, I may have been able to follow the story better. I have a tendency to read in short sittings, gathering just a small amount of information at the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nora needs a sabbatical","review":"I used to buy a new Roberts without even looking except to make sure it was not a rerelease. No more. The plots of her books may vary but she has the same characters in them all. The heroes have a rather boring sameness. And enough of this cloying cutesy Irishness. As for the plot of this book, I don't agree that it's ok to steal from someone in the name of revenge and because they murder people. My sense of ethics was offended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you as disapointed as I am>","review":"Well my future wife was very excited when she found this book. The listing says UNABRIDGED. To our surprise when it comes in the mail after the money has already been transfered it's and abridged version with no information on how to return the product to the people.This is the first time Amazon has ever disappointed me.Change the listing!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I just couldn't get into it","review":"I really wanted to enjoy this book. Having read so many other Nora Roberts (especially the trilogies) I had hoped that the intertwining characters would give the same pleasure. It just didn't work for me. It was slow to get started and the characters just didn't develop for me. Not one of her best works.The foundations of the characters were good, strong heroines, interesting me but it didn't go any deeper with them so you never felt the urgency to read more about them.Started - didn't finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hurrah!! -- more than one plot line without a trilogy!","review":"As an avid fan of Nora Roberts, I was delighted to see the story of the Three Fates start and end within the pages of one book. It must have been tempting to split the story line into three lucrative and separate entities, but instead the reader is treated to real interaction between each pair of lovers. In fact, this interaction between all the players is one of the strengths of this book.Ms. Roberts has once again given us engaging characters. Her depiction of Cleo, especially, was beautifully drawn. The reader is allowed to see the entire woman, not just the hot stripper. The Irish contingent is Nora Roberts at her best -- lovable, laughable, and a family truly united. Her villian, Anita, is almost a cardboard cut-out of evel personified, and does not really have an impact on the story line, other than to act as a catalyst for the other characters.An exceptionally enjoyable read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't Put It Down!","review":"This is Nora Roberts at her best. Vivid descriptions, rich characters, intrigue. She absorbs you into the story. Great for a rainy afternoon! A friend who loves Nora Roberts turned me onto an author who may be the male Nora Roberts - Kirk Martin, who wrote Shade of the Maple. Wow! Same richly drawn characters, vivid descriptions and a powerful story that will stay with you. Thanks for another great one, Nora!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Information","review":"The book held no substantive information on the schools or programs.

I cannot add anything that hasn't already been said about this amazing film.I understand the frustration of not getting the toy but, I'm sure that Disney has done their homework. This film - geared toward the young (as mentioned by Miyazake in one of the reviews) - will sell to families.Especially now, those families - most likely - aren't upgrading to Blu-Ray and are sticking with their old DVD players until times get better. Me? Single and unemployed. For as much as I want the Blu-Ray/DVD combo pack to plan for the future, I will stick with the DVD until I have a good job under my belt and a few credit cards paid off.I was at a Goodwill in Prescott, Arizona in September and spoke with a Mother that uses the VCR tapes donated as her library for her young daughter's viewing. As a gauge, Walmart doesn't even stock VCR's anymore.So - young son or daughter and a regular DVD player? That's the market for the toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Foreign Purchases","review":"I purchased the DVD video Ponyo and when I tried to play it I found that it is not \\"region compatible.\\" Apparently when a DVD is purchased from another country (I purchased it through Amazon) there are compatibility issues and will not play on USA players. I didn't realize that it was being shipped from England."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird","review":"Ponyo is very weird and sorta creepy.Because1)Ponyo father looked like a woman , but still a man at the same time( me and my brother watched this movie together and we was debating if he was a man or woman).2)The fate of the whole world depends on a five year old boy loving a fish girl,are you kidding me?3)Five year olds loving each other, personally i think its kinda wrong , because are they too young to know what love is or not.4)The boy's mom is okay with this?So Ponyo was plain weird."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not well done","review":"Poorly written and not altogether easy to follow.

It seems to me that Disney is selling people special fetures in hi def and then the movie on a regular dvd. Is this correct?? If so, it seems underhanded."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Why No Ponyo Plush for Blu-Ray","review":"Ponyo is not a great and perfect film by any means. I love Miyazaki's works but this one is not quite on target. But I still will buy it because it does have charming Miyazaki touches, and the characters are drawn from faces we love from Totoro and all of Miyazaki's films. What I find especially objectionable is Disney's marketing ploy: the Ponyo plush looks cute, but why is it only available with the DVD, and not the blu-ray? I contacted Disney and got the sorry but plush only with the DVD...which tells me nothing new. I am willing to buy into the combo pack where you get both the DVD and Blu-ray together,but how much more sweeter would it be to have that Ponyo plush included?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Cute","review":"The story line is a little extreme but is a typical Miyazaki fantacy. I like this one better than Totoro."},{"rating":"2","title":"The evolution of Hayao Miyazaki's creativity","review":"You will discover through this Ponyo adventures, the color, the magic and the developed creativity of Hayao Miyazaki, who always wants to show us how beautiful is Japan and its culture and its people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great Animation","review":"This is a great Full Length Animation by Studio Ghibli. The story is about true love and how it can evolve in any shape, any size, and any age. As always Studio Ghibli has made a movie we can all enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ponyo","review":"My grandson already loved the movie and wanted to watch it almost daily. He was delighted with the Ponyo doll and its quality has held up to much loving by an active toddler."},{"rating":"1","title":"All-Star Cast?","review":"I am a huge fan of all things Ghibli. I do not like this. Disney ruined this film. The bonus-jonas and Cyrus hand-me-down cheapened the whimsical and mystical qualities of this film. The theme song, alone, should have been a dead giveaway. An auto-tuned fanservice? Really, Disney? What part of a small demigod's quest to be united with a small boy--and ham--told you that you should make an auto-tuned pop song? Ridiculous. This film could have been good, or at least less campy. If the English scriptwriters hadn't botched the plot, and if the voice-casters were less interested in loading a DVD BLURAY case up with familiar (and overrated, overdramatized) disney pop star names, and were more invested in conveying the magic of studio ghibli--a formula and institution which has proven itself true over the years--then I would be rating this higher, instead of posting what I'm sure will be a very ill-received review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Of course Disney ruined it.","review":"First, I am more than a little shocked that the story, set in Japan, with Japanese characters look...Caucasian. Which continues to baffle me, except that Disney got a hold of a good story, and didn't think Americans might like to see people who don't look like them. Next gripe? Mom and Dad using their child as a go-between; Mom using her child to comfort HER; Mom getting drunk and passing out; Mom's driving...even my two year old who knows not much about cars started yelling \\"UH OH!!\\" and pointing.It's a kid's movie, so the story is a bit light weight. This might bother me more if the other grievances weren't so many."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mommy, this sushi tastes funny!","review":"HAM!!! Studio Ghibli does it again! They've coupled fantastic, mind-bending art to a bizarre, possibly LSD trip-inspired, story. The dialogue in the film is awkward, the characters are mentally unbalanced, and the brief discussion on babies and breast feeding after the big flood scene is, well, weird! I especially don't buy the scene where the two main super cute little kid characters recite from memory the scientific names of ancient sea creatures with the rapidity one would only expect from a seasoned paleoichthyologist. If you are determined to watch Ponyo, watch it for the art.I hope Studio Ghibli finds out what chemicals are affecting their script writers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for 7 year olds","review":"This movie was pretty scary, my daughter did not want to finish it, (she is seven), and I agreed with her.

The tale itself is warm but heart wrenching, the characters are endearing and the portrayal exquisite.If you have a little girl (aged 7 or 8) to buy for, she will love this movie. The reason I say 7 or 8 is that there is a question about the survival of a Father at one point in the movie which may be upsetting to a younger audience."},{"rating":"2","title":"In regards to some negative reviews...","review":"Hayao Miyazaki loves and respects children; he knows them well and gives them far more credit than many of you seem to. Bambi's mother being burned to death frightened the heck out of me as a kid, not to mention all of the other \\"acceptable\\" Disney films where characters meet violent ends, but I apparently survived this childhood trauma and matured into a healthy adult. Parents, your children are NOT as delicate as you want to believe they are. While not quite as compelling as Princess Mononke in my opinion, Ponyo is a beautiful movie that the whole family should enjoy together. And here's a spoiler, both parents live!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ponyo - just a masterpiece","review":"I will be short and simple, Ponyo indeed is a masterpiece.The movie have no special computer effects, but the art is amazing.Miyazaki is always superb, the master gets the history and makes The Art.I came to perceive that does not matter if the art have computer effects or not,some masters make superb art with computer effects, some make art with hisown bare hands (or pencils to be more exact).The entire work have something that surpass many other animation movies.In my opinion Ponyo are not the best animation movie from Miyazaki, andhis animation is not above the best from Japanese Anime, but for surei think the animation movies from the east are far better from theones made in the west."},{"rating":"2","title":"My 3 year old loves it","review":"She's got a box full of DVD movies and I was trying to expand her horizons beyond the typical Disney movie (who distributes this movie by the way.) She's usually good for about 40% to 60% of any movie before she starts finding something else to do because she's bored. She watches this movie from beginning to end all the way through the credits and the next day does the same thing. She can't get enough. It's very sweet and cute and the art work is really amazing. I'm not much of an Anime fan but this one is a good one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I am a fan of Miyazaki's films and was unhappy with this recent release. Yes, it's for a younger age group, but kids are pretty sharp and I felt that the movie was dumbed down unnecessarily. The visuals are fantastic, but the story plods along, and after a while I was just waiting for it to be over. I never felt any connection to the characters and just plain didn't care what happened to them, which to me means the movie missed its mark. Also, some things happened that seemed totally nonsensical--for example, the mother drives with her son through flooding streets and a dangerous storm rather than follow the official's advice to evacuate. Why put your son in danger like that? Other things happened and I felt that there was no explanation given for them, leaving the story feeling choppy. I wouldn't bother to watch this movie; I felt that it skated on the reputation of an admired artist and didn't deserve the credit it received."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome!","review":"we decided to watch this movie because we have enjoyed totoro and other japanese animations in the past. this movie was great-- beautifully illustrated and compelling story. my 5 yo as well as i just loved this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ponyo","review":"My 3 children absolutely LOVE this movie.

This is a short album from what I can recall (a little over 30 minutes). Also, if you're waiting to hear a drum solo, don't hold your breath. Buddy sticks close to the charts on this one. \\"Birdland\\" and \\"Fiesta\\" are pretty good tunes. Fun charts to listen to Buddy's playful bigband interpretation of what Zawinul and Corea were doing at that time. However, \\"Cape Verdian Blues\\" is one of the swingingest tunes I've ever heard.

The order of commands is almost alphabetical but not quite exactly so. There are grammatical mistakes. The cover page proudly lampoons that it is covers through version 8.2 while the introduction meekly says that it was not tested on 8.2.

After failing to excite the public about vegetable cereal, Charlie and Phil are fired from their ad jobs. That means no more expensive day care for their sons at the exclusive Chapman Academy, run by the harsh taskmistress Miss Gwyneth Harridan. While floundering aimlessly in search of employment and tending to his four-year-old son Ben during the day while his wife Kim is at work, Charlie has an idea. If he and Phil can handle taking care of two kids, how much harder can it be to supervise ten? Much harder than they ever imagined. Every kid is different and every one is a hilarious challenge, whether they're suffering from sugar rush, fantasizing about being super heroes, or just demolishing everything in sight, Charlie and Phil soon realize they are in over their heads. Way over their heads. I thought this movie was really funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"daddy day care review","review":"This movie was in good condition and plays well.

DADDY DAY CARE is one of those beating the odds movies that delivers everything you expect it to, and that's fine. The movie had me laughing and the interaction between the kids and adults was funny. Eddie Murphy is a little more subdued than usual, and Jeff Garlin is good as his friend and partner. Steve Zahn is great as Marvin, the Star Trek geek who has a winning way with the kids; and Anjelica Huston--well, this talented Oscar winner proves she can do pretty much anything and be fun to watch. Regina King (Ray) is pretty much wasted in the role of Eddie's wife, but the script doesn't give her much to do.

I don't know about you, but I've gotten kind of sick of seeing Eddie Murphy playing the same character over and over again... But, I was pleasantly surprised when even a half hour into the movie, I was laughing and no longer dreading the rest. Eddie Murphy is funny and, although it is a regular old comedy, his acting has somehow improved. The boy that plays Murphy's son is hilarious! Some kind of comical-kid-genius. The story is about 2 guys who lose their jobs in advertising, and a friend, who start a day care out of their homes (well, actually just Eddie Murphy's home)The kids will love the silliness and the jokes of the other kids, and the adults will like the heartwarming story about a father finally getting to know his son and the funny jokes. I recommend watching it with the whole family!"},{"rating":"2","title":"First Class family entertainment","review":"See this with the whole family.

I work with high school special needs students and we decided to take them to the movie on a field trip. Pretty much, as far as I'm concerned, the funny parts were shown in the previews. The kids were cute, the concept was kinda funny and the only stand out, in my opinion, was Angelica Houston, as the evil competitor out to destroy the upstart day care. Steve Zahn, who I think is very funny, was wasted and the all-to-abundant burping and farting jokes only go so far. Its a harmless film you can take your kids to see and they'll laugh at some of the low brow humor. But don't expect to be entertained yourself. Don't waste your time with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Huge Letdown","review":"I really thought that this was going to be a funny film judging from the previews. But, sadly the trailers contain the funniest parts of Daddy Day Care. Eddie Murphy sleepwalks through this mess, cracking an occasional joke here or there but this is by no means vintage Murphy. The character development is slim to none and we hardly get to know lest care about any of the children or adults involved in the film. Eddie Murphy must blindly throw darts at scripts and take roles because he could not have read this thing and actually been excited about it. Daddy Day Care is a great premise ruined by a horrible script and lack of enthusiasm by it's main players. Not Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eddie hits a new low.","review":"To be honest I still had some respect left for Eddie Murphy before this. He just seemed to have lost his way in the 21st century. But nothing will ever make forgive this. He's just went all 'kiddie' in recent years. And it's sick.In the 80's Murphy gave us strong African-American characters like Reggie Hammond, Billy Ray Valentine, Axel Foley and Prince Akeem. But that was a long time ago. And it's a shame to see him trade a hard edge for movies like this.It's so sugary it is literally sickening. It's about as subtle as a brick in the face too. Annoying kids who are obviously reading phonetically off oversized cue-cards held off camera, David Newman's worse than generic 'family movie' score, clockwork predictability and toilet humor (how many more family movies are going to milk fart sounds for all their worth?) are all you can expect from this film.Staring directly into the sun is not as painful on the eyes as this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daddy Day Care","review":"This movie was pretty good...it was hilarious!!!!!!!!!!

Don't get me worng, it is. But the daddies might snooze off during it. When a father gets fired from his job, he starts a day care center for kids. Eddie Murphy doesn't look happy doing this little kiddy-joke comedy, but his acting is still grade-A. All the good jokes are given away on the commercial. The movie still ain't bad, for a kid flick. Each child in the movie you get to know better and better and every character as his/her own funny joke. The movie keeps kids awake, but age 20 and up might find it boring. Daddy Day Care is 90 minutes, just enough to cram all the jokes and punchlines into. The ending is happy, the characters are happy and the movie itself seems happy. Bottom Line: There's better movies out there, but if the latest box-office hit is sold out, Daddy Day Care is the way to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Remember a Day When Movies Were ususlly GOOD","review":"Get a job and you \\"Actors\\" need to get a new job too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gross!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This movie was horrible.

In one scene where the kids are running amok, he joins in the fun and runs all over the house. He practices his fake (not sure if it was real) klingon words. He also plays the games included in the DVD edition and they don't require a computer. The DVD edition is not for sale here. We rented it from Netflix and we won't be returning it until we buy it.

You get realistic stories about real kids and real kid's problems. Toss in quirky Canadian-isms and you've got yourself a great little show. I bought it for the nostalgia, but i'm sure today's kids would benefit from a dose of teen drama where the kids talk like kids and act like kids and look like kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST SHOW EVER!","review":"Degrassi is pure genious! All the episodes are fantastic and realistic. I just love this series. I love all the characters. I'm so glad we can still see our origional Degrassi cast on DTNG.

The ending was SO obvious that we both hoped we would be surprised by a twist at the end but sadly it panned out exactly as we feared. A superb example of sheer mediocrity. We did not hate the movie we just were disappointed with it. We rented it from redbox so did not waste too much money but wanted to review to save you losing your money on it by buying it on DVD. Wait until it is released on TV and when this happens if you have nothing else to do then maybe consider reading a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"awful!","review":"I can't begin to tell you how bad this movie is! It's like a bad student film. Dialogue, characterization, sound, etc -- so bad. How could this film have won any kind of award?? The music -- gosh, don't get me started...it sounds like that royalty-free music that you can use to make home videos. The dialogue, sparse, mumbled by the actors--half the time I couldn't hear what they were saying, and what they did say did nothing to advance the plot or give insight to character. UGH!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really? We needed to be told this?","review":"I was given this book as a gift and.... REALLY?!The people that could even possibly gain insight from this overwritten and arrogant book would probably be the parents out there who would never read a parenting book to begin with. And knowing what I do about this \\"accomplished journalist\\" and her family makes this book laughable at best.Don't waste your time. If you are really interested at being a better parent then try any other book than this one. Better yet; try taking some advice from your mother, grandmother, aunt, etc. They're much better experts than this young woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same info in book as Ms. Hart's weekly columns","review":"I was disapointed to discover that this book covers the same information (at some times nearly word for word) as Ms. Hart's weekly column. However, the book's new material is entertaining and I agree with some of book's concepts regarding setting limits and limiting choices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unneccesary rancor & circular logic","review":"It seems that she is saying that:1) Kids today are screwed up because their parents get advice from experts.2) Parents should stop listening to advice from those experts and, instead, follow her advice.My own personal opinion is that every kid needs a responsible, involved parent who takes the time to understand them & discover what it takes to teach them what they need to know to become responsible adults themselves and to lead a good life.If the advice that the author has regarding parenting works for you to teach your kids what they need to know to be responsible adults, then follow it (or use the parts that work for you & your family). I think that the parenting advice in here could have been presented without putting down other parenting methods that most certainly do work for other parents and families."},{"rating":"1","title":"conservative psychobabble","review":"I'm so sick of conservative bashing of liberals. First off, there's no evidence whatsoever that pushover parents are liberals, or that they became pushovers from listening to liberal parenting guides. Parents who feel overwhelmed by parenting have been around since well before the liberal/conservative divide.So yes: parents need to understand that kids need boundaries, they need to know the parent is in charge, etc. etc. Unfortunately, the only parents who really understand what this means already know it. And those who don't already know it can hear and think they understand -- but they don't really.In any case, knowing it and understanding it have NOTHING to do with political persuasion. And I'm sick unto death from hearing whiney conservatives go on as if it did.And to mention, in support of her thesis, that certain child therapists have pointed out Hitler was spanked??!! Please. What therapist premises anything on that?

Excellent price online, half the price of local stores, will buy again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works just fine","review":"I only wish the label maker itself had better directions on how to install and set up for the various widths of tape available. But that is no fault of the replacement tape itself. The lengthwise split in the backing makes removal of the backing VERY easy. Additionally, it allows the user to stick the label on across only one half of the label first to make sure it's straight and get out any bubbles or creases - then remove the other half of the backing to smooth the label on the rest of the way. Very good design."},{"rating":"2","title":"It does what labeling tape is supposed to do.","review":"What can you say about labeling tape. It fits my Dymo labeler (of course) and makes labels.

But once I listened to it, I realized just how awesome Christian music can be. Now it's practically all that I ever listen to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even Us Oldsters Like It","review":"From all I've gathered, the Newsboys' music seems geared heavily towards persons under the age of 25; that's not a criticism but an observation. At the risk of sounding old, there have been times I've heard music characterized this way and felt it too \\"juvenile\\" for me. But this is not the case with this CD, even though I'd guess its primary audience is the very young.The musicianship is first rate and the lyrics are creative and God-honoring throughout the disc. There is an energy that permeates the songs, which adds to its appeal. My personal favorite songs are \\"Believe\\", \\"Tuning In\\", \\"Truth Be Known - Everybody Gets A Shot\\" and \\"Step Up To The Microphone\\". But there aren't any \\"duds\\" on here, and I'd recommend the disc, whether you're 8 or 80 or anywhere in between."},{"rating":"2","title":"Newsboys are the BEST!!","review":"If you are looking for an awesome uplifting Christian band, then they Newsboys are the ones for you! After Take you to Your Leader the Newsboys came out with Step up to the Microphone, a more creative, more satisfying contemporary rock. This is truly the best album the Newsboys have come up with, leading the album off with the uplifting lyrics of \\"Woohoo.\\" Having \\"Entertaining Angels\\" in the middle of the album to brings a peaceful melody to the listeners, then to end this outstanding album with the relaxing songs of \\"The Tide\\" and \\"Always\\" brings the listeners to a closing. Do yourself a favor and purchase Step up to the Microphone, you'll love it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best CD By Newsboys","review":"The Step Up To The Microphone CD is by far the best Newsboys CD. 10 great songs that include Woohoo, Step Up To The Microphone, Entertaining Angels, Belive, Tuning In, Truth Be Known(everybody gets a shot),Deep End, Hallelujah, The Tide, and Always. This is a great CD, and a must have for any big Newsboys fan. I give this CD a 5 out of 5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed...","review":"...I bought this record with so much anticipation. \\"Entertaining Angels\\" was such a good song. It painted the Newsboy as kind of the 'Oasis of CCM' Well, Oasis they are not. In fact they aren't even Blur, although they would like to be with a song called 'Woohoo' as the opening track. If others love this record, I am so glad. I on the other hand was severly let down. In fact, with the exception of 'Entertaining Angels' and 'Truth Be Known...' I find this record to be an absolute bore. I wish the band the best as well as a better follow-up."},{"rating":"2","title":"A new sound, but still good!","review":"To give a bit of background, I got hooked on these guys over the summer through the radio, so I didn't get Step Up To The Microphone with any preconceptions as to what the Newsboys *should* sound like. And I LOVE this album! Having since listened to Take Me To Your Leader, I can say that SUTTM isn't as goofy, and the songs tend to be a lot deeper (like \\"Always\\"). However, that doesn't make it boring! There's still plenty of the old 'Boys (try \\"Tunin' In\\" and \\"Truth Be Known - Everybody Gets A Shot\\"). All in all, a great album, I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Awesome","review":"I strongly suggest this CD to any Christian rock fan, or just about anybody! Newsboys deliver their classic music with some new ideas, from the guitar driven beat on, \\"Woohoo\\" to the techno sounding, \\"Truth be known, everybody gets a shot\\" to the heartfelt ,\\"Always\\". Newsboys, from Australia , once again deliver an album that doesn't have a bad song at all. The smash hit \\",Entertaning Angels\\" is definately their most popular song, although my favorite is either the bassy \\"Hallalujah\\" or \\"Woohoo\\". CDs like this? Newsboys previous albums \\"Not Ashamed\\",\\"Going Public\\", and \\"Take me to your leader\\" are all great and so is the likes of Third day,The Waiting, and of course, DC talk"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most well-produced CD's in music.","review":"Even though they lost one of their main vocalist, they didn't miss a step. The other bandmates stepped up, singing lead and writing. Every member sings on this. There are so many extra sounds on this CD that you have to listen for to notice. That shows great musical talent. Peter Furler is the lone producer this time, going without Steve Taylor. All the extra additions add a ton to the songs. They are all masters of their instruments. I can't decide if \\"Take me to Your Leader\\" is better or not. But this one is certainly better produced than any of their others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"I hardly ever listne to this album. Take me To Your Leader is way better. The only songs I like on this one are Woohoo, or however you spell it, and Entertaining Angels. Way to popish for my taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Welll... It maybe had its moments.","review":"Welll... It had its moments. Overall I don't consider it worth the money. It was a whole lot more pop than rock, and a whole lot more pop than their earlier albums, which were all really good albums. OK, \\"WooHoo,\\" \\"Hallelujah,\\" and \\"Always\\" were actually pretty good, but otherwise I didn't find anything I liked. \\"The Tide\\" I didn't totally get. Plus, most of the guitar licks sound used and unoriginal. Their earlier stuff was a lot better, but this one (I hope) was probably a transitional album after John James left. Hopefully on their next album they'll find their footing again. Pass up this one and buy \\"Take Me To Your Leader\\" instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"On e SMOTTH cd!","review":"Well, the newsboys have done it again! They have made probably the best Contem. Christian CD on the Market, and are darn well good at making it! Well, if you are looking for music for a music video, buy this and use 'Tune In' and 'Step Up to the Microphone'"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Newsboys ROCK!!!!!","review":"\\"Microphone\\" is a more spirtually focused album I believe. Leader was great and is one of my all time favorites and microphone is right up there as well. i was worried when John James left but after hearing this I'm not anymore! Got this the day it came out and boy am I glad i did!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Different, but good.","review":"It took me a while to get used to this CD, but once I did I really liked it a lot. The only thing I didn't like was the stupid horns. Other than that it is very good. The lyrics are good, but not quite as creative as Take Me To Your Leader, which remains as my favorite.I would like to ask everyone to stop using ALL CAPS. It is annoying and hard to read. I don't even read anything in all caps because it is never worth reading anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST MUSIC CD IN THE WORLD!!!!","review":"I guess I am partial, 'cause Newsboys just happen to be my all time favorite band of all time! This cd is their best one yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"New to Newsboys","review":"I am a new listener to the Newsboys. I first became aware of them when I heard their song \\"Shine\\" on a religious compilation album of various artists. I was so taken with that song that I went out and purchased this album. While I did not find a song on here that struck me as hard as \\"Shine\\" did, there is certainly nothing about this album that will keep me from adding to my Newsboys collection. These guys are good! And they are not afraid to sing God's praises loud and clear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing as usual","review":"The Newsboys have done it again...they have another amazing album! You can listen to them over and over because they have such a wide variety of music and you can hear their devotion to Jesus. Amazing album!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's too bad Amazon only allows 5 stars!","review":"I really enjoy the Newsboys! This CD is a really solid hit, and I can't recommend it enough! The way they sing so smoothly on a wide range of topics (addressing one of my favorites, relativism, very nicely) with a pumping beat and their usual well-polished lyrics is incredible. The Newsboys got me into the Contemporary Christian music scene, and they've definitely managed to keep me listening to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow. The Newsboys have done it again!","review":"I love this CD, even more than the others. It's really great. The music is catching, and the words really hit deep! Listen to it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best CD's I've heard in a long time!","review":"This is a great CD- every track is worth listening to! The addition of horns and strings on some of the tunes makes them more interesting to listen to than standard pop songs. Never having been a big Newsboys fan, I am really impressed with this effort- it has a nice mix of songs, blending different musical styles. I'll be wearing out a lot of batteries listening to this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Five Stars!!!","review":"This is the Newsboys' best album ever.

I can't wait for their next album to be released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD, especially with all the effects.","review":"The best song is the third one track-i'm not sure of the title of the song. There's a little buzz that occurs periodically throughout the song, that moves from speaker to speaker. it fades out of one and goes to the other. listen for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best newsboys cd!","review":"This is the best Newsboys cd that I have. All of the songs on this cd are good! All of them! The best are Woohoo, Step up to the microphone, and Truth be known, which in my opinion those are the best songs. If you are a Newsboys fan than I think you will like this cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Step Up ...to the new style of the Newsboys","review":"Newsboys co-founder John James left the band just before this cd was recorded ...so it's a little different having Peter Furler's voice leading the music instead of James' but it was easy to adjust to. This album is great. It's more melodic than previous releases and has some great tunes of it's own compared to the Newsboys previous releases. I love \\"Always\\" - it's a song about how God is the father to the fatherless ...I can't relate but it's great. I think \\"Truth Be Known,\\" \\"Believe,\\" and \\"Hallelujah\\" are also great, and everybody seems to love \\"WooHoo,\\" and \\"Entertaining Angels.\\" I would rate this as the Newsboys second best album yet. ...I think Not Ashamed is the best, and Take Me To Your Leader ranks third out of their 8 total albums. BUY IT! YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!"},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars are 5 too short","review":"Warning, the Newsboys are addictive.

Blessing ,Heidi ++"},{"rating":"1","title":"please do not lower yourself to this level!","review":"Well, I am a fan of most Christian music, and, even if an artist is not the most innovative, I can appreciate their lyrics and possible ministry. But, I'm sickened by the Newsboys' lack of artistic integrity! I mean, come on, they change styles EVERY album, and each time it's a little trendier, and a little more sugarcoated production... AND, back in the early 90's, THEY were winning all these CCM awards for \\"best alternative group!\\" Maybe they were catchy or something, but \\"going public\\" is as far off from \\"alternative\\" as you can get!!BUT, if this music really does move you, and you feel you can glean some spiritual insight even thru a total abandon of artistic standards, you have my permission to buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The first week was the best!","review":"The first week I had this ablum I listened to it about 20 times! I thought to myself, this is the best album ever! But than around 28-29 times around, my enthusiasm slowed. Angels started to get under my skin :) and Woohoo began to irritate me.

They advertise it as a media machine, however, it doesn't come with much of the software I needed. i.e. There is no Audio Capture software. The CD/DVD burning software is limited as to the number of formats it will burn.However, most of my frustration has come from trying to get phone support from Sony. After a few hundred questions from the automated phone attendant and 30-40 minutes on hold, their support people seem to be less than knowledgeable and very disinterested in helping.Bottom line: Buy a Dell!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bill Evans for ever","review":"i liked this album because Bill Evans is the artist.

After a shaky start, Hitchcock maintains the European intrigue with a series of bravura set-pieces - climaxed by the Royal Albert Hall nail-biter and a lengthy gun battle in London's East End. Peter Lorre's offbeat villainy stands out among a memorable cast. \\"The Man Who Knew Too Much\\" is far superior to Hitchcock's overlong 1956 remake."},{"rating":"1","title":"The remake was better...","review":"But this version still has its moments. You can easily see why Hitch loved this story enough to remake it, and once having seen both versions, will applaud his decision to do so.The problem with this DVD is not the content, but rather the technical quality of the transfer. I have seen 8mm home movies with better production values. The sound is particularly annoying, and the video not much better.While I can understand the many imperatives for making this version available, I cannot in good conscience recommend it to anyone other than a rabid Hitchcock fan, and then only for historical perspective. It is truly a shame to see such a wonderful film rendered so horribly and a stellar Director's vision, treated so shabbily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but I still like the remake more","review":"I very much enjoyed this at times expressionistic Hitchcock picture, but I think the remake outdoes it. The remake is far more engaging for the first 2/3rds, however, after the sublime theatre sequence his 1956 remake begins to suffer from a weak script. The ending with Doris Day singing that annoyingly obvious marketable song bugs me. The 1934 film ends on a much more bitter, violent level that is much more suitable to the tone of the picture than the 1956 version. Overall though, the 1956 version is better, except for the ending, however, I love the 1934 complete with a wonderful performance from the great, late Peter Lorre."},{"rating":"1","title":"POOR QUALITY!!","review":"I purchased this for my 4 year old thinking it would be a great nightlight. Not a good idea for young children because the glass ball is not attached and is very heavy. Consequently,it will break things if thrown ( the glass ball will not break or crack very well made) anyways... the light projected is VERY dim. It did not project on the ceiling or the walls. Also the sound quality is barely audible. Only two of the six sound was average quality. I bought mine for $19.99 and it was thrown away within two weeks.

For example, you need to work to get the bracket and fixure tightly together so you do not have a slight gap between the fixture and the drywall. Otherwise you are getting the same item you might find in a big box store by the same manufacturer. The four stars is because the remodel fixtures that are spring loaded into the drywall are a tighter fit but keep in mind you also need to spend more for the trim so trim is typically sold separately."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works fine...","review":"This thing is hideous, but I bought it for my future daughter in-law.

My father was stationed on Okinawa at that time (1957) and he would take me out star-watching there - there not being nearly the ambient light we enjoy here. He would tell me stories about how he had applied Bowditch's principles when he was stationed on a weather ship in the North Pacific and how it fascinated him that they were correct more than 150 years later.

I had to read this book over the summer for school and I thought it woul be a real boring experience, but it turned out, I really liked it. It is a story about Nathaniel Bowditch, he grows up during the Revolutionary War and loves to learn. He becomes an indentured slave because his father can not support him and his sibilings. This does not stop him. He becomes a ship captain and you go through most of his life hardships and all."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this interesting, exciting book.","review":"Carry On, Mr. Bowditch was an excellent book. It was hard for me to put the book down. Nathaniel Bowditch-Nat-has life long dreams of going to Harvard. He is wonderful at math. The only problem with Nat's dream is his family is poor and the Revolutionary War is going on. His family has many seafaring men in it. Soon he sails and on his trip he learns many different languages, many errors in Moore's book of navigation, and discovers a new way for taking a lunar. This is a very good book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Carry On, Mr. Bowditch","review":"This book is ideal for young children. It is so inspiring and moving after finish reading the book. I have visited Berkeley several times and found that there is a street call Bowditch. I am not exactly sure whether this street is named for the hero of this book. Anyway, I asked a lot of people and Cal Berkeley's students (including Ph.Ds) about this Bowditch street. Surprise, nobody seems to know who or what Bowditch is. What a shame you could find in Berkeley. I have been in Harvard once and kind of wonder whether Cambridge has Bowditch street. After all, Harvard awarded Mr. Bowditch an honorary degree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money!","review":"This \\"book\\" is probably one of the worst examples of literature I have ever read. Pathetic use of word choice, the whole plot was extremely dull. The most annoying part was how \\"perfect\\" Mr. Bowditch's life is (was)! Everything just goes his way- even his enemies end up looking up to him in the end! NO ONE acts this way! Oh- his perfect life? Well the only un-perfect part is that probably half his fmaily dies. Before you scorn me for saying \\"perfect\\" when he had all this loss- it really didn't seem to hurt him that much. Everyone felt sorry for him- so all the more he gained. He didn't even seem at all sad. The book would be like \\"And his poor, dear sister died of whatever\\" and he would be all \\"oh, I'm sad. :( Oh well, better get back to being happy ol' me again! La la la la...\\" PLease- buy some better book- not this pitiful excuse of one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Victoria's (age 9) Review--Wonderful Book!","review":"Carry On Mr. Bowditch is an exciting historical fiction book that is filled with adventure and discovery. The story is about a boy who is the fourth child of six children who grows up to be a math genius. The names of the six children, oldest to youngest, are Mary, Hab, Lizza, Nat, William, and Sammy. They all live in Salem, MA with their mother, father, and grandmother. I think that the author, Mrs. Lathem, was trying to tell us that even a genius can have some emotional times too. What I liked about this book is that it seemed as if Nat took me aboard his ship to different lands and to adventure in learning. I recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Inspiring Life","review":"The hero of Jean Latham's book, Carry On Mr. Bowditch, provides a good role model for kids today. Nathaniel Bowditch's perseverance through hard times deserves admiration and inspires respect. Even though Nat's life tried various times, his strong ideals help him find a way to \`carry on' each time his plans are ruined. Through thick and thin, Nat enjoys his studies, inspiring children to also pursue their future in academics.Not only is the main character virtuous and inspirational, his story is full of joy as well as defeat. This combination provides a good read for elementary or middle school children. The determined way Nat faces the tragedy in his life makes the sad parts of the book easy to pass by, and kids can get a good sense of what life is about by reading Carry On Mr. Bowditch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carry On, Mr. Bowditch","review":"A very good book about a young man who loves math and decides to be a navigator, and writes a book about navigation.

Then everything is taken away from him. His father has a tragedy at sea and is forced to leave his life as a captain and become a menial worker. His mother dies and his father takes his sorrows out in drink. Nat must then leave school and become an indentured servant. His dreams of school seem lost to him forever.Nat never succumbs to feeling sorry for himself or bitterness. Instead, he finds a way to use his workplace to better himself, learning everything he can about ships and navigation. He is able to take this new knowledge and teach others, becoming well known as a brilliant mathematician and navigator.The life of Nathaniel Bowditch is a wonderful story of finding good in bad and becoming all one can become."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh....","review":"Too general to be of much use.

Shawnna is pretty nice on the mic, even though the pool of female rappers isn't that deep right now, but she didn't deserve this. Her first single off \`Worth Tha Weight' was on point in \\"Shake Dat Sh**\\" w/ Ludacris, but the rest is pretty much scattered low filler material. \\"R.P.M\\" w/ Twista & Ludacris was already on the \`Golden Grain' album, but it's a great song for the people who didn't here it. My favorites on this album are \\"My Chicago pt 1\\" & \\"My Chicago pt 2\\", produced by B-Crucial, but here's the thing-they're both less than a minute long and are both the same beat, which won't cut it.

It's such a shame that Cunningham is not still around to write more books.I do not own this book at the present time, but I had it in my posession for a period of about 2 years and I read it many times during those 2 years. I am now working on getting my own copy.I enjoyed the 13 goals of a witch, which I later wrote an essay about and his way of crushing your myths without making you feel stupid or naive.Living Wicca is a great book to read even if you practice in a coven most of the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for those just starting out","review":"For someone like myself, who is just discovering Wicca, this book in a valuable source. Combined with its predecessor, \\"Wicca\\", it provides a clearly laid out plan for solitary practitioners.

I wouldn't recommend relying on this book solely, but it's a good start."},{"rating":"1","title":"I concur with other reviewers....","review":"...in what a disappointment this sequal to \\"Wicca: A Guide for the Solitary Practioner\\" was.

I also like the bibliography in the back, as it recommends a lot of books that I haven't come across before, and they all sound very interesting. All in all, a classic.But the sequel? Skip it. Aside from some practical info like advice to reading and compiling information from various sources (as much of what solitiaries learn are typically from books), and two well-done chapters about Goddess and God, it just in no way compares to the beauty and heart of the first book.His other books on natural magic however, are wonderful!

I was worried my passport would not fit, but it fits just perfect. The two compartments, one small and one larger, are just enough room to hold a passport and some money.

However, the tie has a tendency to roll and dig into your back. It helps if you thread the tie through the belt loops on your trousers, but then you must wear your shirt on the outside of your trousers. The belt has two plastic half circles to thread the tie through to tighten it. The stitching is not close enough to the half circles to keep them in place. They slip through each other and the tie loosens. This isn't too much of a problem if you have threaded the tie through the trouser belt loops and put all the extra length of the tie in your back pocket. Otherwise, you might find yourself fishing down a trouser leg to find the money belt.

I got a tablet and it was cheap so I gave it a shot. I did try my best to like it and find good in it. In the end I have to agree with the negative reviews here. The whole book was very negative about John mainly, though everyone gets the ax at some point. Richard comes off as very upset that he did not make it as big or bigger than John and that John did not do enough to make him big. While I understand it is Richards point of view. It is not one that even tries to look at all sides or to give credit were credit is due, aside from a few very small places. In short this book was a cash in. At the expense of everyone Mr. Jensen met, spoke to, or saw from a distance.

I admire the author's courage for being able to walk away from Hollywood and all the craziness that comes along with it. This book is an interesting read.

Jensen writes very well, telling his story in a voice that made me think he was sitting in my living room talking to me. Dukes fans, like me, will be shocked at some of the tacky behavior of John Schneider (Bo Duke), especially the way he treated Jensen, who was his friend. The rest of the Dukes cast fare well in this memoir, especially Sonny Shroyer (Deputy Enos), who Jensen says is actually a terrific actor. There is a lot of humor and alot of introspection.

The sound and camera work are very amateurish. This video would only be for a very beginning painter with a lot of patience. The presentation is extremely boring.

My daughter and I have made quite a few and all of them have turned out well. The mango sticky rice, potstickers, Moroccan meatballs (although we did add an egg and some filler to the meatballs which added moisture) were very good as was the shredded beef tacos. We have enjoyed cooking our way through this book as well as reading their vignettes about each recipe or cuisine. Well organized."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Enough Stars To Rate This One","review":"Correct Title: Drama of the Ages. Since this is the book that led me to Christ, it has a very special place in my heart. The chapter entitled \\"What Must I Do To Be Saved?\\" will bring you to your knees. Until reading it, I never really knew how to repent, and give my life to Christ. That, at the ripe old age of 18, and after attending churches for years. But not only is it invaluable for guidance in salvation, it covers about every doctrinal theme from the Bible you can think of. Long a prized possession in our family library as a child, the stunning illustrations are like none you've ever seen before. Heaven inspired even, if you're fortunate to find a fully illustrated edition. A unique collector's item in any Christian library. Like finding a precious gem.

I provides enough depth to get the engineer to breadboard stage for most types of problems, no more. Examples are almost all pertinent to the kinds of problems rocket engineers will face. It assumes the reader has a basic engineering course background in dynamics (solid, aero-, and thermo-) and a working grasp of math up to calculus, but not more. The best uses are for someone who wants a general overview of rocket propulsion, or as the backbone of a longer course of study that includes other, more specialized and in-depth texts."},{"rating":"2","title":"good option","review":"An easy read that has important review topics and associated questions.

Many of the sections have major holes in terms of knowledge, including topics in the content specs. The questions at the end of the sections are minimally helpful. Honestly, I thought it was a waste of money. If I wasn't so stressed out, I wouldn't have bought it at all. I gave it away. Don't think it is useful for board prep and it certainly isn't useful for general knowledge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad for the price","review":"Great features and performance for the price. Can't find cheaper laptop with DVD-R capabilities anywhere. Screen is OK for general use, but gamers and graphic designers may want to opt for the 16\\" screen with 1600x1200 resolution offered by SONY.

Now at 1 1/2 years it shuts down constantly. The problem - OVERHEATING. Apparently it's a well known problem, and I can't get any support from Sony. Lookup \\"Sony VAIO shutdown\\" online and see all the folks that are experiencing overheating problems.I'm very disappointed with this laptop and would not recommend a Sony laptop to anyone.I think I will go back to ACER laptops, they have worked flawlessly in the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful music - but this CD is now superfluous","review":"I bought this before the Yes indeed! boxed set was released. Every song on this wonderful twofer can be found in that set, although I haven't checked to see if they are all the same versions. A previous reviewer suggests two of these tracks are missing from the box, so unless he has made a mistake, they must be different versions of the same songs.Of the songs included here, romantic love songs make up most of this collection although there are a couple of western songs (Red river valley and Tumbling tumbleweeds) recorded with lush orchestral backings like the rest of this CD. All are sung superbly by Jo - but I can't ever remember hearing Jo do anything less. Smoke gets in your eyes and Some enchanted evening are just two of the famous songs here.This is a magnificent collection, but if you buy Yes indeed! (at only a slightly higher price), you won't need it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much the better \\"Autumn in New York\\" reissue","review":"EMI's Ron Hill did a sensitive job of remastering from Capitol's vinyl. My impression is that the studios Capitol used in those days were acoustically harsh; EMI has preserved the sweetness of Jo's voice at the cost of borderline frequencies and dynamics. Enjoy while you can."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for kids past the \\"baby Bible\\" stage","review":"We got this book for our 4.5 year old. He had read his Baby/Children's Bible to pieces. Things we like about this Bible: More details from the stories, Pictures are less-cartoony. Things we don't like: some of the wording is awkward at times (we just improvise with our own wording every once in awhile). Overall, it's an awesome book for kids who are still being read to, but are past the little kiddie Bible stage.

You may think wow a way to hook my GameCube up to my TV. However, an RF connection is the most ancient way on the planet to connect a game console to a TV! It was around with Nintendo's first system! It crams all the picture and sound together and results in a less clear picture and mono sound. Any TV that was purchased in the last 10 years or so should have a better available connection, Like A/V composite. (That's the Red and white jack for stero sound and yellow jack for video) Or even better, S-video (The big connector) with better picture seperation. However, the very BEST connection is component. It seperates all of the reds blues and greens and uses the white and red jacks for stereo sound. If you want to take advantage of Game Cubes progressive scan HD-TV 1080i capabilities on your HD-ready set, you should get the component connection cords that should be availble at the sytems launch."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT'S The Same as the N64","review":"It's the same as a N64 so if you have a N64 and it has a RF swich there is no need for this item"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't buy, if it's not neccesary","review":"This switch is the exact same as the N-64 switch so don't go wasting (...) bux if u already have the switch, but they work great anyway!

A piece of advice though, the N64 uses exactly the same connection, so if you have one for the N64, or need one for N64, buy just one, and seeing as how the N64 adaptor typically costs more (maybe it's the nifty box it comes in), buy the GameCube adaptor and save yourself some cash."},{"rating":"1","title":"This may work for some, but not for me!","review":"This product is supplied without any instructions for installation, although there are two schematic circuit diagrams printed on top of the box.

I wired up from scratch and installed a relay and horn switch and the whole thing ended up looking like a stock install. the horn color matched my quad color as well. When I honk these mothers MAN are they loud!

The author painted a clear picture of the places he visited and the people who lived in the places he visited. I was, however, at times a bit annoyed by his failure to go beyond poverty and corruption to find the many positive images of the land and the people. I am an African who was born and raised in the continent ...and although living in the west has improved my \\"economical situation\\" I would not change the memories of my childhood for anything.I also felt that Mr. Harris rushed through the last couple of chapters of the book. They lack the detailed imagery as well as the enthusiasm that was exhibited for the first three fourth of the book.Still, I thought this was the best travel book I read on Africa."},{"rating":"2","title":"a delightful surprise","review":"I found this book as I was looking for a travelogue on Africa before I went there. What a delightful surprise it was. I loved it. I've gone on to read everything that Eddy Harris has written. His self-aware, honest reflections of what he is thinking as well as experiencing are a great read. And as a person academically trained in \\"cross-cultural sensitivity\\", I thoroughly enjoyed him saying very \\"unsensitive\\" things that any American has to really be thinking in some of his circumstances. I gave this book to my sister who has no interest in Africa and she liked it as much as me. It's just a fun (and educational!) read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good effort","review":"This band is a good band which plays mainly poppier, keyboard style music in keeping with the '60s scene but some tracks are close to genius.ie.

These white middle class garage stars have their fame made on this album.The way the singer sings is a bit strange at times, i think he might need to seek medical attention, or was it the drugs? Hmm anyway. good music, which at times is genius and at others is tame, but you cant deny their part in the garage scene."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated","review":"The Seeds have one great song. That's it. Everything else is a variation of that. Further, Sky Saxon is perhaps the most undistinguished vocalist coming out of the garage. This smacks of blasphemy to garage-heads, but it's true.

But, great content.","review":"I think that this is a great book. The only problem with it might be, that its not written very well. It seems to drag at times and one might feel that its not worth the time. But, it is. This is one book which confronts you directly about who you really are and who you think you are. It reveals the actual meaning of your thoughts and the actual intentions of your actions. Its quite an eye opener into human psychology, in general, and you will see patterns of your own behaviour in his descriptions of situations. It brings you out from the illusion where you are a saint, an extremely nice person; where whatever you do is good, and where you are always thinking about others first and then about yourself. Its worth it in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"A much-needed resource for 3D artists, but a *long* read.","review":"I purchased this book about two months ago. I was not impressed with the volume and span of information covered, but nonetheless, this is a fine resources for all artists who are considering using Poser as a mainstay in their program skill sets. Particularly noteable: keyframe animation and lip-synching to WAV files. Also, (and in my opinion, this was worth the price of the book alone) there is a section on handshaking protocols with other 3D programs (RayDream Studio, 3DS Max, LightWave, Infini-D, etc.). Poser's interaction with MetaCreation's other very powerful mid-price-range vehicle, Ray Dream Studio 5, makes for unbeliveable effects for practically pocket change.If you're going to use Poser for serious reasons, you need this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major disappointment.","review":"I have not yet bought the Poser 4 handbook, and it is THIS book that assured I never will! When I was still working with Poser 3, I was looking for a good resource to teach me how to use it's advanced (at the time) features. Heh, the cover art should have showed me that this book was NOT it. After reading the book (a waste of time), I realized that if THIS was the best he could do, then I was already far more advanced in Poser 3 than he was. Since, thanks to online tuts, I am an advanced Poser 4 user, I think I'll be once burned twice shy and avoid it. My advice to you about the Poser 3 handbook? Well, if you are a rank beginner that wants to make weird figures, this is your book. If you want to learn to use Poser 3's features to make lovely, realistic characters and scenes, use the online resources as this book's price tag is not nearly justified by the mediocre and sometimes bizarre infomation in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shamms is universally despised with good reason!","review":"If you have even the slightest experience with computer graphics you will find this book (like all the R. Shamms Mortimer books) to be useless! Not only does he appear to have no real skill with the product his examples consist of page after page of mindless repetition. Ex: here's how to make a man with a fish head, and now here's how to make a man with a dog head, and now here's how to make a man with a horse head, etc, ad nauseam. Instead of giving master advice on how to make the most of this tool (as part of a greater software toolkit) Shamms simply plugs pieces together mindlessly and passes them off as lessons. There are maybe ten useful pages in the book and ALL of them are almost directly from the Poser manual. Avoid this book at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"But what about Poser!","review":"In agreement with other customer previews, Shamms Mortier has written a book not for the general Poser user, but of his own likes and dislikes. As his own graphical skills don't appear to be very polished (I am being kind here!) he shows his limitations by crude examples. By far, the largest drawback to this book is the fact that if you do not have other software (ie: Ray Dream Studio - as the author MUST have!) then the book is next to useless to a Poser (only) user."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book has great potential -too bad it falls way short.","review":"This is the third and FINAL book I will ever read by R. Shamms Mortier. This is the only book dedicated to Poser3 and sadly it has to come from such a wretched author. There are so many great features about Poser3 that could be discussed that are only merely 'touched upon'. His \\"I don't like this feature so you MUST NEVER USE IT\\" attitude bothers me.

The final shootout, which someone here raves over, is especially hilarious. The gunmen who whack the wedge cut-wearing guido \\"hero\\" really are the gang that couldn't shoot straight.

It was definitely a favorite, as were all the Berestain Bears books! One thing that I loved about it was that after a restless night, Papa Bear explains to Sister how letting your imagination take charge at the wrong time is what often leads to irrational fears, even for adults. She learns that what most often, what is scary looking in the dark is really harmless once the lights are on. This helped me a lot as a little girl.

I have two girls, ages 3 and 7, and they can dance with Rochelle easily for an hour or more. She gives the girls' imaginations a work out, and helps them develop their listening ears (sensitivity to music and what emotions it invokes), while teaching them basic ballet movements.The only caution I have about this product is that Rochelle wears a LOT of makeup (especially considering her young age), though I explained to my girls that this is stage make up and necessary so viewers who sit far away can still see her expressions.Rochelle does a fine job with both of her dvds, and most families will find that their little ballerinas' dreams will come true when they have a chance to dance with her."},{"rating":"1","title":"use the money to make your own kit.","review":"first it comes in a cheap case, nothing really wrong with that.now you open it to find that you paid over $20 for a few band aids, some gauze, a few pain relievers, and some scissors... oh yeah, don't forget the safety pins and rubber gloves!take a walk down the first aid isle at your grocery store and you can buy more stuff than this kit includes and for less."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good kit for \\"Just in Case\\"","review":"The kit does have everything you may need in an emergency + it came with \\"Guide to wilderness & travel medicine\\" Very good reference book for any situation.

The downside is that it only carries a limited amount of supplies. Basically, if someone get's shot on the hunting trip you can hold them over, if two people were shot the 2nd guy would be out of luck. (which I suppose would be pretty unlikely) Anyhow, I also like that there is a survival and first aid book to walk you through details as well as little note cards in each individual pouch explaining what supplies to use for different types of injuries. In all I'd say you could probably piece this together with more of the crucial supplies yourself for less, but if you're lazy and just want it done for you, then this is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for basic first aid....","review":"I purchased this emergency first aid kit specifically for my 72 hr backpack. I would say that the type of supplies included is enough for most basic to moderate injuries requiring wound care. I definitely would not turn to this kit expecting to treat severe trauma wounds. The nice thing about this kit is that there is still room to add a few more supplies to your liking. I was able to add a pack of Quickclot and an Israeli Battle Dressing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for young children","review":"Like another reviewer commented, parents should preview this book before reading it to young children.

Sadly, that's the only thing about the character that inspires sympathy. The one facet in which this movie succeeds is showing a young guy with absolutely no self respect and his series of increasingly dangerous and drug addled trysts while he plans to kill himself on Christmas eve. Yes...it's that depressing.This movie represents everything that's wrong and stereotypical about gay cinema - dark, depressing and self-absorbed characters. Poignant only in its depravity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trash fest","review":"If the religious right needs more fuel for their anti-gay crusades, I'm sure they would be happy to add this film to their ammunition. Promiscuous sex, drug use and the whole concept of an older gay couple using a young boy as their \\"toy\\" is bad enough. Nick May is very good in the title role and manages to create a sympathetic portrayal of a young guy desperately in need of love. This is quite an accomplishment considering that the script basically only uses one sexual encounter after another to paint his plight.

The fact they replaced their \\"silver can\\" product (the one recommended by all ice cream makers) with this one is despicable.

Then goes on to talk about such things like singularities, but brings us back to the rabbitts.I expected a message from E.T. to come from this book, but I admit from God I didn't.

In the novel, Ellie Arroway isn't as annoying as the movie's Ellie Arroway: she is not constantly criticizing religion. The movie spent too much time focusing on the question of religion versus science. It is a theme in the novel, but the theme is not as in-your-face as in the movie (for example, Hadden and his Preachnix device).Unfortunately, the novel is very awkward at introducing backstory: a character is introduced and then the next few paragraphs give a quick biographical sketch of the character. Personally, I'd rather have the backstory of a character introduced in pieces and in surprises. For example, Palmer Joss could have been a much more interesting character if his backstory were introduced much slowly. These sketches should have been editted out.The last chapter of the novel, was much better than the movie's end. It would've been nice to see what Ellie did with that information from her mother's letter."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great book","review":"Contact is a great book that is completely satisfying in the end. I would not say that the plot is completely original but the themes are thought provoking.Does intelligent life exist outside the earth? That is not a controversy in this book because the book is one, fiction and second, SETI is really just a setting for the greater theme of faith, expansion of the mind, etc. It would be like arguing the historical accuracy of \\"War and Peace\\" when the real theme is the growth and changing of the human character.Sagan challenges the reader to think out of our own limited minds when dealing with expansive/infinite concepts like the universe or even God."},{"rating":"2","title":"Voltaire references","review":"This is a passionate book that seems to be the sum of everything that Sagan cared about.

Sagan proves he is just another flying saucer nut who hopes some alien people from way, way out there (\\"billions and billions\\" miles away?) will eventually come and save mankind. He substitutes one wild unscientific premise for another.

And I agree. As good as the movie is - it is a joke compared to the book! There is far more detail here, which is understandable - if the filmmakers put all the detail that was in the book into the movie, the movie would end up being twelve hours long! For anyone who thinks they dont need to read the book because they've seen the movie: THINK AGAIN! The endings are a lot different.

The characters are fascinating, the human element of the story truly inspiring, the conclusion radical and eye-opening and it's written on a level anyone can understand.Sagan's writing conceptualizes science without sacrificing an enjoyable story. Open minded readers will appreciate the symbolism and irony absent in the film version as skeptics becomes believers and the tables turn on the debate between science and religion.You won't be disappointed. The ending in \\"Contact\\" is the most surprising and satisfying that I've ever read. It really gets you thinking about the universe, it's origin and our place in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Science Fiction","review":"Dr. Sagan was an intelligent and creative man. I would have been more satisfied if he had left out the twist between daughter and father in the story but the symbolic of the situation bode well with the whole fiction. Having a woman as the President was a marvelous idea especially as it may come true in near future. His futuristic interpretation of scientific developments happening at the start of the millennium was clever. Maybe I am being biased because of Dr. Sagan's real life's achievements as a scientist. My favorite character is none other than the inventor with an attitude. All in all, although the story line is simple and predictable, Contact is still a skillful art at science fiction by a man with many commendable qualities. The day he passed away was truly a sad day for the science community."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vision and hope can't be conveyed to troglodytes","review":"Sagan's brilliance lies in his ability to make intelligent readers wonder. Those who nit-pick and complain about pi are missing the point.

The book is drawn out and slow moving, the characters are poorly developed and it is full of Sagan's political agenda that detracts from what should be a fun sci-fi novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Five Stars? We're talking about the BOOK, not the film.","review":"I didn't see the film but I read the book and was disappointed. Sagan's agent walked into his office and said \\" You have to do a work of fiction.\\" to which he replied \\"I can do that, I'll just put a couple of characters into COSMOS!\\" I am awed by the amount of 5 star reviews that are here. Sagan seemed to have overwhelming optimism that humans might one day explore the stars, after reading the reviews of this book, I can only conclude that if these are the same people who show interest in said exploration than perhaps the galaxy is better off having these slack-jawed troglodites gravity bound to their homeworld."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"I read this book after I saw the movie. There were a lot of holes in the plot of the movie, I figured that it's a good idea to find out what's this all about.I finished the book in two days. It's a difficult book, with a lot of technical terms and jargons. But generally, it's a very good sci-fi book which stirs up your imagination. It encourages you to look at the sky at night and ponder about life.I am shocked by Sagan's knowledge about the history and culture of many other countries, like China, India, Nigeria, and former USSR. If you have read his Dragons of Eden, you will find that he knew a lot about evolution, animal behaviors and psychology too.Two problems exist though. He was not very good at dramatizing the important events, like the death of Drumlin, making the flow of story not very exciting. Another one was his use of love at the very end of the book, was that necessary?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book","review":"I am normally not a science fiction reader. I enjoy non fiction and rarely dabble in fiction but i had to make an exception for carl sagan. I read essentialy all his other works and decided i had to read this book and lets just say i was not disapointed. This is a must read for everyone, especially fans of sagan or astronomy. It is well written and has a gripping story. Highly recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Great book. After 20 years I keep on going back to my favorite passages. I've always had a \\"thing\\" about initial contacts,the value of \\"pi\\" and its place in the universe. Contact ties math, science, and science fiction all together. Like all critics, I could chop out at least 50 pages to quicken the pace."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that stimulates the reader with visions of universe.","review":"In Contact, Carl Sagan deftly encompasses many facets of humanity. The reader picks up a mass of astrophysics effortlessly with Sagan's easy prose. The somewhat abstract concept of pi is explained and its significance as the universal constant is reveled at as the probable key to otherworldy contact. Other more earthly concepts are explored: secularity, adultery, love. When this book is finished, the reader has hopefully experienced a minor epiphany, as the wholly remote idea of the universe and its properties are boiled down into an engaging story. This book is a different body from the movie, but both stand alone as excellent works of science fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, but not perfect","review":"I saw the movie and immediately got the book. Overall, the book is better. But I thought that the character of Ellie was weaker in the book. I thought Jodie Foster was great in the movie, but in the book, the character isn't very interesting. But the book is great anyways. Really recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A strong book about ideas.","review":"I think this book is in several ways very similar to the Name of the Rose, by Umberto Eco, in that there is a very simple plotline inside which conflict of ideas takes place. It is truly a book about ideas. Additionally, Eco and Sagan use in my opinion the same brand of irony in that many of the characters show examples of vast ineptitude at their jobs. Unfortunately, I read the book only after seeing the movie (and I hold the movie as one of the finest ever made,) but I felt that the book did not live up to its vast potential as the basis of that movie. Both Forrest Gump and Contact focused on a central character, but were driven by auxillary characters; I don't feel that Sagan had fleshed out his characters nearly as well as they were delivered in the movie, which is unusual for a book/movie comparison. If you have seen the movie, I would reccommend the book *only if* you seek more depth on the science component of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"KEPT ME READING","review":"I read the book Contact by Carl Sagan. It would probably be considered a science fiction book because it has a lot to do with space and \\"other forms of life\\". I gave it four stars because it was very interesting and it made me want to keep reading further and further. The main plot of Contact is about a doctor that works at a satellite monitoring station. She is always listening for sounds form outer space and comes up empty handed every time. Finally she gets her big break; she hears a loud heart-beat type sound coming from a distant star. Soon they start to receive sound and video waves. I will not go into anymore detail because it would make the book a lot less exciting to read and give away the ending if you knew anything more about the book. Overall, thought it was a great book and I would definitely recommend it to anyone who finds space and science interesting or who has a little bit of an imagination and curiosity about space."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing first contact with Sagan the novelist","review":"I loved Sagan on TV and I loved Cosmos, but I didn't love Contact. Sagan is a great scientist but he's a pedestrian novelist. I'd call him a poor man's Michener. The characters in Contact are stereotyped and dull. Some sections lag such as the exposition of Ellie's childhood which, apart from being banal, was unreasonably long notwithstanding that it ties in with the ending. I also found the \\"real science\\" aspect -which other readers have said is the books strength -to be a little elementary and a little skimpy. Seems to me that Sagan spent a lot more time in musing on religion vs science than on the technology or the science of SETI (and he does this via too many unauthentic long speeches). All in all a great disappointment"},{"rating":"2","title":"Soul-shattering!","review":"When I saw the movie Contact, I loved it. After reading the book, I say \\"its good, but could been better.\\" The development in both were very good, showing how scientists really are, but the movie do not tells us anything more than 'they are out there'. The book tells more than that. I was terribly dissapointed that a 3 hour movie could not present the impact that the contact had in Ellie. Leaving the movie behind, this book is great! You love and hate the characters and the story is told from a scientist perspective. It can't get more realistic. Beign a scientist I also see this book as an opportunity for non-scientists to feel how we work, and why things are done the way they are done. The conflicts between scientist and non-scientists in the book are seen everyday in real life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book and movie, among the most enjoyable I've experienced.","review":"Like one other reviewer, I don't know what the two one-star raters saw or experienced. Maybe it was no monsters (except the traditional governmental bad guys.) I got the movie on a whim after ignoring it for years. What a shock--it was fantastic. I now own the movie and a hard-to-find hardbound copy of the book. What an experience. Read, watch and listen to the book, movie, and book on tape!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best book ever.","review":"I have just finished reading Contact and I have to say that it is spell-bounding. I'm only 13, and reading this book caused a few strange stare's from my classmates, but they were worth it it. This book is worth taking the time it takes to read, and comprehend, it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea but...","review":"The movie was excellent. So that got me wanting to read the book. Bought it and started it right away. I was disappointed. I just read half the book cause Carl Sagan can't right worth anything! His idea was something I could never imagine it's just the way he wrote bore me and I quit reading it. I wanted to finish it to compare the ending to the movie but the guy just dragged me page after page and I couldn't stand it anymore. Go see the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read! This! Book!","review":"This book is beautiful, stirring, and breathes life into science, religion and life in general. The overall effect is one of intense and complete humanity. I recommend this book to anyone who has ever pondered the meaning of anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sagan was a true genius. Pretty bombastic, huh?","review":"I've devoured every Sagan book I could ever get my hands on, but this one did some serious mind numbing. Try this, get out under the summer night sky with a flashlight and read this book. Vega is overhead most of the night and it feels like it is watching you.This book is not about aliens -- it is about how we see ourselves. Carl was underhanded in his writing because your ordinary moke would think it is supposed to be about his view of the future or some factual account. Only it wasn't. Carl wanted to make the reader think about their own life and humanity from a human perspective. I am a true believer that life exists in the Cosmos, but that is completely irrelevant to this book. It is an excellent account of humanity - our flaws (many as there are) AND our triumphs. It is unfair to Carl to subject it to literary or factual critique. What is fair to say is that it most assuredly will make you think. Carl will definitely be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Godzilla of Sci-fi","review":"Carl Sagan captures your interest the moment the book begins, not with the science of it mind you, but with the main character, whom one automatically recognizes is a exceedingly gifted, and yet compassionate person. The book details her trials in life, including discrimination, death, and domestic family problems, as well as romance. Sagan of course has a healthy mix of technicality within the book, virtually all of of which is based in fact. Between the characters, which seem all to real, and the actual story line and discovery of extra-terrestrial life, this turned out to be my all time favorite book which has something for everyone to enjoy! Its almost larger than life, and should be considered a classic by future generations."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Enriching Novel","review":"A really great book! I especially like how Sagan emphises the important role of women in science, enginering and in politics, with out trying to fill some \\"PC\\" quota. Even though it was probably more entertaining to see clips of Pres. Clinton in the movie, I wasn't suprised to find that the movie version conspiciously edited the part out about the President being a woman. The book is more philosophical and makes more predictions of events that are likely to occur towards the milienium. Really liked both the movie and the book and would highly recommend either! Thank you Carl Sagan"},{"rating":"2","title":"A true intellectual reading","review":"Few books will make your mind soar like this one can. Sagan's genius shows in this book again like it has in every other book he has written. What a wonderful book! It combines science, religion, philosophy, and literature. Each chapter begins with a wonderful quotation by some famous scholar or thinker.The most enjoyable part of the book is the debate between believers and atheists/agnostics. Definitely a very thought provoking book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book light years ahead","review":"Carl Sagan really belived that the universe was full of wonder and this book explores all that and much more. The people who search for alien civilizations in this novel also search for the meaning of life at the same time. Sagan has taken his rightful place alongside Arthur C. Clarke and Ray Bradbury as among the best contributors in both science and science fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Read","review":"Killer Read... Sagan was just a bit too optimistic about how far technology would come in a short time, but I find this to be true of all near-future writers."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this book!!!","review":"This is one of my favorite books. I did think it started out a little slow but once the message was recieved the book really took off. This is a beautiful story and Carl Sagan once again inspires me with his hopeful writing. His vision of the universe, shared with us, is a beautiful and optimistic one. The writing may be a little dry at times but the message is worth the wait. This book remains on my \\"favorites\\" shelf and on my list of books to recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best sci-fi book of all time!","review":"I love this book. The movie was fantastic, but the book is better. I'm not going to explain to story to you because there are lots of people who have already done that here. I'm simply going to give it my highest rating and let you read it to discover why."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Sci Fi book","review":"The movie \\"Contact\\", based upon this book, is a good one...but the book (and I'm sure you've heard this before) is ... stellar! (little astrophysicist humor).It's engrossing and entertaining and definitely a PAGE TURNER!There are a TON of things left out of the movie (necessary for a 2 hour movie), and these details, for me, make the book great.Also the ending is MUCH more fulfilling than the movie. In the movie it's more of a nature of 'faith' dilemma....definitely not Sagan's message. In the book it's more of a 'fabric of space' ending...and I won't say more...no spoilers.Buy it, read it, if you like Sagan, you'll love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great blend of science and art","review":"What a great read! I have become quite the fan of Carl Sagan after reading this book. It was a required read for a Astronomy course I am taking - initially I was a little taken back that the professor would require a science fiction novel to be read for the class, but upon finishing \\"Contact\\" I understood why.Carl Sagan ingeniously incorporates real science and an honest opinion about the unexplored frontiers of space with a very beautiful, artistic view of our real world, and real emotions that we deal with every day.One of the best books I have read in a while. I immediately sent it to a friend to read and he loves it too."},{"rating":"1","title":"book, Contact","review":"I saw the movie first and I liked the movie.

For example, at one point he causes a character to remark that information can be found in the digits of pi. And the writer seemed to have no idea that ALL information can be found SOMEWHERE in those digits. Why? Because the digits of pi are infinite and random. So, somewhere is your phone number, and somewhere else is the product of your zip code multiplied by the square root of your zip code added to your age. Get it? ALL information can be found to exist in an infinitly long and random string. The only issue is how much computing time will be required to find such. Anyway, his character was supposed to have a good knowledge of math and did not understand this simple fact. In fact, she was quite driven by her ignorance of such things."},{"rating":"2","title":"a staple is a staple, what can i say","review":"fits good in arrow t-18 wire tacker and works ok even though the rows of staples are too long to put into the gun and have to be broken off and shortened."},{"rating":"2","title":"T-18 Staples","review":"The Vendor was very good at sending me the T-18 staples, they came packaged properly, no loose staples in the box or tiny pieces that you spend much time putting into the stapler which only cause jams.

All you have to do is get someone to spray air into your computer through the fan hole in the back (you can even do it yourself with a can of air). Just make sure you do it outside, because I guarantee that a lot of stuff will come flying out! I am speaking from experience--I was really peeved when my computer started to overheat andthe fan was really loud and turn off randomly less than a year after I bought it, but when I got it aired out it went back to normal.

This is one of three Kong toys I bought him at Christmas (I also got him a Kong dental bone and a Kong bounzer ball). He's had a classic Kong for a year that he gets peanut butter in everyday that is just starting to show its abuse. I've found that these Kong toys far outlast many other toys I've bought him that claimed to be indestructible, and this ball has thus far held up wonderfully. I would certainly purchase other Kong products without hesitation.

The second one has lasted over a year - in fact it's still going now, but it has started getting stuck on his teeth, and I expect it to die any time now. Hence I bought a replacementMy Dane plays with his ball ALL the time. There is MUCH chewing. so for these things to last a year and still not be destroyed is good in my book!

Its a very large bright red rubber ball.

DO NOT throw this ball directly at a hard surface that has an angle or could bounce into an angle. This is the second time i have thrown a hard rubber ball, only to have it come flying back at me and breaking my nose. $8 toy, plus a $450 doctors visit makes this the most expensive dog toy i have ever purchased.

The black lab loves to put holes in all the toys and tennis balls I give to my dog--which then turns into my dog tearing at the puncture holes. I decided to buy the Kong Ball to reduce the number of tennis balls I go through. He has yet to puncture the Kong ball. Because the Kong ball is simply a rubber ball, it is a lot heavier than a tennis ball. At first it was more difficult for my dog to catch and carry over long distances. It also makes more noise when it hits the ground if you're not on the ground level in a house/apartment. The Kong ball resembles a Lacrosse Ball in size, weight, and construction. If you play with the Kong ball on a tennis court or any hard surface, it will bounce A LOT. It's funny to watch my dog try and jump to catch it in the air and completely miss. I do recommend this ball if you want to cut down on your dog destroying tennis balls."},{"rating":"1","title":"too heavy for a small dog","review":"I have a ball-obsessed smallish dog, and the vet recommended this ball as being better for her teeth. it is very heavy and she isn't at all interested in it.

It bounces well on harder surfaces, is easy on the teeth and big enough they can't choke on it. It will float in salt water, but takes a while to come up so not particularly useful around the water.

Everytime he goes outside he runs and gets the ball, brings it to me to throw and has a blast with it.

I've probably read thousands of books but this one was incredible!

Almost six yearslater, I'm on my third paperback copy. Not bad considering i re-read itabout once a month! It is the absolute best book I have ever read in my life so far, and I have no doubt that it will be for the rest of my life. Aztec quite literally makes every other epic/historical, or even 1000pp+, novel I've read pale in comparison (i.e. Gone With the Wind, Heaven and Hell, Les Miserables, etc.). It's also the only one that I hope never makes it to the Big Screen, because it would be a mockery of Jennings' talent for vividly describing what that era was like so that the reader may see it in their mind. \\"It would be a sullying\\" of how I feel about this book.

You will experience everything the character went through as if you were involved in the conflict. This book brought out every emotion the main character was feeling and I have never read a book that has done that. I praise this book and I have already started reading it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"History at it's best","review":"Jennings has opened up a world that only a few have had the opportunity access. If the study of history is to understand why people make the choices they do , then Aztec is history at it's best. Through the eyes of a talented opportunist who stumbles his way to the very top of Aztec society , the reader is challenged to accept concepts so foriegn to our understanding and experience that they can quickly be labled \\"barbaric\\" or \\"perverted\\". To do so would be a pity for the reader who , to fully enjoy and benefit from this reading experience, must suspend much of what he/she brings to the table as \\"correct\\" and \\"civilized\\". That accomplished , hold on to your seat and enjoy one of the most enjoyable and educational reads out there.

I felt no connection or emotions for any of the characters. In fact, my strongest feeling was usually one of repulsion.

If you are looking for a historical fiction to transport you to another time, try something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"am I the only one?","review":"Everyone seems to love this book. I suppose if you're comparing it to Michener, it would be daring. As a historical novel, it is exhaustive. I'd rather read an ethnography, however. The writing is repetitive, unimaginative, and endless. The sex and violence is completely gratuitous; are we really to believe the Aztecs had small trained children performing ritual (and graphically described) sexual acts on people? I'm not a prude, but I felt as though Jennings was taking pleasure in describing some of the most violent and sickening acts by proxy. Clocking in at over 1000 pages, it has lost the battle for my attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are we reading the same book?","review":"(...)I enjoy a good erotic novel, but this book thinks itself to be an historical book.If you love detail, pick up a book by Umberto Eco. Don't waste your money and more importantly your time in reading this junk. If you want to learn about history research it in the library.

The first sex scene was good but after that it just seemed like the author was trying to be sensational - which I find boring. This sex stuff is interspersed with all sorts of violence and cruelty in the guise of religious ritual, accidents,etc - also boring to me. Furthermore, I felt this wasn't giving me a genuine picture of Mexico in the 16th century. When my daughter told me she was half-way through the book and was still waiting for a plot to emerge, I decided I was going to toss the book and assume that the rest of it was going to be 99% garbage like the first quarter. Why waste my time any more? I gave it 2 stars because it is well-written, that is, readably written."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Forrest Gump of the Aztec World","review":"Ok, so I exaggerated a little in the title. The main character isn't mentally challenged like Forrest Gump. But he does have an uncanny ability to be at the right place at the right time. Did you know that he even invented eyeglasses?I am a huge fan of historical drama, and was looking forward to learning more about the Aztec world. I just couldn't get past the poor writing, which was bordering on the melodramatic. Don't even get me started on the almost laugh-out-loud bad sex scenes. One woman's vagina was referred to an an opening bud. Could the author get any more cliched?It was a true test of will power for me to finish reading this book. I would give it 1/2 star if possible."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm perplexed","review":"I'm honestly perplexed as to how people enjoyed this book (nothing against them, I read the reviews online before I started and was excited to read this book).As other reviewers said, it's very annoying how the narrative stops every few chapters so that the main character can talk to the Spanish. I also feel Jennigs uses these interupttions to show how much of a difference there was between Spanish and Aztec culture. Hey Jennings - NO KIDDING. He was pushing the blatently obvious every few chapters making you feel like an idiot.Another bad part was that it was hard to follow. The name of the main character changed every few paragraphs, it seemed.Secondly, the entire book had no direction whatsoever. He randomly started doing things for no reason. I wanted to read a story, no some schmuck's life story!If you haven't read historical fiction and want to kick it off with an epic, I would suggest Keith Follett's Pillars of the Earth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Pages 52-85 and pages 117-148 printed twice","review":"Very dissatisfied with the printer of this book since pages 52-85 are missing and pages 117-148 are printed twice."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books I've ever read.","review":"From the heights of Mixtli's successes to the depths of his tragedies, this book captures you and does not let go.

The colorful and graphic depictions of certain scenes in the life of the main character are actually a plus, since they add considerable verve to a narrative as long as this one. The only thing I missed were subplots told from a standpoint other than the narrator's first person. Bishop Zumarraga's letters to the Spanish King give the reader some respite, but a few intertwined accounts added to the main plot might have brought more variety to the style."},{"rating":"1","title":"great if it wasnt for all the pedo stuff","review":"I liked it, but unfortunatly the guy seemed to love adding the fact that the main dude in the book had sex with a 7 year old boy in graphic depiction, had sex with his 13 year old sister when he was like 10.

Sólo una nota de advertencia (no lea lo que sigue si planea leer el libro): ningún inquisidor o autoridad eclesiástica en general habría ejecutado JAMÁS a un prisionero en el cual nada menos que el Empreador español hubiera mostrado interés. Me sorprende que Mr Jennings, tan detallista en otros aspectos, se haya plegado tan acríticamente al recurso facilista de la \\"leyenda negra\\".In enjoyed this book enormously. A warning note only (don't read this if you plan to read the book): no Inquisitor, no clerical authority would EVER have executed a prisoner on whom no less than the emperor had showed interest.

The narrative is so beautifully descriptive, one is surprised to find they are in the present when pausing to catch their breath. The characters met and the lessons learned remain with the reader forever. I have read this book when it first came out, then again eight years later, and yet again this year. Reading it once again around 2010 is something I am eagerly awaiting. P.S.

I enjoyed the book so much that I immediately bought the sequel and am finding it just as intriguing. Gary Jennings clarifies how \\"primitive\\" the Aztecs were compared to the Conquistadors: throughout the book I found myself thinking of the Conquistadors as the primitive, barbaric ones while I rooted for the Aztecs to defeat the invasion even though the end result is already known. An informative, funny, sad book which leaves you wanting more. Journeyor is definitely going to be my next purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best historical fiction epic ever written!!!","review":"As a big fan of the historical novel, (Clavelle, Michner, et al..),I have got to say that this novel really got to me.I first read \\"Aztec\\" in 1980. I read it over every 5 years or so. Let me compare it with \\"Andersonville\\"(7.5) or \\"Shogun\\"(8). This book got me interested in the Spanish conquests of both the Aztecs and the Inca. You become so engrossed with the story you may throw the book down at one point (as I did). What a GREAT story this is. It has it all,sex, religion, history and much more. The only problem with this wonderful book is that you will never find its' equal. The closest I've ever found is another novel by Jennings.\\"Journeyor\\"(9)It is almost in the same league as \\"Aztec\\".(about Marco Polo and his travels). I am so happy Jennings is about to release \\"Aztec Autumn\\". I've waited 16 years for more \\"Aztec\\", maybe this is it!? Read \\"Aztec\\". You'll read it over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"A vivid masterpiece!","review":"I could go on and write about how Jennings masterfully tells the story of the culture and the people of the ancient Aztec world.

Like the other commentors, I also read it more than once. I once lent it to my father to read. When he reached one of the first of many of Mixtli's sexual encounters, he called me in disgust to say how dissapointed he was that I read books like that. A week later, he called me to say that Aztec was the best book he'd ever read in his whole life! The history in the fiction was overwhelming!

Stop isn't the right word - pause is better, because already I can recognize that this is one of the best novels I've ever read, and once read, it will never be new again. So I go back, reread certian passages, and just reflect on an ancient civilization that was destroyed. Yes the novel is brutal - some of the things Gary thinks up are really really bizaar - and yet this is an epic story that grips me and leaves me imagining about the Aztec culture. Interestingly, I never really had an interest in the Aztecs before this, which again is the mark of an excellent story teller.One word of advice - don't read this late at night. You won't put it down and you'll never get any sleep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sin palabras...","review":"Even for me as Mexican, this was a breath taken story. There I was, in the militar academy in Mexico city, with my \\"Aztec\\" book in the militar History class. That book was more interesting than the class indeed.For moments I saw myself in Tlactli Mixtli's feet. Traveling all along the Aztec empire, and wishing have being in the conquest war against spanish troops.I think that the experience for me, was very special, because the militar academy's architecture, is based in Aztec meanings (i.e., the government office's shape is \\"texcaltlipoca\\", the aztec's God of war).I finished that book in a few days, and until now, is still the best I've ever read.I would really wish to meet somebody like Steven Spielberg, and tell them to read the book if they hadn't yet, and make a production about it...that would be a dream becoming true...Thanks Jennings."},{"rating":"2","title":"PUT ALL WORK AND PLAY ASIDE,THIS ONE WILL MAKE YOU FORGET","review":"AS A HISTORY BUFF, NEVER HAD I READ A BOOK SO ENJOYABLE AS AZTEC. GARY JENNINGS LITERALLY TAKES THE READER ON A JOURNEY SO MAGNIFICENT AND ADVENTUROUS THAT THE READER WILL REFUSE TO COME BACK.FROM HIS BOYISH DAYS IN MILITARY SCHOOL TO HIS OWN PERSONAL ACOUNT OF THE SPANISH CONQUEST, MIXTLI DOES WHAT EVERY MAN DREAMS ABOUT. THE WOMEN, ADVENTURE, MONEY, AND THE LOVE FOR A WOMAN THAT ONLY EXIST IN BOOKS. YOU WILL REMEMBER DARK CLOUD FOR YEARS TO COME. NO MOVIE REQUIRED, IT COULD NOT BE DONE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"Many books of this length tend to drag on until the reader grows bored and goes in search of another, but I'm happy to say that Aztec is not among them. The book's thousand-page span helps to make Mixtli and, indeed, all of the characters, seem less like characters and more like old friends with every page.Being only thirteen, it's size deterred me at first,(I hate putting down a book once I've started it) though once I began I found myself carrying it with me everywhere- especially at school- so as to get in a paragraph or two before the bell rang.As many people have pointed out, Aztec is not for the faint of heart. Jennings doesn't hold back a bit as he describes bloody ceremonies and oftentimes bizarre sexual situations. These aspects of the book didn't bother me personally, but as they occur frequently in the text, I would advise not trying to simply ignore them.In short, although Aztec might not appeal to everyone, I strongly suggest that you give it a try!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Summertime Read","review":"This is a very good book. It reads like a grand Greek epic. Mostly because it is full of tragedy. But its scope is so large that almost anyone will find something to like in it. I picked it out because I wanted to learn more about the Aztecs, and I was not disappointed. Be prepared to learn some Nahuatl. It can be confusing in parts, and starts out slowly, but after awhile it will start imposing upon your daily thoughts.

This movie is more like some diverse party overnight with them filming themselves singing and talking about their problems. I can't believe people actually like this!

Situations that you accepted on stage and characters you loved did not work in a more realistic setting. The age of the actors made a difference too. I left the movie theater thinking: \\"Wow, these are selfish people!\\" They kill dogs, whine about getting jobs and paying rent, and are drug addicts.

I love that they brought alumni back that have actually been in the play and could really, and I mean, really know how these characters are. It's a great film.It brings a new light to those that haven't heard of the show before. And it brings about so many different issues that have been such a big part of our culture. AIDS, lesbians, gays, druggies. And it's just a great film. I related to Mark the most, because of how he loves to film things.

Although it's extremely difficult to transpose a stage production onto film, I think Columbus did a great job in doing so. Sure, some of the acting was a little \\"larger-than-life\\", but that's what one must do on stage. It was a huge gamble bringing back the original cast, mainly because it's so hard to dilute a bombastic stage personality into a more realistic film one. I have experience that firsthand. But despite all of this, I found the characters very real and very moving. They weren't developed as they could have been, but I haven't been that emotionally moved in a long time. What the storyline lacks, the universal message and wonderful music makes up for. It is definitely one of my favorite post-Webber musicals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie of Love and Life","review":"Wonderful and Beautifully inspiring musical movie. I saw the movie opening weekend that it came out. I have yet to see the stage version, but I definitely will next time it comes to Pittsburgh. I loved musicals, and the movie is fantastic. My favorite character is Angel. I bought the dvd because I enjoyed the movie at the theater so much. Unforunately some scenes were cut from the version I saw at the movie theatre versus the version on my DVD, and some of them are not even in the deleted scenes. One is, but the ending of it is different. That was disappointing, I liked those missing scenes. They made the movie even more powerful. I don't know how they can cut scenes from a movie in between the theatre showing and the reproduction of the DVD. That is so wrong. Fortunately I have those scenes in my head because of how powerful they were and I also have the soundtrack from the movie, so when those songs come up, I picture those missing scenes. \\"Goodbye Love\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Rent","review":"My daughter LOVES it.

So many aspects in this movie - the struggle for integrity and self-expression in a conformist culture, the struggle for survival as an artist in a setting of poverty, homelessness, drug addiction, and life-threatening disease (AIDS); the struggle to relearn trust after tragedy. The songs are addictive too! - they run the gamut from joy and humor to tragedy and mourning to defiance and triumph.The second disc has a wonderful documentary about Jonathan Larson and how RENT came to be, along with scenes that weren't included in the final edit.I recommend this movie for ANYONE over the age of 16."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent broadway adapatation.","review":"I have seen both the broadway and movie versions of Rent.

The spirit of the stage presentation is very well conveyed in the film medium. I was certainly dissapointed to see that some scenes were cut, but the scenes removed admitedly contributed to the flow of the story... at least in some aspects. I higly recommend the film presentation of Rent but I urge anyone who has the opportunity to see the broadway presentation of Rent to take advantage of a rare chance-- it is truly rewarding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't hesitate to buy RENT","review":"I borrowed this movie for the first time a few weeks ago and after reading the reviews about it, I wasn't quite sure how I would feel about it. After watching it, I have to say that I LOVE this movie and bought it the next day. Regardless of what critics have written, I loved that they were able to get most of the original cast members to play the roles that made RENT a success. Yes, they are supposed to be in their 20's in the play but really, I barely noticed or frankly, could've cared less. I love Jesse L. Martin and he was fantastic. Idina Menzel's voice is super and was ever surprised that Rosario Dawson could sing. Anthony Rapp, Adam Pascal, Wilson Jermaine Heredia and Tracie Thoms were great as well. Yes they changed and omitted things that are in the Broadway play, but if you are truelly a fan of RENT, you will overlook that and just enjoy the one thing that is always present: the wonderful songs!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Get The Hype...","review":"Personally, I didn't understand the film or the musical. The message I understand, but the singing, dancing, music, and plot in general didn't really move me, convince me, or uplift me. I understand that in even the most depressing themes in a musical, the music still remains exuberant and positive. But something about the music in RENT didn't seem to fit. I found them to be lackluster and not catchy at all. The characters were bland and boring to me. Not much personality, felt more like watching sterotypes on screen with no depth, emotion, or feeling. One of the actresses who played a lesbian was truly the most horrible and over the top actor I've ever seen, just ridiculous and annoying. I'm glad i watched this with a few co-eds than by myself, it made it a tiny bit more enjoyable. Personally though, i hate the movie, and i just don't understand the musical. Great themes, but just so dry, lackluster, and at times just a bit unrealistic and boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT MOVIE AND SOUNDTRACK AND PLAY","review":"Wow where do I start?

BUT....what stuck with me was the friendship and how they connected to each other and the songs. So I bought the dvd, saw watched the movie again, and like it better the 2nd time around.

Most of them sing pretty well with a notable exception of the headliners Diggs and Dawson - they're painful and I wished they just lipsynced to someone with a voice.The movie, however, left me cold. What bugged me most is the Hollywood schmaltz laid thick all over what is purpotedly the late 80s' NY. What was a gritty, sick, and extremely creative scene has been transformed out into cutesy entertainment. In this Starbucks version of late 80s East Village, junkies and AIDS sufferers feature cool clothes, perfect bodies, clear skin, and neat haircuts. Their suffering is largely outside the camera shot. Not only the whole farce felt cheap, it seemed to cheapen the experience of those who lived, died, and created on that scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life, love, and friendship--all in once neat little package.","review":"I went to see Rent over the weekend, and I must say, I loved the story.

Though returning members did look older than their characters would have been, it didn't impair the story at all. I absolutely fell in love with Adam Pascal's performance as Roger.

Trying to persuade me with desperate fan comments will be a waste of your time. The characters are not likable; they are one dimensional, frivolous, and self-centered. Also the entire reason we are supposed to feel bad for them is because they have aids. Aids is a serious illness that shouldn't be made light of as it is in this horrible production. If you want to see a good play/movie about aids awareness, go see \\"Angels in America\\" instead. Furthermore the story line is slow moving and (obviously because of the weak characters) boring.

Is one of the very few broadway musicals with a rock and roll beat. The story is very poignant once you realize that most of the main characters have AIDS and expect to die soon.

Several catchy tunes too."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Holiday Movie Ever","review":"I saw Rent twice in the theater, once on opening night. I have never been to a movie that made me laugh and cry at the same time. The fact that Chris Columbus was able to get most of the original cast for this movie made it even more special. Don't let the fact that the movie talks about AIDS influance you. The topic is as relevent now as it was almost 10 years ago when the Broadway Play opened. This movie shows how people live with diseases, being poor, and battle drug addiction, yet still are true to themselves, they are true friends and more of a family than some familys I know. And they fight to be better people everyday. This movie makes grateful for what I have and makes me want to do more for others too.

Every minute I had to watch started to seem like a whole hour. Even my wife who is a huge fan of musicals in general found this film extremely distasteful and horrible.

There are some excellent parts (Santa Fe) and some terrible ones (What You Own Britney-style music video) but all in all it is mediochre. If you can't see the show on stage, see the movie. But do not judge the show by it. The experience is so different. I wouldn't recommend the movie to anybody unless they know that they will never get to see it on stage. It just feels flat and forced.Note how Roger and Mark throw their papers into the trash can to heat up their apartment.

And this might have been more enjoyable... just maybe - if that had been the case. The songs were just awful to begin with. The forced rhymes and lyrical stupidity. The checklist of one of each type of expected broadway song. The bad bad acting. Idina Menzel baffles me. She is truly frightening to look at, like a shark in leather pants, and her voice's nearest approximation would be a cat strangling itself. The whole story is as thin as onion skin and not one of the actor's invests any energy into their character - the exception would be Angel. And not one of them made me care one iota.

The plot is weak and difficult to follow - there's a strangeness about the whole thing. Something key is missing; there's nothing to tie it all together.

To be quite honest I don't think I've turned it off since, and I bought it in November.I also want to respond to the review that said the PG-13 rating was inappropriate. The play is not intended for children, also I don't think any children who saw the trailer said \\"Mommy, Daddy, I want to see RENT!!!\\" Plus, kids don't pay attention to ratings anymore.

It was well done from the stand point of having the original cast, 6 months pre-production, boldness, electricifying performances, and punts. On the other hand, the movie lacked a sense of wholeness. Almost like following through a music video without any script. Even when script was added to it, they used punts, funny but not necessary. This is a serious theme of AIDS and 1990's. I didn't even know that ATZ is a AIDS mediaction, until I thought about it. It was sort of vague, although, I did watch a film about aids and their incapable of paying rent.

Those of you who liked this film, go watch Franco Zeffirelli's La Boheme, you'll change your mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"Right from the opening number you are pulled in.

If you have never seen this musical, DVD or on stage, just watch it. It is NOTHING like your typical musical. With it's heart wrenching roller coaster of emotions, excellent acting, amazing music, and astonishing talent it is well worth every penny. I LOVE IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No Day But Today","review":"When I saw RENT in Nov. I flipped out. I couldn't stop thinking about it. I really don't know what it did to me, but I know that EVERYONE should watch it. The music is beautiful. RENT has an important lesson for everyone to learn. Life is too short to take chances. If you waste your time worrying about what might happen tomorrow, then you'll never take a risk or do anything about anything. RENT has always been in my heart, nothing could bring it out until I saw the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Rent\\" -- Not too shabby.","review":"I'm not much of a reviewer, and even less of a theatre regular, so I'll keep this short. I just got back from a showing of \\"Rent\\" at the local $2.99 theater; it was so good that I figured I'd toss in my two cents here.The songs of \\"Rent\\" were all great; each was hugely entertaining, poignant or gripping for its part (my favorites were \\"One Song Glory\\" and \\"What You Own\\"). I'd admit to a little bit of back-row sniffling if I weren't such a manly man. But to be honest, I hadn't realized how large a part homosexuality and AIDS played here (\\"East Village\\" should have been warning enough) -- so if you're an avowed bigot then you might want to steer clear and preserve those delicate sensibilities. For everybody else...I'd say definitely give \\"Rent\\" a shot. As a picture of humanity (which most of us can relate to on some level) alone, it's time well spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stage Production..Great Soundtrack...Good Movie","review":"I have seen the stage production twice and I have also seen the movie. The stage production is better (as it is with every stage to movie production) however I did enjoy the move.

I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"AIDS awareness deserves a better musical","review":"I'm a sucker for musicals, I just love it when the characters sing their hearts out about their joys or troubles.But I couldn't stand this musical. I didn't see the show, but from the movie, I'd have no desire to. All but two of the characters are entirely incredibly self-centered, but we're meant to pity them and their tragic plight? Did I miss something? Why do they think (as they sing in the opening number) that they should be exempt from paying rent like the rest of the world? Why does the heroine think its acceptable for her to cheat on her loving, supportive life-partner at their commitment ceremony? Some of the songs are catchy-ish, but the overall attitude of the characters grated through the whole thing. Yuck. AIDS awareness deserves a better musical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!","review":"My son bought this as a gift for a friend and she loved it, especially that it was the special edition. They have watched it many times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"I love musicals, and this one had great songs, and fantastic actors. Rent took me through a range of emotions, and it was fun.It was fun to have some popcorn and park on the couch and be thoroughly entertained for a couple of bucks, than bother with the fuss and high price of going out.

I have seen Rent several times when it was still on tour and this movie does not come close to doing the story any justice. The movie took out a few numbers and changed the context of some of the story. It seems to drag on at times, which is disappointing. It is nice to see several members from the original cast, but event hey can't make this a great buy. I think the \\"Live\\" version is a much better purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"An amazing movie that does justice to the original stage production. Performances are wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best musicals around","review":"If you love musicals, or even just like them...Rent is the way to go. I've never watched something with such power and emotion through song. All the actors are on point with every part of the movie, capturing what Jonathon Larson once created. I'm glad Chris Columbus decided to get the majority of the OBC in the movie - i don't think the magic would've been there if he had went with the original idea of the like of Christina, Justin and Beyoncé.This DVD, is also worth getting just for the 2hr documentary on Jonathon and Rent. It is an unbelievable piece, and that will make you think twice about your life, and make you want to follow your dreams."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Love Rent","review":"I've seen it twice on Broadway, and once in the movie theater.

Well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I have never seen the play RENT but went to the opening day showing of the movie with several of my rent-head friends. It was one of the most amazing movies I had ever seen. The muisic combined with the heartfelt story of seven friends united by their love of a good time combined with their everyday struggle with AIDS whether they themselves have it or their friend has it. It is a truely touching story illustrating the finer points of true friendship and the hardships that people without an income living with AIDS face on a daily basis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good is Good","review":"I've heard that some Amon Duul 2 fans don't really like this release because it's not as experemental as their earlier ones. I love this album just as much as I love their earlier ones. Many bands get stuck in a rut because they want to do somthing different, but are afraid to because they may allienate(spelling?) fans. Of course one must also remember that Amon Duul 2, had many personneel changes durring their existance, and this alone will cause difference's in sound from album to album. However as I said in the header good is good"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice reading","review":"This story show us how a woman can give a man strength to be alive, Malcolm wanted to be dead until he saw Ariella, you also find out that if you want something you really have to fight for it, because if you don't do anything for yourself nobody will, and another interesting point is that maybe for you something is perfect, but for anyone else won't be so perfect.The story of the book is nice, not amazing, not incredible, just nice, is not a page turner but you can relax and read it, for example (as I did) on two or three rainy days, when you just must be at home."},{"rating":"2","title":"At last, a hero who's not perfect!","review":"Pick up \\"Once a Warrior\\", and be prepared to be glued to it to the end. Karyn Monk's characters are as unpredictable as predictable. Alpin, the seer, smacks of Disney's Merlin in \\"Sword in the Stone\\"; Ariella, the heroine, is the stereotype beautiful-slender-smart combination so loved in romances; Roderic, the villain, is the classic self-centered, cruel, but handsome bad guy. The surprise character in this book is the hero, Malcolm, a.k.a. the Black Wolf. A once fearless warrior, the man has been reduced to drinking excessively to kill the pain of battle wounds that twist and torture his body. The story is thick with deception and truth, realism and fantasy, humor and horror. You'll cheer for the good guys, snarl for the bad, and applaud for the entire book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Major Dissapointment","review":"I have read every single book by Karyn Monk and I have loved all of them except this one. I didn't even finish the book it was so bad. The heroine was annoying and condescending towards the hero and the hero eas just a washed-up has been. The characters just did not work for me. What happened to the magic she so aptly displayed in all of her other books? Well I guess every author writes at least one unsatisfactory book or two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing CD","review":"I heard this CD being reviewed on NPR's All Things Considered and really liked the snippets they played.

Yo Yo Ma, as usual, gives a great performance. The sound engineer, Richard King, should be run out of his profession.

Wars that were supposed to be about religious ideals mostly in reality seem to have been efforts for the maximum of territory to be conquered.I think this is one of the best ways to see how these systems worked.The horse and the sailing ship seemed to be a limiting factor to these empires and help to the smaller sane city states.I like the book very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Beginners","review":"Maybe a four or five star video for intermediate to advanced students, but definitely not for beginners."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Way of Tai Chi Ch'uan","review":"This video is enjoyable and easy to use &#65533; the instructions are clear, the history and philosophy of Tai Chi are well presented, the movements are well filmed using different angles, and the music is appropriate &#65533; it is so peaceful that I entered a state of great serenity while watching.This is a wonderfully constructed instructional video on Tai Chi. Lana Spraker exudes health and inner peace. The practice of Tai Chi clearly works for her!I recommend it highly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"Deborah Moggach is a consistently good read. 'The Ex-Wives' is another example of her ability to introduce characters with whom the reader can identify. They are sympathetic characters, with flaws, a complexity familiar to all of us. At the same time, the situations Moggach devises are unique.This particular novel has a happy ending, although some of her novels do not. However, rather than producing a simplistic story with the 'good' characters winning and the 'bad' characters losing, we are presented with a story that can be read at several levels.I found this novel an easy read, great for a night by the fire. Considering the wintery conditions here, a very good idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased","review":"I recently received these bags.

A lot of cheaper UPSes lack the mute button, and when the power goes out at my house, I have beeping all over the place.You might argue that the Belkin software can mute the UPS (not sure if it really does or not), but the software SUCKS badly on both Windows XP and Mac OS X. It's absolutely horrible. I can tell you that the UPS software DOES properly shutdown my G5 tower quickly when the power goes out (haven't tried it with my XP machine).For only a little more APC offers a 1500 VA unit with a voltage meter on it and a physical mute button.

Masis) is located.On other points he talks about humankind seemingly only 6,000 years old (as most Biblical versions claim if generations are taken literally in Genesis). Well, like another book written in the early 1960's (The Genesis Flood) this book is out of date badly on the age of humankind as DNA studies have since totally proven human life is much older than the few thousand years these books claim.

It's a great resource to give you some background information without commentary, allowing you to come to your own conclusions. However, it is an abbreviated version of the Halley's Bible Handbook so it reads more like lecture notes or an outline. If you're looking for complete sentences and completed thoughts, get the revised and expanded edition, not this one.This book small enough that it's not too bad to carry around, but it's still about the size of 3 paperback books sandwiched together so it's definitely bigger than pocket-sized.

The women were nor even remotely appealing, which might have been a saving grace on some level. The story was NOT sexy at all and was hardly what I would call a love story - now, I only watched it once (because that is all I could take) so maybe I was missing the deeper meaning behind the characters or the plot - but I must say, to me, and I am only one voice out there, this was a waste of money and time - it actually gave me the creeps.

Bradford Dillman is well cast as the chilly manipulator who tries to orchestrate a gold mine disaster in the hope that the ensuing stock market confusion will translate into riches for him and his offshore based investor cronies. John Gielgund's short stint is competent as ever. I am not a fan of Roger Moore's usual over acting but he delivers a credible performance here and then of course there is Susannah York, lovely to watch as ever - the attraction between the two also works well. All of this together with Peter Hunt's excellent direction, translate into a great and very entertaining action thriller. Although not platinum material, it is more than solid gold.

On the other hand, if you have other responsibilities and interests that will prevent you from investing many hours daily in this game, you should skip it altogether. It's way to complicated, and the other players are way too immersed in it, for you to have any fun with anything less than an all out effort.

In the towns you can walk two steps, lag for 5 secs, walk 2 more, wait another 5 secs, etc. It all gets to be particularly irritating when these glitches appear during combat. Whoops, you're dead!

The controls are sluggish and unresponsive, it is impossible to win by pinfall, the camera angles are confusing, and there is STILL no voiceover or commentary! In this day and age, no voiceover or commentary is just plain sad. Also, Create-a-championchip, create-a-pay per view are also absent in this GameCube version, but automatically included in Smackdown vs. RAW 2006. THQ is totally biest to PS2 and Xbox.

So rather than getting a different episode each time you get the same episodes (but in different sequence) on different discs. This is what I would call a RIP-OFF. When 8 discs of episodes are advertised as a set, they ought to be 8 discs of DIFFERENT episodes.There are other disappointments associated with the purchase of this set. There are no episodes with Miss McGillicutty. As well, the episodes chosen tend to be fairly violent.All in all, this is a disappointing compilation of a much loved series."},{"rating":"1","title":"wish I never bought it","review":"I actually bought this from Walmart for $5 and even so, I still would not buy it if I knew that they put \\"Platinum Disc Corporation\\" in the lower right corner of the picture as you are watching it.

However, he did enjoy the song about the rain, and he really likes to see anything with Zoey in it. Probably because Elmo isn't in it at all he doesn't take as much of an interest in it, as Elmo is the character he appears to feel the most comfortable with and helps link him with the other characters. Also it seems that the concepts in the video are for a slightly older child. Still, an enjoyable amd worthwhile video, as are all Sesame Street videos! I do prefer the newer 50 minute Elmo's World video formats, as does my son."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent while they lasted","review":"I purchased two of these. They worked great until the light bulb burned out.

I've had no problems while using it in that manner. No kids touch it, so maybe it's a 'adult' vcr (shrug).And I love the light on the remote.My only complaint would be the rear a/v hookups. The inputs/outputs don't stick out. Instead, it has a little compartment, where all the inputs are deeper than the rest of the plastic...

I really liked Freyja's character development in a Summer to Remember, and I had hopes for the hero that win her over. This hero is foppish with his colored coats and teasing and constantly grinning manner. I don't like this type of hero, but if you do, then maybe you would enjoy this book.

I've played through with each of these, and I love them dearly, but not queerly. Sun Shang Xiang has good speed also, and should be considered if you want to defeat Lu Bu the first time playing as her.The upgrading of weapons was possibly the best feature they could put in there.

If you like action adventure games that take place in the past in ancient times get this game its great. The weapons are so tight they have mystical powers and can kill over 20 enemies in one attack.

It is a great improvement over the \\"2\\" -- for example, now you and your buddy can team up (split screen) and work together to kick butt and strategize. For those of you who enjoyed the PSX \\"JEDI POWER BATTLES\\" and the coop style there, you will love this.DW3 isn't smart and funny like Metal Gear Solid 2 (the only game I can think of that deserves 5 stars) -- but it is a very enjoyable game. Definitely BUY it -- if you rent it, you'll miss out on a lot.Last note: I dunno why this game is so hard to come by? Limited Release?

However, my cousin has told me he has read about some of the men who lived back then.In the game, you can play up to 40 different characters, each with a different weapon and so on. Most people are unlocked and you have to do something special to unlock them. Doing a \\"Musou Mode\\" usually unlocks some new people and get thier 2nd and 3rd level weapon. You also get bodyguards, starting with only 2, but you get more bodyguards as you level up.The toughest guy in the game is Lu Bu and he is very dangerous to low-level characters.

The further you get into the book, the more you're aware that the main character, a variant of an investigator, has no people skills, no organizational skills, no technical skills, and no INVESTIGATIVE skills. He basically moves through the book by thrashing around and luckily finding others to follow up on the hints he gets from his psychic skills. How we're supposed to believe that he could ever put food on the table as an investigator I don't know.

It serves to show God's love and grace in people's lives, and how He can work when lives are completely surrendered to Him. I would definitely recommend this book if you have read \\"Not My Will\\". I think it's also good to read in women's Bible study or a Christian women's discussion, or book club.

No matter where we are we are always connected to those we love with invisible strings. This book is not just for the loss of a loved one. I think it's great for those moments when a child is away from someone they love....like thunderstorms at night, going to school, a parent away for work or just living further away from a family member or friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"inspirational","review":"I have given this book to many adults as well as children.

My brother in law died in December and my sister in law is moving several states away. so i bought 2 of these books so the cousins could stay connected even though they are miles apart. it also added another way to explain that Daddy(and Uncle) is still with us.

As I researched, I came across this book. I LOVE this book. It is a beautiful sentiment. I wish I had had it when I was a child. It would have helped me when my parents divorced and when i was afraid during a storm.I think EVERY home should have a copy of this book. It is appropriate for ANY AGE toddler to adult. I recommend this book to anyone. Not only for dealing with grief but for children with separation anxiety, with far away relatives and more.Do not hesitate to buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome for any separation from a loved-one","review":"We bought this book because our,then 2 1/2 year old, daughter was having trouble being away from me. But upon reading it we found this to be a pleasant jewel for any loss. We lost our Nanny (Grandparent to a heart attack at 62 yrs old). This charming book helps them with her death as well. Our little one talks about being able to feel Nanny pulling her string and they pull hers. It works for our long distance grandparents as well who live in another state. When I send them off to school they both (ages 5 and almost 3) talk about pulling my string. It worked wonders for her separation anxiety--now she bounces off to preschool! I would recommend this book to anyone who is separated from a loved one...through death, location, dad or mom in military, or just going off to school for a few hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching Story","review":"Very touching story. Bought for a 5 year old that lost her father. Also plan to order another for a 3 year old with deployed father. And another for <1 year old with both parents deploying.

I never saw the movie that went with this album, but the music was enough. Angry and defiant, iconoclastic and nihilistic, Ms. O'Connor's music and lyrics were ahead of her time.

I immediately (somehow) got my hands on a casette tape of the soundtrack which I proceeded to wear down through repeated playings. I seem to remember the tune \\"pissing in a river\\" (as I later learned, by Patti Smith) as a prominent anthem of the movie and can't seem to understand why it wouldn't be included in this soundtrack? Is my memory somehow defective or are there tunes in the movie that somehow didn't make it into this OST?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Piece of work","review":"Wow!! what a timeless masterpiece, Hazel's music is still wonderfully exciting and vibrant, sung with a true passion and meaning.

It is a fusion of punk, early techno, and jazz in an addicting production that is much like a traffic accident-you can't help looking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful nihilism at its best","review":"Reminiscent of Lene Lovich's powerful work, Hazel O'Connor absolutely blew me away the first time I heard this. I only knew this music from the soundtrack, a gift from a Dutch friend when it was first released. Then, to see the music attached to dangerous, disturbed images in the movie was almost too much for one sitting. Through it all, however, is O'Connor's voice, raging against the straighjacket placed around us by society, industry and our blind obedience to technology at any cost.The amazing thing is this jarring, strident album has real lyrics, real melody, harmony. It is music - in a genre when those values are often ignored or rejected."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it","review":"I saw the film in 1983 and I loved it.

I am still finding uses for the new features. Adobe was very helpful with regard to loading CS2 on the second of the two computers that one license permits.

I find Photoshop CS2 is too complexe in its structure, vocabulary and workflow philosophy for the occasional user. I reckon it takes at least 2 full weeks of training to manage this software, far too much in my opinion, I mean we're talking of image processing ... in comparaison it took me 1 week to manage Autocad and about 2 weeks for a FEA pro softaware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Photoshop CS2 is a terrible program.","review":"PS CS2 is a terrible program. There are a couple of major bugs I found:First, and most annoying, is it's 'sluggishness'. For example, there is often a lapse of a second or two from the time you try to execute a command and that command actually starts. While this may not be too serious a problem for a novice, it is a real pain when you are trying to use the program professionally on a powerful computer.Second, the new \\"Bridge\\" is a total flop. It's too slow to use, and full of bugs. For example, it sometimes loses files! That's an unacceptable bug, but it still hasn't been fixed by Adobe. Some files, like large tiffs, won't preview at all. And that's only the beginning!PS CS is a much more stable and reliable program compared to CS2.

I am a CG Painter, and I use Photoshop to paint and create realistic special effects.I use Photoshop on a powerful Mac G5. I upgraded to CS2. Painting is now slow, when it doesn't freezes...or crashes! Even with their new upgrade it's not better. Their new brushes worked nice and quick in CS. Using the brushes for professional use is not possible any more.I hope they will fix these bugs, but it's been months I'm waiting for it , and it's not better.

Photoshop in general, too, but especially PS7: Mac.Anyhow, I have mixed feelings with this product. It's great by itself, but not that great compared to past products. The new filters are neat, but somewhat complex.As for the reviewer below stating a two-year college course is required- that's a bit extreme; I learned how to do this (without bothering with the manual, or asking questions) in a couple weeks, when I was fourteen. It's really, NOT that complicated. Just some of the newer things are.An incredibly powerful tool, obviously, and Adobe Bridge is pretty useful too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strong technology, lousy support","review":"Considering how much talent Adobe puts into product development, it amazes me how user-hostile their service is. I bought CS2 last week and cannot get Adobe Bridge to start. This is a critical problem since Canon RAW files (.CR2) from my 20D are not visible in the File/Open box. My fiancee spent three hours on the phone to Seattle today to try to get help, and when she finally got through, they wouldn't deal with her since she was not the registered user, even though she had the licence information. There is no information on Adobe's site regarding Bridge bugs. I don't know if this is also a problem on the Mac, but if you are an XP user, HOLD OFF ON CS2 until Adobe fixes the production bugs in its Bridge software, and gets a better handle on both its arrogance and quality control."},{"rating":"1","title":"Going back to Photoshop 7","review":"PS CS2 is a pain in the behind to install and activate (which you have to do via the web or telephone).But even beyond install & activate, it needs 222MB of hard drive space (versus the 136MB that PS7 uses), takes about a minute or so to open on my computer (Windows 2000, 260MB RAM, 18GB hard drive), and then uses a boatload of memory once it's running. Forget about trying to use another high-memory program at the same time you're using PS2.I'm going back to using version 7.

And that's enough for me to say, BEWARE of this set of applications! Adobe has allowed them to get too bloated, too slow, and the results are that all the programs (but principally GoLive, InDesign and Illustrator, in that order) are crashy and will quite suddenly, forcing you to expend the precious hours of your life redoing work you just finished. I cannot stress how disappointed I am in Adobe, and how distraught I am that we as a nation have allowed the only two competing companies to join, thus guaranteeing that there will be less quality and innovation in the future.

It is a seemingly loving, attractive family, but there is no joy in their lives, only meaningless ritual.The title refers to Australia, where they plan to escape, but they never make it.The Seventh Continent is Michael Haneke's first film, released in 1989, and based on a news story that he read. In this film he sets the pattern for many of his future films. He presents images, but does not try to explain the characters' motivation.

It comes with 4 action figures and other props that I don't really care about. In terms of accuracy of the model, it's pretty good except for the tail rotor which I understand should be mounted at an angle (instead of vertical). In terms of details, it's fair with rivets on the tail boom but not on the main body. In terms of durability, it's constructed fairly well with break-away main rotor for rough play. The movable doors will probably be the first to go.

There are slow blues, faster blues, rock etc and they are played in different keys so you need moore than one harmonica if you should be able to play them all(except if you play the chromatic harmonica). Some of the playing examples where good but I learned most from playing togheter with the Cd where I learned how and when bluessongs changes keys within the song.

Much sturdier, can hold a lot more weight, with a tilting mechanism that is simpler, easier to use, and far stronger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"We ordered this since our 2 kids in band were sharing a stand. We thought it would be a quality product for their practice time at home. When we set it up the first time, the screws that tighten the stem parts would not tighten, so the stand would not stay at the correct height. Did not seem to be made well at all. Returned for refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent, does the job","review":"5'9\\" it's a decent height if I put it almost as high as it can go. (If I go to the max height it will be unsteady and useless). The head portion is bigger than most usual stands in terms of it being more of a rectangle than the usual folding music stand so the music sheets on it stay steadier. Also the page \\"clips\\" have a spring on them as well as a pivot to make them more maneuverable.Generally if you need a cheap music stand that does the job and are about my height or shorter then go for it. I think that past 5'!!\\" it wouldn't make sense unless you're planning to be in the seated position perpetually."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 Star Stand","review":"Surprisingly this stand did arrive undamaged even though it was not in a box.

The stand is very poorly made. The part of the stand that would hold your music is held together with a series of rivets, most of which broke upon setting up the stand for the first time.

The first one was for me and the second for my son who is now taking lessons on guitar. It is light weight, easy to set up and take down. Liked the wide area for sheet music. Very inexpensive. One of the gismo that holds the sheet music keeps falling off on mine. Not a problem as I use a plastic clothes pin. I had noticed on my son's stand the gizmo is different and improved.

Robert Stahl"},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant surprise","review":"As a 30-yr Rush fan, I buy everything that these guys put out. Even their worst efforts (Vapor Trails? Hold Your Fire?) are better than 99% of the junk that passes for rock n roll/metal these days. After hearing \\"A FAR CRY\\" on the radio, I wasn't too excited about this album, although with the dearth of quality stuff out there today, I was more than willing to buy it rather than download it. I'm glad I did. One of the things that I mark as a great album is if it gets better by the listen, and this does. I read somewhere that one of the pink floyd guys, gilmour, I think, gave Alex some advice to \\"go acoustic.\\" It was a great suggestion.I would put the musicianship of Rush up against anyone.

It reminds me of a Rockline interview Geddy gave back in the late '80s. When asked how the \\"Music by Lee & Lifeson. Lyrics by Peart\\" thing worked, Geddy commented that, although complex, Neil's writing rarely left him \\"with a mouth full of words I can't sing\\" (paraphrased).From start to finish, Geddy sounds like he has a mouthful of words that are not only un-sing-able, but are lacking in the creative insight which has been one of Rush's halmarks. Really, really terrible, and SAD to boot.Is this the end of the road???"},{"rating":"2","title":"Far Cry, great single...","review":"I haven't heard the album, but heard the single 'Far Cry'. Normally, a single paves the way for the whole material. I can only find mature work here.Been a longtime Rush fan, and maybe that's why I couldn't try to find the same thing they did 30 years ago. It's not 2112, it's someting new and fresh, it's not Vapor Trails either. I liked it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"After the disappointment of Vapor Trails, I was hoping for improvement. Let me start by saying I first saw Rush as a backup band to Kiss in 1974. I have seen them more than a dozen times since. They are probably one of the best live bands ever. Snakes and Arrows does not do them justice. On the first listen, you have trouble distinguishing between the songs. After a few times through you begin to hear the nuances and distinctions. It is definitely better than Vapor Trails but a far cry from their earlier work. There seems to be a dark side to this CD and it left me feeling kinda depressed after listening to it. Long time Rush fans will probably like it, but you have to give it a long listen and then decide."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rush strikes again","review":"Got the new Rush this morning. I am extremely pleased (as usual). Rush is one of the most consistent bands in delvering quality music. They never rush things (excuse the pun) just to get new material out to make money. As for the new CD, it's not as hard or edgy as I was expect, but I think it really works. The instrumental \\"Hope\\" was mellow and very enjoyable. Nice arrangements and thoughtful lyrics make Snakes and Arrows another must for Rush fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST HAVE","review":"Their best effort in years - I enjoyed the whole thing and it's been a long time since I liked a RUSH album from first track to last."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE--This is NOT DVD-Audio","review":"This is NOT a DVD-Audio disc and will NOT play on a DVD-Audio player.

Did their producer have the nerve to compare it to 2112, AFTK, Hemispheres? Whatever. Bring Terry Brown back! Every so many years Rush puts out a new cd and every year I'm shocked that it's worse than the previous effort. I'm sure fans all summer long will be wishing songs like Dreamline, Xanadua, Red Barchetta, 2112, Subdivisions would hurry up and get over on tour so Rush can play tracks off this monstrosity. I don't mean to be so down on the boys, but I know they could do so much better. Couldn't they?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen again","review":"This is a must have for any Rush fan. I bought this album on the way back from a business trip and listened to it for about 3 hours. There are so many nuances and twists and turns that it takes several spins to wrap your head around it. In my humble opinion this is one of the best albums produced in the past 30 years. The music is seamless and flows from the disc into your brain and makes you crave another listen. As a music producer I could only hope to accomplish something of this caliber.Personally, I would rather wait 5 or 6 years between albums and hear something like this than all the garbage bands that crank out 2 or 3 albums a year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good!","review":"For someone (me) who is stuck on the hey day Rush (2112-MP) I am very happy with this CD. This reminds me of when Counterparts came out - I liked that as a stand alone CD not compared to old rush. The songs are catchy and deep and the production is fantastic. My ONLY complaint is that there is almost no odd meter which Rush does so tastefully (that's just me). That aside, some new stuff that I liked was the slightly bluesier guitar sounds. In fact the guitar sounds are amazing through out. The bass and drums sound perfect too.I have everything Rush ever did and will stick with them until either I or them are through. But I would recommend this CD to anyone who likes great songs with great production. Get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Rush CD","review":"Got to hear the new Rush CD from a friend of course i ripped a copy for myself. I don't know what the \\"Radio\\" guy is talking about.

The band has always been very complex and you sometimes have to get through the many layers to hear to the final product. To me not every Rush album gets five stars. The band definetly has evolved over the years and thats a good thing. What matters is this band has always had a lot of heart in their music and thats very important these days.

All in all this is good effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bring back Terry Brown!","review":"This album is too layered, too processed sounding, too compressed, etc. The producer needs to go.

These guys are truly great but there are just very few real songs here. The playing is impeccable and I like the intstrumentals, but where is the melody?

Why was this decision taken - the furore if the stereo mix was in MP3 only would be deafening yet Surround fans are expected to be grateful for the equivalent of MP3.The trouble is that if we boycott this, the labels will say there is no demand for surround, but if we buy it they assume we are okay about lousy quality.The much-touted MVI is a waste of time & effort unless MP3 and ringtones are your thing.I could not even register my comments because I do not have a US or canadian postcode, so that is also a waste of time.Shame - the stereo is superb, but the loss of resolution in surround makes me weep it is that bad.If you are a surround fan, avoid this - it is a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bust","review":"Rush, I like the theme, but you need to change. You must write lyrics and music simultaneously so that there is actually a cohesive groove to your music. What is wrong? It is all to obvious that most of your songs are lyricized first and then music FORCED into it after the fact. You cannot write lasting music that way. There is no melody-lyric-rhythm groove here that will ever be remembered. Sorry, change your writing method or you will continue to make forgetable albums to oblivion. You used to have a groove, you no longer do. You can have all of the musicianship in the world and not be able to write a SONG."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uninspired","review":"Sadly this is just more of the same uninspired and predictible music that plagued their last studio album. What happened to the brilliant orchestrations that characterized Rush music for such great works as Grace Under Pressure, Power Windows, Roll the Bones and Counterparts?It seems like the Canadian power trio has devolved into a self indulgent formula. None of these tracks really seem to stand out. I honestly felt like I was listening to the same song through the entire album.Rush really needs a creative producer to bring out their best. A producer to challenge their writing skills and push them to orchestrate their sound...A producer to save them from themselves. Unfortunately, Nick Raskulinecz couldn't accomplish this."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bore","review":"The past 5 or 6 years have been a time of growth and experimentation for Rush after their hiatus in the late 90s. But it has also been a time of reflection, thought, and utmost simplicity in their music. I have been a Rush fan for about 5 years and I own nearly all of their studio recordings and all of their DVD releases. So I know Rush's sound pretty well now.Snakes & Arrowsis just a disapointment to me. For me, it sounds likeTest for EchoII--it has 1 to 3 tracks that are actually good and the rest are just filler material or very mellow acoustic tracks. The only song I like here is \\"Far Cry\\" and besides that SNAKES is just a sleepy, monotonous album--at least for Rush. Sadly, I do not think that Rush will ever be able to compose as well as they did before theCounterpartsalbum. Yet, I congratulate Rush for trying as hard as they could to produce the kind of top-notch music that they were playing during the 70s and 80s. I can't wait to see Rush on tour this summer, though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE!!","review":"The MVI DVD will not play on some DVD-A players!

Fantastic song writing and musicianship as always from these guys. I hear that they are going to collaborate with Nick Raskulinecz on their next album which is great news.I will admit to being a die hard Rush fan and have very few complaints of any of their albums but the only reason I can't give the full 5 stars is due to the digital compression of the high frequencies which make listening at decent volume on great equipment a bit difficult. It is much better than Vapor Trails in this respect though. Hey Engineers, Not everyone is listening to MP3 files. Master the album better! The Band deserves it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Yep, sounds like Rush","review":"If you're a fan, this is a good one. If not, you're not going to like it.

They've always done what they wanted. They had to have signed off on how bad this thing sounds. From the outset it is a barrage of sound that hides anything that could be signature for these guys. You have to strain to hear Alex's solo's...what??? Your Alex lifeson.. a guitar legend!!! Turn up your solo bud!!! Geddy has no precision to his sound. Its blended so well you can't hear any one element.. The same guy wrote the bass lines to red barchetta...ugh...Neils kick is somewhere in the mix but again blended to well who knows. No matter where I tweak this I can't get it to pump without something else sounding like crap. I listen to vinyl run through parametric eq then graphic then through sennheiser headphones.

Too bad, I really wanted to like this album - I have lost touch with Rush since \\"Hold Your Fire\\" (been a while) but I cannot. In my honest opinion, it's lacking direction and cohesiveness. It's not totally terrible, as some reviewers suggest, but far from \\"amazing\\" as many others insist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a great album...","review":"I'll keep this fairly short given that this is one of about 500 reviews (which in itself says something about this band). This album rocks!!! Definitely their best in 20+ years. But more so it's just not the type of album you hear these days. There are 3 instrumental tracks on this album, all of which are being played on their current tour. In fact, counting a new (and great) drum solo from Peart the group performs 5 instrumental songs on their new tour. Who does that these days?Aside from loving this album, I love the seemingly throwback idea that it's the music that matters - and that's what's being put upfront - on the album and on tour. And for a band that's been around this long to be creating NEW music that is this good, this progressive and this energetic is incredible!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"into grander territory","review":"a creative and mysterious offering that bespeaks volumes about the pain, suffering, love and joy that these journeymen have experienced through the years. They really are survivors in more ways than one, capturing the elusive nature of enlightenment, or the striving toward enlightenment. Rush has always been the thinking person's choice of rock, managing to powerfully activate so many sensations with their music: cognitive, rhythmic, mystical...multiple nerve centers stimulated.While they take us into newer and richer aural landscapes with each release, I still long for those single rockers that explode with energy. Perhaps I need to give this one a few more listens. It is growing on me in sinuously magical ways."},{"rating":"2","title":"progression to perfection","review":"a memo to rushfan who wants another 2112 or moving pictures release------it ain't gonna happen, shouldn't ever happen, and thank allah it didn't happen with this release. topical, inspired, and sonically impressive, s & a delivers on a superior level. peart is obviously influenced by his demons lyrically but although dark it is very mature. hilites are workin them angels, good news first and the instrumentals. will be curious to see what songs will be played live outside far cry and monkey bidness and how they will handle the acoustic arrangement (if at all). embrace this work coming out in a sea of commercial crap being forced down our throats---booya."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snakepits and Sorrow!","review":"I actually borrowed this CD from a friend - I didn't want to throw my money away, I just needed to satisfy my curiousity. Smart decision. If Rush was unknown, and this was their first CD being played for the record execs, they would never get a recording contract. There's no substance here. Boring, mundane, uninspiring. I don't long for the \\"OLD\\" sound of Rush, I just hope that one day they recapture the MAGIC they once had. There's nothing wrong with changing your sound, you just can't be lazy and change it to junk. Too much filtering and electronics. Go back and listen to the blockbuster song \\"Spirit of the radio\\". The song was an enormous commercial success for many reasons. I'm not looking for another \\"Spirit\\", but I would like something equally bombastic for a change. I don't expect magic on every record, but once every couple of decades isn't really asking too much. Until that day comes, I've got very shallow pockets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad..","review":"I am a Rush fan from way back.

Unfortunatly this album really has no memerable songs on it at all. Although the muscianship is there, the songs are extremely flat and lifeless. Though the acoustic and instrumentals do stand out and the writing (thanks to that genius Neil Peart) do shed some light, this album does not stand up to previous albums. Some of the album sounds like rehashes of their earlier stuff. They suprisingly are not breaking new ground here. I do understand that Rush have been together for thirty plus years. They are allowed to make a sub par album for once in that time span. So, they get a free pass from me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, Great Variety","review":"Terrific new studio material that reminds me of the approach on Vapor Trails, My Favorite Headache and Presto. Great melodies and music throughout- especially Far Cry, Armor and Sword, Spindrift and The Way the Wind Blows. I also like the instrumentals. I can't say enough about Geddy Lee. His bass playing is superb as always. His singing is great and melodic. Alex also does some fine work. Neil is also solid. I'm happy that Rush is alive and as vibrant as ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland from a great Band","review":"As they say, best not to get your hopes up. And that's certainly true with this latest CD from Rush. Being a Rush fan from back in the mid-1970s, I was eagerly waiting for this new album. Perhaps too eagerly. When I finally got my hands on it last week, I found I was underwhelmed.It's a bland, boring album. Not one of the tracks stands out as something extraordinary, or even good enough for a Rush song.

Rush has put together an album based on the idea of faith and religion, and although somewhat skewed to the agnostic's point of view, is still a provacative, thought-provoking and well crafted piece of music.

I'm also a fan of 80's Rush, right up to \\"Roll The Bones.\\" I was under their spell and then......grunge happened. It seemed to knock Rush off track, trying to prove they could still rock hard. As a result, I enjoyed half of \\"Counterparts\\" and \\"Test of Echo\\" (made a great compilation btw) and then VT, so I was nervous about \\"Snakes And Arrows.\\" Well, like many good albums, it doesn't necessarily grab you on first listen, but it is a grower. Also, I am very pleased to say that the recording quality and artwork are excellent. 3 1/2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"The greatest trio in the world","review":"I have listened to Rush since the late 1970's. I finally got to see them in concert in Oklahoma City in April 2008. They sound better than ever - and that's saying a LOT. I saw Led Zeppelin on their final tour (amazing, of course), watched Joni Mitchell do a soundcheck then her concert that evening (mid-1980's, \\"Mingus\\" tour), saw Crosby, Stills and Nash twice, Bonnie Raitt, The Moody Blues, Jethro Tull, Kiss, Emmylou Harris, Fleetwood Mac (\\"Rumors\\" tour), Rod Stewart, The Grateful Dead, Cat Stevens, and numerous other concerts over the years. This Rush concert was the BEST CONCERT I'VE EVER SEEN. Seriously. Geddy Lee is the best bassist ever, Alex Lifeson sets his guitar on fire and Neil Peart - the best drummer and lyricist/poet around.

Their best effort since Counterparts, great balance between heavy and light, acoustic and electric. Crisp clear balanced production. On first listen the instrumental Hope by Lerxst seems out of place, but after listening to the album for a while, it earns it's place, especially considering the three heavier pieces that follow it.When I reach the end of the album I await the first track with great anticipation, I will remember the day I bought this for a long, long time.So will you."},{"rating":"2","title":"You gotta hear this...","review":"RUSH is on the cutting edge of recording technology here.You gotta hear the quality of this 5.1 mix.Fans will love all the interviews and behind the scenes video.RUSH just seems to get better and better."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Questions & No Doubts......","review":"as to why this is absolutely my favorite band.

I must admit that it is a well written and performed piece of art. I appreciate that Rush has stuck to its roots and given us music comprised of bass guitar and drums and not too much of the '80 style of their music with keyboards dominating the music. It has gotten better with the second and third listen and I am now on the fourth time through. So please ignore the reviews that were submitted the first week that say this album is not good. It is fantastic so go out and buy it already!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Like a fine wine, Rush only gets better with age.","review":"I've listened to it four times now and each time I have found myself on a different musical adventure --that was totally unexpected. I loved their last album \\"Vapor Trails\\" and I consider this one to be even better. I especially like their intrumental tracks.Ok, I admit that some of their lyrics are a bit cynical and dark, but in my opinion, so is the inspiration for this album --fundamental christianity.I cannot wait for their next one. Go Rush!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Still Not Able To Get Back On Track:","review":"The last GREAT Rush album was \\"Hold Your Fire\\", and the two following it were ok. The last 3, however, just don't hold up to the classic Rush of the past, and \\"Snakes And Arrows\\" is no exception.The problems, as I see it, lies with the melding of the music and the lyrics/vocals. It sounds too unnatural and forced, and not in sync with each other. The best tracks here are the instrumentals, and I usually HATE instrumentals. The vocal tracks are all very similar as they just prod along, with the occasional moment that something exciting might be happening to a song, but then quickly goes back to the sluggish, generic, almost monotone singing that seems secondary to the great music behind it just waiting to leap out. Whatever Rush used to have, I don't think they are capable of finding it again, and that's too bad. I'll keep buying, hoping, and savoring the 1 or 2 listenable songs on each future offering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea but see you on tour boys","review":"Doesnt do it for me and I have tried hard to like it.

It doesn't get much better that this - so 5 stars it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Poorest of Rush","review":"Was excited to hear this newer release. Played it in my car and it was absolutely depressing. Bitter lyrics and cup half empty point of view through out.

Cute the the way many of worked album titles into the review. Lot of very critical \\"fans\\" here. Seems everyone would be happy if Rush just kept putting out \\"Moving Pictures\\" over and over again. But I remember hearing a lot of this about \\"Signals\\" too. And it's a classic album.I for one am a fan going back \\"2112\\", the first Rush album I ever heard. I have watched and listened, and often been disapointed with various albums. Truth be told I didn't like \\"Signals\\" at first. But now I love it. Conversely I loved \\"Presto\\" right from the get go.\\"Snakes and Arrows\\" is a good album, that I'm sure will grow on me.

The first 3 songs just kick it. \\"the Larger Bowl\\" a nice change of pace happy go song. Spindrift was a filler song in my opinion. But, \\"The Main Monkey Business\\" is worth buying the album just for that track...Freaking incredible GuitarWork by Lifeson!!This new producer they have has hit a home run, it sounds clean and fresh and Positive. Rush fans do yourself a favor and buy this you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Born a new classic?","review":"I have been a RUSH fan for over 15 years. It's my favorite band.

I don't understand why the critics love this CD, and Rush is and has always been my favorite band. Aside from Far Cry, the remaining songs are plodding and the lyrics are unusually self-indulgent. The warbling vocals were grating to such a point that the three instrumentals couldn't save this one for me. Sorry guys, but I just don't get this release."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm DONE getting EXCITED about new RUSH releases...","review":"Yah, yah, I'm huge RUSH fan- all their cd's- got suckered into the $100 tickets to the last few tours, etc., etc.Let's face it- a lot of the fans love their new cd's which is fair and fine and a bunch just find the last few cd's \\"phone-in's\\". I'm not going to compare this to their moving pics periods, hemispheres, etc. (not fair) cause the band does evolve. But to what now? Just old rockers making cd's for their loyal fans. I like this a little better than Vapor Trails if that means anything. There's a few actually good tunes on here (the instrumentals- the monkey song is great) but it is already collecting dust on my cd shelf along Vapor Trails. There's Sooooo much more fun/better/relevant music out these days (and I'm not just talking rockers) that I buy a new Rush cd, listen to it for a week or so and then move on.... forever. Thank god for their back catalog!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the melody?","review":"Rush is known for songs that have great lyrics and great melodies. I haven't found that in Snakes and Arrows. All I hear is a bunch of instruments that sound like they were blended in a digital food processor and spit out in some kind of smooth electronic stream. None of these songs are good, none could be sung along with in concert, none have catchy lyrics or melodies to them. I am a die hard Rush fan going back to my high school days in the early 80's, and I am a huge Neil Peart fan, both his music and his motorcycling books.

Definitely worth picking up for Rush fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Overdue & Very Enjoyable","review":"Far Cry & Armor & Sword are good introductions to the album. I didn't think this was too much of a departure from their original sound. I know the producer stated that it would be a return to their 70's efforts, but this album sounded like business as usual for the trio. Counterparts was a huge departure for them when they leaned toward \\"Power Trio\\"-type music (doing away with keys/synth). Bands like Judas Priest & Iron Maiden have retained their overall sound... more like feel for their roots in music with little shifts/changes over time, which is what is happening here. They didn't take a left turn & do a Megadeth or Rod Stewart album. They simply stayed their course with a detour here & there to do some musical \\"sight-seeing\\". This album isn't 2112 or Moving Pictures, but it wasn't meant to be. It's the same quality product that will work itself nicely into the band's set lists in concert."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Good Rush album","review":"This is a real review, I work in Radio, and have gotten an advance copy. This album is very much like Geddy's \\"My Favorite headache\\" combined with \\"Vapor Trails\\".For some of you, that sounds like a good combo. It's not. The album wanders all over the place, never picking up steam. The lyrics are very, very negative (\\"I don't have faith in faith\\").The first single, Far Cry is a terrific song to start the album with. Enjoy the song, because that type of energy doesn't re-appear at all here. If you enjoy instrumentals, this album may be for you. It features 3 (THREE!), and one of them is just Alex Lifeson (solo).I am a long time Rush fan, and was hoping this album was a return to form. It's not. The songs are disjointed, plodding, and soft. Please don't read this review and assume I only like the old albums. Some of my favorites are Test for Echo, Presto, and Counterparts.Not my idea of Rush.

Noisy was in style at the time of Vapor Trails (e.g. the last Metallica album). When a band is chasing styles that's not a good thing. Far Cry was not good. It reminds me of other certain Rush songs where Geddy is bleating along and you're just waiting on the riff to start again... except there's no riff! Not good. I bought Vapor Trails and listened to it 5 or 10 times. It wasn't bad but clearly not their best work. If you listen to 2112 and then the latest stuff back-to-back you'll hear how far the mighty band Rush has fallen. More likely they've just become old and run out of ideas but not time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is This the Last Rush Album?","review":"Is this the last Rush album? I don't hear any passion or technical excellence from Alex Lifeson's guitar or Neil Peart's drumkit. And Geddy Lee is bulking up on keyboards again, tsk tsk.

Snakes and Arrows confirms it."},{"rating":"1","title":"biggest let down yet!!Are you kidding me 4 stars??????????","review":"Ok look ,i'm a drummer and have been a rush fan for the last 25 yrs .i've seen rush every tour twice in 25 yrs.All i have to say is (and trust me it kills me)this cd is terrible.No big hooks ,no songs to make you say Wow! that was cool.just plain boring vanilla.Iwasn't happy about their last \\"cover\\"album and was hoping this was something that would make up for that.I literally listened to this cd 6 times already and had to force myself to get through it.I even called other friends who are huge fans and they agreed.What happened?????????I use to love every song from start to finish.Sorry but, it really hurts me to say that this is just bad.it's sad looks like i'll just keep going with dream theater and just discovered procupine tree .these guys are cool!to the past rush fans who just gave rave reviews c'mon are you serious????if you are rush fans you know this does not come close to anything they have ever done."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the heck?","review":"I love Rush. Not just the 70's period of \\"Tom Sawyer\\" and \\"Limelight,\\" but all Rush. My favorite era is probably 80's and 90's, when the band was really mixing strong melodies with mature emotional content.I have no idea what this is all about. There's no connection anymore. There's no real soul to this disc. I feel like I'm listening to a group of people trying hard to sound relevent. It's heartbreaking. After all Neil Peart's introspective (and somewhat pretentious) literary outings, I expected the music of Rush to grow. To reach new vistas. I hate to say it but I think the guys are just out of ideas. It certainly seems that way here. This is the first Rush disc I've bought that I just can't listen to. There's just nothing here. Sorry, guys."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps their best album","review":"History might consider this album Rush's best work. I find that Rush albums grow on me with each listen. This album, out of the box, is tremendous. It is brilliantly produced, has tons of musical hubris, and is dripping with meaning and depth. Time will tell and many Rush fans might disagree, but I think that after a few listens, you'll find that this ablum rises above the others with its totality.

Good stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get The Broadway CD","review":"What a disapointment. All the hype about Jennifer Hudson is a lotta garbage. I would rather watch Jennifer Holiday ( original Effie) sleep than listen to Ms. Hudson sing these songs. Everything is scremed full throttle from this poor young girl. The two most offensive crimes she commits are in the beginning of family as she sings..\\"what about what I want..\\" Holliday barely whispered these opening lines and you felt the characters pain...Hudson screams these lines like some angry nasty girl...you feel nothing for her.Second crime is I am Changing...after listening to it I was changing my mind about buying this CD. Full throttle from the beginning no where to go but a repulsive flat than sharp riffed up ending..it was truly grotesque. Oh, and Eddie Murphy is lousy too. I love this music and they spoiled it for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheesy Broadway musical that wont die.","review":"Just saw the movie and although the performers gave their best the musical score really brings the whole project to cheeseville. The music has that late 70's early 80's Broadway pop sound that can only be tolerated with a lot of glitzy stage distractions. Not once even in the soulfully sung yet very ponderous \\"I'm telling you...\\" could you imagine this music being written and performed by black americans in the 1960's-70's. Unlike pop music which doesn't need to move a plot the songs here are drama ballad after drama ballad, really quite exhausting not inspiring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Original Broadway Cast The Best!","review":"I just got the 2-disc Special Edition,Original Broadway Cast,Remastered & Brilliant!!!I was there for the Broadway Production & i don't think any sountrack can compare to the original,especially this new Re-Mastered Edition.As you can see Amazon has already sold out the Broadway CD S.E.Call me jaded,but i would wait till the movie comes out to see if Beyonce's DreamGirls even compares.That is for you folks that have seen the Original Broadway Production.Jennifer Holiday,Sheryl Lee Ralf & Loretta Devine & the rest of the Original Broadway Cast,The Very Best!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Obviously I am the minority on this","review":"Maybe many of the reviewers can not remember the original soundtrack with Jennifer Holiday. I certainly can and each time that I hear Ms. Hudson's version of \\"I am telling you\\", I have to turn the radio off because it is so bad. There is no comparison between the versions. It reminds me of Jay Anthony Brown (Tom Joyner Morning Show) murdering another hit. That is exactly what Ms. Hudson did. She murdered a classic hit.But I can not totally blame her because like other young artists, she is missing the true talent that her predecessors possesed. Aretha, Gladys, Minnie, Roberta, Whitney, Jean Carne, Melba....These young ladies today are more hype than talent. I truly feel sorry for this generation."},{"rating":"2","title":"See the movie too","review":"The movie WAS great and Jennifer Hudson dominated it both in acting and singing. She blew me away.

Also, you get to see all of the hardwork that the actors put into their role which looks so effortless on screen. The DVD with the bonus feature is well worth the few extra dollars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Single and Deluxe soundtrack versions are different","review":"First of all let me say great movie! Seen it twice at show! Everyone claps after Jennifer Hudsons performace of And I Am Telling You Im Not Going. Anyway i dont own either copy of this officially, but have downloaded songs from it. I do notice that some of the songs are sung differently on this single version and the deluxe. Example on the Deluxe 2 cd set the song Hard To Say Goodbye My Love is the version from the movie where Beyonce is singing lead. The version on this single soundtrack its not Beyonce singing lead, its someone else. So some of the songs are different. Since i dont own either cd im not sure what other ones are exactly different, but im sure there is others like this example."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dream Girl Jennifer","review":"This show is absolutely the best musical I have seen in years. The set, the music, was absolutely enthralling. Jennifer Hudson has come such a long way from American Idol. Who would have known she could blow audiences away with not only her voice, but acting ability. The music was moving and sweeps you along to the point you actually feel part of the happenings on the screen. This is a must see and a must buy for anyone who truly enjoys music. I don't feel she stole the show, I feel she OWNED the screen and the music. Beyonce was just along for the ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dreamgirls Soundtrack","review":"Wow this is one amazing soundtrack. Truly it is. I would put it at the top of my list of soundtracks. I am so amazed at the amount of talent and time and effort put into making this one great product for everyone to enjoy. Beyonce, Jennifer, Eddie, Jaime, Anika, and Keith all shine on this stellar CD.My personal favorite is Jennifer Hudsons version of \\"One Night Only\\". It is such an intense, riveting and emotional song. It gives me goosebumps.Jaime also delivers on \\"When I First Saw You\\".You will not be disappointed by \\"Family\\" either. That is an incredible song.Beyonce also does her things, but as many have agreed to it is Jennifer who walks away with this one. Which isnt such a bad thing, considering Beyonce has done alot and proved herself worthy of the star she is. There is plenty of room at the top for all to enjoy success!A + Effort!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hudson Rules","review":"A really fun musical. Jennifer Hudson is smashing and Eddie Murphy is great.

This is very, very addicting. People often stop by to play with the supermags.I wanted to play with this instead of working. The pieces are super tough, the log pieces can be stepped on, dropped, put under heavy books and they don't crack.Be careful using this around computers and other objects. They are strong and will literally fly out of your hand if there is something metal nearby. I recommend keeping the pieces in the Styrofoam container in which they came - the top can be turned over and used as a play table so not to lose the pieces.I plan on getting several more sets for home as well as an additional set for my desk."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 stars for music, 1 for vinyl pressing","review":"Look, I'm no audiophile but there is something wrong with Yeprocs vinyl pressing of this album. I have heard two different copies and on both of them the fidelity gets worse and worse as the record progresses. Everybody knows that the first track on an album sounds better than the ones on the inside but I have never heard such a noticeable difference as this.I think this is a case where I would buy the cd instead or seek out an original pressing of the vinyl."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful songs from a talented artist","review":"This is a great album by a very talented singer, backed by an equally talented band. Dobet's music ranges from danceable, upbeat rock to tribal chants to bluesy dirges. Her compositions are consistently interesting, and the jazz-like variety of the melodies puts her far above other African artists. These are songs that are a bit more challenging melodically and rhythmically, but they are consistently rewarding; you won't tire of them easily.The other, more satisfying aspect of her art is her raw intensity. These songs (check out Djiguene or Massacre) make most current Western pop music sound like elevator muzak. Yes, she can be hoarse at times, but so was Janice Joplin."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Sci Fi Movie!","review":"I bought this movie a few months ago, and had never heard of it beforehand. \\"Voyage to the Prehistoric Planet\\" seems as if it was filmed in russia, and they used a weird red tinted camera lense. It is fairly hard to follow. And don't be missled by the saber tooth cat on the cover, it's actually not in the movie at all.In the Year 2889 on the other hand is in full color and a very thick plot. It especially interested me with the mutant zombies who are left over from a worldwide nuclear explosion. It was very well made and had excellent acting, and the tension and eerieness just builds itself up and never really goes away. Even two months after you've watched it.It is well woth the money of a hardcore Sci Fi fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Digitally Remastered \\"NOT!\\"","review":"What they mean is that it was recorded on to dvd from whatever garbage source material they had.

Also the contrast was wayy over the top.I know for a fact that there is a better version of this movie out there because I saw it on cable (possibly encore or turner classic movies?) a few years ago.I only got this for the lovely Quinn Oharra pool scene which I remember quite well.Not sure if the grind house dvd that has that other movie on it is a different version or not.

This meter measures air flow and temperature after it passes through the air filter. A fouled MAP meter will produce a very bad air/fuel mix.

If you put too much oil on the filter, it can foul it (there are ways to clean the sensor, but off hand I can't remember them). After cleaning the KN filter after 20,000 or so miles, many people spray too much oil on it and that will foul the sensor. Follow KN's re-oiling instrictions religiously.

In fact, the most engaging paragraphs in the entire book are quotes from other books! Also, there are a lot of lists included for this and that, some of which are quite redundant and seem to be included just to take up space. I expected a little more insight, but was dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything your surgeon should have told you","review":"First, the title is misleading because the book deals with pre-surgery nearly as much as post-surgery issues.

If you are looking for additional information, there are other, more relevant books out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Want to buy mine?","review":"I was disappointed with the book.

Many of the group members are familiar with this book, and agreed that it's quite helpful. Ms. Peck took major surgery and a total lifestyle overhaul and put this reader at ease with her personal story. It helped that a medical professional wrote the book and lived this journey herself.

I have already incorporated some of the suggestions. I know I will refer to it again and again.

In my opinion they don't make dramatic change to the picture. I love the camera though, the film is a commitment though. You WILL have to pay a good amount and search for a good price for them.

It is really difficult to choose a favorite T.Rex record because \\"Electric Warrior,\\" \\"The Slider,\\" and \\"Tanx\\" are all so amazing. However, I opt for this particular album because of the continuity, maturity, and vitality of all the songs, along with the youthful, insouciant elegance and careless glam bam wham that melt together so well with T.Rex to create some of the happiest, wildest, along with the saddest and sexiest melodies in the universe.

His unique influence in look (\\"cork screw hair\\" black high hat ala Linda Perry and Slash), haunting overlaid guitar whines screamed through pulsating Vampower amp tubes, driving background drum rhythms, and a unlimited voice range of like an electric harmonica synthesizer.

This is as close to perfection as early 70's glam gets, liberally coated with a layer of cosmic fairy dust and boasting crystalline production. Containing no filler, every track on \\"The Slider\\" casts a huge shadow over its contemporaries, including - at the risk of bringing the wrath of Bowie fans worldwide on my head - \\"The Rise And Fall Of Ziggy Stardust.\\" Unfortunately, there are a million stories with no happy ending in The Big (Rock) City and Bolan's became one of them when his girlfriend wrapped his mini around a tree about five or six years after this was released.

I find it ironic that another book, \\"Professional Apache Tomcat,\\" (WROX), which was published before new Apache book covers 4.0, even 4.1! It also appears, from the tone of the book, that the authors do not care much for Java and would rather the reader use Perl.Do not buy this book if you want Tomcat information.

I believe that 1star ratings should be as difficult to get as 5star ratings and this record is perilously close to 1star. This record is utterly lacking in creativity. It seeks to copy the generic nagging approach to altrock that certain bands (that i, appropriately enough, cannot remember the names of now) have made good on a hit or two with in MTV Buzz bins. Amazingly, [Static] falls short of even this standard mostly because of pop \\"melodies\\" that are tired and uninteresting.

The author recounts the story through the innocent eyes of childhood, the remembered details especially poignant because a child's memories are of a world not judged, but accepted as it is. The author begins her story with her first days of school, singing hymns. Gradually school changes. The hymns become martial Nazi songs, the teachers become agents or resistors of the Nazis. Life includes complications such as avoiding Nazi service and ideas. She spends an obligatory year at farmwork. As the author grows older, the skies contain not clouds but bombers. She is almost crushed to death in the rush to enter an air-raid shelter. And at the end, as the Russians enter the Berlin suburbs, the war comes into her home in a new and personal way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Lose Your Head","review":"I know the author, and can tell you that this is a true story.This is a must read for young people who might identify with her experiences."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kid's For Character VHS","review":"I had this VHS video 15 years ago when it first came out...All the kids loved it..

The picture is grainy and the detail isn't there. Recording in SLP is extrememly poor. Automatic tracking is useless, you practically have to track manually each tape. Playback of store-bought tapes is decent, though. No complaints about the features or the remote. The unit is indeed very light, as another reviewer said, but these days all VCRs are much lighter than they used to, so you shouldn't judge it by that. I returned it to the store, needless to say and wouldn't recommend this VCR to anyone. I guess Panasonic isn't what it used to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Panasonic?? What a disapointment","review":"I always heard how Panasonic made such fine VCRs. While this may have been true in the past, I believe that Panasonic is slipping. Which is all this VCR gave from the time I got it - a \\"slipping\\" picture. Every tape I tried would miss-track, or the picture would flutter & roll, or loud mistracking noises would happen every few minutes. Didn't matter if it was an old tape, freshly opened tape, newly purchased movie, every one miss-tracked or the picture would roll, etc. Despite \\"autotracking\\" feature, I constantly had to manually track the machine, especially after fast-forwarding through a commercial. My previous Panasonic worked very well for two years, and then did the very same thing, despite my taking good care of it. Which is all a shame, because this Panasonic VCR is one of the few available with an S-video output, which would have meant a superior picture-if only it didn't slip, slide & roll."},{"rating":"1","title":"Socks!","review":"Broke in one month.

I was excited by the potentials of so many programmable buttons and it worked great in the beginning. After a while the main button stopped working. When I click on something, it clicks it with a double click (even though it's set for a single click). When I try to click and drag, it doesn't hold onto the object I'm clicking and dragging on (Making it impossible to work with in PhotoShop or highlighting text). When I'm browsing the web, if I scroll through the page quickly it will take me back to previous page (very annoying). I'm running on Win 98.

I say this meaning that when you click you can't count on it to click 100% of the time. When it does work (which is most of the time) you can't count on it to continually hold as it will occasionally just give up. This can be a serious problem when dragging files as the mouse will let go when you don't. I use the mouse for gaming where it has driven me insane for half a year. I can't take it anymore, I'm buying another mouse and I advise you to do the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"great rack!","review":"no comment. just amazingg! i'm a student, and I use a section for each subject and everything's just well organized!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad for the price","review":"It is not the most comfortable mouse I have ever used but the software that comes with it is very easy to use.

The buttons sometimes tell the computer that one click means \\"two clicks!\\" or \\"five clicks!\\" Other times, when I drag to select something, the selection doesn't hold. It makes me crazy. It comes and goes, but really makes my job difficult sometimes. I'm buying another one and throwing this one out the window."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Buttons Break","review":"I purchased one of these mice soon after they were released, and was somewhat happy with it for about 5 months, then the primary button stopped working. Kensington sent me a replacement, and now, three months later, the primary button on that one is broken too. I'm still waiting for a second replacement since they are out of stock.Ergonomically, this mouse is terrible. It's impossible to pick it up while holding one of the buttons due to the flat edge all around on the bottom (as opposed to curved like apple's and most other mice). If you have large hands, find a different mouse. This one is designed for women or small-handed men, and provides no support for the palm of your hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sensational soundtrack that captures the movie perfectly!!","review":"I throughly enjoyed this movie...and the soundtrack isn't shabby either!!

But what is more is that it is set in Washington, D.C. in the late 1960's. It is a time in D.C. when hookers ruled 14th street and an interesting look backward at a Washington of yesterday. And amid the usual crime of D.C. there is a vampire killing people. Our hero is a DC cop who gradually learns that he is up against something unusual.I'd like to see a hardback reprint of this story.

And many things in this book also challenged me in many ways that I am still trying to decipher.I enjoyed the section \`Negative Feeling Toward Others\\" and \\"Our Illusion About Others.\\" I was also glad to read about some criticisms he has had of his faith over the years. It was less than 200 pages. I think I read it in four days. After reading this book, I conducted more research on this highly enlightened man who tragically is no longer with was.

Nor are any plays from Golden Age Spanish literature. They are called comedies simply because they are not allowed the name of Tragedies, which is reserved for plays written in Greek language and style. Spanish is a \\"vulgar\\" offshoot from Latin, and \\"tragedies\\" were not works for the vulgar (common) language. If you are looking for comedy in a Golden Age Spanish play it will be difficult.

Schaap not only profiles the history of boxing but gives us a quaint look at life during the 1930's depression. Jimmy Braddock, was a washed-up, underdog determined to win the title against one of the greatest boxers ever, Max Baer. Braddock was billed as a 10-to-one underdog. Baer was not onlyheavily favored, but he had already killed two men in the ring. Braddock, with the help of his manager, Joe Gould makes a remarkable comeback and defeats Baer. Braddock becomes a hero and is able to get off welfare once and for all.

First thing first, Lyn Whitfield was amazing, even though she appeared to lip sync her sermons. Patti can sing her face off ...PERIOD!!. Ciara on the other hand. Ciara, Ciara Ciara, where do i even start. Lets start with the fact that she cant act at all. Couple that witht the fact that she spoke and sang like a 12 year old the entire movie, yes even after she \\"made it\\". They could have chosen any number of truly talented singers to play this roll. Paris Bennett, who sang one of the track \\"I will\\" for example. The story line was all over the place, with no consistancy or follow through. The viewer is left to guess what happened to get them to where they were. Overall it had the potential, to be great and casting someone other than Ciara as the lead would have been a step in the right direction. Just my opinion"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mama!!!!

(Exceptions: Patti LaBelle - Lynn Whitfield - Marvin Winans)In my opinion I don't think this was a great role for Ciara. This role should have been played by someone with a soulful voice. Everytime Ciara opened her mouth to sing, it sounded like someone was scrapping their nails against a chalkboard. I'm a fan of Ciara's music, especially the songs she released off her first cd.. but this movie gets an one star movie.My advice: Wait until this movie airs on BET... If this movie was called...

The movie wastes such great talent, especially Patti LaBelle and Paris Bennett. It was amazing that seasoned actors such as Ben Vereen and Lynn Whitfield, both actors I respect, played cardboard characters that did not propel the movie or the plot.Ciara was as interesting as a dial tone. I take that back. A dial tone would have been more rivetting. Ciara has to be the most poorly cast member of this movie, and that is tragic considering that she is the lead. Her acting (if you wish to call it that) might as well have been phoned in. I tried to give this movie a chance, and I watched it from beginning to end.

The acting sounded like a first rehearsal. When I heard a few years ago that the movie was in production, I was surprised that Ciara was chosen as lead. Her voice is not strong enough for the songs. But then I expected the movie was following the script of the stage play. Wrong! The only comparison of this movie to the play was Desiree Coleman, the original Doris Troy, singing \\"Not Created to Fall.\\" Ciara, though easy on the eyes, is no actress. Maybe she acted in plays in her hometown of Riverdale, Ga., but her performance would not cut it in any performing arts high school. Now I understand why this movie went straight to DVD. The storyline was weak. Even though Vy Higgenson, the writer of the stage play, was in the movie, I can't understand why she green lighted this project. Watch this movie on tv.

Forewarned is forearmed. Anyway, I thought this was a very well thought out, cogent presentation of a rather slippery topic. Storr, in my opinion, does a good job of sifting Jungian wheat from chaff; although he is an admirer of Jung, he can be pretty critical. Overall, I thought Storr did a very good job of presenting Jung's thoughts and contributions to theories of divided self, the positive role of myth, etc. The book does raise many questions which it leaves unanswered, but I suspect that is a function of Jung's eclectic philosophy, not Storr's writing style, which I thought was very clear. Overall, a good presentation, in the opinion of this highly unknowledgeable reader (although there are some pre-feminist comments that had me cringing)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ice Cream man = eye in ice cream","review":"I enjoyed this film, I haven't seen it for about 2 years.. but I remember it.

Mine powered up talking French, so I had to wade through the manual to figure out how to reset it. FF or Rewinding does not automatically display time remaining. You have to press the display button on the remote to get this info. Needless to say, it went back to the store. I exchanged it for a Sony SLVN71...The Sony was a breeze to setup.

This machine has a lot, and I mean a lot of buttons on the remote. The VCR has no RCA video jack out, but it does have one for video in and there is no explanation for this from customer service. There are an endless list of illogical inconsistencies with this machine.

A great feature for those of us who's kids are exposed to enough advertising as it is.However, extras aside, I found the playback quality extremely poor.

The biggest pain was trying to use fast forward to get thru a commercial without continually overshooting. Its too fast! (my old Admiral is two speed and much easier to control). The programming interface is also archaic! Having to use the up/dn keys to set the channel, time, and date is ridiculous.

It was also fairly easy to install and set up. But I was greatly disappointed with the quality of the picture. At first I thought the poor picture quality might be due to poor tapes, so I tried a variety of tapes, from brand-new commercially manufactured tapes to older (fine) tapes I'd made off the TV. All tapes appeared grainy, with poor color saturation. The reds and dark browns were especially bad. My old VCR, also a Panasonic, which I have used for over 10 years, produced a far better picture from all tapes, new and old. I very rarely return a product to the seller, but in this case I felt bound to. I knew that if I kept it and continued to use it, I would feel nothing but irritation and frustration with the inferior picture quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice VCR","review":"I purchased this VCR to replace my several year old Panasonic one. The biggest difference is the sound. I love good sound effect, and the PV-V4621 is great! It integrates very well into my home theater system with nice Dolby 5.1 . I'm not sure if the picture quality is much better than my old one though. The playback of recorded TV program seems grainy, a little worse than expected.

I'm looking forward to the longer (and better) version with Ian Holm to be released on DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great story, horrible dvd!!","review":"Why this is called \\"digitally remastered\\" I'll never know.

However, the product itself was terrible. I didn't like this one at all. There was absolutely no substance to the story line. Even the version starring John Goodman was better than this one.When comparing the one starring Eddie Albert to the version starring Ian Holm, THERE IS NO COMPARISON. The one with Ian Holm was excellent family viewing, and as an adult, I even view it alone. I love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not have been digitally remastered","review":"I agree with the other reviewers. This is one of the worst prints I have ever seen on DVD. There are three crisp clear pictures from the film on the back of the case. Unfortunately you will never see anything like that in the video. The colors are muddy and muted throughout the film.This is all a sad thing because it is a classic film from Hallmark Hall of Fame and deserves a much better presentation than what it got from \\"Digivew Products\\" I would suggest avoiding anything with their name on it.

With the reviews that I'd read, we took the pieces out of box immediately to set about getting it together. The pieces went together with no problems, and using wood glue along with the screws sent made the house even more secure. It is permanently put together, but we hope she'll have years of enjoyment out of it. The only issue is that the pieces sent to be used as flooring were warped, so do not stay flat in the house. And we all wonder why there is only one staircase section, (on the outside of the middle floor), but her imagination got her over that quickly enough.

Few feminist writers before then had challenged the status quo through such a massive attempt in depicting the female experience. It's certainly a fascinating read but, one has to cringe at De Beauvoir's naive attempt at generalizations. Her book is clearly only a depiction of females in the upper-crust of society, and negates social circumstance. Those familiar with the works of Sartre and other existentialists, will certainly recognize many of the ideas espoused in this book. It often reads like a 'who's who' of the french intelligentsia."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Second Sex","review":"This book has proved to be ground breaking in the feminist movement. However, it seems to reinforce social roles under gender categories, which is the last thing any gender (male or female) movement needs. It reinforces gender roles by outcasting one and accepting the other. It is an interesting read but one that should be taken with a grain of salt."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Cause for Murder of the Patriarch, Yet Still Relevant","review":"This book does not ask women to murder, but rather to reclaim themselves in society by understanding the lies and misshapen information in a patriarchial history, biology, sociology, etc. It is a fundemental piece of feminism, its importance cannot be denied. The Second Sex is a critical discourse that examines most aspects of life in the western world as a woman. Though it is dated, such as the information on the lesbian, much of the content is still relevant. For instance, the section \\"Of women in five authors\\" would be of help to any english major wanting to understand the basics of feminist literary theory.

It seems to be a literal translation and also uses French terminology with no footnotes to explain their meaning to the English reader. All this book demonstrates is that the decades of criticism surrounding the first translation was unfounded & based in ignorance (no big surprise there).Does contain a great quote though: \\"Scandinavians are healthy, strong, and cold. \\"Fiery\\" women are those who combine their languor with \\"fire,\\" like Italian or Spanish women,\\"Oh how true it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bobby's World Swim by me VHS","review":"If you remember Howie Mandel's \\"Bobby's World\\" series, then you likely will enjoy \\"Swim by me\\" and \\"Jets, Choo-choos, & Cars\\", the two episodes on this tape.

My youngest was quick to point out that they didn't wear bike helmets back then, so we got in a safety discussion to boot.

However, I do believe in God, and how I wish that Ayn Rand would have included the virtues of God within her views on capitalism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lasse Faire Capitalism is the solution for our country","review":"Excellent book on lasse faire capitalism. This book shows that a truly free capitalist society has never existed. The USA came closest to a free society in our first 150 years. Once the progressives and liberal politicians begin to try to control the economy it has been on a downward spiral. She is very clear that a controlled economy eventually leads to serfdom and tyranny. We are witnessing this transformation now.

Rand is popular with adolescents desperate to reconcile their confusion about self-interest and duties and \\"Libertarian\\" apologists looking for a theory to justify domination and exploitation.

Although at times Rand seems to be repitive, she is still able to convey the importance of a free market economy, and the dangers of government interference. The book is definitely worth a read for those who adhere to a mixed or socialist economy philosophy. However, as a graduate of economics, I must complain about the utter lack of empiricism in the book and some misinterpretations of the Sherman Antitrust laws."},{"rating":"1","title":"Capitalism is wrong","review":"Capitalism has a number of failings but perhaps the most basic oneis its theory of values. Capitalism acts as if there is a commoncurrency with which we can measure all that is valuable (money).This value monism is incorrect. See \\"The non-existence of a utilityfunction and the structure of non-representable preference relations\\"(Beardon, et al, J. of Math. Econ., vol. 37, pg 17-38, 2002) and refs.therein. Capitalists simply get the math wrong. Money isn't everything.Value pluralism is the correct axiology.

Apparently neither of the authors read Marx.Combine the communism silliness with other coal lumps of wisdom such as hillbillies are too dumb to own radio stations, dumb people can't teach you anything so you shouldn't listen to them, and all government regulation is bad except for protection of life and property, and one can't help but wonder if the book is serious or leftover Cold War propaganda from the KGB."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read this if You're Stupid and wish to be so Irreversibly","review":"Once you enslave your mind to a blind, fantasy-based, utopian distortion of capitalist society, which has nothing to do with the actual functioning of that system on any level, at anytime whatsoever (and the top beneficiaries wouldn't have it any other way - no matter what this \\"economic-libertarian\\" drivel espouses), this is what comes out of your pencil.

We are now living in a reality where big business pretty much influences everything in our lives, and the society that it has produced isn't exactly what Rand envisioned. The idea of an unrestrained capitalism sounds wonderful as a philosophy. But in truth, it's just as dangerous as total government control: Exxon Mobil, Walmart, etc. are not businesses, but institutions with power over our every day lives.

If you want to understand the philosophical basis for Capitalism, and why it is the ONLY moral system compatible with man's life as man, then I highly recommend buying a copy of: Capitalism - The Unknown Ideal by Ayn Rand. If we are to defeat the enemies of freedom it is crucial to understand the flaws in their policies and be able to explain the reasons to those who may be searching for the truth but require a logical and well reasoned explanation. Those with power lust who would rule the world know that it is the concept of Capitalism that must be destroyed.

He soon finds out that The Pack he really belongs to is a wild biker gang that is much more than it seems. Ukiah is then thrown into finding his lost heritage and along the way he finds much more. The only reason I gave it 3 stars is only because I thought that everybody around him just seemed to believe about his alien past a little too quickly and easily.

If you want the answer to that question, watch this movie. Otherwise, don't bother. The acting is not exactly Haley Joel Osment quality, the scenes of savagery are played down IMO so they lose some of their horrific nature, and some of the dialogue and scenes are dumbed down.One area where this movie does get it right is the sets and the cinematography.

Even the Lord of the Flies was entirely erased from the movie, the subject that the book is titled after has been left out! That's just totally unacceptable. The beast, which was just as important to the meaning of the book as the Lord of the Flies, was totally changed.

The characterization, cinematography and screenplay were very well done. This movie is a must-see for those viewers who want to consider what children are capable of doing if the situation is just right. The human capacity for violence is never to be underestimated.

Although, I guess that maybe the point of the movie wasn't really to stay so true to the book, but if that isn't what you are looking for, go for the sixties version.

Two: Ralph, Jack, and Piggy were the same age. Three: They come from a military school. Four: the swearing. Would Golding sit there nodding his head or would he stop the boys and rewrite the script?

It does not add to the story, and the language is used often.The book on the other hand is very clean, and has no bad words. I would recommend reading your son the book. Not only does it not have bad language, it also covers more information, and has more symbols. The pig's head talking is a major point in the book, and is completely removed from the movie...Hollywood has taken a book written by a Nobel Prize winning author (Sir William Golding), and has beaten it until it was dead.

Author makes extensive use of MacDonald's own writings as well as the accounts of Greville MacDonald, his son. I find it comforting and helpful that someone like MacDonald lived as he did, unabashedly. I feel he is something of a living template for many of us today. And I trust someone who you can tell loves the Father and knows he is loved by the Father as well. This is all reflected so well in the bio. Of course, as great as the bio is, it is still no substitute for MacDonald's actual works which is where is spirit really shines through. I would recommend a good dose of MacDonald reading before taking on the bio...the details of a man's life can lessen what is in his heart sometimes. Phantastes and At The Back Of The North Wind are great places to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Used to always have this with me.","review":"I used to have this with me everywhere i went.

When I formulated this goal in my mind, I knew I would need a guide. Following the advice of my teacher, I picked up this dandy little book, and I can only say one thing: what a big help it has been! The section devoted to the subtle nuances of the English language, such as the differences between eminent/imminent, lay/lie, who/whom, that/which, etc., is well worth the cost by itself! In addition, the book provides lucid guidelines and step-by-step instructions for writing a letter, report, summary, or any other genre of paper.Put simply, this is a book every English geek should have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reference book!","review":"I borrowed this book from the library first, and was so happy with the contents, that I decided to buy it.

I had never heard of this band, but I gave it a try. And now I just love it!If you're considering getting this cd, do. I kind of think there's something for everyone on it. It sort of reminded me slightly of one of my favorite bands, REM. But it's definitely different so if you don't like REM, don't let that discourage you. My favorite songs on the cd are Sometimes, Born of Frustration, and Tomorrow, but I really have enjoyed every single song on the cd. It's pop-y, but in a crazy, insane sort of way. I mean, Hymn From a Village? What's that about? I don't know, but I love it. It's just all very refreshing, in a familiar sort of way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trust me, you'll love it","review":"Many bands, calling themselves alternative, are really not very interesting in this decade. Matchbox 20, Blink 182, etc...it's often kind of hard to tell them apart. But they are trying to get to a particular sound--and falling a bit short. What they are falling short of is James. James is fun, beautiful, rocking, sensitive music. Sit Down will make you cry, you'll recognize Laid and love it. Trust me, just because AlternaLite is on the radio a lot doesn't mean it's all that good. You will love James. It's obscure, but hardly esoteric. Just go to a Borders or something and ask to listen to this CD--it'll be more than worthwhile. It is music equally appropriate at a dance party and in your room late at night. It's uplifting no matter what your mood."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favourite CD by my favourite band","review":"What a marvel! I bought this (not from Amazon) after seeing an advert on TV. I recognised Sit Down from ages ago and had enjoyed She's a Star, so I went to the shops to get it. At first I wasn't so keen on some of the songs, but they have all grown on me to the point that I hardly listen to anyone other than James. Tim Booth, whome I have met and recorded with along with Saul Davies, has an amazing voice and I can't get enough of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best CD to be released in ages!","review":"This compilation of songs is the best I've ever heard. I feel sorry for the rest of my James CDs (I have 'em all) because they get a lot less playing time now that almost all my favorite songs are on one CD. It is almost permanently located in my CD player."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great compilation of one of the most talented pop groups","review":"I first heard James when I was about 12 years old when my brother used to listen to them, and I recently bought this album to see why my brother was so taken by this band, and I've think it's an amazing album. Tim Booth's voice is very interesting, and his vocal abilities are varied and intense. The music is catchy, and a tad repetitive between songs, the same tune seems to be used quite a lot, but the sound is good enough to never really let that get in the way. James, is pop/rock, and that style is not for everyone, but if you liked such classics as \\"sit down\\" and \\"laid\\", or if you like the work of The Smiths and Morrisey then this album is definitely worth your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Collection","review":"Awesome collection- if you like James, these are the songs you know by heart- perfect for long car trips!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine music from a fine band","review":"James are one of our finest bands. I'm not sure if they are very well known on the other side of the Atlantic but they are a work of genius. Great songs like 'Laid' 'Sit Down' and 'She's A Star' make James one of the UK's finest bands. Give it a try Americans."},{"rating":"2","title":"James addiction.","review":"This is such an easy band to like. You know, some bands you've got to listen to forever before it clicks. Not James. This is a great, and lengthy 18 track collection. If you only recognize a few songs, don't worry, they're all good. Of course this has the amazing songs \\"Born of Frustration\\" and \\"She's a Star\\", but also has \\"Say Something\\", \\"Tomorrow\\", and many others. James seems to have a passion and sincerity in their music that makes it a joy to listen to. Oh, and it's all very catchy. This collection comes with a big bonus too. I mean, what other Best-of out there will get you \\"Laid\\"?"},{"rating":"2","title":"useful!!","review":"I bought these to stick on a metal easel on my desk.

I would not buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent Idea But These Are Garbage","review":"I bought these as spice holders, even after reading some of the bad reviews. I just thought they were such a neat idea. Well, when I received them, I thought they were very cute and would work well for me. I put them in the dishwasher. When they came out, the flimsy piece of plastic that makes the lid had fallen out of three of the six that I bought. The ones that didn't fall out were full of rusty water that got in between the plastic and the metal. Yuck. For what they are charging for these, they could be of better quality. Please don't buy these if you plan to use them for foodstuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Under-recognized","review":"An excellent album (as usual) from this under-recognized C&W singer.

This has to be Tracy's best CD's ever. If you buy this CD and just listen to the ballad \\"Before I Die\\" you will be completley satisfied with this song alone. This is one of the most beatiful songs I have ever heard. The music and especially the words are incredible. There is no doubt this should have been the first single off the CD. Radio would have grabbed this one and it would have been a great crossover song. The rest of the songs are just as good.

I think that that people that gave it five-star reviews because they were just really surprised that these hot Swedish babes could actually sing and play music.

Every song is great, \\"I dont mind \\" espeacilly. Not a real guitar solo in sight, but that does not matter as the guitar work is still impressive. Fat bass, and driving drum beats abound in all songs, and intresting lyrics coupled with a singer who knows how to sing metal round out one my favorite metal cds.

There are monster hooks in each song which get you singing along each time you spin the cd. I have to say this is the BEST all female band out there right now. They have it all--the power, the groove, the energy, the passion, and not to mention the looks. By the way if Martina ever reads this, the next time I meet you-- I think I might ask you to like marry me or something---She just blasts the heck out of the drums---she might not be all technical and junk, but she can hold her own with some of the best!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"drain sth","review":"Who told these numbskulls they sounded like kittie anyway? great band. drain should have lasted for more than two albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Metal Album - The Female Metallica/Alice in Chains","review":"This album should go down as a classic. All the songs are excellent and have a real, raw, gritty sound... it's an extremely heavy album... but without all the screaming or typical operatic goth female vocals. I have never found another band to sound like or be as good as Drain STH. Unfortunately they disbanded after recording only 2 albums. Both are great... but this one is definitely heavier and less polished sounding than their sophomore release (which although has more of a pop appeal to it is definitely worth picking up.)So if you like metal... or female fronted bands ... or just good music.

The movie is not quite as good as the original production on Broadway starring Tammy Grimes but it is still very entertaining in spots. The most memorable song is \\"Belly Up To The Bar, Boys.\\"Debbie Reynolds does a fine job in the lead as Molly Brown and Harve Presnel repeats his successful Broadway role as Leadville Johnny Brown. The strong supporting cast for the film includes Ed Begley, Hermione Baddeley, Jack Kruschen and Vassili Lambrinos.The movie received Oscar nominations for Best Color Cinematography, Color Costume Design, Color Art Direction and Adapted Music Score.

Debbie Reynolds as Molly is the most wonderful i've ever seen. Her incredible uplifing, very physical production numbers that she does is amazing. Handsome Harve Presnell as JJ with his great voice always gives me goose pimples.This basically semi, true story of Molly Brown, Hollywood/Broadway movie has excellent picture quality and the 5.1 Stereo Sound is awsome.

When she's not screeching, she's blubbering or strutting around as a two-legged caricature of false bravado. And she's a bit long in the tooth to be playing an urchin, as she does in the beginning of this movie. The choreography in this movie is unimaginative and lame, the characters are stereotypes, and Debbie Reynold's talents - on wonderful display in movies like Singing in the Rain - are totally wasted here. I saw this movie when I was a lot younger and don't recall liking it a lot, but I sat through it (saw it with my parents at a theater, so that's one reason why). This time around, I couldn't even get through it. I love musicals, but this one's a dud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Oldies!","review":"This is a great family film.

I have listened to many speakers in my time and, in my opinion, you would be hardpressed to find a better performer for the money. I listen to a variety of types of music and I'm never disappointed in these speakers. Played through a 50wpc tube amp and coupled with a PSW 12 sub, the sound is so good that I hear things on my CD's I haven't heard before. And my old speakers are on the famous Stereophile Recommended Components list. I did notice that a bookshelf speaker in this Studio Series is already recommended by Stereophile as well, so that should be an indication that this is a serious speaker. Do not confuse this series with some others in the JBL line. The Studio Series is for real."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Speakers with plenty of power to spare!","review":"Not only do I own a pair of these great speakers, but I also decided to build my home theater system around them. I have the S38's for surround, the S-Center speaker and not one but two PB12 subwoofers (I like a lot of bass)! Action, science fiction and horror movies are truly brought to life with these speakers. My CD collection has never sounded better. I have a Sony receiver rated at 120 watts per channel and so far I have not been able to turn it up even half way, that's how efficient these speakers are!

I have found it to be the best throat drops when a cold, sinus, or fever related problems arise. And it tastes good!Unfortunately, I cannot find the Honey Lemon Echinacea kind locally any more, and see that Ricola's web site no longer lists them as one of their products. So I bought this pack of 12 via Amazon to stock up. I hope that Ricola makes it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"funniest one liner ever","review":"I have only read the first two pages of this book, but I already give it five stars for the joke on page two. In his critique of Kaufmann's (whom he calls a soft Nietzschean) critique of Nietzsche, Green says something to the effect that one gets the idea from Kaufmann that the overman could very well be a Princeton philosophy professor! I have still not quit laughing.I just hope the rest of the book is this good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A captivating MUST read!","review":"I purchased this book at the publishing house on my tour of Ethiopia. Being \\"hooked\\" after the first page, I found it hard to put down while on my journey. It is the family saga of Greek immigrants living in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia during a terrorist regime. A very stong but gentle story of the blending of two cultures, filled with history and appreciation of the very unique Ethiopian people, their gentleness and their struggles to maintain religious and peaceloving values amidst the turmoil of socialist rule. I thoroughly enjoyed this book and recommend it highly to people of all ages and backgrounds."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Poignant True Story","review":"This is a remarkable effort from unknown authors who not only put their heart and soul in writing this heart-rending story about my country, but were brave enough to have it published at a time when their lives could have been at risk. Mengistu Haile Mariam's brutal military revolution destroyed the lives of innocent people causing great suffering and humiliation. This is an excellent, well written tear-jerker that touched the core of my heart. A great read that keeps you glued until the very end."},{"rating":"2","title":"An emotionally gripping adventure story","review":"I read this book some time back and am delighted to see it on the amazon web. A truly emotinally gripping adventure story of two different cultures blending into shared human experiences which often move to tears.

A real page turner."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"While I did think the child-friendly checklists were generally a good idea, I found myself wanting to edit them.

The checklists lead to a negative sense of self (i.e. \\"ADD is Bad\\"), no positive outcome possible.A side note, \\"school\\" and \\"homework\\" are an integral part of the book.

Stanford takes through a course on the nature, meaning, importance, and utility of history and social studies.

Uneducated farm girl is kidnapped by an escaped (but non-violent) mental patient and is forced to examine her life in a new way. She ends up sharing a mountain cabin with the strange, poetry-spouting man and comes to understand him. Benchley layers the story with flashbacks, which are curious if not especially necessary, yet his dialogue is keen and he makes these characters reachable and funny. Made into a first-rate 1975 telefilm (\\"Sweet Hostage\\"), Hollywood of course added a romantic subtext which you won't get here. Still, the even-handed way the novel plays out, and Benchley's talent with everyday talk, reaches the viewer in a warm and real way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superbly written story","review":"I bought this hard to find book because I'm a HUGE fan of the 70's TV movie \\"Sweet Hostage\\" which is based on it, and now I love both. As would be expected, the book, which is brilliantly yet simply written, explores each character with much greater depth, especially Hatch. Effective use of flashback gives the reader some idea as to why he is so troubled without being too explicit.Just a pleasurable, transporting read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for the weak....","review":"I remember seeing Gator when I was a kid. At the time, I was just excited to see Burt Reynolds. But as an adult, it is a hard movie to watch. The movie honestly portrays the prejudice and small minded attitude of many in the south in the 60's and 70's. Though where I was raised was not quite that bad, there were places that definitely were and we knew it. It makes me face how bad we were and how far we've come. Though definitely not perfect yet, we HAVE gotten much better than this. It brings back the time very clearly to me. Other than that, it is a vehicle for Burt to show off his appeal and to be the reluctant hero (for the time)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Zero stars for square screen not widescreen anamorphic","review":"dont buy this square screen garbage, trash, crap, wait for the blu-ray it will most likely be widescreen anamorphic! and just as cheaply priced."},{"rating":"1","title":"cut up TV version","review":"This was a favorite of mine, I don't know if the original version is lost or if it was cut up for TV and that is all that is left but it is not as I remember it from seeing it on HBO in the seventies.

Lucky cable subscribers need to look no further than Turner Classic Movies (TCM) for a 2.35:1 presentation of Gator (the ENTIRE film, not just the opening/closing credits a la the DVD). Plus, as anyone who watches knows, TCM also means uncut and commerical-free. I was fortunate enough to catch a 4:30am TCM-premiere of Gator on Thursday 9/23/04. Unfortunately, the film began ten minutes later than advertised so, of course, my VCR timer shut off with still several minutes to go. Oh well. No choice but to keep an eye out for the next airing which, unfortunately, won't be for at least another two months (if then, even). Still, give me a widescreeen VHS over a full-frame DVD any day---of any film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great movie from Burt Reynolds","review":"This is another masterpiece by Burt Reynolds, this might not be a comedy but its another fine movie. I loved Hooper, Smokey & The Bandit franchise, Sharkey's Machine and more and this is my favorite action movie.

You won't be disappointed if you enjoy Burt Reynolds many stunts and great material in this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"This movie old but still entertaining.

With no song over 2 minutes the tracks zip by but you never stop the head movement. The beats on each track are amazing and the album flows together excellently! When it all comes to an end and starts back over you find it hard to stop it from doing so, it's good enough to just let it play all the way through again.Yet another Stones Throw masterpiece and another great album from Oh No... It makes you wonder if that family can do anything wrong to music.I highly recommend you check this album out, but if you can't handle music without vocals then you may not appreciate this as much as others. I still would recommend you give it a listen, sometimes you may find that vocals can ruin a good beat and all you need is that head nodding rhythm anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a ball of confusion","review":"I have no complain about the actors. They do their parts pretty well. At first, it was interesting a scary. Then I got more confused not knowing what the story is all about. Is this supposed to be a ghost story? a maniac on the loose? the devil itself or a big invisible monster? I appreciate fictions and like the abnormal. But the logic has to be there, it's got to make some sense. I mean, a monsterous God being afraid of a bacteria is too much to handle. I can't believe they still waste the actors' talents on scripts like this. A good scary movie should keep you scared at least until the next day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Foolish waste of a good actor.","review":"I found this movie very hard to follow.

I picked this up at Blockbuster, stupidly paying money for a rental and just could not make myself watch the whole thing. I am a cheapskate and I never do this. It's playing on the WB right now as the requisite bad sunday afternoon movie.I'll just ask the obvious and say what the #&!! was Peter O'Toole doing in this? Perhaps this past sin is why he was shut out at the Oscars this year.When will I learn? Every Dean Koontz movie I've tried to watch is awful-interesting premise but really really predictable and intellegence insulting plot and dialogue. You can't really blame the actors, they do the best with what is clearly excremental scripting and directing. Even more pitiful and disappointing than Steven King movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"I read the book and wish it would of stayed that way!","review":"I think Dean Knootz is a very fun author to read. I picked up this book because a friend said it was good. The book was good, but not Knootzs best. I rented the movie because I wanted to see how much the book and movie differ. Well, to say it in a nice way - Read the book. The movie is all over the place. I know that they had a budget and had to fit the whole story in less than two hours, but then WHY make the movie. So much is missing about what exactly the Phantoms are and the ending in the book much better. WHY? WHY? WHY? I just can't understand WHY this movie was made in the first place. It should have been a TV miniseries. At least then you can actually make it longer then two hours and people will actually understand what the hell is going on.

I could be more harsh on this movie if I wanted to but it is not even worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shut Up Complainers!","review":"Phantoms is a horror film that harkens back to old hitchcock films. Why it is getting bad reviews for using suspense rather than gore to scare people is beyond me, I went in to this expecting a turkey like Scream, but boy was I surprised. While the effect wore off a minute after it was done, that is understandable for me, because the only movie that stayed with me for months was The Exorcist. Phantoms is a high quaility horror/thriller film that shouldn't be missed. It looks as though the previous reviewers either didn't get it, or saw the wrong movie. This is definately one that'll scare you, but don't go in expecting The Exorcist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phantoms","review":"Two women are searching a deserted town. They find the sheriff (Ben Affleck) and his two deputies, one is Liev Schreiber, and they tried to find out what is going on. Shreiber really does a great job as a slimy deputy. Anyways, the movie is a bit slow paced at first but diffently picks up the pace. A very fun film with some good speical effects. I dont understand why people dont talk about this movie more. It's very enjoyable and well worth checking out."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE BLOB, THE FOG, THE SHINNING, THE ANDROMEDA STRAIN...","review":"Is all of these movies put together. The first 20 minutes are good in getting our attention, but later when we kind of get the feeling the \\"phantoms\\" are not what we thought they were, the movie loses momentum. This film borrows freely from The Blob- the underground scene- and The Shinning- the somber kid that appears out of nowhere- The Thing- the exploding dog- The Fog- the group of dead people appearing suddenly- The Andromeda Strain- the desolated town- The Howling- scene where a character re-appears at a bar- and we could go on for hours... Is not a good movie for people who have seen many other horror films. The younger generation may get a kick of the boo! scenes, but that all."},{"rating":"1","title":"it could use lots of improvement","review":"it was not that scary i ohhed or ahhed a couple of times but thats it ,but the cast was wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"IF I COULD GIVE THIS A \\"-10\\" I WOULD","review":"Ben Aflek as a macho save-the-world hero is more than a joke, it's an insult to my intelligence.

The 5 remaining residents must find out who or what is responsible as they face danger of an ancient enemy of horrific proportions to try and remain alive.You would think a movie starring Ben Affleck, Rose McGowan, Live Schreiber and Peter O' Toole would be pretty good. Wrong!!! The movie is a sub-par mediocre horror story I doubt does Dean Koontz novel, that it is adapted from, justice. Character development is very poor, with little told about each character other than that which the plot relied on. On a plus though - the special effects are of a high value and there are quite a few (maybe 2) nice, scary scenes. Recommended for horror aficionados only."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very bad movie on DVD! It lacks extra features!","review":"This movie is based on the novel by Dean Koontz.If you read the book you know what the movie should be about! The movie's stars try to do their best with the material.This movie would food for the MSTK300 crew to tear it apart. As for the DVD, it lacks trailers,production notes,star bios, commentary from the stars,director etc! If you want to see this movie fime but it not a very good movie ! The only decent thing about the movie would the special effects! Other than that the DVD of this movie stinks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"And I thought Stephen King movies sucked!","review":"How such a truly great and creepy horror novel got turned into this p.o.s. movie I'll never know. The first 10 minutes of the movie is very close to the book, but after that takes a huge dump. There is so much story and charcter development left out the movie that I don't know how anyone could really understand or follow it. The \\"monster\\" was timid at best compared to the book. Ben Affeck? Who the hell cast him? I love Deans book, but even he probably had a stroke after viewing this turkey. 2 stars for at least being mildly entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"What a bad movie. I read the book over the summer so I figured I'd check the movie out. While the book wasn't GREAT, it was pretty interesting, unforunatley something the movie isn't. It leaves out at least HALF of the main characters that made up the book. The characters it does keep are terribly cast and act almost the complete opposite way they do in the book. I don't understand why they chose to change around a perfectly acceptable story so much until they made this mess, but they would have been better off saving there money and you will be too by reading the book instead of watching this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"I won't get into how amazing the novel was or how shocked I was at the theater upon seeing this wreck of a movie (or how I highly recommend the novel.)Instead, consider Ben Affleck. If he's starring as the sheriff in a serious horror movie, you know something's... wrong. I did enjoy the first half of the movie, which builds on ambience and scares you through the unknown horror around every corner.Then the movie barrel-rolls and plummets head-first into the rocks. It rips shreds from \\"John Carpenter's The Thing\\" to \\"Alien\\" and everything in between. The ending is overly simplified and lacks any of the terror from the novel (and in addition is far less epic.)A warning to anyone who's read the book and yet to see this adaptation; don't waste your time.For everyone else, again I recommend the excellent novel, or if you're still in the mood for a good horror movie, try one of the thousands of better ones out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"A let down after the book...","review":"Standing on its own, this movie was pretty bad - poor acting, poor script, silly special effects, etc. However, when compared with the excellent Koontz book it's based on, the movie's dismal quality really stands out. It's as if they took out everything good about the book and threw in some silliness to compensate.To sum up the movie in one word: terrible. Please do your self a favor and buy the book instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even Ben Affleck can save this movie","review":"I absolutely love Ben but making this movie was a huge mistake! He wasted his talent making a low-budget, cruddy film. The plot is so not plausible and the acting is just well, not good.

Don't listen to them! You have to read the book before you see it though, and the movie lacked many of the more scary parts, but it still was great. The bakery scene with the severed heads was real scary! The special effects with the giant moth and the sewer-tentacle-spikes that killed Galen Copperfield were very realistic! The dead bodies of the deputy Paul Henderson and the priest were incredibly real and graphic! The actors aren't too great, but Affleck fit the role of Bryce Hammond incredibly. This is a good movie to watch at night..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Exciting","review":"\\"Phantoms\\" starts off on a nice Scooby Doo mystery ride, but things quickly fall apart when Liev Shreiber, aka Deputy Stu, begins to do his best Telly Savalas impersonation from \\"The Dirty Dozen\\". The quiet tension that was building is soon replaced by heavy assult of standard military versus monster cliches, painful Ben Affleck overacting, and especially weak special effects.The DVD is completely a bare bones affair. Not even a trailer is included. The sound and picture quality is okay, but since the movie takes place primarily at night, some of the scenes are hard to make out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely passable time waster.","review":"This film could have and should have been much better. It starts off like gangbusters! Two sisters arrive in a town that appears to be completely deserted. From there, the film takes a rocket-paced nosedive into sheer and utter boredom. NOTHING HAPPENS, at least nothing worth reporting. The talents of Ben Affleck and Peter O'Toole are wasted, and would have benefited more from a script that actually gave their characters something to do. There is, however, a monster that's worth your attention. If you must watch, fast-forward to the end to catch a quick glimpse of it. Besides that, you'll actually be a lot better off reading the book this mess was based upon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"I read the novel in preparation for seeing the movie, and the novel stank, so I knew the movie probably would, too. But I'm such a Peter O'Toole fan, I went anyway. Well, he was good, but he wasn't in the movie that much. It was the first time I'd seen Rose McGowan, and I was impressed with her screen presence.

My friend and I talked throughout the whole film, making fun of everything. But for some reason, I guess because this movie is so cheeseball, it scared us more than all of the \\"Scream\\" movies put together. Low expectations can work wonders.Ben Affleck couldn't save this movie. We wanted Rose McGowan's character to die. And as for Ms. Going, she was wasted here.

I usually agree with Leonard Maltin, but he must have been watching a different movie. This isn't thought-provoking, it is nothing more than a bunch of trashy sex scenes loaded with nudity and rape. I can't understand one plot turn and trashy ex-rock star David Bowie looks like a dirty freak here (but maybe he is supposed to). Movie isn't deprived of some interest, but I wouldn't recommend it. Why not watch the TV movie \\"V\\" for some inventive and watchable sci-fi.

David Bowie... how do you rate his performance with that of other conventional actors? You can't. He is brilliant in his role as Mr. Newton! I was completely mesmerized and even attracted to him as the thin redhead.

I'm 16 now, and i first saw this movie when i was 14. I understood it as much as you can the first time you watch it, and if you're thinking while you're watching, then that's pretty much 100%. This movie raises questions about the society and government we live in, things we're exposed to, relationships, human desires...lots of questions. It is really a work of art. I was unfamiliar with the book, and director. And i still loved it. I am 16 years old and I still loved the movie. Yes... I am a rabid fan of David Bowie's, but even if he wasn't in it and I still watched it, I would have loved it. (Honestly though, David is perfect for the role. He's a very talented actor and added greatly to the movie.) This is a great movie for people who like to think and I recommend it to everyone. Even if you're not a Bowie fan!"},{"rating":"1","title":"David Bowe oddity","review":"Good actor/bad movie: Very strange movie and not worth the caliber of actor that is David Bowe. The movie content is unrealistic. Why a good-looking, rich man like David Bowe would have anything to do with a brainless bimbo like the motel maid he hooked up with (until she got old and fat) is not believable. They could have written it where he met a beautiful, intelligent and sensitive woman who enriched his life as he traveled through it as an alien until he outlived her - something like the Highlander - so that the movie had some merit with a quality actor like David. Since he has so few movies as it is, I put it in my library as a collector item, only. Sorry, I'm afraid I have to rate it as a C-."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a mess of a movie","review":"I may not be the best one to review this movie as I saw it about 18 years ago. I was 12 and my mom rented it for me because she thought it was sci-fi and looked like something I might like. If she knew what she had rented she'd have been horrified. Now I'll admit I may have been too young to really \\"get\\" this movie, but I do remember it felt like it was five hours long and didn't hold my interest at all. The only reason I didn't turn it off was because I don't walk out on movies. I kept waiting for something interesting to happen but it just dragged on. The main thing I remember about it is the multiple viewings of David Bowie's Penis. Now I'm not offended by male nudity, but this was kind of ridiculous. I would not suggest this movie to the average viewer and not even to the higher class viewer, which I consider myself to be. This is only for the real cult, art house followers so be warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull as dirt (Vol. II)","review":"Note: I am a patient man.

I've tried to watch this thing at least three different times (allowing a good year between viewings in one instance).SHORT REVIEW: It's boring; I don't know how else to describe it.Same thing goes for Don't Look Now: BORING.

So, without having seen it before, I bought the DVD. What a total waste... To put it another way, I have purchased 140+ DVDs and I consider this movie to be the worst. Specifically, this movie is too long and David Bowie's character (the main character) is just too wierd."},{"rating":"1","title":"bowie phone home...","review":"If you're a huge David Bowie fan then you might like this flick- just to see him (and I mean all of him) in 1976, with great hair, and those magnetic eyes.

You also get Criterion's great selection of special features. They are definitely worth watching, even if you are just a casual fan of the film.

It's got assassins wearing matching gold-spangled motorcycle helmets. A university professor who insults his department head with impunity, then happily goes from banging coeds to living in a Quonset hut in the desert with nothing to do. Repeated images of people falling through space, some wearing shiny clothes. And best of all, a girlfriend for the spaceman whose only advantageous attributes are a love of gin and the ability to pick up a grown man; too bad she never learned to call emergency services when someone has a massive, bleeding seizure.

He could actually just stand on stage in one of his elaborate costumes and most of us would be mesmerized, back in his day of course. I remember going to this movie when it first came out and had to see it just because he was in it. There are no CGI effects at all, just something that is seriously lacking in most movies now, a simple story. I remember crying when he pulled out that living camera and saw his family dying on screen he realizes he'll never see them alive or ever get back to his planet again. Very powerful and sad. This movie isn't for every one it is slow and paced and not very noisy.

The chapters on analyses and database building have been written by others than Nash and turned out to be the least usefull in the book since they don't really explain 'how' to use the various concepts and their writing style is very different from Nash'. The rest of the book is an enthusiastic guide into Databasew Marketing with lots of short case studies for B-to-B, B-to-C and financial marketing.

A true classic, I can't wait until the movie comes out in June!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Captures the Heart","review":"No, this book is not for people who love violence, [physical activity], and fast action. This book is for the tender hearted. It is about loyalty, something sorely lacking in this world today. Loyal-love.

And you leave the book wishing that there were more such stories in the real world..........To really appreciate this book you should listen to it on tape or CD.

But what most people fail to see is the devistation that a disease can do to our lives. The beginning of this story was beautiful, but the second half is the reality of Alzheimer's. He is now the only one to remember these moments. To watch your soul mate torn from your reality and dumped into a world of confusion and loss is something I wish never to experience. I read this story a month after Alzheimer's took my dad from my mom at the age of 52. Don't just read this book solely as a love story. Read it as a testiment to what this disease steals from us"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable, sensitive reading","review":"This book was very sensitive and exact as to the feelings that people have when they loose the deepest love that they have. I lost my husband last year and still mourn his loss because we were so connected emotionally. Not many people experience that true love and cannot appreciate it unless they experience that feeling. The less than complimentary reviews of this book make me believe that they have not experienced that feeling. This book may not be a classic literary find (I have read the Grapes of Wrath, Moby Dick and most of the other classics, but it is worth the time to get to your deeper soul and ability to love someone else unconditionally"},{"rating":"1","title":"TRUST M E -- THIS BOOK WAS AWFUL!","review":"I bought this book based on the glowing reviews I read at Amazon.com but I must tell you, I hated this book. First I must clarify that I am NOT a snob or a hard-hearted romance hating person. In fact, I LOVED the Bridges of Madison County!!!! But this book was terrible. It was poorly written, and so overly simplistic and sentamental that I felt like I was reading a novel excerpt from Redbook magazine. Please, please, if you like fine books, do not even consider buying this book. I beseach you"},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived Crap","review":"What a waste of time. My wife and I just read The Notebook and were disappointed by almost every facet of it. Most of the dialogue was contrived and totally unreal. I don't care how romantic Noah is drawn up to be, no man speaks like that; unbelievable (in a bad way). One reviewer said the ending was creepy, and I would say that is putting it nicely. Another thing that was really stupid was that Sparks tries to give Allie virtue, yet she cheat's on her fiancé without remorse. Total character flaw, again unbelievable.Did I mention the writing was horrid? Sparks jumps between perspectives way to much. Third person is good, but he puts us in the mind of Allie and Noah in the same scene on more than one occasion. It surprises me Warner bought the rights in the first place. Not only that but the editor should be fired.I paid a mere 5.95 for the paperback and trust me that was too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"***WONDERFUL***","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

There are so many! There is so much trivial detail (I really didn't need him to explain how to make a cup of tea) and yet Sparks drops many sub-plots that might be interesting. I'd seen the movie and enjoyed it, but the screenplay, while not especially good, was universes better than the book. And the love scenes -- really. They're just awful and embarrassing. They read like they were written by an adolescent boy. I haven't read a Harlequin book since I was a teenager, but this is on a par with what I remember."},{"rating":"1","title":"Peuw! Peuw! Peuw!

Sugar shock!","review":"I'm not sure if I can find the words to describe how I feel about this book. I guess, simply, I hated it. And I like my share of sap. I cry at movies, I bawled at Titanic (all 12 times I saw it). So, believe me, I love a good, sappy story. This book, to echo the sentiments of many others, IS a glorified Harlequin Romance. The only difference is, there's no embarrassing cover to hide when you're reading it. Nicholas Sparks is a god-awful writer, and I think that's my most basic problem with this story. I think it IS a beautiful love story (if a bit far-removed from reality. I mean, you know they had to have some big fights, adjustments to make after marriage, etc.), especially at the end when they've grown old together and he's still with her and in love. But Nicholas Sparks can't write. AT ALL. He uses trite descriptions, banal dialogue and generally overly simplistic language. There are better love stories out there, and better written as well. Go find them. Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"This book has a horrible plot. If you are looking for a book that is cliche, and unorignal, then this is the book for you. The only positive aspect of this book is that it is an easy read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just okay","review":"I decided to read another Nicholas Sparks novel since A Walk To Remember was so good. I agree with other reviewers who say this story seems too similar to the Bridges Of Madison County movie with Meryl Streep and Clint Eastwood. The premise is good romantic escape, but in the end, the reader is not satisfied.The Notebook is about two people who went out in adolesence, move away to do other things, and then meet in town years later, only to find that the love between them never left. The story could have been great if we knew why they were in love and if we knew the charaters better. I read this on a long car trip, and I'd only read this to cure boredom."},{"rating":"1","title":"The notebook novel","review":"I was completely dissatified with this purchase as amazon didn't send the correct version of the book.

I know how hard it is to write and I would never attack a book or a writer just because I didn't like reading the book. But this is really, really something else. The characters in this book are so phoney, so flat and so unreal they sometimes made me laugh; at other times they made me want to throw up. The storyline just seems to be made of sticky sweet syrup; reading the book virtually gave me a toothache. I can't help pitying those poor trees that were felled to produce the paper on which this book was printed.

The hero, Noah, is \\"romantic\\" because he reads poetry, takes his girl canoeing on the river, and fixes dinner. But that's all window dressing. The bottom line is sex. They're great together. And Allie is the perfect heroine from a man's point of view. She has a great body. She thinks he's sexy. She hasn't gone to bed with anyone else in the last fourteen years, because he was so great. Yep, this is true love, from a guy's point of view.

The story, taken from the life of the author's wife's grandparents is the story of Noah and Allie who initially meet just before World War II. Most of the story is told in flashback as Noah is reading it to someone in a nursing home over 50 years after the initial meeting.This is so beautifully done but I must warn everyone to have the hankies ready!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A timeless romance novel","review":"Beautifully written in the common language of any one who has ever felt in love, \\"The Notebook\\" by Nicholas Sparks is captivating. The book takes you immediately into the character's lives, in a charming plot that brings the lovers together-- taking you through their journey.

Mr. Sparks shows so liitle insight and use of descriptive language, it is a wonder that he could drag this sad story on for 195-odd pages.

If you have always believed in true love and never-ending love ....this book is definitely for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!.One of the best love stories I've ever read.","review":"\\"The Notebook\\" by Nicholas Sparks is by far one of the best love stories I've ever read. It is a story of love and devotion between a man and a woman that will not die no matter who tries to stop it. The love everyone wants to find,complete with the expected tears in a romance novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book!","review":"i picked up this book and began reading it last saturday... i finished it last saturday, too! it was so good i couldn't put it down. do not start reading this book unless you have some time to dedicate to it.if you look to the end of the book to see how many pages you have left, make sure you're not counting the preview from his next book. i was disappointed when i thought i had more pages left than i really did have."},{"rating":"2","title":"touching story","review":"Very nice story...much better than the movie. It keeps your interest and if hard to put down. You feel for the characters and it is an emotional experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cathartic experience","review":"I really loved this book. I think for me it was a cathartic experience. I literally cried my eyes out for the last 60 pages. It is certainly a book you want to be at home to read. I would definitely recommend this book to my girlfriends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"A cute love story but prepared to cry. See the movie, it is a good representation with a few changes that still work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I first read this book about 10 years ago and all I remember is crying and crying. I loved, loved, loved this story. It is soooo sweet, heart-warming, and yet heart-breaking. I felt the movie was pretty true to the novel, but the book was better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book","review":"Nicholas Sparks did a greattt job with this novel. It is not just a romance novel where boy meets girl, boy falls for girl and the end. This book delights in the pleasure of true love and the turmoil true love can bring. 5 stars for Nicholas Sparks, a true romantic."},{"rating":"2","title":"This could be my grandparents","review":"My grandmother was in a nursing home for 3 years and my grandfather visited every day until he died. Reading \\"The Notebook\\" left me in tears. Having someone you know with this horrible disease leaves one feeling terribly helpless. This fact must be even more devasting to people that have been married for 60 years. I remember the pain and anxiety my grandfather went through on a daily basis, visiting a woman daily who no longer knows him, except infrequently. The turn of every page reminded of two of the most important people in my life. Their love was heartening and it is the kind of love we all hope to find in our lifetime. Great Read. Robin, Worcester,MA"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love can never be forgotten","review":"The one thing that someone can do for you is: \\"Just read the book.\\" Don't try to explain the book, just have them read it. It's a love story of a love so strong it cannot be reduced by years, other people, or commen sense. In the two characters eyes the only thing that matters is the other person. This is a book that will connect with your heart and soul, you will feel their pain and you will cry. Then, guarented, you will read it again.Don't pass this book up it's something that you will compare your life to over and over again. It will warm your heart, feelings, and way of life."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook is an outstanding story of romance that has lasted a lifetime. It was a beautiful book, one that I will always remember and will probably read again and again. I would highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Note Book","review":"I read this book in one day. I was truly riveted to the story line and it was a good love story. I have not had a good cry in a while and this book really touched my heart, to realize how true love never dies and stays with you throughout. The writer nicholas sparks is really good with words and imagery and the words came to life. I really loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Those Who believe in Real Love","review":"One of the greatest love stories in modern times-I havent had the opportunity to watch the movie but I hope it will move me the same way the book did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"I totally love this book.

Definitely a great read that I look forward to enjoying the next one the wedding"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Worthwhile!","review":"I am very surprised at the variety of response this book has inspired. It is a very, very touching book and has reminded me of the value of humanlife and our short time we have to appreciate it. Stick with it past the first 10 pages and you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching","review":"I just read the book & it touched me deeply. The love story is great, I can't imagine a love that is so powerful that it could heal a person's disease even for a moment. By reading this book, you know that true love does exist."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Bridges of Madison County Rip Off","review":"The book was written to draw the audience into emotions rather than telling the story. There were too many cliches to the story.The story reminded me of Bridges of Madison County. It was marketed quite well. Whoever did this deserved much of the credit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"It was too mushy for me. I couldn't get into it. I finally finished the book mainly because so many people had told me how wonderful it was. I guess it wasn't my type of book. All it was, was feelings, feelings, feelings. It never really went anywhere. It's hard for me to list a book as \\"I don't like it\\" because I can usually find some quality to like in a book which I did here when the couple was young, but eventually even that got to me. I'm glad the author is doing well, he has quite a following."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I found it very boring. I had heard good things but it really didn't hold my interest. The man in the story was very sweet and it was a great love story."},{"rating":"1","title":"TheNotebook","review":"This book was way overated. The first few chapters were good but most of the book was written from the nursing home and was very boring. I got the point after one chapter, didn;'t need half a book. I feel I wasted my money on this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"OH PLEASE!","review":"I am disappointed and somewhat alarmed at all the 10's this book has received here. Can't anybody see through the paper-thin prose and constant cliches? I love a good love story as much as the next person, and as a matter of fact, I am involved in a lost-and-then-found-again relationship similar to Allie and Noah's which has brought me much joy, but I was truly embarrassed by the author's simplistic, unrealistic, trite writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too trite for words","review":"The author has discovered all the ingredients for success -- make it short, use the same cliches over and over, refrain from developing any depth to the characters, provide no insight to the characters' personalities, skip opportunities for conflict, develop no character flaws. I never felt as if I really knew Allie or Noah. There was no develpment of Allie, what she'd been doing during the 14 years since she'd last seen Noah. To justify her seeking out Noah, she simply says over and over again, \\"I was just wondering what you'd been up to.\\" Please! These characters sound cardboard with dialogue that could have been written for a grade school paper entitled \\"What I did during my summer vacation.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Grab some tissues","review":"This book should be on the top of your MUST READ list. I've passed it on to all my girlfriends. It's a small book...great for those who don't have a lot of time to read, but full of great emotions. To be pulled into these people's lives and feel how strong their love is, it's amazing. This book will live on with you for a long time after you are done reading it. And for those hopless romantics, it will make you believe the right one is out there and you can live happily ever after."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ah, young love!","review":"A bodice-ripper sans ripped bodices (ha, she unbuttons *his* shirt). Personally, I'd have thought she'd opt for a shower before going back to meet Lon. No wonder he disappeared. In short, about as plausible as Love Story, and serves the same purpose: makes the ladies sigh and look askance at the guy snoring next to 'em.Stick with \\"How We Met\\" in Ann Landers. At least they're real."},{"rating":"1","title":"Secrets revealed by the notebook effect elderly woman's life","review":"Another disappointing attempt at creating a moving romance. The author equates love with tragedy. True, all life ends in death, but he dwells on the negative rather than the positive. The book takes the reader on an emotional roller coaster ride and then drops them off the cliff into oblivion. Don't bother with this book or you'll need prosac to face the day."},{"rating":"1","title":"A true love story? I think not","review":"I barely call this a love story. It truly would be called a love story if it didn't have all those obscene descriptions in them. I was reading this book during homeroom and I got into trouple because of what I was reading. Truly, I couldn't tell it would that kind of a book from it's description in the back. I've seen more writing talent in a Dr. Seuss book than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"More sap than maple syrup","review":"I'm not sure why certain romance novels seem to \\"catch on\\" and become mega-bestsellers while others are relegated to the pink-and-baby-blue-softcolor shelves. In this case, I don't see what all the hype is about. There are much better books out there to spend your time with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should be 0 stars.","review":"Predictable and lame, this is a weekend laptop turnout from an author who expects success. Why is it given to him? Are best seller readers so infantile that they will accept cheap writing at $6.95 a pop? Total waste of time. Don't read if you have any education or self-respect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable, unbelievable, and unrealistic","review":"Adequately written for the general public, yet way over the edge for believability. Admittedly tugged at my heart strings, but also pulled my leg."},{"rating":"1","title":"An unrealistic, laughable book","review":"A co-worker leant me this book and I alloted a night for it-it didn't even take me that long! I couldn't believe the characters, the situations, and most of all, the dialogue. I am in love and would make sacrifices--I only hope that my love will never be as cliche and ridiculous as this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"1 word: pedantic","review":"This book was so poorly written that it was difficult to read. (Nicholas Sparks, if you're reading this, I'm sorry.) I could have written something better, more entertaining, and more subtle when I was about 8. I cannot understand what sort of publishing house would actually produce such an amateur attempt.I am reading Sparks's second novel, Message in a Bottle (or was it his first???), figuring that perhaps The Notebook was just a fluke. I must say, it is better, however a glaring lack of subtlety must be Sparks's trademark.But go ahead and read it - it will only take an hour or so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Touching at times, but far too predictable","review":"Watch out Harlequin! This book reminded me of those ridiculous grocery store checkout romances I read in Junior High. Although the book is so short, it took me over a month to read it. The plot was non-existent and the characters were cardboard cut-outs. The dialogue became so cheesy at times that I had to put the book down lest I puke. I kept hoping it would get better but it never did. It did have a few touching moments, but overall this was a very disappointing read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Enjoyus Interruptus","review":"The predictable storyline of this book (I can't call it a novel) never really \\"happened.\\" I could have handled the thin plot if the writing weren't so meager. This book included some of the dumbest dialogue I have ever read. I only read with any interest far enough to find out what happened and then could have easily left it never wondering again what became of the lovers. I only finished it because I am on vacation. And now free to read a REAL novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"I read this book...yuck!","review":"This book bored me to tears. Thank God I borrowed it from the library. I would have hated to spend hard earned money for it. Sorry Nick."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't enjoy this book","review":"I can't believe this book is a \\"phenomenal international best seller\\" I hated it, I only dragged myself through it because it was given to me by a friend. I thought it was totally corny, and thoroughly unbelieveable. Were we supposed to cry? Where??"},{"rating":"1","title":"couldn't finish it","review":"what is the big deal? i found this so boring i had to put it down and never did pick it back up."},{"rating":"1","title":"knock , knock . Louder !!!","review":"On my head for reading a story like this, of a man just came back from world war II but he stir the water to make sure the powders were dissolved , and a woman who cried for the sun rise !! this story is so poor it took advantage of Alzheimer .. and reading it is no charity !"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Notebook, the novel","review":"This is a great, quick read. The writing is superb and the story is wonderfully romantic, with a slight twist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific book","review":"This is the kind of love story that we all hope for, but never get (Almost?!?). When I first read this book, it was not a major motion picture, but held my attention from beginning to end. I also believe that while the book was phenomenal, sadly, the movie did not do this story any justice.(I beleive the actors could have done a better job personifying the protagonists)This was my first Nicholas Sparks book; I remember thinking how much I love this book and was immediately on the lookout for other Sparks books.I recommend this book 100%!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"AVOID LIKE THE PLAGUE","review":"I saw the film and it had me in tears and so I thought .... lets try the bookBIG MISTAKEIt not only failed miserbaly to live up to the film and my expectations but also ruined one of the best films I've ever seen. All I can say is the script writer is an absolute genius, because he/she managed to create absolute genius from a pile of rubbish writing I wouldn't taint my compost heap with. How do you go from Dear John to this???Did Nicholas Sparks fall and hit his head??????Go out and buy the film... you will cry like a baby and enjoy it immensly, but do NOT buy the book!! it will destroy the film for you forever!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheese","review":"For the second 1/2 of the story, the ending seems so obvious that I expected surprise ending, but no. Total cheese. At least it's a short book. No more Nicholas Sparks for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"Maybe I made a mistake but watching the movie 1st. I kept waiting and waiting to get into the book, but never did. The end just seemed wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"Am I the only one? I thought this book was one of the worst I have ever read! It was written so badly that it was embarrassing to read. It was so cliched, so unimaginative, so awkward! If this was a bestseller it should be proof that anyone can write a book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Emotionally manipulative","review":"Nicholas Sparks always needs to have someone die to make a poignant romance. It's quite sad, really.And Noah was the most unrealistic character ever. NO GUY acts or talks like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"I agree with erinleigh1","review":"I didn't expect it from Nicholas Too..The first book I've read was ( A walk to remember ) & it was such a brilliant book.. it was totally dirfferent about a pure LOVE...(the note book) is an absolute (yuk)..! & I'm not trying to be rude! no.. I'm just upsettttt!!!the book made no sense @ all..it was disgusting! a real Yukkkkkkkkkkkkk"},{"rating":"1","title":"Are they still witing this awful stuff?","review":"The most boring thing I've read in a long time. Two perfect people having a perfect romance.

I have read them all and if want a great read with a touching story then he is the author for you. Get your kleenex's ready. You can't go wrong here.And I always preorder his new ones..... I'm addicted."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Notebook's Journal","review":"The Notebook is the greatest love story since Romeo and Juliet. Nicholas Sparks has out-done himself this time. The Notebook moved me greatly. It made me realize that true is a never-ending story and that it can only be found once in a lifetime. Even though Allie and Noah have fights they work through it and their love grows stronger. This should encourage couples everywhere to work through their disagreements because true love conquers all. I give Nicholas Sparks two thumbs up for this moving and touching story."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT?","review":"i read this book up until the point he reunited with allie and then felt the story was over. when it jumped to them being in the nursing home and her not remembering him i lost focus and was bored. i honestly could not read on and put the book away. maybe i need to try again since it has such great reviews i don't know. i will NOT however see the movie as that definitely ruins the whole book reading experience since hollywood loves to change things so as too seem appealing to more people. not my favorite nicholas sparks book but still have NOT given up on him either as i have read quite of few of his that i just loved and will read again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my kind of book","review":"This was a very boring read. A lot of words without saying anything. A bit too unbelievable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeeeeesh!","review":"A GUY recommended I read this. I'm a chick. I read it. Wanted to barf during the ordeal. Bad dialog. Trite, to say the least. Tried other Sparks novels (I mean, after all, the guy's a bestseller! Millions are reading his books!) What I learned after trying a few others: either I have zero taste, or millions of others have zero taste. Ha-ha, take your pick! If you're an ardent Sparks fan, sorry for offending....not."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my four hours back","review":"A recipe for The Notebook.Take two bland, perfect leads. Make them fall into a young syrupy love. Throw in a touch of class separation in the South. Age them enough to be world weary and to have accumulated another obstacle to their love. Overcome obstacle. Get old and forgetful. End the book with geriatric sex.Induce vomiting.[...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"The book told such a touching story. I was deeped moved and inspired by the true love that two people could share. It made me feel good about life. Wish there are more good stories like that in real life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow what a book","review":"Two years ago my teacher recomended this book to me. After reading it. I convinced three other people. Now the total has reached twenty. I love this book I couldn't it put it down. Even after reading it five times. This book still has the power to make me cry."},{"rating":"1","title":"An easy, forgettable read","review":"Nothing really happens in this book. It reads like a high school student assignment. The end has a touching aspect to it which brought it up from a one-star review to a two-star review. If there's bad weather at the beach and it's the only book there, go ahead and read it. If, however, you have the choice to do anything else with the precious moments in your life, do that instead. There are better love stories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made-for-TV material with not enough to exceed an hour","review":"I'm not sure what the big deal here is especially knowing that this has been a popular best-seller. This is one (long) declaration of love that leads us to a non-existent crescendo. A disappointing, but thankfully short and easy read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor writing and totally predictable story line","review":"Awful. Silly. I can stand a predictable story line if the writing is good, but this was the pits. If this guy actually considers himself an author, then I'm Ernest Hemingway. I got the book as a gift. I may never forgive the friend that did this to me!!!!! This book is an insult!"},{"rating":"2","title":"timeless love story","review":"As a first time Nicholas Sparks reader, I was very impressed with The Notebook. It is a timeless love story between two very passionate people, Noah and Allie, who once again find love after fourteen years of separation. Snags catch their hearts though, one being that Allie is currently engaged to a dependable lawyer whom she does love, but not like Noah. Throughout the novel the reader is left with the question of who Allie chooses and must read to the very last chapter to find out the ending to the story. Almost fairy-tale like in nature, the story proves how resilient love can be. If you're looking for a romantic love story, and don't mind a novel that plays with your emotions, The Notebook by Nicholas Sparks is a great place to start. I will definitely read some more of Sparks' books after the wonderful experience I had with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Romantic entertainment","review":"A light romantic book that should be read in one sitting with a glass of favorite wine. Just an enjoyable experience. I want to marry either Nicholas Sparks or D.M. Roman (the author of Fried Calamari who shows great insight into a woman's mind)."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was awful - sappy and sophomoric","review":"Nicholas Sparks(aka. Noah) might be a poetry reader, but he surly is not a poetry writer. The writing is dull, pendandic,and downright boring. The whole book is so simplistic I am appalled at what the good reviews it has received say about the American reading public."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Beautiful Book","review":"A thoughtful and beautiful tale told from a man's perspective through the thick and thin of his relationship. Makes you believe in happily ever after again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wise investment","review":"This is one of the best books I have read. The writing is so vivid and passionate. I have passed it on to five others and they whole-heartedly agree. Thank you Nicholas."},{"rating":"2","title":"An exceptional tale of never ending love.","review":"\\"You are, and always have been, my dream.\\" What a powerful tale of undying love..... if only we could all experience a love as Noah and Allie did. To see such passion through the eyes of a man ..... as both the main character and the writer.... I had tears in my eyes throughout the whole book. I have read Message In A Bottle also and am looking forward to Nicholas Sparks' next novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic Love Story","review":"I haven't seen the movie yet but this book is one of my favourites. Nicholas Sparks is a wonderful author, and anytime I read his books, I'm surprised that the story is written by a man. There is so much passion in it and it's really heart warming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overly Sentimental","review":"Overall, I liked the book and I read it in one straight sitting of about 3 hours. However, I did at times find the book to be overly sentimental and over the top at some points. Sometimes I just wanted to scream OK I GET IT THEY LOVE EACH OTHER MORE THAN ANYTHING LETS NOT DWELL ON IT! Too sappy at some points but i would recommend the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST BOOK!!","review":"The Notebook is the sweetest, most touching novel I have ever read. I picked this book up before a 7 hour car ride and had to put it down numerous times to hide the fact that I was about to cry. Even if you know what is going to happen, as I did the first time I read it, you will cry. I cried many, many times during this book. I have read this book 3 times and have not gotten sick of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Of My Faves","review":"I'm not going to describe the book because so many before me have. But I do want to say that it is one of my favorite books and what got me to like Nicholas Sparks. Some aspects are a bit far fatch but its kind of sweet to think that someone would be so enamored with someone else. Its a sweet story. I don't know why anyone would give this book a bad review unless you don't like romance novels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic! A must read for all hopeless romantics!","review":"The Notebook is a love story that stirs the heart of the reader to love their spouses, children, and friends with a genuine love most people only dream of experiencing. The book can be easily read in an evening, and leaves the reader longing for the love described so eliquently by Nicholas Sparks."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most romantic story I've ever read .","review":"Because I live in North Carolina, it was even more visually powerful. There is some truth even today about the Southern caste system of marrying the \\"right\\" man. Sparks made both characters feel with their whole hearts. A story about the one and only \\"perfect\\" love each of us deserves. I truly enjoyed every minute of reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best love story ever","review":"A friend of mine lent me this book to read and I can't thank her enough. It is the best love story ever told. I stayed up all night cause I couldn't sleep til I finished. My husband thought I was crazy! I have now found the perfect Christmas gift and plan to give it to all my close friends and family. Everyone person should be loved like that. A must read!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful love story","review":"Beautiful love story...Just touched my heart love Nicholas Sparks and this did not disappoint in any way shape or form"},{"rating":"1","title":"An insult","review":"Cliche plot, cliche sentences, unoriginal, unmoving: John Locke was correct when he said that in a capitalistic society mediocrity would rule, would rise to the top, but he NEVER prepared us for this!!!where is the Salinger of our time???!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Actually, no stars for Nicholas Sparks","review":"Nicholas Sparks seems to be under the mistaken impression that mediocre writing and a contrived plot can be hidden under adjectives and long-winded description. It can't. This is writing for money's sake, without any poetry, emotion, or heart. About four pages into the book, the reader basically can figure out the gist of the plot. And did we really need that five-page description of cooking a crab dinner? Allie and Noah are merely caricatures of actual human beings, and Sparks barely touches real human emotion here.. All in all, a disappointing and actually unbearable reading experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest and powerful story of compassion...","review":"The most tender story of unconditional love, written with the power of simplicity. No intellectual posing, or toying with the reader, but handled with gentle caring and directness.This far surpasses even \\"Madison County.\\" Every writer, as well as reader, should be taking notes on this work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Taps into the deepest emotional core.","review":"This story is a fast read, yet one of the most beautiful books I have ever read. I couldn't put it down. The only time I did, was to stop myself from getting so lost in the book. I had to look up and distinguish my reality. A book that can do that, is worth reading. You won't finish this with dry eyes though. Enjoy, it is heart-warming."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect love story!","review":"I have read this book over 5 times in the past 4 years. I absolutely love Sparks style of writing and the intimacy of this love story. It is the perfect read for any adult woman!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It was the most amazing love story I have ever read.","review":"I though it would be the run of the mill love story. Was I ever mistaken. From the very beginning, Sparks held my heart in the palm of his hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Sparks tells a wonderful story that seems so real. The words that Sparks write paint a beautiful story in you mind. It's a book that you can't put down until you know what happens to the two lovers. You feel each characters pain, happiness, and want. Just seeing the cover of the book or hearing the title makes my heart skip a beat and brings a tear to my eye! I recomend this book to anyone that is in love, wants to be in love, or who has seen love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart touching story made my Day","review":"I found the Notebook to be a touching heart warming story. After the plodding read of Cold Mountain by Charles Fraizer it was good to read a book that at least used quotation marks. I thought Mr. Sparks did an excellent job of conveying what the characters were feeling. I loved this book and I don't really care much for Romance novels. I certainly would not put it in the same category as the Danielle Steele drivel that other reviews have. Maybe some readers need to take off their jaded glasses and give this one another read."},{"rating":"2","title":"It'll Bring You To Tears","review":"This is one of my all time favorite books. If you want to curl up and read a sweet romance story and maybe shed a few tears, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant quick weekend read","review":"Right in the middle I was disappointed by an unnecesary love scene.. but other than that this is a quick read and pleasant for one weekend.I enjoyed the writing and the story, but it is a watery romance with little robust character. Still, as I mentioned: pleasant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fiction at it's worst, stock full of editing errors.","review":"I read mostly fiction; at least 2 books a week and enjoy most of what I read. The Notebook is the worst book I have ever read and the publisher should be ashamed of themselves. The first 20 pages are stock full of the word \\"and\\" connecting sentence after sentence after sentence. It's almost comical. If you haven't read a book in 20 years and want to get started again, this might be the book for you; just do me a big favor, don't buy the book, check it out at the local library. Make sure to look in the card catalog under \\"over rated\\". If I could rate this book with no stars I would have."},{"rating":"1","title":"I felt robbed.......","review":"I had heard of this book so many times and seen interviews on TV, I decided I would read it. In fact, it was chosen as my bookgroup's selection to discuss this month. But I surely felt robbed as I read it. For the first half of the story I kept waiting for something to happen... during the second half I lost all hope. I still can't shake the feeling that this guy, with his business sense, said, \\"I'm certainly not a writer, but I can sell a book\\"! He wrote with a shameful shallowness, and it makes me sad that such a book became a bestseller. It says something dreadful about the mentality of our society."},{"rating":"1","title":"If this is the best book you ever read-get a library card!","review":"I can't even believe this book was published, never mind that people thought it was great! They obviously have not read truly great books.

Critics are...well, right. Completely."},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE...","review":"I simply don't understand how people can give this awful book a 10. What else have they read, or better yet, what haven't they read? Perhaps it was the small size of the book that was so appealing... Can hardly wait to see the movie - NOT! At least I borrowed the book, wasting my precious time and not a dime."},{"rating":"1","title":"sad waste of time","review":"Next week will be my first meeting with a neighborhood bookclub. Alas, if they collectively like this highly-publicized drivel, it may be my first and last. The boring, stereotypical, wooden, one-dimensional, humorless characters and the improbable dialogue and interaction were painful to experience. I did appreciate the length - mercifully short. And Mr. Sparks looks real cute on the book jacket."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Only Book I Ever Threw Across A Room","review":"Ugh. This book is the most sappy, predictable, and unreadable I've ever encountered. I read all the others recommended by Amazon under the \\"Customers who bought this also bought...\\" and they are all far better than this one. A Harlequin romance for the geriatric set."},{"rating":"1","title":"disapointment!","review":"Usually I say when a book it turned into a movie, the movie lacks something. In this case though I felt the movie was able to portray the emotion of their love much better than the book. As I was reading the book I felt as if he wrote the story as a script for the movie then wrote the book as an afterthought. On its own it is a very good book, I personally felt more emotion from the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Noteworthy!","review":"Sparks presentation of this bittersweet love story really moved me. It has been a long time since a book like this has affected me. The story tells of Noah and Allie's summer experience when they were still teenagers and discovered love. Their parting was brought about by Allie's parents who thought that Noah was not good enough for their daughter. After more than a decade, Allie comes back to Noah to tell him that she is engaged to a prominent lawyer, yet is still drawn to Noah, her \\"dream\\". Sparks weaves this story fluidly. He descibes scenes and situations vividly that the reader sees himself in the story. A light, fast-read, beautiful love story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book and it is one that I would read again. It truly touched my heart and I would highly recommend it. I had loaned my copy out and am anticipating buying another copy. It shows how poignant a long lasting lifetime of love can and should be between a husband and wife."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not read this book","review":"I looked up this book to review it because I think it's the worst book I ever read. No wait, that was the one time I read a Danielle Steele book. Anyway... The writing is like cardboard, dry and stiff, and that's how you leave emotionally. There is nothing engaging about the romance - which is the most unromantic love I've ever read about. It may have been a good story written by someone else.I give it 2 stars because the segment at the end is more engaging and touching, unlike the main bulk of the book, but still even that part should have been much better. Bad writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I don't tend to write bad reviews - but I wanted to warn people if they were thinking of reading this one. If you're looking for a sappy short read that you can get through in a few hours, go ahead and read it. But if you were looking for a memorable work of fiction that has believable characters and a solid storyline, keep looking. I haven't found anything to recommend instead of this book quite yet, but The Notebook definitely isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lukewarm","review":"So far, I've read two of Sparks' novels - neither have impressed me. The author is very unimaginative with his plot and word choices. How he became so popular is beyond me. Within the first few chapters, any intelligent reader can dissect the rest of the book to figure out the ending, which is, by the way, unsurprising. I would only recommend this book to preteen girls - they might find some depth to the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nauseating","review":"I'm starting to wonder why I belong to my book club, considering that I've been subjected to books like this one. This book was long on detail, short on plot. It's the kind of witless book you can read while supervising the kids swimming during the summer; your full attention is not necessary to grasp the \\"plot\\". This book reads like a made for television movie...that you decide from the advertisements not to watch. I did learn one thing though: even if you write a really bad book, someone somewhere is bound to publish it. Save yourself from the nausea and spend your money on another book, just about any other is more worthy."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time","review":"This book is astoundingly awful. It has almost no plot, character development, or conflict. It is completely predictable, boring, and slow. It brims with syrup-y ingenuine unbelievable sentimentality expressed in childish cliched prose.The protagonists are flawless and over idealized. The writing itself is nauseating. One protagonist is described as a \\"living poem\\".The other's \\"every movement exudes sexuality\\".Read the other criticisms. They tend to be right on the money.My sister-in-law gave the notebook to me for Xmas because it \\"changed her life\\". I'm baffled as to how. And I'm not just a heartless male. I've enjoyed several \\"Oprah\\" books.\\"The Notebook\\" is cotton candy. Overly sweet puffed air in pretty colors that will leave you with a stomach ache."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing could ever compare!","review":"The Notebook by Nickolas Sparks is the BEST book I have read yet. This is a story of a summer love. The younge man , Noah, falls in love with a younge rich vacationer,Allie.They come twe totally different classes. Her parents despise Noah because of his financial difference.The younge girls parents after the summer ends take Allie back to the city. Noah and Allie try to keep in touch but can they have a real long distance relationship. Allie meets another man; she loves him but in a different way than she loves Noah.

Once you read one, you want to read all of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mushy and predictable","review":"It's a love story, the main characters are handsome, intelligent, she's rich, his poor, but they are \\"perfect\\" for each other. The end is perfectly predictable. After reading 20 pages, you will know how it ends... Honestly I finished this book because it's very short (thanks God!), otherwise I would have jumped to the last page. So if you want to read a mushy predictable love novel, read this one, you won't be disappointed. I hope they never make it a movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Talk about predictable","review":"I was excited to read this book initially because I heard Sparks is a good writer but I was dissapointed very early on. Sometimes predictable books are fun but this one was too predictable in the sad sort of loathsome way. Sparks did a good job of characterizing the two main characters with their weaknesses and strengths but the two characters weren't exactly the least common kinds of people. I was dissapointed with the main characters actions towards her fiance and they both acted like small children who didn't know much about right and wrong, either that or they didn't care. I skimmed most of the book because my eyes could not stay on the page long enough to finish it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sappy and predictable story","review":"I expected this book to be engaging, but what I found was 2-dimensional characters and predictable outcomes. This book reminded me of a Harlequin romance. Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"to fast, to desultorily and to shallow","review":"Actually I thought this would be a nice time-passer after seeing Message in the bottle and that for a second time I would be able to escape into emotional trip. But the story was too foreseen, caracters and whereabouts of story were similiar to that in Message. Again there was water, this time a river, and Allison is a painter as Catherine in MITB. There were to many similarity with MITB that this novel can stand fo itself and give something new and on the other hand that old romantic passion. I was specially mindful to letters, for a search of that little moments that MITB made my life more genuin. But those were nothing comparable to ones in MITB and though I read it in several hours it has left me a taste of a bitter orange. If you would like to read beautifull, subtile love story, try Herman Hesse's Gertrud"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cotton Candy Novel","review":"This is a cutesy little book about Noah and Allie who've lost track of each other since their teenage years. When Noah returns home from WW2, Allie visits. Will they get together despite the fact that Allie is engaged? I think that sums up the plot rather well. You can probablly write the rest of the story yourself. Its sappy, syrupy sweet and makes Bridges of Madison County look like a Hemingway novel. But yeah, its romantic, its what you wish romance in real life could always be like. Makes you wonder if everyone can write a novel and be successful?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully Romantic","review":"This has to be my favorite book of all time. For a first time author...Nicholas did an excellent job. I felt so much love and compassion from the characters in \\"The Notebook\\". It was like all their emotions came out of the pages. I have never read a love story that inchanted me so much. I hope he writes many more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap!","review":"What a waste of time. My wife and I just read The Notebook and were disappointed by almost every facet of it. Most of the dialogue was contrived and totally unreal. I don't care how romantic Noah is drawn up to be, no man speaks like that; unbelievable (in a bad way). One reviewer said the ending was creepy, and I would say that is putting it nicely. Another thing that was really stupid was that Sparks tries to give Allie virtue, yet she cheat's on her fiancé without remorse. Total character flaw, again unbelievable.Did I mention the writing was horrid? Sparks jumps between perspectives way to much. Third person is good, but he puts us in the mind of Allie and Noah in the same scene on more than one occasion. It surprises me Warner bought the rights in the first place. Not only that but the editor should be fired.I paid a mere 5.95 for the paperback and trust me that was too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"This is such an amazing love story. When we first meet Allie, she hasn't seen her true love, Noah, in 14 years. The year is 1946 and he's been at war. She goes to see him when he returns and they both immediately realize that they are still in love with each other.Allie and Noah's love continues for half a century and keeps getting stronger and stronger. When Allie comes down with Alzheimer's Disease, Noah stays right by her side and takes care of her.This is a great love story, a real tear-jerker, and an all around amazing book.

I found it to be cliched, vapid, and predictable - way too predictable.If a book is really bad, I won't keep reading. I was almost there with this book. If you like romance novels, you'll probably like this book better than I did.As for the unconditional love part, yeah, it's there, but I think that I have seen the scenario from the end of this book (to say more would be a spoiler) in real life and don't see that the story here stands out more clearly as a shining example.Oh well, on to some of the other fantastic literature out there just waiting for me to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put it down!","review":"I absolutely loved this book! The movie was great too, but the book was even better. The creative writing style made it to where you could picture every word your mind took in. The way Nicholas Sparks conveyed the story through imagery caused me to read the book three times over. He showed the value of nature and romance in this story about two young people falling in love, loosing each other, and finding what they lost years later. This story showed a new perspective on life and what truly matters. I did not find one fault in the book and i highly recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"I cried ...","review":"what a lovely story ... I stayed up reading the book from start to finish all in one sitting ... it is hopelessly romantic."},{"rating":"1","title":"A silly book...","review":"Not much to say. A genre romance with a twist. How the sorts of books that are on the best seller list these days get there, I will never understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply the worst","review":"I cant' believe I could read something worse than the Bridges of Madison County. Nothing is believable in this novel. I still wonder how the author could come up with that stupid end (without that it could have deserved a rating 2). There is more to love than sex, mr. Sparks, especially (and hopefully) after your hair starts whitening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very stirring, will remain with you for a very long time.","review":"The story is very charming, but what grabbed me was the sad and lonely way this journey had to end.

I thought we were in love. This book shows me, we have a long way to go. I am not the emotional type, but this book led me very near to tears and that my friends is hard to do. After the first chapter or so, I couldn't understand what all the commotion was about, and was about to close it. I'm glad I didn't, for this relatively short book will be with me a very long time. I recommend this book to the young, the old, unmarried as well as married. If only we could all love each other in the same manner, this would be one wonderful world to live in."},{"rating":"2","title":"a quick read of love","review":"A quick read of LOVE. If you read at a decent speed, you can finish this book before you fall asleep in one evening. haven seen the movie first, you can visualize all of the characters in the book. It makes you wonder, if you are still single, if you will ever experience this form of true love in your life. Thus, it can make you feel very depressed if you start comparing yourself to the characters in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"I wanted to read this book after seeing the previews for the movie, which made it look really good. However, I was surprisingly disappointed. Reading the story, I kept expecting some major plot twist or turn, but - surprise, surprise - it ends exactly how you think it will. You automatically know who the man and woman are when you begin reading the book, and it's not hard to guess who Allie chooses to marry at the end. Also, it was kind of hard to believe that they could so easily revive their 3-month relationship after 14 years. Fourteen years ago I was six! That's a good bit of time there. And the way the book ends is kind of creepy...I wouldn't recommend this book unless you're a sappy romantic who cried at \\"Titanic.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"After hearing all the countless praises and optimistic reviews of this book, I was actually looking forward to reading it...was I disappointed! The whole feel of the book was it was trying too hard to evoke an emotional response from its readers. The only response I managed to muster was laughter. The premise had all the makings of a promising novel. What resulted instead was a poorly executed made-for-tv movie-of-the-week script disguising itself as a touching human drama. The characters were annoying...one dimensional and lacking any sense of depth or reality for that matter. I kept hoping the story would get better and it finally did---when I closed the very last page and realized it was finally over"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't add this one to your shopping cart!","review":"Beware of all the \\"10\\" reader ratings. I found this book lacking in substance & character depth. Sparks doesn't even take the trouble to explain why the \\"sparks\\" flew between the two main characters or why the flame kept burning for so long. I laughed all the way to the ending. \\"The Notebook\\" is nothing but a spin-off of the \\"Bridges\\" tale by Waller. Why can't writers & their editors come up with more unique idea content? I mean, come on, let's give everyone reading the book a good cry now by letting one of the character's come down with Alzheimer's. I found this book a feeble attempt at capturing the essence of enduring love. I think if the book is ever made into a movie, I will save my seven dollars & cut my losses. I gave this book a \\"2\\" rating only because Nicholas Sparks gets a 1 pt advantage for a man trying to write a romance.

Even if your marriage is safe and sound, read this book and you'll be able to remember just how deep your commitment goes. The story will have you cheering from the start and crying at the end. Then give this gift of love to your spouse but make sure your there when they reach the last chapter. \\"The Notebook\\" will make you both weep and remember exactly how much your love to oneanother means"},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's be honest - this is a poorly written book.","review":"Surely there must be someone else who thinks as I do about this poorly written book. The second part of the book which recounts the meeting between the man and the woman has the worst dialogue I can remember reading in a book. I don't know how many times he writes that the main character is sitting in the house but \\"stares at the stars\\" as he says something - or he \\"stared at the moon.\\" He sets up dialogue with phrases such as \\"he went on to say.\\" I was so distracted by the terrible writing. I think the reader is a personable handsome man who had a very good idea for a book, plus a good agent, but someone should have worked with him on writing dialogu"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad!","review":"I have read all three of Mr. Sparks books and he is a very good storyteller however, Mr. Sparks never writes a good ending to his books. When so much time is spent in reading a book only to get to the end and it is so sad leaves a very bad taste in ones mouth. Hopefully, his next book will have nicer endings or endings that can be clearly figured out. Right now I, like so many other people I know have no desire to read another sad doom and gloom saga."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage.","review":"I'm embarrassed for all the people who liked this book. I agree with the reader from northeast PA (July 11) that reading it was a complete waste of time. It doesn't entertain, enlighten, inspire, or make you feel anything except complete disgust with yourself for having bought the book in the first place. I'd recommend something of true literary quality, but most of the reviewers of The Notebook would never appreciate or understand it if I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time.","review":"I can't believe how many people liked this book--they must not do much reading or they'd know how completely unremarkable this is. The characters are cardboard and the story is 100% unoriginal. The numerous descriptive and explanatory passages are unimaginative and try the patience. Somebody in my book group selected this; what a joke--there was absolutely nothing to discuss. Plus, the ending was completely manipulative, pouring on the sentiment to try to get you to care about characters that are completely unreal. I guess Nicholas Sparks is laughing all the way to the bank, but as a writer he has no talent. The only kind of book I can't stand is the kind that insults my intelligence, and this one does. To the people who loved this: please, browse around amazon.com and expand your horizons a bit. If you do more reading, maybe your taste will improve."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can't judge a book by its cover","review":"Okay I admit it, I bought this book because I liked the different textures on the cover. Sadly, that's as exciting as it got. If you like love stories you will enjoy the fluff stuck in the middle. But come on, how unbelivable can you get. Not only was the writting poor (A lot of talkin' but not much said) but the plot was ridiculous. I'm sorry, but Alzhiemers dosen't work that way, no matter how much you love.

What a disappointment! I want my certificate back!! I thought this book was the worst book I have ever read! I love romance and I believe in true love, but this gagged me so bad. It was horribly written and was so boring....I will not read another thing this guy writes. I won't even see the movie, \\"A message in a Bottle\\".

First of all, we understand there is an audience for this simplistic love story, but for anyone searching for something more, they will be sorely disappointed. Our book club found the story very formulaic, trite, banal and uninspiring. As women, we were disappointed at the shallowness of the characters, especially Allie. She is presented as the \\"virginal\\" fantasy who saves herself for 14!!!! years until she is resuscitated by the strong and virile Noah. Until then she has stifled her artisitic creativity while Noah led a relatively full, albeit solitary life. The storyline had the potential to be interesting and provocative. Unfortunately, we are given one-dimensional characters whose love for each other seems free of struggle and not grounded in reality. They make it look too easy.

Let's call it a short story). I'm one of the sappiest, mushiest people I know and I could hardly get through this book. I promptly threw it away once finished. Sparks should have at least attempted to make his characters' dialogue even the least bit realistic or believable. The constant over-the-top 'her eyes glistened like glowing emeralds in a sea of shimmering diamonds and she wondered how she ever made it through one breath without seeing the ripple of his chest' writing was just way too much.

It's incredible how much Noah loved Allie and I loved that about the book because I think that is the kind of love we all would want to have. The reason I didn't give it five stars was because I expected a little more from the end. The ending was ok and I didn't feel frustrated with it but I think the author could've added a little more to it.Overall I think this is one of the best love stories and the first one I've read because I usually don't get into reading the heated love books but decided to read this one because I wanted to see the movie.

I've concluded that the narrator died at that moment, but that's not so according to my friends. My book club is in a heated debate over this. This debate has been the most interesting part of reading this book... wondering what on earth Nicholas Sparks is describing there at the end - death or new life?

I had to skim over a great deal of it because the writing was so bad. The mother's actions were unbelievable; \\"true love\\" at age 15 is very rare; and the Alzheimer's situation was unrealistic.

Nicholas Sparks seems to know just how to hit the right chord, at least with me anyway, and I've never thought of myself as a hopeless romantic. This story is much deeper than \\"Message in a Bottle\\", which was a nice story, but didn't have nearly the uplifting quality that \\"The Notebook\\" does. I usually don't cry when I read books, but I cried BUCKETS with this one, mainly because of the tenderness that Sparks gives his characters, and the beautiful pictures that he paints with words. I think that one of the most attractive things about the way that he writes is that I think we all want to be loved this way. Sparks has a tremendous gift that he graciously shares, and I am thankful to have read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made Me Cry","review":"I can't recall a book that ever brought tears to my eyes. This is the first. Although the story is pretty predictable, it is extremely touching. The relationship of the characters is one that most of us long for and few of us get. If you read it you'll be sure to enjoy it. Bring tissue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Saw the movie didn't cry, read didn't cry. Everyone else I know did. It is full of emotion and passion. Almost like Johnny and June."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sappy Wishful Unrealism","review":"I love romances. I really do. But this one is really abysmal. The movie is reasonable, but the book is intolerable. If I have to hear the sentence \\"She was beautiful\\" just one more time, I'm going punch Nicholas Sparks in the kneecaps. This book is very much a good indication of why Sparks was unknown for so long. The movie works. The book definitely doesn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This book is amazing. It really shows how people can continue loving each other and what true love is. I wish the book was much longer though and was sad to put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I love this book I love the romance and mystery and recommend it to everyone who enjoys both things in a book"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of time!!!!","review":"This book has been written a thousand times before Mr Sparks was even born. It's such a common love story, a 12 year old could have written it. You don't even care about the characters because you don't get to know them, and every word is a deja-vu of third rate romance novels. Thank God it's so short!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing, unrealistic, and shallow","review":"The book covers a deep, heartbreaking subject in a shallow and unrealistic manner.Want to be depressed and bored? If so, this is the book for you!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr. Sparks - aren't you embarrassed?","review":"This thing (I hesitate to call it a novel) is a gooey mess. Allie and Noah were totally unrealistic (except for their very real diseases) -one could find better character development in a comic strip (remember Nancy and Sluggo?). I've always wanted to write a novel but feared rejection. Thank you, Mr. Sparks - I've changed my mind!"},{"rating":"1","title":"corny book","review":"this story should be with the books w/ fabio on the cover. I can't believe it is a bestseller. I read this when I was in a book club, totally going into it with an open mind. this is for small-minded folk. These characters are so phoney and the dialogue so corney that I thought I was going to throw up on the book itself. yuck!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple story, simply told, but touching at times.","review":"Sparks does what every writer in the business has been told not to do since the beginning of...well, since the beginning. He ignores the concept of viewpoint, switching between characters in the same scene, confusing everyone except those \\"romantic\\" enough not to notice. The language is pedestrian at best; however, I can't forgive the writer (and apparently editors) who let lines like \\"and she smiled softly\\" slip through their fingers. When I figure out how one can smile softly, I'll try reading another book by Sparks."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you like great literature, don't bother","review":"Two people whose taste I respect insisted that I read this book. I still haven't figured out why. It was simply awful. Poorly written, cliche, boring, trite, etc. The only reason I read to the end was because my friends had insisted I would love it. If you like great literature, don't bother with this book no matter what your friends say. If on the other hand, you love reading cheap romance novels, you will probably love this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor excuse for a best-seller","review":"Are you an avid reader? Then really, don't waste your time on this one. It will only take a few hours, but you may as well be picking your nose because this is really disappointing. I am all for a sad love story, but this is a sappy, poorly written novel. It might have been easier to read with fewer grammatical errors and some sort of writing style. I can not believe that this was a best-seller."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book sucks!","review":"I read a lot of books and I can't remember the last time I read a book more insulting to my intelligence (perhaps it was Bridges of Madison County)! The writing is dreadful; it reminded me of the Danielle Steel novel I read as a teeny bopper. It's filled with useless descriptions of what the characters were wearing and what they made for dinner and breakfast. The characters are made of poor-quality cardboard. It's unbelievably trite and sappy. I'm so glad I borrowed a copy and I can't wait to give it back...I'm embarrassed to have it on my shelf! IF YOU HAVE ANY SELF-RESPECT, DON'T BUY THIS BOOK! I don't think I live on the same planet as the people who rated this book a \\"10.\\" My book group will get strong warnings from me to stay away from this time waster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like every other Nicholas Sparks","review":"While this book may make you cry and is sweet, it definitely made me see how typical Nicholas Sparks is. He uses the same themes or ideas for most of his books and they are all very similar. Because the story seemed so familiar and unoriginal, I really didn't enjoy it. If you have read several of his books already, I don't recommend this book. If this is the first Nicholas Sparks book you have read, you probably will enjoy this book, although others like Dear John or The Last Song are better."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Notebook","review":"Im very happy I bought this book. The movie was great so I wanted to read the book since sometimes in the book there are more details. The shipping was on time and the packaging was good too."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Notebook","review":"I was dissapointed with this story. The movie - unusually - does so much more justice to BOTH characters.I almost wish I hadn't read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful love story","review":"Noah loves Allie. A wonderful love story about a love that almost had no chance. Fourteen years after falling in love over a summer, Allie is about to marry a lawyer she has met.

Years later, when Allie acquires Alzheimer's disease, their love proves just as strong as always."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"Very moving story on how to deal with what life deals to you. Although we all have different ways to handle tradegy, the author's story here is very moving. Highly recommend to all ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"COUGH, WHEEZE, GAG","review":"I was given this book (\\"a light read\\") during my recovery from pneumonia and I must say that under Mr. Sparks therapy, I only felt worse. BORING, TRITE, UNIMAGINATIVE cliché... Must admit that I never got beyond the third chapter. Went back to Dr. Rushdie, who had me feeling top notch in no time at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"The absolute, hands-down, best book I've ever read!","review":"With all the comments already on this site, I'll leave it at my summary above. The people who criticized this book are obviously fresh out of English class where they are used to reading cookie cutter books that have every possible element (i.e. humor, major plot development, etc.). The charm of this book is it's simplicity!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm hooked!","review":"I would say it's never to late to enjoy a good book! I love a book that just flows, and is not so overwelming with characters that I can't keep up. This is simple, touching, and full of powerful emotions. I'm happy I'm reading it before watching the movie, although I'm sure I will enjoy the movie too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"Very good.. everyone should have or at least want a love story like this!!!! Inspiring I'm 14 and Nicholas sparks has got me hooked!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well I liked it","review":"Boy, this has been the most online reviews I've seen for one book here at Amazon.com. And it's a love/hate book. You either love it or you hate it. It takes a lot for a book to make me teary eyed. The last one to do that to me was The Bridges Of Madison County, and now The Notebook, so closely compared to Bridges, has done the same thing to me. I was touched by the romance of the lead characters, not so much with their rediscovering of lost love, but of his devotion to his wife in their \\"golden years\\". That was the best part of the love story. Usually books about romance have the man and woman get together and live happily ever after. The Notebook tells you how that ever after may end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally flat","review":"I'm excited to read this book because of the good buzz it has been getting. Boy am I to be disappointed! There is no humour, and the dialogues make me cringe. The characters are as flat and one-dimensional as pancakes. I won't be reading his ssecond book.Mr Sparks, don't quit your day job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Escape","review":"Aren't we all searching for this kind of love and total devotion? Nicholas Sparks has written so eloquently, so aware of the heart and the soul, so aware of what is the most important element in life---love. This book is a must read for anyone...anyone that does believe that this kind of love is really out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Despite the flaws, the love shines through.","review":"While this book certainly had its flaws, to include the unrealistic but uplifting ending, the love Noah felt for Allie really shined through. Sparks did a wonder ful job of conveying this love to the reader and made you really feel Noah's struggle in maintaining his sanity as his world fell apart. His abiding love for Allie made his remaining days ons earth worthwhile and full of purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!","review":"I absolutely love this book. This is an amazing book that explains about true love and total compassion. There is also sadness, but when complimented with the passion, it is wonderfully beautiful. The book is different than the movie, of course, but it is in a very, very great way. I would recommend this book to anybody looking for some real love. Nicholas Sparks is just pure genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful story","review":"Like a lot of other people, I read the book after watching the movie. A beautiful story worth reading, Nicholas Sparks always deliver."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW! How can a man write exactly what a woman wants to hear?","review":"The Notebook is the most sensitive pageturner I have ever read. It captures everything a women ever needs in a relationship. I can only imagine what it would be like to be loved like that. You must read it, if not for the enjoyment then for the experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"We should all be this lucky","review":"Sparks' is a tad melodramatic in his prose but this tender story of growing old with your true love is endearing. All I can say is ... we should all be this lucky. The Notebook has all the standard love themes of \\"love lost and found\\", \\"torn between two lovers\\", \\"love that cannot be due to socioeconomic constraints\\", \\"first loves reunited\\", and on and on and on.Noah and Alli fall in love at 17, again at 31, and Alli and Noah find themselves in an old age home in their 80's. Once more, if you're meant to be together, nothing and no one will stop it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read","review":"This is an incredible book with an engaging romantic story line. The book will surely keep the reader interested with it's rich details and plot. I reccomend this book to anyone who likes romance novels because this book is great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"movie better than book?","review":"This summer I decided to try Nicholas Sparks's books. I loved the movie, \\"The Notebook\\" and wanted to see if the book was as good/better (usually books are better). I don't know if it was because I remembered the movie so well but I found the book not as exciting/touching as the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Notebook by Nicholas Sparks","review":"I absolutely loved this book! Unlike some of the other reviewers who were expecting to be intellectually stimulated by reading it,I found it to be a heartwarming love story; one we could only hope to find. In light of the recent death of former President Ronald Reagan, one can only imagine what Nancy Reagan experienced with Alzheimer's disease. She once refered publically to this disease as \\"the long good-bye\\",because it slowly takes the mind of a loved one. Nicholas Sparks does an excellent job of describing Noah's pain in dealing with this disease. The end of this book clearly states that it was based on the love story between his wife's grandparents. I am looking forward to seeing the movie, and I only hope that it is as good as the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Modern Day Fairy Tale","review":"The Notebook is a beautiful story about to people who truly love each other. Its amazing, especially towards the end of the novel when Allie is suffering from Alzheimers. Noah is able to get her to remember who he is. At the end of the novel Noah's \\"commentary\\" drags on a little, but still this is an amazing novel. Anyone looking for a good cry, and to have their heart feel warmed, read The Notebook!"},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing book!!!!!!!!","review":"definitely my favorite nicholas sparks book (i have also read a walk to remember and the rescue). it is such an amazingly sweet love story. some do not care for spark's style but i think he is an excellent writer that really touches the hearts of readers. this book is incredible!!!!!! READ IT =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a good book","review":"I thought this book was a pretty good book because I finished this book in about 2-3 1/2 days! I could not put this down. And when I couldn't find it when I wanted to read it, I was very [mad]. But don't take my word for it, read it yourself and see how much you enjoyed it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sparks: an Erich Segal for the 1990s","review":"The Notebook is one of the worst books I've read in this decade. This is not literature--this is women's magazine fiction from the 1950s (except they would have toned down the sex scenes). If I was a Southerner, I would be embarrassed by this one. Was Sparks subsidized by the Alzheimers Research Fund or some group? They should have spent their $$$$$ on a cure instead. If you want to read a great love story, buy Ethan Frome by the wonderful Edith Wharton."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I've ever read","review":"I can't quite figure out what all the fuss is over this book. And I loved Bridges of Madison County! Nicholas Sparks gives hope to aspiring writers everywhere - if he can get published, anyone can. I've read some awful stuff, but The Notebook just about takes the cake. It is a cliche from beginning to end. The characters are one-dimensional, the plot is completely unbelievable, and the writing is lackluster. Save your money and don't buy this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please explain this undeserved phenomenon to me.","review":"I'm still agog after the reading experience of The Notebook. I believe it's still on the bestseller list and it made the number one spot on some magazine's (ok, so it was Glamour) reader-submitted list of the top-ten love stories of all time. Topping Jane Eyre and Pride and Prejudice no less. Even the number two spot-- Bridges over Madison County--was a mildly diverting read.This debut effort is the most simplistic, hackneyed, uninvolving novel I've ever read. Cognizant of all the hooplaa, I kept waiting for the story to get better. It never did and I was glad when I turned the last page.I see from the reviews that four stars is the average score. Here's a one-star to balance out such undeserved approbation. Of course, Sparks is laughing all the way to the bank over his literary coup."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booooring!","review":"I believe there is a truly wonderful love story here. Too bad it is buried in this terribly mediocre writing. I think this story could be half as long and twice as enticing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dare I say it?","review":"The Notebook is one of my all time favorite movies. The story was amazing and so I wanted to know more about the characters. Books always offer more... don't they? Ha! Hardly. Nick Sparks has the writing talent of a 4th grader. This book was awful. I didn't like the characters and the ending was nowhere as profound as that of the film. The idea was great, the execution was a train wreck. Thank God for great screenwriters who took the idea and turned it into something great. As I asked about Nora Roberts, how on earth did this man get published?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, Unoriginal, Sappy","review":"One of those rare books that is worse than the film. What drew me to the standard and over-done rich girl-poor guy, love triangle in the film was that there was a lot of unique chemistry between Noah and Allie, a deep passion. The best part was that they fought like a real couple, matched up perfectly because they fought. Noah was a unique character, sort of bitter and broken by war and heart break. The book, on the other hand, was all sap and the flat characters, their romance sickeningly sweet. The prose was whiny and boring. It was simple and unoriginal. Grade: D"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugghhh!","review":"This book was plain terrible. Nicholas Sparks' writing seems very amateur and there was nothing that made me want to keep on reading. This book was filled with cliches and forced moments to make it even more sickening and syrupy. I think I quit reading after 75 pages because Sparks, in my mind, did not create very likable characters. I did not care what would happen to Noah and Allie. The movie, however, is decent, but probably because I didn't have to sit through Sparks' mediocre writing. I think his target market of lonely housewives will soak it up, though. The only tissue I needed for this was the crying I did for wasting my time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"This book is a sappy piece of garbage that people couldn't pay me to read again let alone watch a movie about."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would rather stab myself in the foot than to have to read this again","review":"I would like those 3 hours back Mr. Sparks.This book lacked substance, was choppy, predictable, and uncreative. Writing was that of a middle school student. Extremely disappointing. I am super curious how the movie is. I didn't even read the insert at the end of the book for Nicolas Spark's next book, as I just wanted The Notebook to endddddd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Wast Of Money","review":"I don't like this book. The movie had far more detail. I can't believe I bought this piece of garbage! It didn't even include the scean were they met at the carnival! TERRIBLE!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How can a book be this boring?","review":"I hate to give bad reviews, I really do, and when I do I try my best to justify it or still find some good in the book. But after suffering thru \\"The Notebook\\" I felt compelled to jump to my computer and spill my guts! This is a plain bad book. I picked it up because all the hype and the countless weeks it spent at the top of the bestsellers lists. It looks like a short read so if it is not good at least it will be brief, I thought My mistake! It feels like reading the Bible cover to cover in a foreign language you don't understand!Stay away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mindless quick reader","review":"This is a great book to read while floating on an inner tube at the river. It doesn't take anything to keep on track. You can go splash around, pick up where you left off, doze off, read some more. Yes it is sentimental and I would recommend it to other readers that love to read and cry at the same time.I wonder if Mr. Sparks has had any contact with Alzheimer's patients? I have. It is not pretty. The french kissing was so inappropriate and unreal! I think there could have been some other way of describing to readers their deep affection and love.Thank goodness I got my copy from the library!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unoriginal, predictable.","review":"I read this book expecting a deeper story. The story is touching on some accounts, but the direction the story takes is incredibly obvious. There is no element of surprise, or anything that makes the book worth reading to the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Too Syrupy","review":"What a bunch of sticky, gooey, syrupy drivel. Nicholas Sparks is a talented writer, but I'd like to see him employ his skills on a meatier story. This book is hugely successful, and I think that speaks for his WRITING as opposed to his choice of story. For truly gripping reading, turn to Uris, Vidal, earlier Follett, Kingsolver, etc. Sorry, Nick!"},{"rating":"1","title":"MAKE THAT MINUS ONE.","review":"I paid money for this and what I got was a stupid re-hash of all the other romantic novels I have read in my teen years. Gooey, sappy, this thing was a virtual maple tree of goop. C'mon. Stop buying trash like this. WHERE CAN I SEND IT BACK FOR A REFUND. Excuse me, I think I'll vomit first. Oy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a joke?!?!","review":"Beyond awful. I can't believe how many people liked this book. The writing was unbearably bad - downright embarrassing in fact. I was relieved to see that there are some people here who agree with me. I really wanted to like the book and the characters, but because it was so boring, transparent and predictable I was unable to even finish. I had to skim over the last 90 pages. I wouldn't have even done that except that a co-worker lent me the book (thank god I didn't spend my own money on it!). It's not that the idea & premise are so bad; it's the insincerity with which it is written that betrays any real depth of emotion. I think it is a sad state of affairs that this a bestseller.And if I wanted to know how to cook a crab dinner, I would have read a cookbook. Boring, boring, boring, boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Toothache sweet","review":"The story is so sentimental that readers should make a dental appointment on page one. The cookie-cutter characters march through calendar scenery with predictable results."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get what the BIG DEAL is?!?!?!?","review":"I love romance stories....I love tales of triumph...I love stories of lost loves found.... I love happy endings.....But, I didn't love this book, I found this book to be most of the time very boring and predictable...."},{"rating":"1","title":"A literary letdown","review":"I decided to read this book because I saw the movie trailer and it looked like a lovely summer read. Do not be fooled! Go, see the movie and do not be lured into reading this book. The premise is cliché and everything that Allie and Noah say to each other has been said a million times over. The dialogue has no flow and no creativity. Sparks uses the phrase, \\"God (damn) he/she looked good\\" to describe how Allie and Noah felt when they see one another, so many times, that it becomes a laugh. He has no other way of describing what each character feels. After reading this, I needed to read \\"Gone with the Wind\\",-immediately-a real love story, that doesn't insult your intelligence. There is a reason why some books and some authors transcend the ages, we can read those books and be transported to a different world each time. This book has none of those qualities. Sparks and this piece of \\"literature\\" will be forgotten, and it will not matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Notebook","review":"This story was so beautifully written and full of laughter and tears. It defines the true meaning of love and expresses it with such power and emotion. This book is for all the people in the world who believe in true love and fate. It will capture your heart and leave you in tears. It was such a delight for me to read. It's a story about two teenagers who once fell in love. They were separated at the end of the summer that they met and each began to lead a new life. Years later they met up again, and found the love that they once had. Nicholas Sparks writes with such charisma and enables you to believe that true love will always win in the end. I recommend this book to all dreamers and believers. This was a book that I know I will read again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please return my $4.95 and four precious hours of my life","review":"Hideous drivel--trees died for this? I am shocked that so many people liked this book. I bought it in desperation at an airport and couldn't give it away afterwards. A child of ten could write a more compelling story. The dialogue is cliched and awful, the plot is a joke. Fans of this book, branch out! There are plenty of well-written love stories out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get a cavity from the endless amounts of ridiculous sugar","review":"How did anyone actually like this? It is badly written, has all the cliches of a second rate romance novel, no plot, no characterization worth even mentioning and I got a cavity from the endless amounts of syrupy sugar. It actually worries me that so many people liked it. I have to wonder why and what is missing in life that makes someone say \\"this is wonderful!\\" about a turd."},{"rating":"1","title":"A potentially meaningful story made simple, sappy, pitiful","review":"A book written to appeal to an audience of shmucks who have no knowledge of great literature. Perhaps a great reading primer for kindergarteners, minus the sex scene. It made me think, I bet this is the kind of stuff that makes up those grocery store novels with Fabio gracing the covers. Characters so one-dimensional, the movie rights will probably be for a cartoon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorely Disappointing","review":"I bought this book with high expectations - every review I'd read said how wonderful it is. Now, I'm embarassed to admit that I bought it! It's poorly written - elementary, really - and is a cookie-cutter love story. I felt no bond with the characters, and although I did cry while reading the last chapter it was because I related Allie's illness with that of my late grandfather, rather than because I really cared about them. My advice to those considering buying this book: save the cash and buy something really worthwhile, like Diving Secrets of the Ya-Ya Sisterhood."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I read this book as a part of a book club. A big part of the group was still teary-eyed over it, but to me it was a big disappointment! I'd define this book as \\"fluff\\".Although the significance and the suffering that Alzheimer's brings cannot be debated, the development of the characters was weak. I typically do not find a book that is this quick & fast reading to have any significance to me. Just because it causes you cry or stir your emotions does it make for a work of genius."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUT THIS BOOK!","review":"I returned this book after reading ten pages. It should be listed under \\"true crime\\", b/c it's just that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much of a story.","review":"This isn't the worst book I've read, but I can't understand why it's been a bestseller so long. There's hardly any story here.I'm not unromantic, and the love between the main characters is sweet and enduring, but that's not enough to make this a good book.I was 14 pages from the end and had no trouble waiting a day to finish it. Actually, the only thing that got me through the whole book was to see what the big deal was. And I still don't know. Sorry, Nicholas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived to bring tears in a most unoriginal manner.","review":"I love a good, romantic story as much as anyone, but this story is a huge waste of time. Its only salvation is that it's short. After the first few pages, the rest of the book is entirely predictable and unoriginal. What would you call the written equivalent to a paint by number picture?"},{"rating":"1","title":"truly mediocre","review":"Yikes! How can so many seemingly bright readers fall for this maudlin and implausible tale of sex on the deathbed? Friends with whom I have agreed on many other books told me would love it, warned me to keep tissues nearby.... tissues unnecessary except to stifle my alternating giggling and gagging. Probably the best thing I can say about this book is that it's marginally better than Bridges of Madison County: the worst thing? That it's sophomoric and maybe little bit gross. That final image actually made me say, \\"Eeuww!\\" Yucky.No, wait -- here's the worst thing I could say: It was obviously written with a movie in mind. Maybe the movie will actually be better in the same way Bridges made for a better film than novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of paper","review":"This book was awful. Trite, maudlin, lacking in plot and containing shallow characters and an undignified and improbable ending. I had to force myself to finish it. A cure for insomnia."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Stupid LIttle Sob Story","review":"I read this silly little volume as I was being driven from New Hampshire to Montreal. I should have thrown it off the Champlain Bridge, but I didn't want to get arrested for polluting the St. Lawrence River. This book is unrealistic and sappy, and, although I am a romantic, this story just didn't ring true. What happened to the great literature of our time? And this pathetic book is on the bestseller lists?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Hard-Hearted Review","review":"I'm always looking for escapism in a good romance. After this book, I'm still looking. There is Alzheimer's in my husband's family, and this book is an insult. It implies that true love conquers all, and if you love someone enough, they just might remember you! Of course! Why didn't WE think of that? Save yourself some time and money and skip this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmm...","review":"Yeah, I didn't get the hype about this book. It was lent to me with the command of \\"read it with a box of tissues.\\" The only way I would cry would be because of boredom and sincere disappointment. For a book that is considered so \\"moving\\" I found that it lacked anything to actually move. It's one thing to write a short story and be done with it, but another thing to try to rush through and make a story short. To me the story was a good one, but the way it was written made this book an empty vase. See the movie; it's a better way to get the story and not waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a definite zero-star book","review":"Amazon needs a zero-star rating...or maybe even negative stars. This is one of the worst examples of writing I've ever endured. Pedestrian, simplistic, stilted, slow, meandering, boring. Reads like a junior high school student wrote it. The story is silly as well.And Mr. Sparks is laughing all the way to the bank. Fortunately a friend loaned me the book (she LOVED it)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Barely Got to Page 50","review":"I started to read The Notebook book only because my neighbor forced it upon me, and I had to stop at page 50. I know that since I am not a romantic person, it was not a good idea to read it, but i wanted to please my neighbor, so i tried and, believe me I TRIED to finish it (or AT LEAST get to page 100)! Nicholas Sparks' writing style horrified me! I felt I was reading a C-students narrative in Junior High!I can now fully understand why a lot of his books are made into movies; many directors and writers are looking for a book that they won't have to rewrite to make a movie. I felt like I was reading a script, it was all dialogue and actions, and, oh yeah, more ACTIONS! He was barely able to describe anything at all! I will never again read a book by Nicholas Sparks, or even let alone THINK about doing it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hairy Plodder & the Chamber of Boredom","review":"My dissatisfaction with this book may stem from the fact that I'm listening to it on tape, and thus can't skim through the dull bits and eruptions of poor writing.In the first two tapes, the phrase, \\"S/he ran his/her hand through his/her hair\\" is repeated at least 5 times. Many other uninteresting, repetitive details choke the recitation of this wooden tale.There may be a good story hiding in here, but it is decked over with stereotypes (\\"emerald-eyed\\" Allie, \\"muscular\\" Noah), poor writing (all that messed-up hair!), and miscellaneous goop. The only remotely interesting character is Clem the 3-legged dog, but even she can't give this dull book some \\"legs.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Dick and Jane Fall In Love","review":"I am very depressed that this book is on the bestsellers list...(who can one believe?)

I thought that I would be bored but I wasn't. I was drawn into Allie's dilemma that I couldn't put it down till I knew her answer. GREAT BOOK!

But somehow, at the end of the summer, the two are separated and lose contact. After 14 years they meet again. Will their love overcome the barriers between the two. You betcha. And it's all rather touching, even overwrought at times. So far nothing new, and, indeed, from my perspective nothing worthwhile.The last portion of the book, however, fast-forwards to the modern day. Our protaganists have now aged and one is in the grips of Alzheimer's. The love story continues. This portion of the book too is sacharine. It is not nearly so hackneyed, though.Even though, in my opinion, this book is not worth reading, it is by far Sparks' best and the only of his novels that displays any inventiveness."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Notebook","review":"This was one of the most contrived plots I've ever read.

THE NOTEBOOK, unfortunately, was not blessed with a particularly good writer. The plot is very thin, the \\"suspense\\" is not suspenceful, and the writing itself...ouch. Sparks has quite a following, but his work isn't even good enough to be considered escape reading; it's too full of distracting bad grammar, etc, etc. If you must read it, get this one from the library."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for all romantics","review":"First time novelist Nicholas Sparks has created a stunninglook at life, romance, and the true meeting of unconditionallove. Almost two novels in one, the book traces the taleof two people from their initial \\"first love\\" experiencesto the culmination of the lifetime they share.Beginning as most young romances do, Allie and Noah'scourtship develops into a binding soul-mate relationship ofthe calibre we all hope to achieve in our lives.

It was said to be 'even better than Bridges of Madison County'. I didn't become immediatedly entranced with the book, but the more I read the more I felt connected with the characters.

A wonderfulstory."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best love story ever written!","review":"The Notebook made me cry more than The Prince of Tides...and I thought that was hard!! I can compare the love story to the one told in the current Titanic. Same effect, cried for hours afterwards, and I still can't talk about the book or even think about it without my eyes getting misty. The story of Noah and Allie is timeless, and if I had one wish for humanity, it would be that every person experience the love that these two people felt for each other. I know that I will read this book over and over again, and will probably wind up giving it to my grandchildren!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"True love itself","review":"I cried my heart out because it reminded me so much of my boyfriend and me. No matter how old you are, when your true love comes, you have to go for it... Allie realized that just in time, her one true love was Noah, who was also her first love... The last part was totally powerful, and sad, it leaves you thinking about it... First thing I did after reading it, was buy it (it was borrowed): I fell in love with this book, for me it's the kind of book which when you need it, you just open it, read a bit and feel better. This IS true love, it's a beautiful book, simply written, but that's what makes it so unforgettable, because it feels real, but most of all because it feels GOOD."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Notebook - A Classic Love Story","review":"The Notebook is a classic tale of old love being rekindled. I loved the story and the beautiful romance that goes with it. However, I have read several Nicholas Sparks stories and I didn't like the writing in this book as much as his other books. At some points it could be a heavy read weighted down with too many details and some points could be confusing.Although the writing wasn't as good, I love Nicholas Sparks and his marvelous books.*parental review*bad language - 2 - only a few d words and s wordssexual content - 6 - much kissing and infidelity. also a detailed sex scene, romanctic & not too graphic but detailed enough.violence - 0 - noneadult content - 5 - sex, cheating, and very strong emotions.however, I would let a teenager read this if they've seen the movie or have read other books by Nicholas Sparks like Message In a Bottle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This is the first time in my life where I have liked the movie over the original book. Sparks does a nice job of describing the scenery. But this book lacks depth and never really explains the time of when the characters actually fall in love. I couldn't even finish the novel because I was so disgusted by it. The book went into way too much detail of certain parts that left me grossed out, it seemed more like the writer's own fantasy than an actual story. The novel is filled with unbearable cliques and awkward conversations. I remember thinking to myself this is stupid, why am I reading this? To anyone considering reading this book, don't! Watch the movie because it is actually really good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heart is Crossed- Love is Tough","review":"Oh, the passion involved! It is so difficult to let go of a past with someone that you love. It is also very tramatic to be in love with two people. Your heart is torn in two. There is such a fear of regret!Without crossing the line into \\"cheating\\", how can you possibly decide who is going to make you happier when both suitors are as handsome, as kind, as sweet, and as in love with you? How to choose?Sparks' writing style is very easy to read and find yourself absorbed in. He writes to underscore the heart in matters that are almost too hard to talk about- let alone write about for all the world to see and criticize.The movie was just as brilliant.If you loved this story, read \\"Wretched (this is my sorry)\\" by Katherine Marple. It has a similar idea of: Do you go with the passionate relationship that makes you feel insecure at times, or with the comforting one- your best friend?"},{"rating":"1","title":"What is the big deal about this book?","review":"This is the first and only book that I would say just watch the movie. I don't like the book, in reality, I really didn't love the movie. Too sad, too depressing and sappy. I really struggled to keep reading the book. I think it jumps around too much and is really s.l.o.w. I just don't get why it was on the best seller list for so long. This is the third book written by Nicholas Sparks that I have read, and I think it will be the last."},{"rating":"1","title":"My teeth ache","review":"I finally got ahold of this book that I have been hearing so much about.

But The Notebook shatters the myth of true love to make it a reality that even the most cynical of hearts can believe.And who says romance dies? For as the love between two people grows, so romance keeps the passion alive spuring the couple never to forget or leave behind the precious bursts of young love. The Notebook chronicles the life of love and gives this cynical heart a small hope that true love just might be a real possibility"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Story","review":"This is a beautiful story about time and human strengths and frailties.

OLSOS DMC","review":"I never really enjoyed romantic books, but this book stole my heart. Normally I hate to see a movie before I read the book. This time I gave in and went to see the movie with my best friend. The movie was incredible. I figured that if I enjoyed the movie so much I must love the book. I read the book, and it was awesome too. Unlike the book, the movie focused mainly on their summer affair. The book, on other hand, showed me the love they shared, the life they lived apart, and the life they lived together. Both book and movie created tears. I cried for a half hour after I saw the movie. It's just a beautiful book. But it's a matter of taste, if you want to see their summer together - go get the movie. If you want to see the love they shared - go get the book. This book showed me what I truly want in love.

I would highly recommend this book for everyone - it is a true story of love and committment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Cliche, Terrible Ending","review":"The worst ending of any book I've ever read. I think the only reason I finished this was because I'd seen the movie and I thought it HAD to get better at some point. For someone who has had a love like that portrayed in the book, I was excited to have this grand finale of their final union...the movie captured this MUCH better than this poorly written book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as good as the movie","review":"I saw the movie version of The Notebook, which I loved, before I read the book, and I expected the book to be even better than the movie, since that's the way things usually are. But this is one of the few exceptions -- the trite, cliche-ridden book just doesn't even compare to the movie, which was very moving and romantic. I really congratulate whoever read the book and made that great movie out of it.If you haven't read the book yet, I would suggest just seeing the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrendous","review":"This book went straight into the trash as soon as I was finished with it--it needed to be recycled into a milk container. So you ask if I hated it so much why did I finish it? Because there was about an eighth of an inch left of pages and I figured oh surely there is more to this story--maybe a surprise ending, a little character development, a plot...but nooooooo. The pages were a combination interview and a preview of his NEXT BOOK!!!! AS IF!!!!This is a harlequin novel with contrived characters so in love with eachother that Sparks didn't need to bother to give them personalities. Don't bother to give this book the time of day. Now I understand what \\"save a tree\\" means."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one stays with you.","review":"When I first starting reading this novel, I thought it would be just another love story, but it wasn't; it was a powerful piece that juxtaposes youth and old age in a unique and magical way.

Similar premise, similar writing, yet, Nicholas Sparks is famous while an army of romance novelists JUST LIKE HIM perish in obscurity? The Notebook is awful. I couldn't get past first 15 pages or so and I tried several times, because I wanted to understand the MAGIC that has captivated hearts of so many readers, but it was just so poor on every level! Yeah, no words. Just a very poor book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The romance of a lifetime","review":"I truly believe you people that give this book less than 4 stars have no romance left in you. The great ratings people are giving this book are from the theme Sparks is using in this novel.. true romance.

I strongly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read all his books...there awesome.","review":"I loved this book. I am now addicted to all of his books. I read them in less than a day because they capture me so much. So heart warming. I have cried at the end of all his books. The best. I can't wait until he writes more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!!","review":"My sister suggested that I read this book a while back. I said that I would read it but it took me long time to get around to picking one up at the bookstore. Now I want to kick myself for not picking it up earlier! It was soooo good! I can relate to having that one person in life who was your soulmate who \\"got away\\" only to be reunited again later in life. To have someone love you throughout your entire life, despite time and distance, is something that hardly ever happens in real life. This book lets you hold on to the hope that maybe there really is everlasting love!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok Get Kleenex, or cry reading this.......","review":"I really liked this book for many reasons. Good story, plot, great details. I must say it is sad when your about done. This will make you cry. I'm 17 and I don't cry on tearjerkers but I will admit I was close to crying. I heard on his site this was going to be made into a movie. It would make a good movie. Well read this great romantic love story.

Read a preview to The Wedding. But read The Notebook first!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wasted reading time...a big disappointment","review":"I'm no literary critic, so bad writing has to be plain obvious to get my attention. The characters were flat, the narrative sketchy and trite. The story was sickeningly sweet, yet, I kept reading.(After all it was \\"a New York Times Bestseller.\\")Finally I threw it down after 150 pages. I can't believe that it was published. I'm sorry I wasted my time on this book, and hope that my comments will save someone else their valuable reading time."},{"rating":"1","title":"movie was better","review":"not impressed with the book. I thought the movie version did a better job with the story and the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"I was looking for something to read. I pick this book up and started reading it at 3:00 pm one day and by the next day I finished it. The best book I've read this summer. Wish I could find more like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"I found this book lacking...","review":"When I first started reading The Notebook, I fell in love with the writing style. Although at first the story line held my attention, later I found that I couldn't wait for it to be over. I understood Noah's character, and felt his love for Allie. But Allie's character wasn't developed well, and her love for Noah seemed only slight. Just when you think you finally get to find out what happened, the story just stops and leaves you hanging. I can appreciate the mystery, but there was no climax in this book at all. I was not excited to read it, and I was not sorry that it ended. It was not a page-turner."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different type of love","review":"For me this is the best book Nocholas Sparks has written. It is a different type of love. I am a married young man and I would like to live that kind of love with my wife when we get older. Everyone with a heart should read this book. The way the author explain each detail is great. I also read \\"Message in the Bottle\\" from the same author but \\"The Notebook\\" has something special. I invite you to a great experience reading \\"Notebook\\". A soon as you read it you will understand what I am trying to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nerver Ending Love","review":"This was one of Nicholas Sparks' best books even though i've only read two, both of which were tear jerkers. This one was a REAL tear jerker though. The way he expressed the love between the two people and how they never forgot about each other. Nicholas Sparks is one of the few authors that can create such a story that can make you feel like you know the characters. This story tells a story about a a well off family that doesn't want their daughter to fall in love with a man that, to them isn't good for her, but she already was in love with him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly Entertaining But Ultimately Boring \\"Chick Lit\\"","review":"I found the first half of \\"The Notebook\\" mildly entertaining but was bored and kind of grossed-out by the second half. I can't say too much without giving away key plot points, but suffice it to say that I think most men will be pretty bored by the book. For a much better book by Nichaolas Sparks check out \\"A Walk to Remember\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Empty and meaningless....","review":"It is obvious while reading THE NOTEBOOK that Nick Sparks agonized painfully over ever word he typed, that every sentence was a struggle in his simplistic mind. I've stepped in rainpuddles that weren't as shallow as his characters. Each character lives more in the past than in the present, and I personally found it hard to swallow that two people that met at age 15 for a month or two during the summer could wait almost 15 more years hoplessly in love with each other. And when they DO get together, they spend all their time \\"remembering\\" those summer months. I love a good romance, but this was just sickening. I reccomend reading it only because it is so bad, it's hard to believe. His second book was even worse..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Notebook","review":"I read Nicholas Spark's Message in a Bottle and decided I wanted to read more of his books. I loved Message in a Bottle but I enjoyed The Notebook even more. This is a heartwarming story about how love works in mysterious ways. Noah and Allie fall in love as kids and many years later they find there way back to one another. Allie found Noah in the paper and wanted to visit him one more time before she got married. When she saw him though, she feel in love all over again and it didn't even feel like many years had gone by. The end of the book has a dramatic twist and made me cry. This book seriously moved me and made me believe in having a soul mate. The moral of the story is no matter what obstical life puts in your way, true love will always find its way in. I loved how this book made me feel and if you like love stories, this is the ultimate one. Read The Notebook for a powerful love story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Much Sugar, Not Enough Substance","review":"At the heart of this novel is a lovely and romantic story. However, a book needs more than a nice plot to make it a good read.Sparks seems unable to let his characters develop naturally. Instead, characters are introduced for the sole purpose of assuring the reader that the protagonist is a good and generous fellow, then quickly dropped.Add to this Sparks' bland narrative style and you're left with a story that feels hollow. This novel could have been so much more, but I finished the book feeling like I had been the victim of a cheap attempt to tug my heartstrings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just awful: one star is too generous!","review":"Yeucch!! I forced myself to plow through this sugary mess because a friend loaned it to me. Lousy, stilted writing; characters thin and slick as magazine ads; not much in the way of a plot. Brevity was this book's sole virtue. Publishers, please: put a Harlequin sticker on this sort of thing so it isn't mistaken for literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are You Serious?","review":"I read The Notebook in 8th grade for a book report. Soon after I found out what a mistake that would be. The charachters are entirely run of the mill and the plot is totally unbeliveable and predictable. The only time something slightly changed in the whole story was when you read about the two charachters reuniting. Although I was happy to finally get to a bit of a change form the book, I'm not sure thats the kinda of change I was looking for, whcih was a full on description of the two having intercourse. Pretty much, this book consists of: balh, blah,,blah, sex, balh balh blah, sex. I cant understand why this book was so highly praised, but I would strongly reccomend not reading it. Its a whole lot of nothing rolled up into 200 pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Book","review":"I really liked this book because it was so very romantic. Yes, it was flowery and a little cliched but oh for a perfect love like they shared... Helped me reaffirm my belief that love can endure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put down.","review":"I couldn't put this book down. I LOVED IT!! Whenever I had a chance to read it I would. I loved the story and the movie. I loved the letters they wrote to each other. I cried when I read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for speed reading!","review":"This book is good practice for speed-reading courses. Even if you miss a lot, you miss very little. Typical Hollywood expression of love--through sex. Raving sex. Repeated sex. Entering and re-entering. The author also uses trickery when, for many pages, he doesn't mention the name of \\"she\\" in the second part of the book. Perhaps this is one case where the movie will be better than the book. How could it be worse?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly Satisfied","review":"If your a hopeless romantic or just love a touching love story, this book is for you. I was so enthralled with this book that I read it in two evenings. I recommend it to everyone I know and have passed the book throughout my cirlce of friends and family. All I can say is read this book!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say \\"contrived\\"?","review":"Yes, it's a tear-jerker and a reader isn't supposed to be too picky, but give me a break. The woman's fiance is your typical WASPy bore, and our hero is such a man's man. He builds, he cares, he cries!And the ending is ridiculous. A better title would be \\"When We Were Pimps.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back!","review":"I even said to the checker at the bookstore, \\"Do you promise this is not just another 'Bridges of Madison County?' Well, she lied. It's bad.

It's so detailed and vivid it makes you feel as though you're actually watching the story unfold."},{"rating":"1","title":"The story really didn't go anywhere.","review":"I was disappointed in this book since I had heard good things about it. If you like love stories than maybe you would like this book. I found the story to be very lame and it never really took off. I did finish the book but I found myself thinking blah blah blah just get to the end of the story so I can start another book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book makes you want to never give up!","review":"The novel by Nicholas Sparks is the best book I have ever written. It makes you realize that you should never give up. You should follow your heart which will lead the way to happiness."},{"rating":"1","title":"the stupidist book I've ever read","review":"I'm a junior in high school, and I checked this book out because people (including my english teacher) kept gushing about it. I truly wanted to like this book. After about thirty pages, I began to feel slightly nauseated, but read the whole thing, hoping it might redeem itself. No such luck. This book is such a waste of time that I actually feel annoyed with the people who gave it good reviews. It is full of cliches, and very poorly written. It is predictable, and sappy, and unbelievable. I would have to say it's one of the worst books I've ever read. Don't waste your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This novel is a bad soap opera in print","review":"This book is simply horrible. I hoped the story would match the warm feeling I got when I first picked up the hardcover edition and looked at the beautiful jacket. It never happened. Yes, the plot is mundane and predictable and the cliches are numerous and the dialog is shallow and unimaginative, but the overriding dissapointment for me was the consistent lack of depth in the characters. At the end of the story I still knew almost nothing about them. I found myself wondering if Mr Sparks will someday look back on this work and be embarrased, as I certainly was for him.I guess if you are one who is deeply moved by the plot, romance, dialog and characters of daytime television soap operas, this story may just satisfy you. If you don't fall into that category, I recommend you spare your time and money and save a tree by avoiding this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"[Poorly Written]","review":"I will admit that the beginning and end of this book may work pretty well in rousing some emotions, but everything inbetween is tripe. Most of it is so cliche that I actually rolled my eyes and groaned out loud. The descriptive passages throughout the middle section the book were very unimaginative and timeworn. They actually made my eyes hurt. After struggling to get to the end (which was pretty good) I couldn't supress the thought that two very different writers worked on this book. The idea behind the story was good, but too bad the author didn't hone his writing skills better before tackling it. I would never classify this as literature. It's just too poortly written."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't wait until it was over.","review":"This was a book I picked up to read on the airplane coming home from a vacation. I was laughing out loud and reading excerpts to my husband because I could not believe how poorly it is written. It will not be enjoyed by any educated cosmopolitan individual. The sweetness is so forced and the characters so bland it maked me truly believe that ANYONE can get their work published. I am shocked at the acclaim this book is getting. And I thought \\"Titanic\\" was bad. Please save your money and find a book that might give your brain a workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Man \\"Gods\\" in This Drivel","review":"I made it as far as page 49 and then I threw the book on the floor because of cliches like the following:\\"But God, those eyes.\\" --pg 40.I cringed but read on.

This is one of those rare cases in which the movie is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bawled my eyes out","review":"Simply stated, it moved me to tears.

Can you say endless love? I sure can and I would love the relationship that Noah and Ally had. I never saw the movie and I can't wait to see it. I must have been living under a rock.. How did this book pass me by??!! I plan on checking out other books by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful...Great...Bittersweet...","review":"This book was a wonderful love story. The boy getting the girl isn't as easy as it always was. Mr. Sparks has a true talent. Would recomend this to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spiritual Journey","review":"The Notebook was my first Nicholas Sparks experience. I immediately bought his other works. Spectacular reader involvement into the storyline occurs at the onset of The Notebook. He weaves a tale of true love. This is not a typical \\"romance novel.\\" Seduction is a fleeting moment; Sparks, however, spins a magic tapestry in the strength of true love and lasting devotion. I have purchased numerous copies of this novel for my friends' enjoyment. Each recipient has raved at Sparks' soulful writing and ability to hold one spellbound. As a voracious reader I can unequivocally state that this is my favorite book of all."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE REVIEW","review":"I don't really like the book. Their love is not as meaningful to me as the book has described. The plot is good, but the author should've made it more of a tragedy instead of a happy ending. I don't like when Laura came back to him and then they stayed together. The author should just leave the story when Laura left to get marry with Leon. To me their love doesn't seem stable. I would like it more if he change the end and maybe have one of the main characters die. It may be lame, but it's unexpected. It would be more emotional and remembering."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Tearjerker that Will Melt Even the Stoniest Heart!","review":"I have to confess that when I read this book, I was in the car on a roadtrip with my parents. I had a horrible head cold, and they were riding up front while I huddled in the backseat with this book. Now, I NEVER cry at movies or books -- for heaven's sake, right? -- but by the time I was done with this beautiful love story, I was weeping furtively, concealing my tears under the sniffly guise of my cold. This story is absolutely gorgeous. I mean, this book violates absolutely every rule against melodrama, manipulation, or maudlin emotion, but it WORKS. What can I say? You grow to love these characters, and their story unfolds so tantalizingly and so carefully, your whole heart will become invested in their experiences and decisions. The only thing now is that I dare not read the book again... I'm afraid my husband will come home and find me in a most satisfying heap on the floor, weeping inelegantly! But see for yourself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Notebook","review":"A beautiful book. Nicholas Sparks has a way with words. He can develop a romance and put just enough drama into it to make it exciting. The Notebook has a wonderful plot. Read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Notebook","review":"One of the best books I have ever read. I would recommend this book to anyone. I did not want to put this book down and I liked the fact that it was a quick read. I am determined to read all of the Nicholas Sparks books before school starts again. Chances are I will be posting many reviews~"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save me from books like this","review":"What terrible, terrible writing. Vapid, hollow, trite--I could go on, but mere adjectives fail to capture the bounds of my distaste. i'd rather read a magazine. Or a blog. Or a roll of toilet paper. With so many great books out there in the literary canon, please take my advice and avoid this formulaic trash. If you're just that curious, watch the movie--running time two hours instead of 8 in front of a forgettable book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total deception.... the movie is better.","review":"I bought the book thinking that the book was going to be as good as the movie, but it's not.It was so bad that I want my money back!!! The book starts when Allie wants to meet Noah. That's about when the movie is almost over. The book doesn't really tell the story of Noah and Allie together. They remember of bits and things and that's about it. The book also is kind of boring. I had a hard time reading it, because Noah says something and then they walk for a long time and then she answers or they gaze at the sun or the trees for a long time and then they talk or they are comfortable with silence... It's a boring novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most excellent piece of literature!","review":"I loved this novel! It was heart-warming from beginning to end. It is so easy for anyone to get caught up and emotionally attatched with the story and the characters because most people have either experienced such a true, beautiful love such as the one in the story, or they are looking for a love like this! I reccommend this novel to anone who believes in the power of love and who loves to cry, because that is just what I did for 10 minutes after I finished this novel...which I read in 1 day!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It took my heart and captured my soul.","review":"As I read this book I found myself lost in another time. I found myself looking at my husband with Allie's eyes. I have known since the day that we met when we were fifteen that I would love him forever. And oh how I wanted them to be together. I can only hope that when we grow old we will do it with such grace and love as they did. Anyone who has ever loved needs this book! It took my breath away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the Best ( says it all )","review":"The only thing that might top it is \\"Message in a Bottle\\" just finished it and LOVED it too! Wish more writers could write like this but I haven't found one yet!!! Sparks catches you from the very beginning and just pulls you in from there on out until the end, which leaves you feeling AWESOME can't find the words to describe the feeling! You'll just have to read both and find out for yourself!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as great as I expected","review":"I'm a person who usually loves a book more than the movie version, but in this case the movie was SO much better than the book. Unfortunately I watched the movie before the book so I was incredibly disappointed when I read this, it just didn't get into there past and how they fell in love enough for my liking. It's still a touching story, I just didn't enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"An utter waste of intellectual time","review":"Sparks' book is trite, predictable and completely one dementional. Granted, I love the idea of true love and its ability to survive in modern times, but I also read for enriching dialogue, convincing charaters, and original thoughts into matters that so many authors have already contemplated. This book just doesn't cut it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The notebook","review":"Couldn't put it down. At the end, I wanted more but Nicholas Sparks does it again.Where does that kind of love exist. You will cry your heart out."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Notebook-nothing to write home about","review":"Friends had suggested I read The Notebook and told me how good it was. I didn't particularly love it and found it a bit corny."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved the movie!","review":"The movie was tons better. I didn't care too much for the ending in this book.The movie makes me cry. The book didn't. I was expecting to get a good cry from the book, and I didn't. I was disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I liked the movie better...who says that?","review":"I enjoyed the movie much more than the book. That said, I thought the book was just ok. I don't get what all the hype was about. It is a short book, but it fell short in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"read this","review":"I absolutely loved this book. I couldn't put it down all night. I started it at ten and ended at 3AM I cried my eyes out. I also gave a copy of it to my best friend and she hated me for it because it made her miss her fiance who was out at sea even more. This definitely is something that everyone needs to read to remind them of what love is about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Romance and love knocking at your heart","review":"I gave it a 9 because it was a little bit short, I wish it would have go into more detail. The story is a credible one, I lived something similar to what Noah lived, only she marry the other guy! It is very sensual and even erotic, without being vulgar or shameless. Very romantic. The second part is one of inspiration and devotion to true love and loyalty. It was recommended to me by a very romantic friend. I read it while I was away from home in Bosnia with the Army, mad at my wife, and it help me to assess my position as a husband and re-commit myself to my wife and being a better husband and lover. Not a book to be read with the mind, but with the heart. A re-born romantic"},{"rating":"2","title":"Need a good cry?","review":"I read this book in one sitting. I started crying around page 95, and didn't stop until about half an hour after I'd finished. It's like the author had all my buttons (true love, alzheimers, the South)lined up in a row and pushed them hard. Sure this book is schmaltzy, sure it's no great work of lit-rit-ture, but it is a great read if you want a good cry."},{"rating":"2","title":"We've all had (or dreamt) of a love like this...","review":"At the urging of my wife and best friend in the world, I picked this novel up. To say I couldn't put it down would be a gross understatement. After finishing the book (and a box of tissues) I found myself invigorated and with a new appreciation of the love that I have. I also felt a renewed passion to savor that love as fully as possible -- while our youth is still with us. I have no question that nearly everyone has either experienced a special relationship such as this -- or they have dreamt of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"harlequin / blue-light special","review":"While the love story in this book is beautiful, the story was so predictable that it was ultimately boring. Lucky for the reader the author limited the length. Please keep in mind that this comment comes from a reader who is very tired of the my-father-killed-my-puppy-when-I-was-ten-psycho-babble that dominates so many novels today. I like to read happy novels...I just didn't fnd any substance in this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Notebook","review":"The Notebook is one of my favorite stories. I truly recommend this book to the people that like romance and love stories. This story will make you cry and fall in love at the same time. This story will keep you reading, and reading, because you will want to know what's going to happen next. I also watched the movie of this story, but I enjoyed, and liked the book best."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book brought tears to my eyes...","review":"I really enjoyed Nicholar Sparks' \\"The Notebook.\\" I liked how all the characters were developed very well. You could tell so much about Noah and Allie by just what Nicholas was commenting that they did. A few times in the book I had tears in my eyes. It was very touhcing. I most likely reccomend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll Love This Book!","review":"I definitely liked this book, The Notebook, by Nicholas Sparks. It is a fictional story that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys romance novels. I enjoyed this excellent book because Sparks described every moment as if you were there yourself, you could feel each characters' emotion as if it was your own. It was so hard to put this book down. The suspense and different conflicts that occurred, internal and external, made this book so interesting. The Notebook is also full of surprises, with such loveable characters. Overall, this story of passion and love between two people could, in the end, bring you to tears."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Notebook review","review":"Nicholas Sparks is known for his talent of writing love novels that make you cry. This book fits that description. I would suggest the book if you like romantic love novels. If you dont this is defidently not the book for you. The ending is kind of confusing but is a book you will want to read over and over. Once you start it you really cant put it down. It has good twists that you wouldnt expect and it keeps you wondering what is going to happen. This novel makes you think about life and how it can change so quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice change !!!!!","review":"While I may not be a literary genious, I truly enjoyed this book. This was not an unrealistic story as was the story of my own grandparents. Those who are skepitcal about \\"true love\\" and \\"In sickness and in health\\" will not appreciate this book, for those who have lived it, a must read novel. It inspires hope of \\"forever\\". I enjoyed this book and have passed it on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get out your tissues!","review":"I first thought the book was too sappy and almost gave up. But then, Noah is reading from his journal to his wife Allie who is elderly and who has Alzheimer's disease. They are together now in the same nursing home. This is when you'll get to weeping unless you've got no pulse. A great book from there to the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's good!","review":"After recommended by a co-worker, I watched the movie then read the book recently. Personally, I like the movie much more then the book. As one reader mentioned in the review, the story is lack of details which the movie I think, has filled the gaps for it. I like the movie more then the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tissues.......please","review":"I couldn't put this book down. I was reading it in a doctors office and I had to get up and leave because I started to cry. It is so touching and beautifully written. Everyone should be so lucky to have a love like that. I would recomend this book to anyone!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A good beach read...at best.","review":"This book didn't leave me crying, or even feeling attached to the characters, and I consider myself a fairly emotional and romantic person. The book was too short to really feel anything for the characters. Any true depth or believability I found myself feeling at times was always hindered by Spark's horrid writing style. I found myself cringing from time to time over the sentences and words he chose; it was that out of a pre-teen novel. The dialouge was all too contrived and unrealistic. I could see myself really enjoying this book if I were fourteen or younger, but for the older reader, just take it for what it is: a quick and easy read for the beach. Nothing you'll want to reread or cherish, but it's entertaining for a few hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speechless......","review":"I have to admit when I first began to read this book I thought it would be one of those books that you could never get into. I could have not been more wrong. Although the introduction is not the best, the rest of the book makes up for it. The love described in this book and the idea of Soul Mates was so unbelievablely well put together. I rooted for Noah the whole way and at times felt myself choking back some tears. The love described in this book is too great for words. I would highly recommend this book to anyone needing a soul-deep love story."},{"rating":"1","title":"predictable romance","review":"If you want to read a book that has no excitement and no depth or meaning then you should read The Notebook. Kudos to Sparks for writing a book with a plot that has been used many times before and actually receiving praise for it. I was extremely disappointed with the ending. The writing style was easy to read, but how it was set up in some parts made it confusing about who the author was referring to. I have not seen the movie but I heard good things about it. After reading the book I want to see the movie just to see what all the hype was about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blecccch!","review":"Absolutely nauseating. I read the whole thing, hoping it would turn around, but no! Gotta give the guy credit, though, he's got millions hooked. I've read better romance on notes passed in high school."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book was in poor condition","review":"Book was in poor condition. It was not at all acceptable condition of book. Book was not well described in the descriptiona. Book has stain on almost all pages. Looks like this book got wet earlierb. All pages on the top right end corner was crushed/folded"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"like new\\"condition i dont think so","review":"this book looked like everyone in the US had had it first it was old worn out and the pages were yellowing i would never order from them again"},{"rating":"1","title":"do not read this book","review":"I already wrote one review advising people not to buy the book. The writing is bad, the characters are boring, the story is trite. It is the second-worst book I ever read. The only reason it got 2 stars instead of 1 is that the final segment was somewhat charming. I explained why. People then proceed to accuse my review of being not helpful. It's not supposed to help decide TO buy the book, but NOT TO buy the book. It's a bad book, trust me! Are only positive reviews helpful ones? Look and see how many others wrote the same thing I did! I'm trying to save you a few bucks here. If you MUST read it, check it out from the library. Don't spend money on this crap. You want to read some good southern literature - read Lee Smith, Pat Conroy, Fred Chappell, numerous others. Stay away from Nicholas Sparks. He still has some maturing to do as a writer. The book reads like an *average* high schoolers creative writing assignment."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh, lord","review":"I guess it's inevitable that we will always suffer such trite, shallow, obvious, moneygrubbing writing as this schlock, each and every year. One would think Mr. Sparks would at least have the shame to use a psueodnym"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh! Ugh! Ugh!","review":"I am shocked that Nicholas Sparks continues to sell any novels at all, considering how appallingly bad this and his other books are.His plots are formulaic and his most complex character is scarcely two dimensional. Compared to this dreck, even a Danielle Steel novel seems brilliant and complex. It's so obvious that Sparks is going for the obvious tear-jerker, and no amount of schmaltz is too much in this quest. Save your money and your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"CRAP!","review":"What a waste of time. My wife and I just read The Notebook and were disappointed by almost every facet of it. Most of the dialogue was contrived and totally unreal. I don't care how romantic Noah is drawn up to be, no man speaks like that; unbelievable (in a bad way). One reviewer said the ending was creepy, and I would say that is putting it nicely. Another thing that was really stupid was that Sparks tries to give Allie virtue, yet she cheat's on her fiancé without remorse. Total character flaw, again unbelievable.Did I mention the writing was horrid? Sparks jumps between perspectives way to much. Third person is good, but he puts us in the mind of Allie and Noah in the same scene on more than one occasion. It surprises me Warner bought the rights in the first place. Not only that but the editor should be fired.I paid a mere 5.95 for the paperback and trust me that was too much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are we really this dumb?","review":"I can't believe this guy's books are selling. I'm no damned genius, but I could have told you what was about to happen on the next page with 100% accuracy. And the writing, damnation! I've never seen so many cliches in one place since the last time I heard a gradution speech. This could be an excerpt: \\"A penny saved is a penny earned, actions speak louder than words, and all you need is love.\\"This is a terrible book. But you know what, this guy may know that. I have a sneaking suspicion this guy is smart enough to know that his stuff has the literary content of a hooked on phonics brochure, but is able to make millions of people take him seriously while he laughs all the way to the bank. He can't write at all, but he knows how to make a buck. More power to him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well the last few pages are worth while","review":"I do not like Sparks' writing style but the way he puts the last sequence of the book about Allie and her husband's love at old age was so... well beautiful. It can easily be compared to Nancy and Ronald Reagan. Getting old is expensive when it is a loved one you are losing. I hate most of the book but the last few pages are timeless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Cheesy Book?","review":"Honestly, do we need another book where you don't actually have to read anything because you already know what's going to happen? While reading The Notebook, I felt like I could have written every single word in ever single sentence. I asked some girls from my work what they thought about it and they loved it. It is a feel good novel that makes you wish everything was so perfect all the time, but get real. I guess there is something to say for love stories and happy endings, they never happen, but it's fun to pretend. If this is your thing, go for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could this book be more trite?","review":"Terrible. Predictable. Intelligence insulting. Though true love can last a lifetime, teenaged passion cannot. And true love can not cure Alzheimer's - even in romantic fiction the premise is unbelievable. This book goes into the \\"Hours of My Life I Will Never Get Back\\" pile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse romantic novel I've ever read","review":"Hands down, this is the worst romantic novel I've ever read. The narrative was stiff, unnatural, almost painful to read. The dialog was at times unbelievable, at times simply awful. The plot was poorly developed and the characters, especially the female lead, were ridiculous. There was nothing even remotely romantic even in the romantic moments! In contrast, the movie, which I saw a few days after reading the book, was very nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"If you have seen the movie The Notebook and are interested in reading the book, don't waste your time. The book leaves out any character development and leaves you with two-dimensional personalities that are too flat to connect with. It's a quick and easy read, and I admit once you start you want to finish, but only in hope that something surprising or interesting may happen. Expecting the same ending as the movie, I was extremely upset when I finally finished the book. It was quite a disappointment. I'm not too cynical to appreciate the theme of true, enduring love, but it is insulting that Sparks would expect his readers to buy into the sappy and unrealistic story."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst book I ever read","review":"A friend gave me this book to read on a plane. he loved it and it made him cry. I was excited to give it a try. The worst book I have ever, ever read in my life. The writing style (lexicon used, vocabulary, etc) is so poor, that a 9 year elementary school student can write with more imagination. What a miserable prose... The plot is weak, the characters (that are flawlessly perfect in every way) are flat, 2 dimensional, no development. The story is not credible to begin with. The writing is repetitive, the author has no imaginative ideas, in addition he makes factual mistakes (in 1946 his Noah is wearing jeans like James Dean, but in fact, these pants werent even called jeans at that time, nor they were in fashion). Someone who reads Nabokov, Umberto Eco, Markos Garcia, Marcel Proust-- never should touch books by Sparks. It is a shame, I cant believe that some people actually rate it 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly written and dripping with sentimentality","review":"I had never read a Nicholas Sparks novel prior to The Notebook. After watching the movie (and enjoying it immensely) I felt I owed it to the source material, as well as myself, to give the novel a read. I so wanted to enjoy this book. After all, I'm a sucker for romance.What can be said about this book that isn't negative. Weakly realized, poorly written, and ridden with sentimentality I can only marvel at its popularity. It was nearly impossible to look past the drab and commonplace prose and the author's overwhelming propensity for sappy inner dialogue.I'm certain that I'm in the minority here. Nicholas Sparks clearly has a devoted following. For me, however, it was unsatisfying to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sappy, Oversimplified, and Unrealistic","review":"While reading this book, I felt as though it had been written for a second-grader. The sentences and words were short and sparse. The faults of the writing style are not the only problems, however; the storyline is melodramatic and sappy, and the author clearly didn't do sufficient research on Alzheimer's. The story is very predictable (and also appears in many other books by Sparks). The only good thing I have to say is that at least the book is a little less sappy than the movie. If you enjoy reading books with substance and style, this is NOT for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books that I've ever read...","review":"It's difficult to talk about the content of the book without giving away the plot. On a broad view, it's a love story, but not in a sweet, sappy, happily ever after sense. The realism is fantastic- so much so, that I read it from start to finish in one night- I just couldn't put it down. The book has a slow start as you're introduced to the characters, but once the plot takes off, it draws you into the lives of the people that you're reading about. That's really all that I can say without giving away the story, but I highly recommend it to anyone who's looking for a good story to curl up with on a rainy day. Definitely 5 stars!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An AMAZING love story!","review":"Once I started reading this book, I couldn't put it down. The love story of Noah and Allie was so beautiful. Puts life into perspective of how love should be! I recommend this book to anyone who just wants to read a good love story! The tears were falling by the end...Love this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mildly entertaining story","review":"This book has a decent plot line,however the characters aren't as well developed as they should be, which makes it difficult to connect with the story. The awful prose is was so trite and dull it was painful to my eyes. But I had an eight hour flight so I finished it out of boredom. The ending wash rushed and should have been more focused and detailed. If you like \\"literary\\" literature, ie excellent prose and style, you will not enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"major disappointment","review":"I bought this title because the one I really wanted, \\"Cast Your Fate To The Wind\\" is not generally available.

Thomas Ward, a thirteen year old seventh son of a seventh son, has been volunteered by his parents to be the apprentice of the local spook. This spook has protected the county from dark forces for a long time but knows that his work is soon to pass. All of his previous apprentices have failed, and now Thomas is his last hope. As Thomas tackles his training, he is faced not only with the challenges of evil, but also with those of coming of age.

Now Im feeling guilty the kids in a mess!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good clean fun","review":"Unspoken Desires by Iris & Steven Finz is a well-written informative book about regular people's \`taboo' sexuality. With each interviewee having a different take on just what taboo is. It is about sexual desires, acts and fantasies that people keep secret from their partners. They put stories in this book that seemed to follow regular themes. There is a wide range of personality types and their corresponding kinks represented in this book. They range from Mary, who was brought up in a Convent after her parents died, and has some pretty tame ideas about what is taboo in her story titled \\"Shameful Desire\\", to Olga who likes to exhibit herself graphically in front of a web cam. This was a thoughtfully written, sexy, well-put together book. The stories in it not only titillate but they also educate by presenting a wide range of sexual fantasies and realities from normal people. It is a good book and a decent addition to any collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Tolkien Reader for Tolkien fans.","review":"Like said before, this book is for already established fans of J.R.R. Tolkien. This book includes an essay about fairy stories and Tolkien's thoughts about what a fairy story is and is not. It was a slow read, but interesting to see into his mind and to discover his influences. The highlight of the book for me was the Farmer Giles of Ham. It was a well told story. The adventures of Tom Bombadil were good because it gives you some backstory of Tom. I'm not really a fan of Tom Bombadil, but you can appreciate the thought that Tolkien put into Bombadils poetry/stories. I really believe Bombadil was one of Tolkiens favorite characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I wanted!","review":"This did not have the Tom Bombadil stories that I read 43 yrs ago. It was ok for what it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leaf by Niggle - best short story ever.","review":"This is the only book that has Leaf by Niggle, which is the best short story ever written by anyone, anywhere.It also has some poems that are not found anywhere else, such as Errantry, Princess Mee, The Man In The Moon Stayed Up Too Late, and The Mewlips, all of which I memorized as a twelve year old, because I liked them so much.The rest of the book is also very good if you like Tolkien's style and/or are interested in his thoughts. As a child, I also memorized his letter on page 74, which begins \\"Although now long estranged...\\" and which encompasses topics which challenge the oldest among us.As an adult, I still find Tolkien's works and thoughts compelling, though perhaps for somewhat different reasons than those of my childhood.The book is worth the price, if only for Leaf by Niggle and the letter on page 74."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice addition to Tolkien library","review":"This book is well done, full of several wonderful short stories, an essay, and even a poem or two. It's really not something to read all at once, but more of a selective reading volume. It also has excellent illustrations."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Have for Tolkien Buffs","review":"A Tolkien Reader is perfect for those who love Tolkien's work and are interested in the man himself. \\"Tree and Leaf\\" is a fantastic essay in the ways of myth and legend, and really taught me a lot about the very nature of not only the fantasy world, but our own as well. \\"Beortnoth\\" wasn't quite so interesting, but \\"Farmer Giles of Ham\\" was absolutely hilarious. \\"Leaf by Niggle,\\" Tolkien's only allegory, is quite touching, and reveals a lot about Tolkien's view of his place in the world. The poetry at the end is positively beautiful. An excellent anthology of Tolkien's lesser-known and shorter works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth reading!","review":"This is a collection of several of Tolkien's smaller works like his short stories.Most importantly, however, is that it contains his rather hard to find essay entitled\\"On Fairy Stories\\" and its demonstration : \\"Leaf and Niggle.\\" To appreciate more Tolkien'sother works (LOTR, etc.) I must recommed reading his essay.

Be sure to order size larger than you're used to. Or maybe even bigger than that. They're very heavy clogs otherwise.

Although I intended to wear these clogs strictly for gardening (they're a snap to hose off and dry quickly when hung toe-side-up), I found myself wearing them for quick trips to the store during rainy weather and even wore them when I had bus duty at school one rainy week. I discovered when I wear these clogs with even a light pair of socks, my feet stay warm as well as nice and dry. I especially appreciate the treads on the sole which keep the possibility of slipping to a minimum-- when that \\"rain\\" turns to snow/ice (yes, this happens in Montana from time to time :)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sloggers","review":"I wanted something I could slip on when I needed to run outside for something minor.

I wear 7.5, but ordered a 7 and they're perfect.Love, love, love!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too wide and too heavy","review":"They are just too wide even I did not go with a bigger size as people recommended. In addition, they are too heave to just walk. The fit is so bad that they are easily slipped off from your feet when you walk. I will not recommend unless if you have wide feet and the weight do not bother you. I gave 2 stars since the build quality is pretty good. But if they don't fit, they can't be worn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloggers 260KW08 Women's Premium Clog Size 8 Kiwi","review":"After reading some reviews on this product,suggesting that you buy a larger size since they run small, I went ahead and ordered the Size 8 Sloggers Women's premium clog. It turns out that the Size 8 (I'm normally a 6 1/2 - 7 size) is too big for me. The clog is also very loose or wide in the toes and my feet swims around the shoe when I wear it. Unless you have wide feet, I recommend not to order this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good for gardening","review":"The shoe is well-constructed, but slips off of the foot too easily.

I wear them a lot, and they're very comfortable.

Before that time, I'd wear them only occasionally, like when I was working in the basement on the concrete floor, or outdoors. But wearing them daily for over two weeks really helped to aleve my foot and toe problems and pain. I think the Sloggers have even helped my knee pain some. I'll probably buy another pair or two of this particular style."},{"rating":"1","title":"My feet aren't that thrilled","review":"These clogs look neat and they seem to be of sturdy build. However, they are so loose that my foot has trouble staying inside it when I'm walking. And yes, I ordered the correct size. The length is almost a hair too small so there's no way I could wear a size smaller. They definitely do not fit like a glove and if I had to walk any distance further than my garden, I wouldn't and couldn't wear them. I am looking forward to being able to hose them down when I pick up mud, as I usually do when outside. That's their function for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"So comfy, So fun","review":"I bought these shoes just to work outside.

Perhaps, however, I shouldn't hold Ms. Ephron in such high esteem that I immediately buy anything with her name on it. No, she didn't write PS Your Cat is Dead...but she did endorse it. And shame on you, Nora. This book made me laugh countless times, but never at anything the author intended to be humorous. Rather, I laughed at the sheer absurdity of the dialogue. Never have I heard people speak in the way these characters did. They were overly witty and brazen, as well as entirely one-dimensional. As much as I disliked this book, I would recommend it to self-declared \\"theatre types.\\" What they saw in Rent (the film, of course) I shall never know, but they will almost certainly find that same element in PS Your Cat is Dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing and offensive in many ways.","review":"After seeing this book around I got a copy after checking the reviews here :) But what I found is a 1973 old book that has finally been printed post-mortem, with some dippy 1973 sensibilities like you can fix any problem by smoking some strong marijuana, or it's OK to snatch a purse if the victim can afford it. Then there's the homo/bi-sexuality part, one of the major themes of the book. I wasn't offended but I didn't care for it either.

Although its a nice nostalgic magazine that has good articles all about the old days, it carries almost nothing in the way of photos, and is quite a colorless magazine overall. Some time ago it also stopped carrying a lot of old time poetry and sketchings that was not only plentiful in it at one time, but two of my favorite features. Since it's so rare to find old fashioned magazines these days I still can recommend it for the die hard lover of days gone by. But if you really want to read and relish in the old days with colorful pictures as well as articles, may I recommend Reminisce magazine that is also available here on Amazon. It's packed with nostalgic pictures and articles in every issue and accepts no advertising. I have been a subscriber to it for years. Good Old Days is good, but there is definitely one better in my opinion.... : )Reminisce"},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD","review":"I would really like to tell you how wonderful this publication is. However, having placed my order in November 2007 and it now being halfway through February 2008 I still couldn't tell you...that's because I haven't received one single issue! They took my money right away...if only their delivery began as fast. In addition, I sent an email to the publisher over a week ago and they haven't had the courtesy of responding to that yet either. Perhaps what they mean by \\"good old days\\" is proving that back in the days you would get what you PAID for!

I had to stop reading, after several poems; Pablo Neruda's love poetry was so intensely powerful that it overwhelmed my senses. He wrote brilliantly and passionately of the feelings of his soul, at once enthralling yet brutally candid. You suffered along him, you loved the woman he loved. The verses he wrote express the ineffable and indescribable. And the earthly images he creates are potent, almost too potent.

I don't even know how to describe Pablo Neruda. When you read his poetry you just become entranced by the way he is so accurately able to convey such passion in his simple words and beautiful imagery.

I love the writings of Faulkner, O'Connor, and Percy, grew up in the South, and all of my relatives still live on red clay roads on southern Ga. farms. \\"Car Wheels\\" fulfulls New Yorkers' expectations of how Southerners are supposed to sound, and I think that's why Northern critics like it so much. To these ears, it just sounds like a parody, about as authentic as Steven Spielberg's depiction of the South in The Color Purple.

Lucinda Williams has a gift. She writes brilliant, yet simple songs. When she sings them, she means what she is singing. Her voice trembles when she sings of personal experiences and pain. Her song \\"2 Kool to be Forgotten\\" is almost like a novel summed up into a brilliant song. I saw her in concert in Nashville last weekend and she blew me away. If you've never heard Lucinda Williams, her sound reminds me of the sound of the song \\"Ode to Billie Joe.\\" In fact, on her album \\"Sweet Old World\\" she sings a song called \\"Pineola\\" which [to me] had to be inspired by that song. You can't go wrong with her albums \\"Sweet Old World,\\" \\"Essence,\\" and most of all \\"Car Wheels on a Gravel Road.\\"I also recommend her version of Hank Williams' \\"Cold, Cold Heart\\" - check it out on \\"Timeless,\\" the tribute to Hank Williams."},{"rating":"2","title":"An American Treasure","review":"After continually showing great promise on her previous records, Williams breaks through with an absolute masterpiece for \\"Car Wheels on a Gravel Road.\\" There is literally not a bad song in the mix, though the title track, \\"2 Kool 2 Be 4-Gotten\\" and \\"Lake Charles\\" stand out in particular. Williams's lyrics capture portraits of rural America like no other songwriter I've heard. Additionally, the musicianship on the record is first rate. The songs contain elements of folk, blues and country. This would be my pick for album of the year for 1998."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD might be to great to lend out","review":"I'm new to Lucinda Williams.

I don't *love* all the songs on the CD, maybe especially compared to those on \\"Lucinda Williams.\\" But, I *do* love quite a few, including the aforementioned \\"Joy,\\" as well as the opener, \\"Right in Time,\\" and \\"Car Wheels,\\" which follows. Then....the third cut! \\"2 Kool\\" just makes me think of my high school years and how all of us used to say things like that....You're 2 kool 2 B 4 gotten! Etc. Besides, it's a fabulous song....Pick up again w/ \\"Metal Firecracker, which burns just like a .... well, you know! Last 4 songs on the CD are altogether awesome. \\"All the way to Jackson, I don't think I'll miss you, much.\\" And, when I listen to Lu, I don't think I will......Or, will I??"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"For those of you who are purchasing Lucinda's work for the first time make sure you listen to a sample. The music/beat is very good but the lyrics are odd/goofy and she has a very rough sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"The title is only ten syllables short of haiku, but as invoking.","review":"I bought CWOAGR years ago, listened to it constantly for months, then lost it only to buy again a year or so later. It was great then, it's even better now. LW's songs become audible snapshots of your life, and this more than any (only the self-titled may rival). So if you listen to this during rough times, be forewarned it will bring it all back even after years. Whenever the powers that be decide to make those top whatever lists, I think car wheels will stand side by side with the giants.Her greatest and one of my favorite albums of all-time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's be honest, this woman's voice s**ks. she can't sing.","review":"Unfortunately Lucinda's CD is recommended by Amazon.com (in this case), and she may well be purchased by numerous tone deaf listener's but unfortunately the vocals are horrifying. hate to burst your bubble. This ain't music !"},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't understand","review":"I got this CD all sure that I would like it because of the great reviews and most of the people Lucinda Williams are compared to I love.I really was not impressed at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Her voice kills me!","review":"I would agree that these are well written songs and musically they are terrific, however, Lucinda's voice is TERRIBLE! I liked the songs so much I kept listening to it hoping her voice would get better. No such luck -- it kills the whole thing for me. This one makes me wish you could return opened CDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a bunch of undeserving hype","review":"I'm consistently suprised at the groupthink mentality, whether it's popular music or alternative. Lucinda Williams was one of the best CDs I've heard and I've listened to it regularly over the last couple of years. The songwriting on this one doesn't compare. A lot of people want to like this CD and fewer actually do. The lyrics are overly repetitive and it doesn't have near the soul of her previous work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lucinda rocks","review":"I have heard of Lucinda Williams over the years but never was a fan; however, after buying this lone cd and practically dismissing it before listening, I was blown away once I heard it. I have a friend who prefers \\"Essence\\" or \\"Lucinda,\\" but I have to say, after hearing \\"Car Wheels\\" first, this will always be my favorite!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gifted","review":"This album is like opening all the windows of your house wide on the first great spring morning of the year. It's really hard to convey how good it is, because I'm at a loss for parallels. Maybe Kind of Blue?It's a living classic - buy it and enjoy it, knowing that Lucinda will be with us for a long time, and there will be so much more to enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still I long for more Lucinda","review":"Although we already own 'Car Wheels on a Gravel Road' by Lucinda Williams and love that album dearly, I would have to say that owning this bonus album with a 2nd live performance CD is a MUST have!Not only do you get awesome quality in the re-mastered tracks, but you also get a live concert performance by Lucinda that is awesome to listen to!To date, the 2nd CD performance of 'Change the Locks' is my favorite recorded version of that song which I have longed for for quite some time. There's something about hearing Lucinda perform that song live that brings out an intensity that a studio-recorded version of this song just can't re-produce.To all of you Lucinda fans that crave, and just can't get enough - this CD set comes close! There isn't anything that can compare to hearing her live, but this CD set comes close. Highly very highly recommended!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lucinda is the preeminent female songwriter in America","review":"I have never felt compelled to review one of my purchases until now. This is a masterpiece! Gorgeous, gritty lyrics combine with superb melodies to take you into the backwoods for a big slice of Americana. Lucinda takes forever to record a new collection because she's a pain in the ass perfectionist. This one was damn near worth the wait. Plus Steve Earle contributes to several tracks. If you are interested in folky, jangly poetry that will kick your ass, buy this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Crossover Mainstay","review":"Not much to say, Lucinda does all that. Just wore my disc out...so getting another. I will say she's a core personality of that enigmatic artistic American underground the mainstream will never get, no matter how many fancy Rolling Stone articles come out about it. Just hope you all get enough bread out of the deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"sublime!","review":"My tape of \\"Car Wheels on a Gravel Road\\" is the only tape that's been played in my car deck in two months. And it's been continuous, I can't get enough of it. It's the album of the year, perhaps the decade. I'm looking forward to the Somerville Theater show on October 20."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece........","review":"Rolling Stone Magazine called this release a masterpiece and I certainly agree. I bought this CD five weeks ago and haven't stopped listening. I would definately call Lu the female Steve Earle; by my standards that is the highest compliment I could pay this gifted singer songwriter. Put this one under the christmas tree for anyone you know who appreciates great music."},{"rating":"2","title":"playing even as I type!","review":"William's album is one of the best albums of the year; one can listen to it repeatedly and never tire of it. The songs are varied and pleasant to listen to (with the possible exception of \\"Concrete and Barbed Wire\\"). Williams reveals herself to be a gifted singer/songwriter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly good","review":"I'd heard excerpts from this album from a non-commercial college station. It got my attention. This album is better than the excerpts. This album is honest, well produced and the musicianship is remarkable. In this era of over produced electronic sound it's good to hear something from the heartland where a guitar is a guitar and a voice is a voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album of the year.","review":"I'm from Baton Rouge where Lucinda Williams learned how to play guitar (direct quote from her amazing concert here last week). We were looking for something different to listen to while driving across New Zealand and the reviews looked good. We happened to pick up the Christchurch newspaper which picked it as the best album of the year as we drove over Arthur's Pass (long way from Louisiana) and I couldn't agree more. The blend of musical styles works damn well. They played a concert here last week and I was worried that it would be one of those \\"unplugged\\" things that wouldn't work. Not!! Lucinda has put together on of the best bands I have ever seen. The album and the concert both have my highest recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!!!!","review":"It has been a long time since I bought a record that I didn't want to end. This is it. Not a clunker on the CD. She is a great singer/sonwriter. Excellent backing musicianship as well. Oh by the way; the sound (recording/mixing) of this CD is as good as it gets. Between this and Lucinda's lyrics you can almost taste the dust of car wheels on a southern back country road on a hot day. Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Merle1 Country Road","review":"Good CD Wish it showed track titles on new players. I like country and have been working in Vicksburg, MS, so some of the tracks fit in good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lucinda carries her unique sound to another level.","review":"Understanding the alternative country sound sometimes takes time, but Lucinda puts it in perspective when you listen to this well defined album. On the same level as Robert Earl Keen, she is reaching legendary status in the Texas/Louisiana area. Her pure simple sound and close knit lyrics make for a truly enjoyable time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like any fine wine,This Lady will only improve with time","review":"I only listen to music that I find entertaining to me, not what someone says. I have listened to Emmylou from the begining of her career, and I'll listen to Lucinda Williams as well. They both have a quality that makes you able to pick out their voice in a song. My hats off to performeres like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"A major disappointment","review":"If you've heard and enjoyed Lucinda Williams on a previous album, don't buy this one. After a long wait, this monotonous, boring, hackneyed collection of songs is a major disappointment. The worst thing anyone can say about music (any type) is that it all sounds the same. It usually means the listener is totally alienated. That's how this latest release affected me. My advice, buy any other Williams CD (self-titled, Sweet Old World, etc.) and you 'll hear an artist who cared about her music. This release is instantly forgettable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely disappointing","review":"After hearing 1 track from her cd on the radio, I bought it thinking that it was going to be a really great collection. Boy was I wrong. The entire album (with the exception of Can't Let Go - which she did NOT write herself) really stinks. I have extremely varied tastes in music and pride myself on loving everything from blues, country, rock & roll to classical (with the exception of rap). But I have to say, that this cd has got to be one of the worst collections of incoherent ramblings I have heard in a long time. Every song sounds like the one before it. It amazes me that so many people love it. You can't really follow the melodies - there is no structure to the songs. I am looking forward to selling this one back to the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"I am not impressed.","review":"I am amazed at how such poorly crafted lyrics could make it in the big time. The singing is affected indeed. Whiney 90s style. Backed up with a good band, however, I could write a better song sitting in the bathroom with my son pounding on the door!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I was extremely disappointed with this recording.","review":"This recording was repetitive, flat, and monotonous. The bottem line, it just isn't country. It was a total waste of money and will cause me to think twice before I order over the Internet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than \\"Rubber Soul!\\"","review":"Some albums have some nice individual cuts on them. The really great ones have nice individual cuts that relate to each other and somehow end up higher than their sum. Rubber Soul was like this. Gravel Road is another. The mere fact that Lucinda is not a household name today is a stunning and shocking indictment of life in the late 20th century!"},{"rating":"2","title":"worth the purchase...for sure!","review":"I believe this is the best of Lucinda! Great bluesy sound. All of the songs are really great! You won't regret this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the fuss?","review":"Grating, monotonous voice. No melodies. Shockingly poor lyrics!!! The band is the only redeeming feature. I do not understand the hype... there are far, far better songwriters and performers out there that deserve this attention...It doesn't even deserve one star..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed in this CD.","review":"I'd never before heard of this artist, but bought the CD at the recommendation of amazon.com. (I even bought one to give as a gift!) The music is fine, but her performace sends shivers up my spine. I took the CD to work, and three co-workers felt the same. Obviously we are missing something...what?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pave the driveway, please...","review":"\\"Car wheels on a gravel road, car wheels on a gravel road, car wheels on a gravel road, car wheels on a gravel road.\\" I enjoy southern imagery but that is all we get here- imagery, not much substance. Good band, good production, unique vocal performance, but unremarkable songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"It would be boring if it wasn't so grating.","review":"I'm really baffled by the great reviews of this record. Williams' voice is horrible. It's not that her voice is unpolished; Dylan, Steve Earle, and many others pull off less than perfect voices by the strength of their delivery. Williams tries too hard to sound soulful, ending up sounding desperate, grating. The melodies are flat and uninteresting, and the lyrics are uninspired. Skip this and pick up a Steve Earle, or Blue Rodeo CD for some great \\"American\\" music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I have enjoyed Lucinda's work in the past, & looked forward to this one after all the rave reviews. Musically, there isn't much of interest. Her stories may be interesting, but this isn't a book. As music, it's kind of boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"The music is timeless and transcends categories","review":"Like her namesake Hank, Lucinda Williams sings with an authenticity that tells you she couldn't fake it if she wanted to. This album transcends musical categories such as folk, blues or country, although it contains elements of all of these. It is just great American music. \\"Lake Charles\\" is a mysterious, achingly beautiful song that will get under your skin and stay there for weeks. A great achievement, the best album of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"How Sheryl Crow wants to sound but won't ever","review":"A long time coming but more than worth the wait. She has made 'town' a word of three syllables and 'casserole' a word full of erotic promise in the past, so she has a lot to live up to, even without her lyrical acuity and economy. Her style hasn't changed much over the course of her last three albums: the drawling honey and grit voice, the familiar band she relaxes with, twanging and chiming guitars, well-picked guests adding colour with fiddle or organ. The world she describes is off the main roads, full of small disappointments and victories. This album makes you think that there is something worthwhile in Country music, away from the rhinestones and syrup."},{"rating":"2","title":"A masterpiece","review":"If every true artist has one Mona Lisa or one Sistine Chapel in them, then Carwheels on a Gravel Road is Lucinda William's. From what I've read this album has taken a long and difficult road to get to us. Lucinda wanted this record to be as near to perfection as possible and it is. The vocals, the instrumentation, the backup vocals, all blend to make an album you listen to again and again and marvel each time at finding something new. Nothing is done to excess, the economy of effort is outstanding. This should be the breakthrough album of Lucinda William's career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, very interesting","review":"A different kind of music. Sorta a Bonnie Rait sound. Enjoyable but somewhat overrated by the description given."},{"rating":"2","title":"Did the car wheels run over her Essence?","review":"I ran this one into the gravely ground. I love everything about this CD and looked forward with much anticipation to the next one. Just listened to the samples of \\"Essence\\" due to be released in June and I have to wonder what terrible thing happened in Lucinda's life. Each track is more down than the next. No energy or optimism at all. I'm not going to get it and I'm a huge fan of CWOAGR. Lucinda you're 2 Kool 2 be this sad. Hope you cheer up for the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most overrated album of 1998","review":"Years in the making, enduring endless rerecordings and producer switches, this album arrived to no end of hype. Sad thing is, all the energy people devoted to it before it came out must have made everyone think they had to continue the hype even after finding out the album simply isn't very good. Williams' voice notwithstanding (too many criticisms of her focus on that), it's her writing that is poor. For a poet laurate's daughter, you'd think she'd be able to venture beyond cliche and half-baked ideas in her writing. Critic David Fricke called this the \\"Blonde on Blonde\\" of the '90s. Revoke his license."},{"rating":"2","title":"A review of the following reviews","review":"Here, save some time. Most of the following people love this album. A solid minority hate it. Very few people in between. General consensus? If you don't mind vocals with character, if you don't mind songs with character, and you don't need Billboard to rationalize your musical tastes, you will probably enjoy this very solid collection of country/folk/blues musings.Otherwise, you'll long for your Dixie Chicks CD, and wonder why Sheryl Crow isn't even more popular. After all, SHE's got videos, right?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Late Than Never","review":"I'm not much of a Country Music fan, but I appreciate and enjoy good music of any type or style. I only recently heard this disc, and all the hype and praise is certainly deserved. It's no surprise that Steve Earle plays and sings on this disc. Lucinda Williams is the female Steve Earle. Or maybe he's the male Lucinda Williams. They're two sides of the same coin, and they're the best that Country Music has to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lucinda is addictive","review":"This is the first album we bought by Lucinda Williams. I have it memorized now. I'd love to see her in concert, but she doesn't seem to do that. We have even discussed taking a vacation just to see her! It's country, but there's a lot more to it than that. Many of the songs are haunting. If you are a fan of good music, you'll love this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"genius prevails","review":"Because there is not a single album by Lucinda Williams that I think is not outstanding, I cannot say this is her best album. The greatest praise I can give it is that it is as truly excellent as the others. Why this talented, intellegent, unusual artist has not been more widely recognized I can neither understand nor explain. Her unusual, emotive voice, her truly poetic lyrics, her original melodies, her subtle, humble, wounded sensibility conspire to position this woman at the very top of her field. She has, in my opinion, no peer other than Chrissie Hynde. I will wait for the so-called critics to realize that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finch Fortidiet Eggcite - 100032230 - Bci","review":"My birds seem to eat the food well enough just didn't appreciate the bag not getting pack correctly so when I received it. It was litterly all over everything else in the order not to mention my supply was mainly wasted. Amazon did make it right. But still it should not have happen. the price was cheaper at the time but I found with shipping its not a great deal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learn about Hemingway from a friend","review":"A friend rec'd this out of print book to me. He has rec'd many great ones, but this blew my mind. One of the best books I've ever read by one of Heminway's closest friends for the last 14 years of his life. The True, uplifting, and sad novel, left me with 2 regrets: 1.) That I did not read it sooner, while I was younger, and 2.) That my life will be nothing like a life touched by, or experienced like Hemingway's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is a classic..fondly re-isued","review":"Probably will be most cherished momento published FOR the 100th anniversary...."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 1/2 * Feline Fantasy","review":"From the mischievous mind of Dav Pilky (\\"Adventures of Captain Underpants\\") comes this clever spoof sure to please grade school children. The story adheres fairly closely to \\"King Kong,\\" except that the giant beast is a cat and the explorers are three mice. Pilky's trademark puns and silly jokes punctuate the text.This is fairly sophomoric stuff that is not quite as clever as \\"Captain Underpants;\\" however, the book is highlighted by Pilkey's \\"manipulated photographic collage, heavily retouched with acrylic paint.\\" Photographs commingle with vivid surreal colors for a unique book that is as gratifyingly cheesy as the text."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's explore the plotline...","review":"Patterned after the storyline of \\"King Kong\\", of course, this tale involves a cat being kidnapped from his home, tied up in a burlap sack, and placed on display in irons in Mousopolis. After Kat Kong escapes he climbs up a tall building and is lured to fall to his death by a mouse in an airplane. Throughout the story the cat is made to look ferocious and evil, while the mice, who have engaged in kidnapping and who are responsible for the cat's death, are made to look cute and innocent.As the primary caregiver of 2 adopted cats, I find the story a bit disturbing, and children might find it disturbing too. The notion that children reading this story might be inspired to torment cats also disturbs me.I gave it 2 stars because despite my objections to the plotline, I still thought the artwork and prose were good.If you like this type of story and want to read it to a child, \\"Dogzilla\\" is the better choice since in his story, the dog is not kidnapped and murdered."}]`),N={name:"App",components:{PoemCard:D},data(){return{visibleCount:6,poemsData:C,isLoading:!1}},computed:{visiblePoems(){return this.poemsData.slice(0,this.visibleCount)},hasMorePoems(){return this.visibleCount<this.poemsData.length}},methods:{async loadMore(){this.isLoading=!0,await new Promise(o=>setTimeout(o,1e3)),this.visibleCount+=6,this.isLoading=!1}}},O={class:"card-container"},R=["disabled"],M={key:0},B={key:1};function H(o,e,n,u,r,s){const c=y("PoemCard");return a(),i("section",null,[e[1]||(e[1]=t("div",{class:"top-banner"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title"},[t("div",{class:"top-banner-title-text"},"🎉 Your SNAP 🥳")])],-1)),t("div",O,[(a(!0),i(w,null,f(s.visiblePoems,(h,m)=>(a(),b(c,{key:m,poem:h},null,8,["poem"]))),128))]),s.hasMorePoems?(a(),i("button",{key:0,class:"load-more-button",disabled:r.isLoading,onClick:e[0]||(e[0]=(...h)=>s.loadMore&&s.loadMore(...h))},[r.isLoading?(a(),i("span",B,"Loading...")):(a(),i("span",M,"See more"))],8,R)):p("",!0)])}const x=d(N,[["render",H],["__scopeId","data-v-fb0a1d4c"]]),L=JSON.parse('{"title":"","description":"","frontmatter":{"page":true},"headers":[],"relativePath":"drive/34.md","filePath":"drive/34.md"}'),W={name:"drive/34.md"},P=Object.assign(W,{setup(o){return(e,n)=>(a(),i("div",null,[v(x)]))}});export{L as __pageData,P as default};
