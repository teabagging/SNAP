Playing DVDs through the VCR degrades the picture, as I'm sure most of you know. After hooking up the adapter, I noticed that it did a good job with the picture, but the audio was horrible.

There are better adapters out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"RFU ADAPTER","review":"This is NOT a Sony product. If you use this item, and anything happens to your PS2, Sony is not responsible.

Also the sound is mono, so it only comes out one speaker. After this i bought a new tv(i needed one anyways) and the s video cable. The s video cable is awsome. Anyways, i highly recomend that you try to find an alternative to the rfu adapter if you want to watch movies.

We have no way of knowing whether this was done by the original player or by a piano roll editor. So these recordings may represent the original pianist's intentions in the area of tempo and timing, but not necessarily as regards dynamics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful solo guitar...","review":"I agree whole-heartedly with the great Jack Wilkins' review below...Joe Diorio has always been a forward thinking & harmonically adventurous musician & this cd reissue really captures that spirit. His liberal use of constant structure chord changes, open strings & lightning fast fourth intervals does more than just dazzle, it creates a very solemn harmonic atmosphere that's both melancholy & enlightening at the same time. This cd reissue is a standout gem in my jazz library...I've owned the original vinyl issue on Spitball for years & look forward to future Joe Diorio reissues on the fantastic Art Of Life label. A great companion to this cd is Joe's out-of-print 1993 solo release \\"We Will Meet Again\\" on the RAM label; Joe's compositions \\"Hymn\\" & \\"Poem\\" appear here as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oops!

It would probably take more time and effort to try to get a replacement, so most likely I will just find a different kind of rope for the chain.

As the title implies, Custer and Pickett get the most coverage. However, the book is filled with interesting, insightful, and simply amusing stories about other soldiers. Some, like Whistler, achieved greatness in other fields. Others are not nearly so well-known but had extraordinary lives nonetheless. The writing is sometimes a bit choppy but generally well-done. This is a book for those interested in the Civil War and Frontier period. Even if you are a sophisticated and expert student of the field, there is something new to be found in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read","review":"Do not make the mistake of thinking that the Goats or Immortals were in some way \\"rejects\\" or failures.

He sends Glogauer, the protagonist, to the time when Jesus is about to make his appearance. What happens next is imbued with the classical paradox of time travel (if you know history and if you travel back in time, you can come up with the original idea before it existed. But who got the idea in this case? A vicious circle...). The style is poor, and there are huge gaps in the story. It might have shocked quite a few pious Christians in its time, but I'd say not anymore..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"This thing should have gotten no stars, but you can't do that here. I read it and thought, \\"how does such poorly written drivel get published?\\" The characters all have the same voice and POV. The setting is drawn such that you could easily convince yourself the story takes place in Montana. It reminds me of something Howard Stern would write for the shock value. Typical Christian-bashing stuff without much literary gravitas. If you want to read the real deal, read \\"Quelle\\" by Peter Fusco which you can buy here on Amazon. Written in the first person, it drives you in a Viper from beginning to end. Great adventure, exciting, meaningful and uplifting, \\"Quelle\\" will at least make you feel good about life rather than making you feel so spiritually bereft and dirty you want to buy some rope and head for the nearest tree."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Debut Album!","review":"I saw Michael W.

I highly recommend it. His new album is coming out in February. I'm planning on getting that one too. You won't be disappointed with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitely one of the best texts on Strategy","review":"I had always believed that UK had a few business schools like London, Strathclyde and Cranfield comparable to the top US schools. The quality of this book, by two Strathclyde academics, re-confirms that. It very clearly establishes that \\"Strategy\\" is not just the pre-occupation of the board, it is every manager's business.

After the first night of use I had significantly less neck pain and it has since deceased to the point where I hardly even notice it. The pillow is a little hard when you first rest your head on it, but with body heat it because soft and molds perfectly around your head.

With most of Scott's work, DGames has no passion between the two main characters. There was definitely no passion in this book. Possibly my favorite of Scott's books is Highland Fling.

It contains music featured in all four of the series and the respective choices are examples of the exemplary creativity of the composers. The highlight is the \\"Suite from The Inner Light,\\" a beautiful selection that is almost new age in its structure. Another outstanding cut is the suite from the DS9 episode \\"The Visitor.\\" The only downside is the selection from what many Star Trek purists feel is the best from that series, \\"The Trouble with Tribbles.\\" Unfortunately, the music like the particular episode was not up to par with standards set in such episodes as \\"The Corbomite Manuever\\" and \\"The Doomsday Machine.\\" To have included \\"tribbles\\" was a mistake. Otherwise, this disc should be in the library of anyone with a passion for filmscoring."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great CD for Trekies...","review":"but a good CD for musicians. I enjoyed hearing most of my favorite themes from the Star Trek series with the exception of 2 of the tracks.

It acomplishes what it set out to do, combine all four series on one cd, with some success. There are several faults. One, the inclusion of heros and demons. Its to slow and boring. Two, the arrangement of the Theme to Deep Space Nine. The melody is hauntingly beautiful but the accompanyment is to complex and overwelms the melody. Also, the drums are to much. Other than that the CD is great. When I first got this CD I would only have given it two stars but then slowly, it grew on me. I started to enjoy the farce-ish suite from \\"The Trouble with Tribbles\\", the orchestrated version of \\"The Inner Light\\" ( though a better version can be found on star trek original soundtrack recordings by Jay Chattaway), and the dark \\"Heart of Glory\\". The theme to voyager is just as powerful as ever. A good buy.

I'd give this CD five stars if it wasn't for their butchering of Track 10 which is much better on their revelation EP. Additionally, the production on the disc is subpar, the vocals are turned too high and the overall clarity just isn't there. Overall, it's a good listen.

I love the fact that I can replace whatever color of ink runs out first without replacing all colors at once. The fact that this is a double pack saves even more money.

When you search for this product, the supplier that comes up by default seems to change daily. I just went for the first choice -- SchoolCartridgeRecycling. In spite of the fact that this firm's name suggests that they specialize in non-original products, what they sent me was the real thing.

I haven't used any of the programmability if offers yet, but I'm sure that will only enhance it once I take the time to figure out how to do it and use it. The only drawback I've noticed in it is that the D-pad, while a little easier on the thumbs, is very sensitive and will easily interpret what you think is just a one direction push as a diagonal push. (It does, however, make it easier to do diagonal pushes when that is what you want to do.) This can throw you off a lot in games like Tekken Tag Tournament, but hasn't given me a lot of problems in SSX.

No finer CD has come down the pike in quite some time. Like its predecessor - 'Chemical Friends' - 'Pressure' relies on acoustic chords to form the foundation for many songs but Nyles certainly isn't shy using his electric guitar, as shown by the muscular second track \\"Next Obsession\\". Beyond strings, though, this album is marked by a mastery of electronic recording techniques. Coupled with insanely catchy melodies, these songs, with their lush harmonies, treated vocals, and other sonic surprises, weave a tapestry of sound ranging from space rock to psychedelia to trance, with subtle reminders of Nyles' folktronic predecessor, 'Chemical Friends'. It's difficult to pigeon-hole \\"Pressure.\\" No matter, just slip on the earphones, close your eyes, and be transported. \\"Pressure\\" will blow you away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the wait - AWESOME album!!","review":"I am a huge fan of Nyles Lannon (aka N.Lannon or N.Ln) and have been patiently awaiting the followup to his first album Chemical Friends, which was one of my top 5 albums of 2004. Pressure does not disappoint! Nyles again produces fantastic melodies, which is truly his gift, along with a soothing, unique, and authentic voice and cool electronic sounds. I am impressed with the diversity on this album - each song has its own unique sound, mood, tempo, etc... this is not the kind of album where the songs all sound the same. He managed to retain some of the best elements of his first album, while producing something new and different that shows his talent as an artist who is willing to explore and experiment and grow.

The drums are not recorded to great either but you have to remember these are kids in high school just doing this for fun on they're own and considering that it does not sound to bad at all. The best part on the CD is the guitar playing and catchy riffs. They are really good but I have to tune a few things out to really enjoy it. Listen to the track samples to feel it out first. I like to listen to it now and then.

Sounds interesting enough, but alas! this movie is no more than a mixture of Lynch-at-work footage, an all-too brief look at his work as a sculptor and an incomplete survey of his pictures. How is it possible that there is no mention of Lynch's absolute masterpiece 'Twin Peaks' in this documentary?? The 'Eraserhead' cast reunion is a unique display of dullness; a bunch of old actors visiting their former dwellingplaces. If you want to find out how exactly Lynch shot the prison scene in 'Lost highway' (better watch that movie again!), you have to take a look at this. However, people who know all about Lynch ànd people who know nothing at all about him, may both get disappointed. Better luck next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"AmazingPieceOfArt,VenturesIntoTheInnerMindOfTheGeniusLynch","review":"Um yeah, so the movie was a credible search of phantasmagoric production.

Marina Raye's music is the only Native American music that never ceases to reach me. I'm an artist and I love to play her music for inspiration when I work on my art. I keep waiting for Marina to cut a CD that I don't absolutely love, but she never does. This one, too, I absolutely love.

Balanced with these frustrations is the extraordinary success he was able to achieve. It is a credit to him and to his colleagues that so much was accomplished.

The selection of pieces presents classics by both Spanish composers and by composers of other nationalities who were entranced by Spanish music. One interesting aspect of this CD is to compare similarities and differences between how non-Spaniards (Rimsky-Korsakov and Ravel) and Spanish composers (de Falla, Albeniz, and Granados) approach the evocation of Spanish music. The London Symphony Orchestra does an excellent job of capturing the Spanish flavor and rhythms.

I first read this book at the public library, but I liked it so much I'm planning on buying my own copy. Jennifer's ambivalent reactions to David were also well drawn. P.S.

So far (4 months) I've had almost zero detergent leakage, which is a first in my experience.

It is an absolutely fascinating exploration of the wonders of the universe both from a macro (galactic) point of view and a micro (cellular) point of view and, given that it's a short film, should be viewed by everyone at least once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sure, outstanding picture quality in a bloody boring 'movie'","review":"This is IMAX: Big screen Imax geeks have their 5.0 Dolby DTS , 6.7, 9.8, Super Duper Bit, Super Duper Duper Bit, Monster wolf, Hi Fi, super Hi fi, 9.99999999999999999 Mega Hurtz .....Oh, the movie.

Morgan Freeman narrates with his lovely, deep voice and keeps the film's slow pace at a more interesting flow. The music is also enchanting and helps it be a smoother ride. I never saw this at the IMAX theatre, but at school on a projecter about 10x smaller than the IMAX. But, nevertheless, it still captivated me and took me far, far away. Cosmic Voyage doesn't delve deep into Astronomical findings or anything excitingly new, but it does give us information that we see everyday and puts a spotlight on it- making our world ever more visible than we imagined."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pop-tart science, very dissapointing","review":"Fails to engage the imagination and has VERY little to offer in terms of physics or otherwise.

I had bought 4 or 5 in the last few years and was getting mad. It seemed like it should be easier to find a good one.I don't want anything special just that it WORKS and stays working.So here is the review:Easy to use. They designed the gearing very well. It is pretty easy to turn. I am almost 50 and my joints are getting messed up. It's hard to turn my old can opener. It always was. This one is easy.It's built pretty heavy duty.

I've used it for several months now, and can state that it leaves the lid attached to the can on two sides. This means I have to find something (preferably not a finger) to pry under the can to break whichever metal attachment is smallest to get food out! Completely unacceptable!

One hand to hold the grip, a second hand to turn the crank, and a third hand to hold the can. This is because the cutting wheel will walk over the rim of the can allowing the can to drop away from the can opener. This might be annoying if you are opening a can of something you can pour out of the can easily, but if you are opening something like chilled cranberry sauce or refried beans, which requires removing both ends of the can and allowing the contents to slide out in a cylindrical shape, this can opener is going to dump the can into the bowl, pot, or whatever food dish you are working over. In a restaurant, that means you dispose of the contaminated pot full of food and start over. So, unless you have three hands, or desire a can opener that requires two people to use, then this particular piece of equipment is not for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its truly a workable piece of tool","review":"Its everything the other reviews say it is.

After I pushed the order button, I saw the review about the Amazon can opener being made in China, not the USA. A real Swing Away is made in St. Louis, not China. Sure enough, my daughter just received hers and it is stamped China. If I had known this was not a real Swing Away I would not have ordered it. I feel the information online is very misleading.

I just received a new one to replace one I put at a seasonal residence and was shocked to find that the handle covers are no longer cushioned rubber, they are hard plastic. They hurt. There is not much a can opener has to get right, but on the list are: open cans, and don't hurt. Do not waste your money. There are far better options. Companies may decide to manufacture overseas but, as is too often the case, design is compromised and there is simply no reason to purchase a product at this low price point with the vastly superior items available in the same ranger that are both effective AND properly designed to avoid pain-AND made in the USA.

I grew up during the 1950s and '60s and dearly loved, (and still do,) the horror, sci. fi. and fantasy films of that period. This book touches on the sci. fi. films I remember very well and not so well. While I didn't always agree with the author, (I remember he didn't have many good things to say about \\"Voyage to the Bottom of the Sea,\\" the favorite sci. fi. film of my childhood,) I still greatly enjoyed the book nonetheless. Sometimes I would pass up films I had little interest in, then I would go back and read them when I completed the book. This book is over a thousand pages and I was reading it for most of the summer.

Your book is the ultimate How-To, taking the murkiness out of the process and creating a beautifully clear roadmap.When I get writer's block, though, is the time you're with me the most. I consult your book and, lo and behold, the block came from veering off-track. Your book sets me back where I should be.Thank you, thank you..."},{"rating":"1","title":"OUTDATED","review":"Seger's \\"how to\\" book might have been okay for the scripts of twenty years ago (when it was originally published) but it offers no practical advice for today's modern screenwriter.

I consider myself pretty widely-read in the field of health and beauty, so I was interested to read this book, \\"Total Rejuvenation: From Skincare to Scalpel\\". It seems to be self-published, by one of those printers you pay to print whatever you write. I didn't know that Amazon stocks self-published books. This book reads more like an extended brochure. I guess it would be useful if you're already one of Dr. Cohen's patients or planning to become one.

Their deconstruction of familiar tunes and their own compositions (three by bassist Anderson, two by drummer King, and one by pianist Iverson) are energetic and often noisy. Each musician is a percussionist, each a melody maker. The scratchy, nervous music may be jarring to many, but others may appreciate the cleverness, humor, and audacity. The lyricism between the discord, as with track 5, Giant, arises as a fresh breeze. The well-matched team of musicians create a fresh, bright and challenging sound. The problem is that repeated listening tarnishes that brilliance. The musical approach soon seems to be only a gimmick."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love all new tools","review":"All new tools are great, but this tool is just good to look at!

I own several PC tools and you will never go wrong! This is an incredible value if you do a lot of finish work. The compressor probably isn't that good for other types of use, though. For another $100 you can add a brad nailer, too, which adds a lot of flexibility. I do think PC should give me a discount since I had to live with my BAMMER for the last several years, although it too is good for limited use.

It has been 8 1/2 years since this book came out and i just read the series again (i cant stop myself), I just wanted people to know that there are people like me out there waiting over 8 years for his next book in the series.

The author, of course, does not make any mention of the internet which is the vehicle through which most of us play poker nowadays. He also could not have foreseen the extraordinary success that amateurs have had against professionals which is why he stated that amateurs usually lose their money at the World Series of Poker. In the last two years Greg Reimer and Chris Moneymaker thoroughly disproved such a notion. Yet the author should not be blamed for historical eventualities he could not anticipate. He has written a highly functional and readable guide for the weekly, or Thursday night, poker game. It's ideal for beginners as his explanations of the game (and its many variations) are clear and concise. His knowledge of strategy and tactics is notable. A big plus at the end is the annotated bibliography which I read a couple of times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thursday-Night Poker: How to Understand, Enjoy-And Win","review":"I don't advocate this book.

However, tough players will destroy players that play in a manner that the text advises."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent book -- well researched","review":"I echo what other reviewers have written: This book is better for the average home game where the stakes are low and play is loose. At the same time, the average home player may find the mathematical detail and the discussions of expected values difficult to follow. That doesn't negate their value, however, and I find that the academic approach Steiner uses is great (what other poker book has footnotes?). In particular, his discussions of the more popular games -- draw, 7-card stud, 7-card hi-lo, hold 'em (texas and omaha), etc. -- are valuable. Even if you have to reread some of the sections to fully comprehend them, it's an excellent foundational treatise on poker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Machine shuts down after a couple of minutes","review":"I was very dissatisfied with this product.

Batteries Plus then rebuilt one of them for about $30, and that lasted about 3 years, but they messed up the case doing it.

This is unfortunate, because Janequin was one of the strangest and most interesting composers of pre-Baroque music. Some of his songs--particularly the title track--are full of bizarre vocal effects which add both impressive virtuosity and humor to his compositions. This is a good selection of music performed by a good ensemble, although the whiny, nasal voice of countertenor Dominique Visse is ever-present."},{"rating":"1","title":"I actually like it a little","review":"I think its pretty cool especially considering kool keith's ouvre but i'm rating it one star casue of all the scandalous rumors about the record label."},{"rating":"1","title":"weird but not kool!","review":"when,first listening to parts of \\"The return of Dr octagon\\" i believed it was Keith's doing.....i might have heard parts of 3 or 4 tracks and thought \\"ants\\" and \\"trees\\" were not all that bad.but it isn't the Dr octagon sound,if you want something near the sound of the original Dr octagon album,order \\"Project polariod\\" and you will be satisfied.after a second listening,i decided to order this and was hoping for better tracks that made it something like 'Mr nogatco\\" but the overall feeling is disappointment!i ordered it,because i love to collect a lot of keith's stuff......i included, \\"The undertakers\\" and the \\"Collabs tape\\" and an other cd of keith,and i will enjoy these,when they arrive......the return of Dr octagon,however,might bore me very soon!let Dr octagon have a real return.....one with dignity!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad.

The levels are off and the beats sound like they are off a boy band record. The only track I liked was the one with Princess Superstar, and that's because she's a cute female MC.

Focusing is fine enough, though to nit-pick, not as smooth as it could be. I could view objects at the specified 20 feet, but I had to strain my eyes a bit for it. Still, they are 10x magnification, so chances are if you're getting them, you are planning on viewing things farther away than 20 feet. If you want to see something that close, consider this same binocular in an 8x32.Barska Atlantic 8x32 Waterproof BinocularThey are a little heavier than I had hoped, but that probably reflects their sturdiness. Getting a harness helps. It takes a bit to adjust them to your eyes, but once you do, they are great.Overall, I'm happy with this purchase, especially given the price.

First day of the safari I went to zoom in and realized that the center focus ring was sliding in and out, it should not do this, it should only turn. I was wondering why I was having so many issues as to where my wife was not, her's were working fine. I was screwed and my only way to focus was to push/pull the center focus ring.

The cam-lever is simple and works well, and isn't like one of those coffee table puzzles to re-thread if you accidently pull the strap all the way out. There's a pad behind the buckle to protect the surface it's up against, and there's velcro to hold the unused strap slack (althouh the velcro could be a little longer for when you have a lot of extra strap)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its about sound!!\`","review":"The auto set is GREAT! However, it is too bad they did not use a better radio or maybe just a better antenna! If you like tin you will love this radio. Granted its job is to wake you up, and you will move very quickly to shut this thing off. But I like to sit and listen to NPR for a few minutes before I go downstairs for coffee. I tried moving this thing around the room just to get away from the crackle, no luck. I even tried tuning in to a top 40 super station better, but we still had tin and a bit of a crackle. I live 10 miles from downtown Columbus Ohio so we are not exactly in the sticks, and the radio signals to all other radios in the house come in load and CLEAR. This radio does hold the distinction of being the first item I have ever returned to Amazon - maybe you will have better luck with it - but I doubt it. It sure would be nice if they could make an easy to set, good sounding, reasonably priced clock radio.

After a year or so, the line segments that make up the time started to burn out one at a time. Now so many of them are off, the time is completely unreadable.

For me it was a mistake. The Scott clock radio had tons of automated functions, I never had to fuss with it, and thought it was a super replacement. About a month after I purchased it, however, it dropped to the floor from my bureau. Ever since it has refused to light up. It's probably a good buy for someone with carpeting, but I'm glad I didn't throw out the Dream Machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I replaced a 15-year-old Sony Dream Machine with this and eventually went back to the 15-year-old radio! This one has terrible sound and terrible reception. Everything sounds like its being broadcast from inside a tin can - the FM stations sound like AM stations (muffled, staticky). You can tune in a radio station at night and set the alarm to wake you to that station - by the morning, the radio has lost the station and you wake to static. This has happened to me over and over with several different stations. The dual-alarm feature is nice, but there are other radios that have two alarms. Don't waste your money on this - it is really junky!"},{"rating":"1","title":"good until it died","review":"This was a good alarm clock until it suddenly died around a year from when I bought it--they do have a limited one year warranty, but I'm having a problem finding my receipt, oh well!

The memory chip inside this clock was programmed prior to 2006 when the rules for Daylight Savings Time changed. Therefore it will change to Daylight time one hour later in the spring and one hour earlier in the fall than the rest of the country. I know this because I have this clock and I purchased this new one thinking it was updated. Its Not.This is really unfortunate because otherwise it works great and the included battery inside for power failures has lasted at least 6 years. If you don't mind the hassle of having to work around the wrong automatic daylight savings time change (you have to know when to make the switch) this is the clock for you (and me too if they ever update it)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this unit","review":"I plugged in the unit and the radio is unusable.

I called Scott's 800 number and they said they are aware of the problem with their remaining stock and to NOT SEND IT IN to them since they would just send me another buzzing unit.ps - the unit does change automatically for daylight savings time apparently, but will now do so on the wrong dates since it is hardwired with the old change dates from years ago!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't count on good radio!","review":"The Auto time is great and I would recommend it if you use the beeper to wake you.

Times infinity.","review":"Oh, how I was looking forward to this book...waited and waited for it to come out in paperback...sat down to read it with eager anticipation...read the first paragraph and nearly coughed up a lung.The prose is dense, the language laughable, the characters many and boring, the plot trite. I know Carey was trying to take the notion of Fantasy and stand it on its head, but its only effect was that the loose change and used Kleenex fell out of Fantasy's pockets.Jacqueline Carey is miles better than this, worlds better...I'll still plow through the others because I'm a bit of a lit masochist, but I'll borrow them from the library.If you wanna give them a try, borrow them. Don't buy them. If you happen to like this sort of thing, you can always get the books later, but I cannot in good conscience recommend these books to anyone who has something better to do with their time. Too much good stuff out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Exploration","review":"This book will remind you of other epic fantasy novels - The Lord of the Rings, Dragonlance, etc. I believe that's intentional.Ms. Carey takes the framework of these epics and turns it on it's head: most of the action we see from the viewpoint of minions of the \\"evil\\" Lord Satoris, particularly his general, Tanaros. But are they really evil? This book sheds some light on the shades of grey that are usually missing from such epics.Oh, and something purely informative - this does not contain sex, unlike the Kushiel's series, whether that's to your taste or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing and Gloomy","review":"I have read this book, and the second in this two part series, Godslayer. I have read all but one of Carey's books, and I can't believe she wrote this. Other reviewers point out the flaws in her writing, and they are correct. Every fanstasy book has someone complaining that it is a rip off from Lord of the Rings, so take that with a grain of salt. The practice has become trite and standard fallback for people lacking in imagination, and who want to appear knowledgeable. What no one else has mentioned, and to my mind, is the biggest fault in the story, is how depressing, gloomy and hopeless it is. This mood prevails from the very begining and continues right to the bitter end, in Godslayer. If you are the kind of person who enjoys a happy ending, and I am refering to Godslayer in particular, don't pick up this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredible Disappointment","review":"I can't believe from reading this book that it is the same author. The book is so poorly written it is mind boggling. Only love of the Kushiel's series caused me to continue to plow through the bad prose, the Tolkienesque plot (I am sure there are a FEW original ideas left in the world that Carey did not have to do this cheap knockoff plot), and the unappealing characters. Normally, once I start reading a writer's work, I am committed. However, I think I will stop here with Carey's works. Maybe I will try the next series. This was such a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"I really tried to read it...","review":"I am a huge fan of Carey's Kushiel series so I was more than excited when I picked up Banewreaker. I even launched into several small \\"Why Jacqueline Carey is great\\" speeches to friends and family before reading the book. I enjoyed giving the speeches and I am glad to discover that, even after reading this book, I still enjoy Jacquline Carey. If you are looking for a great novel, pick up 'Kushiel's Dart' and leave this one alone.There is just too much, too much happening here for belief. The previous reviews I've read have mentioned how much these books resemble Tolkien and yes, I definitely agree... but there's more. There are no characters to identify with in this book. The plot is predictable and had too much long winded prose. I was really sad to realize about half way through that I was actually bored and didn't care what happened in the rest of the book.So, to sum: Kushiel series, yes. Sundering series, no."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I suppose what makes Banewreaker so completely disappointing is that Jacqueline Carey's other books were so wonderful. I can't understand how someone who gave us both the rich characterizations and the rich mythology of the Kushiel books could write something so lacking in depth. And given the strong women in her early books, I find Cerelinde a complete whimp who can't seem to do anything more then complain. In all honesty, I found I couldn't even finish the book, and I will definitely pass on the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Ahead and Read It","review":"Okay, so it's no \\"Kushiel.\\" I was very wary of reading this book after reading the reviews, but now that I've finished it, I'm glad I bought the book. Yes, there are similarities to Tolkien and Eddings but in the realm of fantasy, is that so rare? Admittedly, \\"Banewreaker\\" doesn't have the intensity or the complexity of the Kushiel Legacy, but that doesn't make it garbage. If you start reading this book with an open mind--or just don't expect it to be like Carey's previous work--you should enjoy the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just couldn't get into it.","review":"I've read every other series put out by her but this one I just couldn't get into.

It just started to get good when it was over. The story telling is faboo as always, but so far not as compelling as Kushiel's. Hang in there readers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Man, what a crappy book!","review":"What happened to Jacqueline Carey? I didn't like her much when I first started reading the Kushiel trilogy, but I was persuaded by my wife to give the second and third book a try, and I have to admit to being mildly won over. But having got this for her as a birthday present, even she didn't want to finish it. What happened?Perhaps the only character Carey can really write is Phaedre, and maybe it's because she is in her own image. This attempt at standard fantasy, even with the take on evil, is boring and flat, the characters dull or annoying, and it has the distinct feel of a retread. It is certainly derivative, as other reviewers have noted.I guess I'm a tough critic. I haven't really read much in this genre that I've liked for a while, but I think that's George R. R. Martin's fault for taking so long to come out with the next one.My advice--read the Kushiel trilogy, but get them from the library in case they offend you. Avoid this one.Joe"},{"rating":"2","title":"Same old fantasy plot, totally different","review":"If you look just at the actions occurring in this book, it does look like many, many other fantasy books. Heroic quests, wars between good and evil, wise old dragons, magical artifacts. I described it to a friend as \\"the Belgariad told from the other side.\\" But that's not really the point. It isn't really good vs. evil. Most of the characters think it is, and that's what the \\"good\\" side wants them to think. The only ones who really see that there is no good to come of either side winning are the \\"evil\\" ones. As a story about characters, rather than events, I think it's a great success. I look forward to Carey's conclusion to this story with no easy answers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I enjoyed the Kushiel series. It was fun and sexy. This is a bad Tolkein rip-off written by an angsty, emo Goth. Good grief, my 7th grade D&D; group came up with better plot-lines than this. Carey finds every cliche possible in Tolkienesque fantasy and uses them without mercy. Her characters are wooden. The writing style is unpolished. Even the NAMES are cliched. \\"Rivenlost?\\"\\"Cerelinde?\\" \\"Tanaros?\\"The Kushiel series was fun to read. This is severely disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"No, It's not Kushiel. Get over it.","review":"But I didn't expect it to be. Banewreaker held my attention to the last page and I am looking forward to the next installment. The story was solid, and I had sympathy for the characters. All of them which is hard for someone to do. I admit I was expecting more of the erotic aspect of Kushiel but that wasn't the story Carey was telling here. If you are expecting that, get over it. This is a good, fast-paced and completely different story from any other I have read recently (and I have read a lot of books) and Carey did an excellent job telling it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh - this book qualifies as a good spider killer","review":"I just had to get in here to try to lower the stars.

I know the silmarillion isnt as widely-read as the lord of the rings series, but come on! even the gods names are so alike! stick to kushiel......they are wonderful, inventive, gorgeous imagery.......get back to work on that series instead. there are enough bad ripoffs of tolkein out there already.

Well dude that sucks but I suggest you get over it, and not mope around like a douche bag for over 1000 years. I mean seriously, 1000 years?

Even with the missing material this is a very short book at only 138 pages (without the end matter and notes) in a small format of 8\\" x 5\\". My negative review is not a reflection on the author and the quality of his research and writing, but instead on the printer who made such a glaring error that went to market unnoticed.

I did not know that Syria and Egypt welcomed in the fleeing Nazis at the end of the war. If one Jew reads this book and is converted then the book will be worth it weight in gold. The part on the Isaiah prohecy that a virgin shall conceive and the author's expanation that in the Greek translation of scripture the word used is definately \\"virgin\\" further supports that Jesus was the Messiah.

I've only read One for the Money and it was quite a bit better than this book.I listened to the audio version of this book and the narrator was not good.

And the way the narrator tried to do an accent for Kurt, but then kept forgetting to keep up with it - so sometimes Kurt's dialogue had a really bad accent and other times not.I don't mind stories where the main characters start off hating each other and then fall in love by the end.. but seriously - these characters had like one chapter of hating each other and then were in love like 5 minutes later.

The Bambi Molesters remind me of someone, anyone that would be ultimately appealing to Quentin Tarrantino and used in one or ten of his films. More than simply background music, \\"Sonic Bullets\\" grabs your attention and takes you on a sweet ride. If you like The Ventures, the Bambi Molesters are an updated version.

There are no grips of any kind on the bottom so its straight, smooth plastic on porcelain which presents a severe danger to any child trying to use it. The flexibility is great for travel but it gives under my son's weight before he even hit thirty pounds and that freaked him out so bad he started yelling, 'no, no, no!' It was ridiculous.

It also slides around and doesn't fit oblong seats at all. If you move it towards the front like I saw some reviews suggested, your child will wet their pants because it puts them to close to the rim of the toliet.

It works just find for her weight. It is very important that you place the seat on the front of the toilet, there is a little lip on the seat that secures it in place. My child wiggles around on it quite a bit and we have had no problems so far. I can see how a real mover might dislodge it and land in the toilet. But really how often are you going to leave your child in a public bathroom all by themselves that you wouldn't be there to tell them to knock it off and sit still? I would not recomend this seat as an every day potty seat for home. For travel and outings it works great. Since it is hard plastic and not padded I've noticed my little ones cheeks turning a bit red from prolonged sitting on it. I'd much prefer a padded seat for those long potty training sessions.

We bought the Primo seat after we read the reviews and have used it constantly for the last month. I would give it 5 stars. Not only is it sturdy but it stays in place. The seams are not flat like this seat with big bird so be careful if you like to slide your child's bottom all over it but I feel there is no real threat using the primo.

As it is, this is the best CD I have heard in a long time: poetic and intelligent lyrics, understated and subtle guitar (with occasional bursts of axe victim pyrotechnics), interesting arrangements (both conventional and unconventional) and strong melodies peppered throughout.

Perhaps Pegasus is really parrot Polly that repeats ad nauseum the same old musical formulas to the devote. If anybody digs through the 2 CD set expecting to find the new bold approach, they may as well keep digging to China -- at least they may find some new music there.

A DEFINITE MUST HAVE for residents both new and old!!!!5 stars doesn't do this book justice. I'd give it 10."},{"rating":"2","title":"thorough but lacking","review":"The NFT is full of useful maps and some useful info. But I am dissapointed by the icons used to show location on the maps. It is sometimes difficult to figure out where things are based on the icons because they are not numbered and there are often 15 coffee shops on one map. Also, some of the useful info that is included is not so useful. I called the five cab services reccommended for airport rides and all of them were outrageously priced, and one of them was a restaurant, so I ended up finding a cab with my own research. I am also dissappointed by the fact that it lists all the Dunkin Donuts and McDonalds but leaves off some of the cities best independent stores, which I would think would be what Not-For-Tourists guide would be focused on. It's good to have, but not extensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed--it's old!","review":"What a disappointment!

But the battery power on this thing is amazing usually I have to change the batteries evey other day but this went a week and a half without needing anything new! The anti-skip kicks too. My little cousin listened to it and dropped it repeatidly but it didn't miss a beat and it came back to me untarnished. It also comes with a car kit so you don't have to waste your batteries on those long drives which I appreciate very much. The hold button was new to me but it is so cool. I was on the bus a while ago and some annoying kid kept pressing buttons and he was so ticked that he couldn't do anything to it! I would reccomend this player to anyone who likes to listen to music everywhere all the time in any conditions! Oh yeah the price is awesome too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Shepard2000","review":"Nice sound, changed headphones for upgraded sound. Eates up battery time when using the anti-skip function and other accouterments. Make sure player is off anti-skip function when you can get away with it; otherwise look you 6 hrs of play otherwise 8 hrs max. Resists almost no bumps w./ out anti-skip; resists most w./ anti-skip.

Auto off nice, remember to hit stop forget pausebut a battery charger like a computer would be nicer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead after 1 month","review":"I bought this CD player for my daughter's birthday, and, only 4 weeks later, it's completely dead.

Every aspect of it was great, I like the look and the anti-skip. Then, on the second trip I took it on, I put in a new CD, and it didn't play. I figured it was the batteries, so I put in brand new batteries, and it still didn't work. Then, I tried to switch CDs, but it made no difference. Now, all the thing does is spin the CD for about 3 seconds, then say there is no disc. I think there is a problem with the laser, but I barely used the unit. I think that now on, I will get a personal CD player from a company that I know has a great reputation like Sony or Panasonic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad shipment?","review":"I bought it in early September. The anti-shock mechanism did not work properly, gave static most of the time. I exchanged it. The new one seemed to work well.

Seems like some recent buyers have really bad reviews, so I wonder if there's a bad batch out there. My player works fine, although the sound usint the car attachment is not the best (I have a good Blaupunkt cassette player and decent speakers). It does eat batteries awfully fast, but that's not a problem because I pretty much exclusively use it in the car.My advice--wait and see if more recent buyers are giving better reviews, or purchase a different model."},{"rating":"1","title":"mine didnt work at all","review":"i just got mine today and it didnt work. it played the first part of the first song only on each cd i put in it. it couldnt play any other tracks. i called the factory and they said it had a bad laser. so watch out for bunk players from koss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Completely lost until I read these reviews....","review":"We watched this movie and assumed there were two couples.....??????? until i read the reviews....even though we kept watching, we asked each other many times.....What in the world???? Actors were great, plot was okay, execution...not so great! will leave you scratching your head."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh this film.","review":"I always appreciate inventive filmmaking but sometimes things just don't work out. The script was written without dialogue. The actors developed all the dialogue with the directors during rehearsals. Now that is not something you can say about most films. And it fits with the whole theme of the film. But sadly it just does not work here. I am a huge fan of JGL but his character (and everyone else's) is just plain out flat. And don't even ask me what was going on with both plots. This is another interesting idea though. Have two plots going on at the same time. Showing how one choice can change everything. Too bad its nothing worth watching. When I said don't ask me about the plot, it wasn't that it was over my head it was just boring and I kind of stopped paying attention.They had good intentions with this film it just failed to really amount to much. Still I applaud the cast and crew for trying something different."},{"rating":"2","title":"IMPATIENCE IN THE MEDIEVAL FUTURE","review":"Very good read, but not on a par with Christopher's TRIPODS series. Perhaps the sense of urgency is lost because so much time elapses in this book, instead of the plot pursuing its course remorselessly day after day. But John Christopher fans will want to complete this futuristic series set in a medieval England.Thirteen-year-old Luke Perry, the son of a commoner (promoted to Captain) hears a prophecy of the Seers (priests of the Spirits) that he will become the next Prince-in-Waiting for the city of Winchester. But treachery from enemies, friends and even his own family stalk him as he impatiently waits to come into his own. Besides, Luke is confused about the very existence of the Spirits; he wants to scoff and deny this national religion, but their prophecy suits his ambition perfectly. Does a young teenager possess the intelligence, wisdom and skill to defeat adult rivals for the throne?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A stirring fantasy novel based in post-apocolyptic England.","review":"The first book in the sword of the spirits trilogy, this novel portrays a young man, and his journey, which unexpectedly leads him to become a prince. This stunning novel introduces you to the second iron age, after an apocolypse. In the tradition of other writings by John Christopher, this story can be appreciated on many levels"},{"rating":"2","title":"Un Viaje al Pasado","review":"Esta es una de las autobiografias mas sorprendentes y al mismo tiempo encantadoras porque describe la historia de amor de sus papas como muy linda.

One of the problems that I found with this book is that is not for a beginning DBA. There are many places in this text where the author makes assumptions that you the reader know what is going on. The other issue is that they try to cover trouble shooting on mutiple platforms and with many different oracle products. If I were the author I would have picked one platform and one product to focus on. Not really bad book, but it is a bit vague and does require an experienced DBA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totaly Useless","review":"Hoping to gain additional skills to deal with complexity of Oracle8 databases. Well, this book is a collections of bits of information from Oracle Support database that can be found on the Support WebSite. Most of scripts that are provided with this book are outdated, most go back to 1993-96 v6 and v7 of Oracle. It seems that the book was done in a rush and has very little value to any Oracle DBA with 2+ years of experience. Would not recomment to waist your money on it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"I found this book to be good for someone who is not totally new to Oracle, however is not all that experienced either.

But the other tracks are an intriguing mix of folk, with some Celtic flavors, some middle eastern elements, and others. Plus superb musicianship, both singing and instrumental. Not just drums but violin, a flute like sound, tambourines (excuse my musical illiteracy). Destined to be one of my favorite CDs. Complex, heartfelt. Get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tis set is a Winner!","review":"I bought this set in Jan of 2007. It was in a showroom next to a Sony XBR3. Both had excellent PQ, but the MITS was a grand less.

The picture both SD and HD (through DISH network) has been outstanding as well as over the air(I get Chicago stations)signals in HD.

If you are looking for a book that will tell you the best places to stay with kids, or restaurants to go to, or activities to do, like I was, -- again don't waste your money on this book.Instead of giving the reader a list of best hotels, restaurants, etc. it has something good to say about every place. Every hotel reads like a page out of the hotel brochure. I was thouroughly disapointed. I can honestly say I did not learn one thing from this rather short and dry book.Also, watch some Travel channel specials.If you need a book, the best I have read so far has been\\"The Unofficial Guide to Las Vegas\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Lighthearted and Fun!","review":"I live in Phoenix and my wife and I found this book very handy on our last trip with \\"the kids\\" - we've got four of 'em. I like Lynn Goya's lighthearted writing style and she did a good job of finding some great spots in Vegas that our whole family enjoyed. The only drawback is that I felt she could have touched on some more getaway trips just outside the city limits, but hey, that's being too persnickity! Really, this is the ideal book if you want to take your family on a vacation to sin city."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sexy, but not as good as Baby I'm Yours.","review":"When I first read Baby I'm Yours, I had to try Susan Andersen's Be My Baby. The sexual characters are there, like in her first book, but it wasn't as fast paced. I enjoyed it's worth the read, as I'm sure all her books are."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fast paced, funny book!","review":"This was the first book of Susan Andersen's that I've ever read. I found it to be a fast-paced, funny book. I really liked the dialogue between the characters. The suspense was somewhat predictable and I had figured out everything before I was half way through the book. I will definitely read more of her books. I have searched several bookstores here in Houston, but they don't have any of her earlier books. I can't wait for the next one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is the plot?","review":"Having read all of Susan Andersen's books, I was greatly disappointed in this one. Susan has written great romantic suspense in the past--Exposure, On Thin Ice, Present Danger. All are worth rereading. This one wasn't worth finishing. There is no suspense, no romance, just \\"cute\\" sexual byplay. Hot or not, it's not a book I'd recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not her best...","review":"I know that this author's romantic thrillers are weak in the thriller department, but this book was even worse than normal. The mystery plot was laughable. I also didn't find the hero, Beau, very appealing. He was always sloppy and unshaven and seemed like a slob. What Juliet would see in him was beyond me. And, once again, the author gave Beau a ridiculously exaggerated accent (at least he didn't say \\"cher\\" all the time!)Actually, all the main characters were two-dimensional caricatures. No depth to them at all. If you don't read this one, you aren't missing a thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT HER BEST!!","review":"I absolutly loved All Shook Up by Susan Andersen but this book doesn't even come close. Susan needs to stick to her local of Washington state and stay away from the South. The southern New Orleans dialect about drove me crazy, I could hardly understand what they were saying most of the time.Also, the story is really lame with the secondary characters, actually kind of stupid to think about it. I found myself skipping through alot of the book just to get back to the two main characters and their relationship.It's an okay read, but would recommend her other books over this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr.Good Old Boy Meets Ms. Straitlaced","review":"This book reminded me of so many others.

Just did not like book, characters, and what was that plot?"},{"rating":"1","title":"NO Romance","review":"Where do I start? The dialog was bad, the plot was lame and romance was non existant.A good book engages you so deeply that you feel all the emotions while reading.You live in the story... This book could not do it. Beau sounded like retarted and uneducated with limited thinking.I hate it when women literally \\"BEG\\" for sex....Here is a classy princess who all of sudden changes character 180 degree, throws her arms around Beau's neck, forces his face to her and begs himto have sex with her. I guess to some authors to be open minded means to have no self-respect or pride.And of course Beau wait all the to way to the end of the book to confess his love.. and he does it in a really cheesy way that make want to slap his face...It was my first and last book by this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing... boring...","review":"This is the second Susan Andersen book that I read. The first one, 'Baby, I'm yours' was great. I was looking forward to reading this one but what a disappointment. Beau is unprofessional and retarded.

These young men are very handsome, erotic, and innocent looking all at the same time. The images are not pornographic in any way, meaning no frontal nudity. They are images of very happy and smiling young men who love to act-out in front of the camera. These shots taken by this young good-looking photographer are of youths he discovered in clubs, on the streets, or at the beach. Horvath has a way of knowing when to snap a photo; when the lighting is perfect and the shadows cast the perfect mood. Most of these black & white and color shots of various sizes are taken outdoors.This is a collection of beautiful images from a new talented photographer that are very appealing. I look forward to Volume 2, and I know I will not be disappointed if it is anything like his first volume. Perfect!Joe Hanssen"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm glad I bought this used","review":"I was really dissappointed with this book. The cover page seemed to suggest it was about women who had been forced or tricked into prostitution. I found myself wondering how they felt when they found out they had been tricked. How did they end up getting out of this and putting their lives back together? These types of questions were never addressed. It was mostly dealing with the number of incidences that happen in varies countries. How the laws have changed over the years etc. It was more text book quality than I would have expected. Also, contrary to the title the vast majority of the women they mention in the book entered this life fully knowing what they were doing. Nothing was stolen from them, they gave it away.

It's some dumb metal head playing a riff, then playing it again in slow motion and not teaching you a single thing. The video quality is the worst I've ever seen on any video in my life and every segment begins with a huge line that rolls across the screen.

It's a silly story line about climbing to fame and fortune in the world of police detectives. It's not a becoming role for Barbara Stanwyck, and Sterling Hayden just stands there and looks his sexy, handsome self.

BE WARNED THIS ONE IS SUPER SLOW AND SUBTLE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly enjoyable.","review":"This is a collection of fictional short stories, published in the United Airlines \\"Hemispheres\\" magazine. What a wonderful series of stories, I really miss them.This is one of those books so enjoyable that it is difficult to put down. One struggles with the decision to read it all at one time, or stretch it out to enjoy it longer. I succumbed to reading it all at one time.Each story has an excellent surprise ending, leaving the reader guessing right up to the end.It has been a few years since I read it the first time, and plan to re-read it again in the near future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice change of pace from the modern","review":"Picked up this book from the library \\"Friends of the Library' section. aka for sale rack. I didn't know the age of the book but it is a short read, 190 pages. Realized after pulling up the title here on Amazon that it is from the Vietnam years, 1969 to be exact. The book starts slow but really puts the reader back into the late 60's with references to the war, teenagers called \\"swingers\\" and everyone smoking cigarettes even while pregnant.By the 5th chapter the reader is hooked and just like the two past reviewers state, this book is suspenseful! I couldn't wait to see what would happen next since the author left a \\"wow\\" at the end of each chapter! It did end rather quickly, and the reader will know exactly how it will end but all the same a good blast from the past read that will stay on my \\"to keep\\" shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Casual Shoes","review":"These shoes are fantastic.

Very good value!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Criticism of Competition","review":"Though this book presents a few interesting ideas, most of them are confused by far-fetched metaphors and lack of substantial proof. Perelman is clearly interested in making the material accessible, but he does so by using so many different metaphors that it is difficult to figure out exactly what he is trying to say. Though his claims seem to be revolutionary, he touts nothing more than the modern liberal agenda. I happen to agree with his ideas, but the methods he uses to support them are weak and could afford to be better informed by classical theory. If you want a good criticism of modern competition, this is not it. This book ends up being a long justification of an unclear, poorly editted, and weak thesis."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book is nothing more than anecdotal nonsense!!!","review":"This book was easy to read and kept me reading for a reason: I was looking for the point!!!Dr. Perelman quotes so many other economists and non-economists without ever bringing anything new to the story. He even goes so far as to provide comparisons to the Biological Sciences, which cloud his point even more.In short, I could not recommend this book any less!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good data transfer Cable","review":"I purchased this cable for a nokia 6060 phone and it works perfect!, not trouble at all, I really recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"warm coffee not hot","review":"This is a very poorly designed coffee pot. The coffee is luke warm. The flavor is poor. Difficult to fill. The filter is sitting on top of the grounds so your coffee gets the left over sludge from all the other brews. If you like good coffee dont expect it from this pot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst coffeemaker ever","review":"You would think by now the Mr. Coffee folks would know how to make a coffee maker, but this one was apparently designed by people who have never brewed a cup of coffee in their lives.If the carafe isn't in just the right position, you wake up to a puddle of coffee on yourr counter and floor. Unfortunately, I cannot tell what the right position is--it just overflows randomly.As if that wasn't bad enough, the clock display is right above the carafe. As the coffee brews, the steam infiltrates the clock and fills it full of condensation, making it very difficult to read. After a few months of this, the clock quits working altogether and you cannot set a delayed brew. You read correctly: this coffeemaker kills it's own clock!I will NEVER buy a Mr. Coffee product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"We've had this coffee maker for about 6-7 months now.1) Where does all the water go?a) It all steams out the back. Therefore, you have to put in more water than what you want to end up with in your finished pot.b) It leaks out the hole in the back of the coffee maker leaving a constant (but small) puddle of water contstantly on the counter. The puddle of water is not large enough to drip over the counter edge, but it is irritating.2) Why does the coffee taste not only bitter but also with plastic overtones?a) Ok, I don't do the vinegar clean every 2 weeks, but I do it at least once a month. That should be enough for only having 1 pot of coffee a day, right?b) The filter basket and lid on the pot are both plastic and I sense that I can taste them in my coffee!Good features:1) The 5 bell alarm letting you know when the coffee is done.2) I like the looks of the coffee maker.3) Not a 3 minute pot of coffee, but brews in a reasonable amount of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit after 11 months","review":"We purchased this coffee pot to upgrade our old Mr. Coffee coffee maker which is still working after 20 years. Well, needless to say, this machine is now kaput (after 11 months) and we will be returning to our old 20-year-old Made in the USA machine.We noticed that this machine was slowly put out drips of coffee at a time, so we cleaned the machine with a proper de-liming product as directed in the troubleshooting guide. After completing this process, this machine would no longer put out any drips of water. Tried two more times and finally stopped when the machine started spewing water everywhere.FYI, after carefully researching, I will next be upgrading to a Bunn BX-B or Melitta coffee makers as they are made in the USA. For now, it will be a relief to return to my 20-yr.-old Mr. Coffee which is still going strong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Coffee maker","review":"I had similar bad experiences with the coffee maker, FTX41,- The coffee is cold after it is first brewed- No longer brews the full pot, only 4 of the 12 cups will brew.- The lid of the carafe always comes off.- Small leak around the base.So I thought that I would voice my displeasure via the Mr. Coffee website. That also wasn't a pleasant experience, apparently \\";\\" is a special character and the system wouldn't take my comments. So I called in the 800 number. After listening to my issues, the customer service rep was oblivious to my concerns. She said that they would send me a return for the product and after they received the old one she would send me a new coffee maker. When I told her that I didn't want a replacement, she said thank you and hung up. With this kind of quality and service, I will not only buy another Mr. Coffee product, but I won't buy a SunBeam product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit after 18 months","review":"I purchased this model after my old Mr Coffee coffee maker died after _12_years_ of service, and I was satisfied with this coffee maker while it worked. The unit never leaked, but the carafe occasionally did drip on the counter while pouring.After 18 months it just quit brewing (clock/timer still worked) and the hot plate wouldn't heat. The machine was disassembled and I noticed two blown (leaking) capacitors on the control board. Replacing the bad caps didn't help so it must be the heating element/thermostat/thermal fuse that is bad, but I'm not attempting any more repairs.The 18 month life-cycle is simply unacceptable. I'll _never_ buy another Mr Coffee product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow and messy. The worst machine out there.","review":"To be fair this is only the 4th coffee maker I have ever owned but this is definitely a slow poke. I bought the red model for the look. Aside from the adjustable warmer this machine is worthless. The water must be filled very slowly or it will spill out all over. The coffee filters will fold over on themselves and coffee grounds will flow out into the pot. This also causes the auto stop to clog and coffee will continue to pour out after the pot is removed.Most importantly of all, this coffee maker is unbelievably slooooow. People are not exaggerating when they say this thing is slow. It takes about 20 minutes to brew 12 cups on mine. More than once I have poured a cup and left for work with the thing still brewing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks like a sieve...","review":"After past experiences with Mr. Coffee products, I told myself I would never purchase another.

BEWARE!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"We feel this superb coffee maker has been unfairly criticized.","review":"In response to all the negative reviews, we rate this one as five star. We love the coffee it makes. The coffee maker heats the water to maximum standard, unlike many other coffee makers, most far more expensive, for the best coffee in your cup. Our unit did have a very small leak of water after brewing. We had allowed more than the 90 days go by, so no return to the store was possible. The repair station is no longer in our city, but 90 miles away, so no return there was practical. In response to our very slight problem, Mr. Coffee Customer Service promptly sent us a replacement unit, which works fine, with no water leakage whatsoever. We love this coffeemaker, and feel that we were treated royally by Mr. Coffee. Dr. & Mrs. DJN."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very slow brew time","review":"This coffee pot takes forever to brew. The first time I used it (to clean it) it took 30 minutes to run 12 cups through. I've used it 5 times since then and it's only gotten worse.I contacted Mr. Coffee customer service and they told me to run 4 cups of vinegar through the machine, even though it's brand new. They said that if that doesn't fix it, to return it to the store.Well, it didn't fix it so I'm returning it, but I'm not buying another to see if it was just a defective unit."},{"rating":"2","title":"I did not used yet.","review":"I still have packed, eventually I will use.

Morning came, brew lights indicated the coffee was brewed and yet the water was still in the reservoir and yet nothing brewed. Checked to see if everything was seated and tried to press for a manual brew, nope.Without boring you here, for one week, I tried manual and timed brews and it only brewed when it felt like it, which was once. When it would finally brew after pressing every button out of desperation; the heater plate barely had any heat so it wouldn't keep a pot warm.I've had good luck with Mr. Coffee until this turd.

When we remodeled our kitchen two years ago the coffee maker looked shabby. I decided to stick with the Mr Coffee brand because of its reliability. This model stinks. The steam fogs up the clock and I believe it is the reason why the cleaning feature has stopped working. This coffee pot looks worst than the one I owned for 12 years. The metal the has been hit by the steam has corroded. The metal where the coffee pot sits is also corroding away. After only 2 years I am looking to replace this machine.

I will be purchasing another Mr. Coffee."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for people who enjoy injury and hate coffee","review":"I was given this brand new machine by my dear, loving mother, who already had a coffee maker and knew I was a fan of coffee. After a stop by the store to drop some money on filters and very expensive coffee and raspberry flavoring, I brought it back to my own house excited for the brewing experience that would await me. But rather than the fun coffee party I had anticipated, the machine took all my ingredients and turned them into steam.3 tries and 8 cups of attempted coffee later it was still just producing steam and, on top of that, the entire machine, every inch of it, had turned into flesh-searing tower of magma. my entire kitchen was drenched in the condensation caused by the steam, my fingers were burned, my soul broken, and I sat alone in the floor of my kitchen, mourning my shattered dreams.I will never use a Mr. Coffee product again.My greatest regret right now is that Amazon made me give this product a whole star."},{"rating":"1","title":"An exercise in futility. I hate this POS.","review":"This is the third Mr. Coffee Maker I've had in the past 5 years with this design. I don't know why I've been stupid enough to buy more but never again.1. It overflows and makes a mess about once a month.2. The clock/circuit board mech stops working because of the steam.3. The release plug hole grommet thing in the back falls into the body and can't be retrieved.4. The drip spout activator pegs that hold it on apparently melted from the heat so the basket plug hole stays spring loaded shut unless you remove the spring, meaning you can't sneak a cup.I am taking a sledgehammer to this POS and I'll never buy anything from this company again, unless I can somehow manage to give it as a gift to my worse enemy.

We purchased another in 2009, the FTX41, and it just died after 15 months of service. The symptom was you hit the start button, it beeps 5 times, and does absolutely nothing.Troubleshooting guide at the MR Coffee site says \\"Call Service Center\\". No hope for it as it is 15 months old and out of warranty and non-repairable. A lot of money for a piece of JUNK!No more products from either MR Coffee or from Sunbeam for us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mr Coffee Fails to Deliver","review":"I bought this coffee maker while it was on sale because the features appealed to me.

The brew does not flow straight down from the basket into the pot (that is why you need the thing-a-majig to \\"deflect\\" the coffee into the pot), so....you need to order another basket which is about $9 plus $6 S&H. Not worth it!! Look at another one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away","review":"As with other reviews, water handling is a big problem. It is very hard to pour the water into the unit through a poorly placed water inlet. Then it frquntly leaks brewed coffee if the pot is not carefully placed. The worst aspect is the 'burp' of steam that happens when the reservoir is empty blows the feed tube off the heating element. The upshot is that the next time you make coffee all the water you pour into the reservoir goes directly onto the counter and floor. 'Customer Service' said that since I had removed the 4 screws in the bottom of the unit to try and replace the tube onto the heating element I voided my warranty, so I am SOL. I'll never buy another Mr. Coffee product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit working in less than 6 months!","review":"Ok so I have been through 2 of these machines.

It worked pretty well for the price, so I got one for my office last year. That's when I discovered that the carafe is a piece of junk. Maybe the pot that came with the one I bought for my home is better tempered glass, because despite occasional clunks against the sink while I'm half asleep rinsing out the pot, it's held up fine. The one for my office has been replaced SIX times. All it takes is a tap and the glass breaks. Last week, it wasn't even a tap - the coffee was made, we heard a SNAP sound and coffee started leaking out of the cracked pot. The carafes are $10.96 at Walmart, so besides the $40 for the coffeemaker, we've forked out an additional $66 plus tax for replacement pots. We're tossing this piece of junk and buying something with a thermal carafe that's not a Mr. Coffee brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply the Worst.","review":"In the annuls of coffeemakerdom this may go down as the worst machine ever made.

After much deliberation I decided to give Mr. Coffee a try. Let me just say that I woke up with a puddle of hot water and grounds all over my counter. The mechanism for pausing the brewing is so touchy that if it isn't just right it wll leak everywhere. I decided to give it another chance and made another pot of coffee (while standing there and making sure it didn't make the mess again). The coffee was full of grounds because the filter size is too small to hold the amount of coffee needed for a nice strong, full pot of coffee and the filter leaks into the filter basket.I returned this and bought a Cuisinart 1200. No comparison, spend a little extra now on your coffee maker and you'll save it in paper towels over the life of these two machines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this one.","review":"We like organic coffee and pay $14.00 for 12 oz.

It has some nice features, I like the window for the water, easy to see display, easy controls, temp control for coffee pot, no problems loading coffee or water. I am returning it today, becouse the coffee taste is inferior, compared to the Cuisinart that it replaced, I suspect it caused by cooler water through the grounds, the Cuisinart was hotter out of the brew.

There are some things I don't like and thus only 2 stars. (1) The coffee immediately after brewing is just warm despite cranking the heat to max. I frequently have to microwave a fresh cup. Give it 20 minutes and its hot however (2) The lid to the carafe does not attach securely. It frequently falls off when getting the last cup. Have to keep my thumb on it to fix that. (3) After the brew cycle is complete, the coffee maker boiler continues to cycle attempting to heat nonexistant water. I have to put up with nearly a half hour of periodic gurgling. It would seem not too hard to program the electronics to turn off the boiler until the brew switch is cycled again for goodness sake (4) The clock LCD contrast is now so low I can barely see the parts that are suppose to be black."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad !!!","review":"We bought one for the company, after a few months it started to leak, so we bought another one and after a few month the same leaking problem.

Let me count the ways...1. The carafe dribbles so much it's ridiculous. My infant son was drier.2. There seems to be no way to fill the reservoir without getting water all over the top of the machine.3. The filter that came with the machine was so finicky to get in just right - and caused any number of overflows - that we finally just threw it away.4. The clock is nearly impossible to read.5. To set up the coffee to brew later, you have to click the button once; to brew now, click twice. Ridiculously counter-intuitive.There are more, but I have apparently blocked them out to try to save my sanity....This is truly the worst coffee maker I have ever owned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't like at all!","review":"The can opener does not swing tight and once installed, kept swinging out instead of staying stowed.

Although it was intended to save space, it is kind of a clunky eyesore."},{"rating":"1","title":"P.A. Harris","review":"I had a Swing-Away can opener for many years and loved it as it was quick and effortless to use. Then had to get a replacement as the blade became dull.

Very disappointed with the new one and would not recommend this product to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked great, then went to pot.","review":"This worked perfectly when I first installed it.

I searched the web and found the Swing Away Wall Can Opener on Amazon. I was delighted that I could purchase the same product, except, it is nowhere near the quality of the original and wobbles and its cutting is hit and miss. I then discovered by old opener was MADE IN THE USA, and this new one is MADE IN CHINA. Be wary folks, the title of your purchase may be the same, but the production poor.So disappointed in my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Can Opener Ever","review":"I too grew up in the fifties with one of these on the kitchen wall and have owned one since then, for about ten years in the 90's. Stupidly I got rid of it and just recently decided I'd buy another. Well this one does not work on eight out of ten cans. It just won't grab on and cut, it'll cut an inch or so then let go, or maybe it will grab and cut for most of the way around the can and then refuse to cut the last quarter inch. Maybe mine is a lemon I don't know but I wish I had kept the one I owned in the 90's because this one is a piece of junk. It looks the same and mounts on the wall the same but it does not work well at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not your mother's can opener","review":"Mom had a Swing Away that worked well for decades. This is not the same quality at all. Since Swing Away started manufacturing them in China, the quality has gone downhill rapidly. Wish I had known that before I bought it.Got it about 9 months ago.

My family had one when we were growing up in the 1950s. When I bought my first house I bought one in the store.

Now I'm moving into a third house and... you guessed it... no store seems to carry ANY wall-mounted manual can opener. And this is southern California, a huge market where supposedly you can find anything for sale... somewhere.Yet when I Googled Swing A Way can opener it gave me the Amazon.com page where -- obviously -- it is still available. Sold! What could be better than buying a proven product from a proven store??PS: I'm guessing that stores don't stock this item because it never wears out.

Any March baby or lover of a quality aquamarine will love this pendant.

This special is really funny and I am delighted that MPI is releasing this gem. The special also stars Gale Gordon, Mary Wickes, Mary Jane Croft and Ed McMahon.

Furthermore, the book is full of wrong information. For example, it heralds carbohydrates as having more satiety than fats (just think about your ability to eat a plate of pasta versus your ability to eat a plate of fat). The book advocates many foods that have nothing to do with our \\"origins,\\" with a heavy emphasis on post-agricultural foods (grains, legumes, etc.). One of the recommended snacks is brown rice with honey (why not a plate of pasta covered in corn syrup?). First chapter wastes nearly 30 pages with layman's retelling of evolutionary theory. Last 1/5 of the book consists of non-unique recipes and sourcing. Lots of trees died in producing this drivel. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't take it far enough.","review":"If a reader has subsisted on packaged, processed, junk and fast food all their lives, this book may offer a good starting point towards eating a little more healthy. She simply doesn't take it far enough. Besides the annoying and endless references to the unproven theory of human evolution, in her meal ideas she offers corn products (really? hunters and gatherers had cornfields?), cooking spray (tell me that's better than olive oil?) and artificial sweeteners. When I got to that section I had to return the book to the library. Much better reads are 7 Principles of Fat Burning and Eat Right for your Blood Type. Maybe I'm missing something, but there were so many grains of salt I had to take with her advice that my blood pressure went up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really stone age","review":"This book is an absurd contradiction. The author correctly states that a truly healthy diet should follow the way man ate before civilization and society changed the way we eat. That is how we evolved. Then, she advocates whole grains which had no part in the foods available for consumption in those ages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new here","review":"It is obvious the author read S. Boyd Eaton and Dean Ornish, which are echoed quite heavily in this text. Suggest that you skip to the source and read the Paleolithic Prescription and, of course, any of Dean Ornish's book. There are some \\"good\\" fictional passages in here that are somewhat amusing, at least if you have done any research in this area."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stone Age Claptrap","review":"This book was so dry as to be useless to me. I found the comparison of modern humans to stone age ones ridiculous. The point was made that our ancestors had virtually no occurence of diabetes or cancer, or much fewer instances of these diseases. Of course not--they had a life span of about 30 years! No time to develop those diseases.The book continually made those inane comparisons while offering no practical tips on how to achieve the guidelines laid out in the book.Furthermore, a diet book with no recipes is useless.This book was a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tuareg","review":"One of Mark Harmon's very very early movies and one i'm sure he would like to forget.

The outlets of course are modern three prong and polarized .For my application(workbench outlets) I would like to have had a longer strip with fewer outlets but I can't hold that against this product.

I was screwing into oak."},{"rating":"1","title":"outlets set wrong?","review":"As someone else has previously commented. I bought this strip because most of the plugs I needed to plug in were of the rather large variety. I thought the gaps between the outlets would be sufficient to use every outlet. I opened the box and the first thing I noticed were the outlets, the were all set at 90 degrees from what I expected. So now, when I plug in one of my oversized plugs, it covers up 2 outlets, totally defeating the object of having spaces in between them. I now have a 12 outlet strip, with spaces in between and I can only use 6 or 7 of them. Totally pointless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this powerstrip","review":"Unlike many power strips that I've had around my computer, this one can actually use all of it's plugs because they are spaced out far enough to fit in the awkward sized ends.

One hand to hold the grip, a second hand to turn the crank, and a third hand to hold the can. This is because the cutting wheel will walk over the rim of the can allowing the can to drop away from the can opener. This might be annoying if you are opening a can of something you can pour out of the can easily, but if you are opening something like chilled cranberry sauce or refried beans, which requires removing both ends of the can and allowing the contents to slide out in a cylindrical shape, this can opener is going to dump the can into the bowl, pot, or whatever food dish you are working over.

Seems the original company may have changed hands a couple of times through the years, so those brands we could rely on, and were American made are no longer around. After spending quite a bit of time on the Internet searching, it appears that none of the other home can openers are made in the USA either. I called OXO and one other company as well, and the story was the same, all made in China.

You could say I'm just getting what I paid for, and I'd agree, except that the reason I bought it was because the 10-year old opener I bought it to replace is, apart from the handle grips, the very same model (and cost about a third the price!).

It gets rusty, it skips, it only opens half of the can, and it only take about a month or so for it to completely break.

Several reviews and other sites stated that the Swing-A-Way 709BK is an American made product. This is FALSE. I received it today and there's a big MADE IN CHINA stamped right on it. It feels flimsy, not much different than a $1.99 can opener from walmart. Way overpriced for the cheap made in china junk it is. I'd send it back if it wouldn't cost more in shipping than this is worth.

I ordered this one to replace it. What a piece of junk. It skips off the can leaving the lid firmly attached at 2 or 3 places. Efforts to go back over those spots result in a disfigured can and a still attached lid. I am then forced to pry the lid off with a screw driver leaving jagged shards of metal protruding from the edges of the can.

This could have easily been told in a small monograph or pamphlet. The fact that it is a hard cover book tells a lot about the mind set of Ike(as he is known).Please don't waste your time with this as I did. He trashes a lot of the sports organizers and fellow fishermen.

It provides a concise, focused review of format and subject matter for the three WEST-B sub exams.

Unfortunately, several of the practice test questions are poorly constructed, and there are a few questions that make no sense at all. The answer key is also not great... while \\"detailed\\" answers are provided, the rationale for some of the \\"correct\\" answers seemed faulty.

But the point of Haunted Castle is not plot twists and witty dialogue, but rather to provide an effective showcase for 3D special effects.Viewed through that lens, Haunted Castle is worth watching, although in a few more years the effects are likely to seem dated. It may be a little intense for small children, but it's certainly less violent than, say, Revenge of the Sith.To answer the other reader who wondered about the mysterious face and voice, the part of Johnny's mother is played by Kyoko Baertsoen, the vocalist for Lunascape.

I've well outgrown adolescence, but enjoyed it anyway. Most of the 3D features are good, sure a few are cheesy, and of course the storyline of bargaining or not w/ the devil is well known. I agree w/ one reviewer about the title being a bit misleading as there were minimal ghosts (his mother), several demons and tortured souls (graphic violence not suitable for young children IMHO). There are REAL albeit animated song performances by the mother and then later by her son's band which I really enjoyed.

While it does follow a neat chronology, the lack of a 'story arc' keeps this from being a documentary in the strict sense. We get to see Paul in acoustic concerts, and are allowed into his basement for recording sessions (fun and fascinating).However, there is nothing to reccomend this DVD to the non-fan. I loved it, loved watching Paul with fans and onstage. But the lack of a narrative, such as found on any VH1:Inside release or any of the classics like 'Dont Look Now' or even John Lennon's outtake film \\"Imagine,\\" makes this no more than a wet dream for his fans.That said, Westerberg is an amazing talent, and I highly suggest picking up 'Tim\\" by the Replacements as an intro full of hard, driving rock, or his solo debut, '14 Songs' for an introduction to his more sensitive side.

Instead, she's a pluck, independent lass who simply wants to live her life as she believes she has the right to. This independence gets her in trouble, but not annoyingly so.This is a true love story between two characters who don't WANT to love each other, but who can't help it because they've grown to love each other.Definitely worth reading.

The next time I tried it, I spent about twenty minutes trying to attach it to the hose, unsuccessfully. When I stopped swearing and examined it, I realized I had stripped the plastic threads or should I say plastic thread? The connector is so narrow, there's hardly anything to connect to. It's so fragile it might work if you connected it to a hose once and never removed it but forget multiple times. Now this junk is going in a landfill.

The gear drive didn't last and, to their credit, the manufacture promptly replaced it. However, the next one didn't last much longer than the first. The oscillating drum kept hanging up.

First off, is there ANY Palmer book where the woman isn't a virgin (or had her virginity taken from her by a bad guy)? These simpering virgins can never stand up for themselves & if they ever attempt to do so, it's with a completely lame comeback or attempt. Second, ALL of the leading men have some sort of social issue...surly, cranky, jerky doofuses - but somehow the virgin always falls for the jerk...no matter how poorly he talks to her or treats her. Can anyone say \\"Doormat\\"? ARGH! For once, I'd love to see Palmer try something new...use her writing skills to write a strong female lead and a non-jerk man. She's a good writer....it's just too bad it's often wasted on rehashing the same old thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Good, If Difficult, Combat Flight Simulator","review":"Although this game is kind of old, I believe that it is still a very good game worthy of getting for anything under $20.

The ancient female center is still present and wise, as Anne has opened to a few readers. I still dream of the ancient female center rising in the world to end the depradations of male-economic-plutocracy, still excising the traditional people and women as quietly as they can, all over the surface of dear old Gaia. Anne is an oracle. Give her to _all_ your children, esp. boys when they are still young enough to be reached before patriarchy's testosterone poisoning reaches them.

I highly recommend this book to every woman, and gently encourage her to share it's message with all girl children in her circle. Women will have to reclaim the power and beauty of our gift of being female. We should teach our daughters and nieces of the spirituality to be found in our bodies, and reclaim the magic that is menstruation, pregnancy and menopause.

The recent discovery of Balosky's \\"Small Wonders\\" quilts - more than 100 doll size quilts named after friends, family, and important figures in our world - has led many people to take a closer look at her work. At first, the quilts seduce you with color, but many of them are narrative, even confessional.

But it seemed that the content of the book did not relate to new ideas or techniques. The problem that I had with this book is the fact that it tried to take the important lessons of life and relate it to \\"quilting\\". I know many good self help books on getting over your own personal demons in general. But if you have personal obstacles such as insecurities and demons that prevent you from making a great quilt, then I think it would be best to take some quilting lessions or simply just take a break from quilting! All in all, this book did not help me."},{"rating":"2","title":"blah, my opinion is nnooottthing!","review":"This was a fun book to read---despite the fact that it seemed too long in places, filled with boring detail. It could have been a little shorter and more interesting if those details were cut, mainly for their unnecessary involvement. Other than that, I really enjoyed the characters that were introduced and developed throughout the book. Also, it was nice to read about the 'other side' of pirates; what they had to do to maintain the ships, among some other things you don't find in other stories. It was also left in such a cliffhanger that I cannot wait for the next book to come out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended!!!","review":"All I can say is I loved every single thing about this book.

I have listened to it for 20 some years now and I never tire of it.I have never heard a band that was so into the charts on an album. The trombones and saxes are tight. The trumpet section deserves special props for being able to go from subtle to explosive in nothing flat.The odd time signatures that Hank Levy uses on his masterful charts (Time for a Change, Decoupage, A Smith Named Greg) give this album extra flavor.Words can't really describe it, you just have to give it a listen for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality Big Band from a Lost Time Period","review":"This is record is a good catch in my opinion. I'm particularly fond of the Hank Levy charts (Time for a Change, & Decoupage). That man wrote odd-meter madness that manages to groove and sound natural anyway. \\"Send in the Clowns\\" is a delight for any fans of the art of lead trumpet. Yes, the record sounds dated. But we also all know and realize that big bands don't sound like this anymore, thus it has a significant place in history. The recording quality is weak for the time period, but the good music makes up for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful","review":"Susan Aglukark sings with a crystal clear voice full of soul.

I know Suzanne's program is garbage because I followed it in her first book and lost 22 pounds before eventually gaining more than 30 back and having my cholesterol go from 214 to almost 300!! She is really dangerous with this non-medical advice that is designed to sell books because we all want to think there is some easy shortcut to eating all we want and still losing weight. Yea sure.

I, personally, found the Forward to be of more use. Food combining is eluded to, but in true Hollywood style, is so perverted (in the truest sense of the word), that it appears Susanne came up with the whole idea of food combining. Here's why I say what I do: My health history is horrible. I learned all I could, before I dieted, so I wouldn't cause more problems. Susanne outlines the proper plan, yes, but proceeds to turn it inside-out. BASIC AND PROPER FOOD COMBINING is required to build a FIRM FOUNDATION, from where a person can reestablish their Endocrine System (the recipes combine nothing that should be combined)!

It makes no reference to the spherical and cylindrical coordinate systems, which you need in order to save yourself about 120 steps for certain problems.

There are all these chemicals hidden beneath the protein that cytosport makes and its a shame that they do not care. While many say that there are these chemicals and stuff inside other food, such as fish, do we really think its ok to have it in this too? It is bad enough for us to be consuming from regular food, why add extra?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps you shouldn't buy this...","review":"Tastes great and certainly helps with working out.

Peanut Butter Chocolate. Overall this is a good flavor. I mix it with Chocolate Soy Milk and do everything I can to get rid of the chunks of powder.

It says \\"32g\\" on the front in 40pt font, and then beside that read bottom-to-top in 10pt light-grey font it says \\"per 2 scoops\\". 32g is better than average for a serving of protein powder, but very bad for 2 servings. You probably won't make the same mistake on a straight-text website as I made while in a rush to get out of a closing B&M; store, but still be warned.The taste of the product is average, perhaps on the 'choclatier' side but that doesn't really result in better taste. It also does not mix with water well and found I had to use about 33% more liquid to dilute an equal amount of powder to my other brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tastes decent, not the most expensive, but upsets my stomach","review":"This brand of powder has a lot of the qualities you'd want in a protein. However, there have been reports of heavy metal levels. This brand upsets my stomach and makes me feel nauseous. I found another brand that is cheaper per gram of protein, as good quality, mixes better, and doesn't hurt my stomach. It's the optimum nutrition chocolate flavor. I wish I could return these (I bought a few flavors being dumb)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much sugar and fat","review":"I'm not sure how the marketing department for Muscle Milk comes across with Lean Protein for this stuff, but it's loaded with fat and sugar...things you probably don't want to be ingesting if you're serious about working out.Stick to NATURE'S BEST, ISOPURE CHOC (LOW CARB) 3LB, it's a little more expensive, but you get more for your money and it's a hell of a lot better for you, and for Caesin theOptimum Nutrition 100% Casein Protein, Chocolate Supreme 2 Poundis the way to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Muscle Milk","review":"Would use ths seller again.

Especially if you decide to subscribe which you can cancel at any time and choose the frequency of the shipments whether its every month or once every 6 months.

The reality though, is that i don't care how nutritionally superior one product is to another, if the taste is not there you'll go a week before it starts making you gag and stop using it. MM tastes like a real shake, its low in sugar, has decent amount of protein and again tastes awesome!"},{"rating":"1","title":"good for you taste buds, bad for your heart","review":"I give it a 5 stars for the taste and a 1 star for the 8 grams of saturated fat. Unless you are young with a high metabolism or do lots of cardio, muscles milk will make you fatter and clog your arteries after many years of taking this product. Your longterm health is more important than building muscles now. if you take this 3 times a day, that is 24 grams of Saturated fat. Saturated fat raises your cholesterol and cholesterol clogs arteries which causes stroke and heart attacks. You might as well eat dominos pizza 3 times a day. Pizza's high in saturated fat and protein just like this powder. I recommend Optimum Nutrition 100% Whey Gold. It has 1/16th of the saturated fat. THe downside is it doesn't taste as good as Muscle Milk. M M tastes damn good. Optimum Nutrition has a cheaper price per serving. The choice is yours. If I were 18 again I would probably go with M M, but now I'm 33 and more mature so I worry about more than just getting big muscles."},{"rating":"1","title":"if you have a sensitivity to fake sugar: DO NOT BUY","review":"this stuff is disgusting. its like drinking pure splenda. gave me a headache and made me sick. awful awful awful. i dont even get it! why add fake sugar? i stopped buying optimum nutrition because it was off the grocery discount, and id ont remember that having real sugar, definitely didnt have fake sugar, and tasted GREAT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Taste","review":"I've tried brands at Walmart (to save money) and the taste was terrible.

I expected to get a similar taste to the other mix, just with a few carbs which I did not mind. Not at all, the mix tastes very chemically and artificially sweet which Im not usually especially sensitive to. I mean I didn't expect it to taste exactly like fresh peach/mango but this is way off. Would not recommend & disappointed that despite the taste guarantee on the label I wont be able to return it through Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst.","review":"If you are a serious bodybuilder, or even just someone wanting to lose weight and eat healthy, there is no way you should be considering this protein powder.First of all, the front of the label is very misleading.

Unfortunately, it is more of a mass gainer than just lean protein, but, that is not why I am giving it two stars. I should have done my research before switching from my Syntha 6 and Optimum Nutrition Whey. The reason I am giving it two stars is the taste. The chocolate is terrible. I do have the banana Muscle Milk and it tastes pretty good even compared to my favorite, which is Syntha 6's banana. The banana would probably get 4 stars. The muscle milk does contain a whole assortment of vitamins, aminos, and healthy fats. Not as much protein per serving as Syntha 6 though. Overall, muscle milk is just not for me, perhaps the Light version of the banana would be more to my liking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for sugar fiends!","review":"I just bought muscle milk to help my mother who has cancer and needs to have protein to help herwith energy levels.....I tasted it first ----This drink is entirely too sweet!Who drinks anything this sweet?

It took some getting used to but after listening to the CD, I cannot get the songs out of my mind and I can't get the CD out of my car! It's a must for the road. The lyrics, the music, the tone is all different from song to song. Some songs are slow and thoughtful and other songs are hip and poppy and they make you want to bounce around. To be honest, I can't stop dancing in my car when I listen to \\"Ready to Go\\" or \\"Sieze the Moment\\" and I can't help but space out in my own little world and sing along to \\"Used Black Cars\\" or \\"Web of Roses\\".

My daughter will be 3 in July. She weighs 32 lbs. She has been very hesitant to sit on the big potty (we have a toddler potty at home)but was excited to see Dora on her potty seat. Used it maybe 3 times. The last time, we were at Walmart and she had to go potty so we ran into the bathroom with the potty seat, set it up and I placed her on it. It almost immediately caved in and dropped my daughter into the filthy public toilet, banging her ribs on the toilet on her way in. I am furious!! Not only was it completely unsanitary but now she will not go near a big potty at all.It seemed like a perfect solution: portable, cheap and sanitary, but ended up just being cheap and not worth the trauma to my daughter. Hope this saves someone else the disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't cover entire toilet seat, Weak, flimsy.","review":"I just bought the Dora folding potty seat today at Walmart. It doesn't cover the entire toilet seat. It starts at the front of the toilet, and doesn't go all the way to the back. The result is that there is no support in the back. My daughter is 3 yrs, 4 months, and this seat is much too weak for her. Any movement she makes causes the potty seat to sink in the back. I'm afraid that if we use it, it will soon break and she'll fall in. She definitely can't sit back, or even sit straight up because it sinks so much. I'm returning it and I'm going to look for something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"literally better than nothing","review":"i suppose this seat is better than layering tons of toilet paper on a toilet bowl. this folding seat may be appealing to little ones because it comes decorated with familiar characters (e.g., sesame street, dora, etc). but there is nothing to hold it in place on a toilet seat. my twins can't relax enough to 'go' while sitting on it because the hinges are flimsy so the seat feels like it's about to give way under them. they're small (27lb) 2yos, so i can't imagine what would happen if they weighed more. save your money and get a more stable travel potty seat!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for travel, not for everyday use.","review":"I think this is a brilliant idea, but needs a little work.

They were both so excited to see the seats and to take them out and fold and unfold them. I sent one home with my niece and I kept one in my daughter's diaper bag. The next time we were in public, I was excited to pull out my toilet seat! That is, until I tried to set her up on it.. the \\"nonslip pads\\" did not work, the seat when sliding around and ended up in the toilet! We tried it again on the toilet at home with the same results! Arggg she won't even sit on it anymore! I called to ask my sister how she liked hers and she said that her daughter won't sit on it because it slides around too much and it scares her. After spending almost $30 on 2, I would say skip it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"exactly what i expected","review":"Its exactly what ii expected it to be a travel toddler seat cover.

I purchased this out of desperation on a road trip. In less than 24 hours my daughter (32lbs.) 2 years 4 months fell off it twice! Both times adults were right there and the last time I was actually holding her as it fell into the McDonald's toilet (yuck!)The fist time it actually folded and pinched her on the butt, breaking the skin. There is nothing to keep it in place except some rubber pads at the bottom. Granted she was doing number 2 and had to sit a while longer then I think most kids. But criky this should work at all times! The whole point to this is so I didn't have to squat in front of a public toilet while I waited for her to go...the best place for this is in the trash!"},{"rating":"1","title":"slips, no handles","review":"this seat slips all the time. also, there are no handles, so my daughter has a tendency to touch public toilets to balance herself.

Along with Bird and Nijinsky, Jaco helped fuel the 'great artist as madman' to the point of cliche. His life was marked by incredible highs and equally incredible lows. Saddly the marerial was recorded when Jaco was all but 'gone' and, should never have been released. Please pass on this and buy any of his incredible CDs with W.R. or Jonie Mitchell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reading Reading Vergil's Aeneid","review":"I am a student taking AP Latin: Vergil, as an independent study, and I have found this book to be very useful in its strong explication of the text and its focus on things that are not often noticed in criticism. The essays vary in quality, but they always provide a different perspective on such topics as Aeneas's relations with family and nation, the old question of whether Dido or Aeneas is really in the wrong, imagery, translations, and parallels with other ancient works. If you are a high school teacher looking for materials to use with a class, be aware that many of these essays use very modern critical approaches, and some of them are difficult to understand, but some would be fine for the average student. The book overall has a strong feminist slant. I thought it was really excellent, and I would recommend this thought-provoking book to any reader looking for modern scholarly interpretations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great good book","review":"Good book for Cowboy cooking.

Otherwise, the writing and plotting is painfully pedestrian, so don't get this book expecting any real reading pleasure."},{"rating":"1","title":"An amateurish production","review":"The DVD looks like something cobbled togeher by a committee of well-intended amateurs trying to save money on what they put together.

This production does not do it justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE Sports Nutrition Bible","review":"For those of you who are looking to push your health and sports performance to the extreme, this book stands alone as the best in its field.Dr. Michael Colgan is probably the most well-respected writer and researcher in sports nutrition today, and this book has become the \\"bible\\" of the sports nutrition industry. Some of today's most elite athletes, bodybuilders and celebrities have used this book's advice to help them achieve incredible gains in performance and physical appearance.You don't have to be an elite athlete or celebrity to benefit from this book though. It contains a wealth of information on nutrition, diet and how they affect your health. It covers practically every vitamin, mineral, amino acid, fad health food and sports supplement you can think of, and explains the benefit (or lack thereof) of each.While many clinical terms are used in the book, his advice is still understandable for the average person. A true classic of its time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book yet to detail the workings of the anabolic system","review":"This is the best book I have ever read for educating yourself on the bodies inner chemical workings for athletic purposes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most sane book on nutrition for athletes","review":"This is the most sane book on nutrition. There are no fad diets, and no crazy anecdotal recommendations, just scientifically based advice to enhance your athletic performance. If some supplement has marginal or unclear scientific evidence he points it out. If there are any concerns with a supplement he lists them. The correct level of supplementation is also defined according to scientific test results. Colgan is very forthright and his integrity comes through. I recommend and loan this book to all my athletic friends and they always have to buy a copy. In Optimum Sports Nutrition Colgan helps athletes seperate the truth from the anecdotal hype. I've read several of his other books and found them to be most helpful for anyone concerned with health and nutrition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Material, but;","review":"I have only read the first ten chapters so far, but have only had the book a week. I have found the information very enlightening. I am a natural body builder who has problems putting on weight and keeping my energy level up, this information has already been helpful. However, I do have one concern! I would like to know if Dr. Colgan has a vested interest in Twin Lab Products, or are they really as good as he make them sound in this book. He makes reference to them in almost every section I have read to this point. I am not being critical, but I would just like to know if these products worth my money. I already use products sold by Body Wise for my glycogen rehydration. Thank you in advance for your reply."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredibly thorough guide, with one caveat","review":"The information contained in this book is as astounding as it is fascinating. Everything you ever wanted to know about the relationship between diet and athletic performance is spelled out in detail. I've bought several sports nutrition books through Amazon.Com, read them all, but this is the one i continue to reference whenever a question arises.One caveat though. Michael Colgan seems to have a very close connection to TwinLab, whose products he (at least openly) endorses every chance he gets. The book is published by ARP, which is owned by Twinlab, as is the magazine AN Muscular Development in which Dr. Colgans brilliant articles appear every month."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read with a grain of salt","review":"While I was intially impressed with the book, it did gnaw on me why the book pushes TwinLab products throughout, and all other kinds of supplements. If you take all the supplements in the book your bill will be in the hundreds of dollars. Then after further research, I discovered TwinLab published and the book and the author gets paid by them to write on a monthly basis. Unfortunately that taints all the findings in the books, and explains why so many supplements are pushed. If Colgan was honest, he would have exposed his relation with the Lab upfront, which would have made me a lot less suspicious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent reference tool...although a little outdated","review":"This book serves as an excellent tool for anyone interested in learning more about nutrition, vitamins, supplements, and how they all fit together in the body. There is enough detail presented to gain a working knowledge of nutrition, but it isn't written on a physicians level, making it user friendly. I found this book very informative, better than most of the nutrition books I've read. The one down side is that it is a little out dated. Some of the information on supplement usage is outdated. Regardless, this is an excellent source of information for bodybuilders and other athletes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bites the Big One","review":"First of all, it is improper to put the letters Dr. before your name when you've already followed it with the letters Ph.D. It's either one or the other, not both. Obviously, Mike doesn't know this because he's so worried about everyone being assured of his education. Good luck in trying to find out what his PhD is in. It's conveniently omitted on all of his books. Now to the book...it's written as if the author has a high school education not a college education. It's full of poorly worded paragraphs, misspellings, and misinformation. Colgan is absolutely incorrect in some of his statements. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone unless they're up for a good laugh of someone who has obvious Napoleon syndrome."},{"rating":"1","title":"skip it","review":"I'm a huge smap fan and this is possibly one of their worst.

I don't know about others but I certainly find the jar extremely inconvenient. It's a rounded small jar with a small opening that makes it a task to get the creme out. What's more bizarre is that it comes with a plastic stick that one's supposed to use to scoop out the creme but who on earth has the patience to meddle with it?

I haven't had any breakouts since using this product.The glycolic acid concentration is very high so if you have never used this type of product before I strongly suggest you acclimate your skin by using Level I products for a few months, then move to Level II for a few months before using the Level III products as it will burn and possibly irrate your skin"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product and brand","review":"I started using this product after my dermatologist recommended it for help with some hormonal pigmentation, fine lines and acne (in my early 30s!).

My skin is clearer, tighter, and softer than before. I no longer have to deal with acne. I think my skin just glows with this product. I've been using it for several years now, and if not for the cost, would use it exclusively.

Some of the recipes are strange tasting such as the Spinach Quiche and the Tempeh Cabbage Casserole. I could barely eat either of these. I did love the Curried Saute. I also liked the Pasta Primavera. The hummus Dip was extremely salty (must be a misprint, 5 Tbsp of Tamari), could not eat it. Also, the Apple Loaf cake was really sweet, dense, and mushy (had to bake it forever) and very fattening. I have not tried all the recipes but it seems this book is too inconsistent. Another problem is, some of the ingredients are not easily found at your local grocery store. So you need to either order them online or schlepp to Whole Foods. In addition, these recipes have a lot of fat. Some recipes even have you deep fry in oil, which is very unhealthy. I think the Moosewood cookbooks are far better than this one. Sorry Morty. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"Pancakes were a flop - is the rest?","review":"I bought this cookbook in the airport. I liked how simple the recipes looked and thought I'd try it. I tried only one recipe so far, the Pancakes of While Wheat. It was a total flop. The pancake \\"batter\\" wasn't a batter at all, but a paste. I know what people will think - that I must have put too much of a dry ingredient in the recipe, but I swear I followed the recipe. Now I am worried that the whole book is a total scam. Is this book for real? Did anyone else have better luck with the pancake recipe? I am pretty skeptical of trying any of the other recipes now.

However this book did not impress me. There was hardly anything I chose to underline, and at times I felt the author went too far in interpreting the photographs. One such instance occurs when Cantu describes a child's eyes as sad and thinking about the difficult time ahead; for me, it was just pushing it too far to create symbolism and meaning where there is no place for it.It was an OK book, a simple read that you can finish in one night, but it failed to grasp me emotionally and intellectually.

Any book that starts out with a mention of Roland Barthes puts the reader on notice that the writer has something to prove. And when the word \\"lover\\" shows up on the first page, you know you are in trouble-- it's written by someone who has to prove modern academic and social \\"credentials,\\" whatever that means. Combine these two minor problems with the fact that the book has no apparent organization (based on a series of random selections of family pictures) and no historical structure, and you get the idea. There are some really great books about immigrant families in the Southwest, including Cajas de Cartón (okay, so it's California, mainly), The Rain God, and John Phillip Santos' book Things Left Unfinished at the Time of Creation.

He even succeed in grand poetry (Pale Fire), so one would think that his literal translation of Oneigin would be a welcome publication. It's not. First, Nabokov strips Onegin of all poetics, which he admits is his intent. He believes the poem is better understood from a transliteral (almost interlinear) reading than from a poetic reconstruction. This attempt may please, and I stress \\"may,\\" those who, unfamiliar with Russian, and who want such a bland diet of lackluster prose. But there are so many excellent translations of Onegin that are beautiful and captivating in themselves, I'm not sure there's much need for such a literal, word-for-word, transcription.

Star Samantha Morton was ill for much of the time, which accounts for the extensive use of voice-over narration.The action takes place in 19th century New Zealand where Maori (the indigenous people) and the colonial English are engaged in conflict around a river. Director Ward has tried to create an epic in the mold of Herzog's \\"river\\" films but his terrible script leaves the actors nothing to work with. A notorious flop in New Zealand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing and Funny","review":"The quirkyest most mellodic western music I've heard. Its for a western/comedy starring Henry Fonda.

But this is gay porn, which turns even the non-homophobic OFF. I painfully watched and hoped for a movie but there was little. Yes, I probably couldn't see past my phobia for phalics, but this review only serves to warn others. Not for the Will&Grace crowd either. Sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Believable acting with a story in a tailspin...","review":"I was surprised at the overall tone of sadness and depression in this movie. The actors, who very believably played struggling youths growing up in a porn/stripper world, were the highlight of this film. Maybe the script needs more credit for the intentional lack of flair and in the end is VERY believable.This is not a \\"feel good\\" movie, so don't expect a sense of happiness at the conclusion. After watching a convoluted movie like this and knowing these types of situations DO exist in real life, made me thankful my life is \\"simple\\" compared to this.This film won't win any Oscars, but it's worth the watch for it's raw production value...4 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just because it's a gay movie doesn't make it a good one!","review":"Almost boring, but a little moving at moments. Far, far from a good film. Chock full of typical gay coming of age movie cliches. The main character is good, but underwritten. And what's the deal with the female stripper scenes? I love female nudity when it's appropriate (Center of the World), but this was way out of place. Gratuitous. And no male nudity? It's a gay film featuring Gay \\"Porn Stars\\". Geez! The only enjoyable characters are the photographer and the secretary! They get about 5 mins of screen time. Skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont get your hopes high as this movie is not what it seems","review":"Having read a glowing review In Gay Times & Diva of the London Lesbian & Gay Film Festival 2001 I imported the DVD at great cost. The picture quality seems good and there is some good concepts explored in the movie but not developed further. Apart from Gurney the movie is not visually very appealing and leaves a taste of a low class and low budget film. Even more amazing is the fact that movie is about pornstar but there is hardly a spec of frontal nudity shown. For me the movie was disappointing and I doubt if it justifies repeat viewing. I expected better."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst film i ever saw","review":"i just recently got hooked up in purchasing film from the net and little did i realize that whats posted as a review of films being sold were nothing but deceit.(not for all)This particular film was over rated and so much was said to entice me to get one and view it. my experience?

Note: this is not pornography; it is a story that uses the gay porn industry as its backdrop. I was pleasantly surprised by the capable acting and the presence of a decent plot.

There's actually a good 60-minute story here inside an approx. 90 minute running time, so it's too bad the director didn't edit out all the boring parts and make what is now a 2 star movie into perhaps 3 stars. One entirely boring subpolot involves a girl's pregnancy and I can't for the life of me figure out why it's there. It's pointless and dull. There is some nice acting and some nice visuals of the porn star and the fluffer.

Unfortunately this is more to do with the programming of the game as opposed to the wheel itself due to the lack of controllable options in the game.

They are store close outs for a reason, nobody wanted to buy them in the first place.. She couldn't call the book \\"Dime Store Decorating\\" because she already has one called that.If you are looking for cheap ways to decorate your children's ever changing rooms, I suppose this book could be helpful there, or cheaply decorating for a children's party or a potluck at the VFW hall. There are a few ideas for cute cheap party decorating using items from dollar stores.I wish I had thought to return this book to Amazon, but since I didn't it will be donated to a local thrift store where someon can pay what it's actually worth. $1.00"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fabulously tacky and doubtful she'd even decorate like this","review":"The photos of the second hand store objects are disgusting dirty junk! She couldn't haul herself to a real flea mart? She must not truly go antiquing, and doesn't show an understanding of aesthetically pleasing vignettes. Most of the photos are really cheesy and cheap looking. Not to mention boring. How is photos of her family all lined up in rows a new decorating idea? This book is dated and frumpy but some of the ideas make no sense. It's as if she had a deadline and didn't know what she was doing so she thought of things to throw together at the last minute, that she took down as soon as she took the photos. There are no photos of her actual living room or bedroom, real rooms that people live in. Why is it cool to see a bunch of clocks on the wall all in a line?

I listen to it a lot. It has a good diverse pallet of songs but it is consistant enough that you can tell it is the same artist (not vocalists). If you like groups like Delerium you will really like The Dawnseeker. The tunes have a tantalizing intro and keep you hooked. Good buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If only it played","review":"I purchased this, hoping to get a copy of the music I liked. Well, the copy didn't work.

The music is compelling and motivational at times as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointingly boring","review":"I tried very hard to like this album because I like some of the artists involved, but the songs are too alike and, thus, the album is unfortunately quite boring. No song stands out for its musicality or its lyrics. The monotony is disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"ambient, lush and spellbinding","review":"After first hearing his music a year and a half ago, I had been fidgeting in my seat, anxiously awaiting this album. Now, I can proudly say that it was sooo incredibly worth the wait. From the first confident downbeat to the final ethereal chord, \\"The Dawnseeker\\" is captivating. It is even a bigger delight when you slap on the headphones and listen to the intricate layering and gorgeous orchestrations behind all those mesmerising voices. A fantastic first effort and am very excited to hear more from Sleepthief. Conjure One, Delerium, Balligomingo, and Enya fans will not be disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, this didn't work.","review":"I love almost all of the artists involved in this project. HOWEVER, this sounded so over produced it utterly lacked the creativity that these musicians and vocalist have brought to all their earlier work. It is OK but seems very mainstream targeted. I found myself bored with each track before it even got halfway through. I will try listening again, I really wanted to be knocked out by this but was underwhelmed. If you liked this, and are curious to hear something similar but more experimental try some of the other work such as Mind Fruit or Delirium's earlier stuff, and you may see what I mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"this is what i have been looking for","review":"It has been a long time since I have been excited about music. I found this album by listening to a conjure one radio station on pandora. Over the course of a week, I was introduced to Sleepthief, Blue Stone, OceanLab, Ulrich Schnouss, and Tracey Thorn (immediately recognized her from Everything but the Girl). Finding all of this in one week was more or less overload.Dawnseeker has almost overnight jumped to my favorite album. Its too early to know if it will hold that claim forever, but I am excited by the possibility. This is the first actual CD I have purchased in years... just buying the MP3's wasn't enough.If you have not used Pandora before, I highly recommend it. I would have never found Sleepthief without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest","review":"This book was excellent, on the topic of family, friends and lovers. I loved it and had a hard time sleeping!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read for anyone interested in Classical Tibetan.","review":"It's not a typical grammar text. It won't give you prescriptive rules and exercises and it doesn't try to force Tibetan into procrustean bed of grammatical categories of European languages. Instead it aims at helping the reader to develop an intuition about the language and is very successful at that. Abundant examples with clear and thorough explanations lead you through all aspects of the Classical Tibetan from alphabet to poetry. This book will definitely help you crystallize your understanding of Tibetan grammar."},{"rating":"1","title":"How does she do it? She doesn't!","review":"I too was drawn in by the editorial reviews of this book being touted as the working mother's Bridgette Jones's diary. I can only guess the reviews were written by men. While I could relate to the guilt felt by our heroine I couldn't help but want to knock her silly. A job that affords her Armani suits and a nanny? Poor lady. Try mothering in the real world. This book is a complete insult to those of us who have to deal with work, kids, an executive position and DON'T have a choice. All my working friends could't wait to read this. I will make sure they don't.How does she make it in a man's world? Ultimately, according to Allison Pearson, she doesn't.Spend the {money} on a manicure, you'll feel much better in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frighteningly True","review":"A very funny book. It is a parody of course. Kate is the ultimate extreme career woman, but there is not one working woman out there who does not relate to the essence of Kate's struggle. I honestly laughed and cried. Author Allison Pearson hit the nail on the head. Sometimes a little too close to home as I winced in recognition. Other times I got to congratulate myself on not being quite \\"as bad as Kate.\\" But I loved it. It is a good story with an ending that provided food for thought about some of the choices I have made with my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don't Know Why She Did It!!","review":"I listened to friends tell me how hilarious this book was so I kept reading, hoping something interesting would happen, something at least REAL! I'm supposed to muster up sympathy for this supposedly brilliant woman who is a shark in the world of business but at home is afraid of her nanny and her housekeeper? It all seemed so absolutely silly and inane! And what was so funny about the high-school highjinks this crowd of female corporate geniuses pulled on the their co-worker after he put up nude composites of a fellow female work-mate on the internet? This was the best they could come up with?? Are you telling me you have to destroy your own career in order to get even? You know what it reminded me of? That movie \\"9 to 5\\" with Dolly Parton and Jane Fonda. Without the charm."},{"rating":"1","title":"It stressed me out","review":"This book stressed me out..... I spend most of the time hoping she would get her act together so she (and I) could relax. As a working mom it depressed me... and I truly could not relate to her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectacular!","review":"It is rare for a book to live up to its hype but this was even better than I expected! It was so funny, so sad and most of all so true. Allison Pearson captures the joys and trials of motherhood perfectly."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't know how she did it","review":"I simply do not know how this author passed this off as a best selling book. I recently borrowed this book from the library when I learned it was to become a movie staring Sarah Jessica Parker and Christina Hendricks (who is one of my favorite actresses of all time). When I began reading this book, it took a few pages to determine what was going so horribly wrong. In the simplist terms, the books \\"heroine\\" is one of the least likeable characters ever written. In her world, every task can only be completed correctly by herself. Her nanny? Incompetent. Her boss? A fool. Her husband? A slacker. Her best friend? Her mother? Uneducated and naieve. Coworkers? Pigs. The list goes on and on. What makes this especially annoing is that Kate make daily huge errors in her own life, but cannot tolerate any person around her who is less than perfect. I am so glad i did not pay for this book. I am hoping that the screenwriters can do something with this material to make it watchable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Working mums will TRULY relate to Kate","review":"As a fellow working mother I laughed (and cried) right along with Kate Reddy. The events and dialogue ring true, and sometimes I thought Allison Pearson had read my mind. Kate is British, so some references must be figured out by context, but any Anglophile will love this book. I didn't want this one to end; Kate is now a friend I'd like to receive hilarious emails from. When's the sequel coming out??"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved every second until the very end","review":"Don't worry -- I won't give away the ending. I will say that I loved this book. Raved about it. Bookmarked quote after quote. I empathized with literally every single experience of the main character. I felt more in touch with a heroine than I have in a long, long time. Maybe since \\"Bridget Jones Diary\\", and even then, frankly, I just loved her but wasn't really simpatico with her. Here, Kate Reddy is me. Almost literally.And that's probably why I was a teeny bit put off by the end of the book. I won't say more because I don't want to ruin it for other readers. And I will buy more books by this author. I loved her insights, her humor, her gut-wrenching honesty. I just didn't love the way she ended this amazing story. Maybe that's because it can't be my ending?In any case, well, well worth the read. You will enjoy every page."},{"rating":"1","title":"trite, myth-propagating, unbelievable","review":"It's difficult to not give anything away about the book in order to back up the criticisms in the review title, but the character read as someone that couldn't possibly exist in the real world. A collection of stereotypes: the high-powered career-woman and the stay-at-home-mom, smashed impossibly together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Last time I read a book recommended by Oprah","review":"I respect and enjoy Oprah but I continually am disappointed in her book picks. I guess we are on different pages so to speak as far as literature is concerned.The woman in this story does try to have it all with Marriage, kids and work but her choices obviously are tearing her apart and then the introduction of infidelity disappoints and ruins the hope the book would end well. I know it's just a story so I'll just say \\"bad choice\\". It drug for pages and finally stops, but doesn't end. Wish I had my 20 something dollars back.I really don't recommend this one. Sorry Oprah."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heartbreaking for the children if anyone actually lives like this.","review":"Who really lives like this? Why on Earth would someone bring children into this world that they had no intention of raising themselves, only to schlep them off on to a nanny at the earliest possible convenience? Kate's character does have the distinction of many guilt-tripped working mothers of buying their children's love when all they need is their parents there, and not more THINGS to fill the void."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Don&#65533;t Know How I Finished It","review":"This book is better birth control than an afternoon at the Park Slope Food Coop (habitat of the undisciplined bobo brat). The endless hassles and humiliations that make up Kate Reddy's days juggling high-powered career, kids and husband gave me a case of heartburn and elevated blood pressure just from turning the pages. Pearson's zany plot twists verge on sadism, even if the character's decision to sell her soul so completely for cash renders her unsympathetic from the start. For a certain tiny, VERY privileged slice of society, the horrors of Kate's life may approach reality. But, like hemorrhoids or cockroach mating habits, are such mundane yet unpleasant subjects worth reading about if they're not rendered by a master? This is only middling work, and I can't imagine a harried mother would want to spend her free time reliving the worst moments of her life. Quick, someone, tie my tubes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Was Disappointed!!!","review":"I read this book because of the kids, unfortunately there wasn't enough about the kids to make it worth my while.A woman is torn between her job and her kids. She finds joy from both. In my opinion, there is no question about this. I feel the parent should stay with the children, especially while the children are young. It not only benefits the child, but also the adult.I had a difficult time getting through this book,mainly because the sentences were jammed too full, trying to prove that this woman was too busy. It didn't seem realistic.I gave this book a 2 and a half stars:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsettling","review":"Ultimately this is the story of the poor rich successful girl (yes, I realize she wasn't born rich) that popped two kids out and didn't realize they instantly came with a nanny. She's a control freak who can't control anything. NOT impressed and very glad I got it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass","review":"Don't buy this book. Not only is it poorly written, but I can watch the news to have mainstream culture demonize me and other women. I also was completly offended with the cushy background of the author and her purported tone that she spoke for so many women. Please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Exhausting","review":"I was absolutely exhausted reading this book! I have been a work-outside-of-the-home mother, a stay-at-home mother, and a part-time-at-home mother. A lot of what Kate Reddy goes through is true to life, but this book was just too much! I didn't care about her childhood, and I thought the degree to which Kate/the author patronized and infantilized men was just ridiculous. Kate Reddy did not have my sympathy one bit. She deserved to feel guilty and exhausted."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Do Know How She Does It","review":"Any working mother--or, to be more precise, any mother who has a job outside the home--can identify with Kate Reddy, a woman who seems to have it all (a great job, a good marriage, and two beautiful, healthy children) and constantly hears the sound of balls crashing while she attempts to balance the demands of her seemingly-perfect life.Allison Pearson's portrayal of Kate is realistic and, for the most part, engaging. But I hated the end of the novel. Millions of women around the world manage--albeit with difficulty and great sacrifices--to balance marriage, children and career. Allison Pearson does. I do. So do many of my girlfriends. Why can't Kate Reddy do it too?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the hype","review":"This book was irritating. I did not sympathize with the main character, Kate, at all.It could be a terrific book from the working mother's point of view but unfortunately it is not. It stays on the surface with not much substance.Kate has a great, very demanding, high salary finance job.She has two children.And a nanny.And a loving, understanding husband who's career hasn't been as successful as Kate's yet and he spends a lot of time with the children.Sure, she works hard and she juggles a lot of things, like school bake sales and dinner with the in-laws.But still, she got no sympathy from me. Maybe because I know to many hard working mothers, with two jobs, no loving husbands and no nanny that juggle a lot more than Kate.It has a happy ending, but if you think of it Kate's life isn't that bad at all to begin with.I didn't not understand the point of this book. My suggestion is to skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic!","review":"I am going to be so disappointed when this story ends. This is a fabulous book by a brilliant new writer. I just logged on toAmazon to buy every book that this woman has written and was shocked to find that this is her first. Also, I listened to this book on cd and the reader Emma Fielding is great. I'm always so relieved when a professional is hired to read. Some great books are delivered very poorly when read by the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"I threw out my copy so nobody else would read it!","review":"I am a mother of two and work outside of the home full-time. I bought this book because I was feeling overwhelmed and was looking for a book to help me commiserate over my situation. I couldn't have hated this book more. I was so mad at the author for the ending, after cursing and crying, I threw the book in the trash so that no other working Mom would be fooled into reading a book. And now they are making it into a book? Let's hope they change the ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, and real world","review":"I see a lot of negative reviews here, but I think this book is hilarious and very real. It may seem to some like it has a feminist agenda, but if you have ever worked in a high-pressure business (as the heroine does) you will have experienced some of the frustrations of trying to compete with men who have stay-at-home wives, or have tried to ignore sexual jokes during meetings, or rushed from work to school to home. I loved reading about a woman a little like me, who is over 20 and is trying to DO IT ALL. It is not preachy, just very funny and very true - and the revenge she exacts on a particularly vile coworker at the end of the novel is WONDERFUL. Does she make the right decision at the end of the story? You read it and decide for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"This book is clever, well written, and dead on funny. The only problem I have is that poor Kate's life is so stressful, that I get stressed out just reading about it! A must read, not only for working moms, but for every woman who is contemplating combining motherhood with a career."},{"rating":"1","title":"She doesn't do it.","review":"Allison Pearson's novel is a screeching disappointment. As a working mother, I happily ordered the book online after reading the New York Times Book Review recommendation that suggested that I was the prime audience. Little did I know that this novel is a post-feminist backlash tract disguised as a feminist agenda. It really should be marketed to smug stay at home Moms who have the economic freedom to make what they consider a \\"choice\\"--which really means that they have someone else to support them. They will be pleased at the ending, which basically says that you can't do both."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"must-read\\" for all busy moms","review":"What a marvelous book that all busy moms will enjoy! I didn't want it to end as I could relate to so many of the main character's experiences. The author is very good and I hope she writes more adventures like this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"how under-appreciated are working mothers? Now you know!","review":"This book is the best I've read with regard to describing the frustrations of being a working mother. Although my job (and probably the jobs of most of the readers of this book, or else they wouldn't have the time to be reading novels!!!) is nowhere near fast-paced, high-flying and competitive as Kate Reddy's, the feeling that you're on a constant treadmill set too fast is all too familiar.Allison Pearson tackles her subject with great honesty and a wonderful sense of humour and though I really enjoyed the book, I got a feeling that she kind of \\"sells out\\" the working mothers of the world in the end. Yes, I KNOW from bitter experience that we can't have it all, but does that mean we have to give up trying?"},{"rating":"2","title":"*ahh!*","review":"i'll make this short. this is as witty as one can expect it to be, but it may also give you a headache to read about kate's life which is why i gave it four stars instead of five. humorous, ridiculous, and for the light-hearted. the ending seemed kind of bland to me after all the \\"drama\\" throughout the book. if you're a person that can laugh at the misfortunes of yourself and others, you will probably enjoy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"My life, only British.","review":"I roared with laughter and cringed at the dead on assessments in the very first chapters. A wonderful, brutally honest, *funny* view of working mothers. I immediately bought and lent copies to my casual network of working mother friends, saying \\"Read this, it's about us!\\" Readers not familiar with British slang will struggle a bit, but it's still worthwhile. My only complaint, and a very small one, is: why does the resolution depend on Kate rescuing everyone else in her life: her father, her slandered co-worker, her mother, her sister, her sister's co-workers, probably the whole darn economy by the time she's through? Does getting out of the working mother trap require performing great acts for the social good? Isn't that what got us into the mess in the first place? But I rant, and I digress. Read it, and enjoy it as comedy, social commentary or both. Here's hoping Kate Reddy pulls it off!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It gives me a slight headache","review":"I'm currently reading this book, and my head is pounding. I had to put it down for a moment to catch my bearings. It's not that it's a bad book, it's just extremely fast-paced and is tiring me out."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Was Disappointed!!!","review":"Of course, the kids drew me to this book, but therereally wasn't enough of the kids to satisfy me.The story never really got me involved. It's like the author tried to cram too much into each sentence to exhaust the reader, and prove that the main character was too busy. It is my personal belief that women should stay with their kids. It not only benefits the kids, but also the parents. It's just too bad that practically the whole book went by before she realized this.I would have rather read about a stay at home momwho struggled, but took great care of her children. This is the first book I have read by this author, and now I'll be scared to read others by her. I rated I Don't Know How She Does It a 2.5 stars:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just an OK book - not very realistic","review":"Kate Reddy is not your typical working mother. She has a glamorous job (she admits she may go abroad three times a month) and has a minicab to pick her up to work instead of taking the Underground. She doesn't get treated as well as she likes, but she is very successful and well respected by most at her work place. She has a full time, live in nanny and enough money to hire whatever needs to be done. Because she is so lucky, I found her whining to be a lttle unrealistic and the sporadic illustrations of the difficult time women have in the of world of work to be a little sanctimonious. I was also disappointed to see her reject the man's world. I fully expected Kate to end up running her firm instead of leaving it because a woman with a family could never truly succeed in the environment. Nevertheless, this was a fun book to read, if only for the use of British terms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh! Enough already!","review":"Being a working mom, I don't have much time to read so I got the audio version of \\"I don't know how she does it.\\" And I don't - I really don't - know how anyone got all the way through this book. Sure, Pearson makes some solid points about the delicate balance between work and home life and the jumble it can all be, but her character comes across as crass and uncaring about the people she should care about most: her family. I finally gave up on the audio version when I couldn't listen to another moment of Kate's complaints. She's all complaints, no solutions and she seems to be the only one who matters. Her selfishness was appalling. Thank god I only rented this from the library!"},{"rating":"1","title":"ANNOYING","review":"This is a moderately amusing, fairly entertaining quick read. Most working mothers will be able to relate to something that Kate experiences, in the same way that most single women could relate to something that Bridget Jones experienced, while recognizing that these women are really caricatures, not real women.HOWEVER, this book was mostly annoying! There's virtually no character growth until the last 20 pages, and by then you really don't care. The book stopped being amusing and started being really annoying pretty early on. You just want Kate to STOP COMPLAINING and find some beauty in the big pay check, big house, great kids, etc..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pain in the Neck","review":"I wnated to like this book so much- a working woman, balancing motherhood with a rewarding career, blah, blah, blah. But Kate Reddy was just so unlikeable. Not funny at all, in fact, just depressing and whiney. ugh, those stupid lists of stuff on her to do list were painful. My advice- stick to Bridget Jones- at least she has a sense of humor!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Offensive","review":"As a working mother, I find this book terribly offensive. It is NOT a light-hearted tale of the trials and tribulations we all face, but a devious, insulting insinuation that it is, in fact, impossible to be both a good mother and a successful career woman.Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Started off good...","review":"I thought I would enjoy this book. And I did at first. However, I started to hate it after a while, finding it extremely depressing. We follow the life of Kate Reddy, a working mom with a marriage that is on the rocks, and who is finding herself drawn to another man...who lives across the Atlantic. I found most of Kate's life boring, especially the bits about her job because I had no idea what Kate's job was. Perhaps I'm a bit to young to try and understand exactly what Allison Pearson was trying to say about working mothers. However, to me, it was like she was saying it couldn't be done if you wanted to be great in both arenas."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"My sister sent me this book years ago. I finally took the time to read it (first novel in 10 years) because they are turning it into a movie starring Sarah Jessica Parker. I figured it had to be OK. AND I wondered what message my sister was trying to send me.Well, the first half of the book was extremely boring. Any mom knows what it's like to juggle roles; We don't need this character to bore us with the details. And THIS mom (Kate) had an in-home babysitter and husband who HELPED !! And she was complaining/stressed ?!!?Anyway, the author tries to wrap the book - and Kate's life - up in a nice little bow at the end. How quaint. And unreal."},{"rating":"1","title":"not reality","review":"I had heard wonderful things about this book. I had heard that it was the 'grown-up Bridget Jones', which initially turned me off. I decided to try it from my local library on a boring weekend. The inital review of Bridget Jones isn't too far off.It was amusing at first, but quickly became predictable. .... The moral of this story is 'if one is a working mum, one is a bad mum'. It has funny moments, but I think that, in reality, the story would have worked out much differently.I am a woman working in a man's world as well. I handle myself very professionally without resorting to her tactics and certainly without meekly accepting the sexual harassment. I am divorced and love it. I am not Kate Reddy and I don't want to be. Women, do not let your daughters read this book or Bridget Jones!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny book, but has its drawbacks...","review":"I am in the middle of this book, and while I like the narrator's (Kate's) wry wit, the book does have its problems. She does only seem to be aware of herself and her world. She makes a lot of money and also has to work hard, I understand, but other women (like my own mother)work just as hard, in careers that are considered \\"boring\\" and don't have the perks (like travel)that her job does. They also have to deal with the same issues she does- a husband who doesn't know how to do things without her, doesn't start dinner, etc. I am glad other women do have these things, but sometimes this book just seemed like a love story to thoise with glamourous careers and children. Someone should try writing a story about a mom who has to work 3 jobs and deal with her family. This character just needs to get her head out of the sand a bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't know why she wrote it","review":"This is not a book to put down lightly. It is one to have the pages stripped out and line the bottom of one's parakeet cage. This was one of the worst books I've ever read. I bought it to read the genera of I guess soap opera literature. I will not judge another woman on anything she does, but Kate is neurotic and married to a beta man and she seems to sail with no rudder. A scene between her mother and a judge near the end is supposed to impress us as some empowering motherhood thing, but in the US, you'd get booted out of court over it and a stiff fine. I couldn't imagine her saying that to one of the terrifying white wigged judges in England.Poor character development and a bad reflection on women everywhere. This seems to have been put out by someone against motherhood and working."},{"rating":"1","title":"I know how she does it - she has help","review":"I was expecting a totally different book, to be quite honest. I wasn't expecting a mother who \\"juggled\\" work and housework and all with help and plenty of money. She has a nanny and a housecleaner! Granted, her housecleaner for some reason can't clean hardly anything beyond what's directly in front of her, but she can still afford help nonetheless. And the ending? I thought it defeated the entire purpose of the book.Honestly, I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone. Thank goodness I borrowed it and didn't waste my money on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"THEY WROTE A BOOK ABOUT ME","review":"It seems as though this book is written about me. Or perhaps, \\"I\\" Represent the millions of women everywhere who are burned out and still managing to do the impossible-survive with class. Kids are a full time Job. A full time Job is a full time job. All work and no play makes me have no time to read this book, but read this book I did. I can't think of a single working mom who can't not love this book. I love this book because I empathize. Very insightful and moving book. It made me laugh and cry at the same time. Also recommended: The Little Guide to Happiness, by Michael Kevin Naselli"},{"rating":"1","title":"I know exactly how she does it","review":"She has a bazillion dollars, a wonderful understanding husband, great lingerie, a fantasy lover and more or less everything else she wants in the world.Terrific. I know how she does it, now can someone tell me how I do it? I only have the kids in common.As a struggling, overeducated, extremely underpaid, single mother, this book was a total disappointment. Even comedy must have some reality to it. There are cute bits - yes, mothers are competitive - but the treacly attitude does them in. And at the end? SHE can walk away and 99% of us cannot; it's a copout. I was very disappointed with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really depressing - I don't know why she did it!","review":"I'm a lawyer and a mom, and while I sometimes related to Kate's frustration with time and with her kids, I found the book incredibily depressing. I was literally SAD much of the time I spent reading this supposedly \\"hysterical\\" book - and angered by the fact that the reviewers were calling it the \\"most honest book about modern motherhood\\" - this is not a true book about modern motherhood - if it were we would all slit our own wrists. I agree with the reviewer that called this a backlash against working mothers - it really seems to imply that a working mom cannot possibly be happy. Don't waste your precious time or money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"Sorry I spent good money on this book. From the reviews I thought it would be a funny take on typical working Mom.. I think the author more interested in showing her grasp of the English language ..... I planned to read it and buy some for gifts. Glad I reviewed it first."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book Stinks","review":"I am a working mother and I found this book to be outrageous and offensive beyond all measure. Not only was the heroine possibly the most heinous mother imaginable (every horrible stereotype about a woman who likes her career and has no business being a mother at all magnified by 3000), but the moral of this awful book is that even a heinous horrible mother is better served being home with her kids. That this book is touted aS a comedy novel for working mothers is outrageous and I'm sorry I wasted my time (thankfully not money) reading it. Working mothers beware -- DO NOT READ THIS HORRIBLE TRASH!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Whiner!","review":"This woman has a partner, a nanny, and a well - paid job that gives her international travel (sans child) as a perk. So - WHAT IS SHE WHINING ABOUT??? If you are a single mother like me, you'll find this book not only annoying, but insulting. This woman needs to get some perspective on how hard it really can be, to parent a child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrating","review":"As a new mother, I had looked forward to this book, thinking it would give me insight regarding how to balance work and motherhood. Instead, the main character spends most of her time complaining about having too much work, yet hating spending vacation time with her kids (who drive her crazy.) The end was far fetched too. I would not recommend this books for new mothers."},{"rating":"2","title":"She Just Does","review":"I've just finished reading Don't Know How She Does It and thought it was terrific. Kate is funny, familiar and real. She got an education, climbed the corporate ladder in high heels, laden with child and discovered she was the man she always planned to marry. Realizing her goals, she must face the debacle of her missing life. I laughed, I cried, I'll be first in line when the movie comes out. If you are a career woman, join the Kate fan club."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't know how she does it so poorly","review":"I don't know how she does it so poorly. I am speaking of Miss Allison Pearson, in reference to her horrible novel. This piece of bland fiction would better serve the detainees of a Turkish prison than an erudite, WASPy mother of two. If you're looking for a novel to read while you spend your trust fund at the beach with all the other rich snobs, I suggest you pick up \\"Oh the Places You'll Go.\\" It greatly surpasses the muddy narration of Pearson's prose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unrealistic","review":"I was initially excited to read this book. I am a working mother who is married to an Englishman and loves English books. I am not a violent person but, after a few chapters, I wanted to smack Kate and tell her to grow up. If I were her husband, I would have left long ago AND taken the children with me. She is obviously self-centered and career obsessed. I never once got the feeling that she enjoyed being a mother. Then we are supposed to believe she just gives it all up (not until after pulling a juvenile stunt at the office) and is \\"Mary Poppins\\" all of the sudden? There were a few incidents that made me laugh or cry but overall the rest did not make up for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real life","review":"Sometimes harrowing, always honest and insightful, what happens after a successful singleton gets her guy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Can Relate!!!","review":"A co-worker of mine gave it to me as a birthday present, and I couldn't put it down! I've shared it with other friends who juggle the Mom-corporate career world, and everyone's loved it. There were so many neurotic thoughts by Kate with which I could identify (and some that made me feel better, thinking \\"Well, I'm not THAT bad!\\"). A must-read for the working mom!"},{"rating":"1","title":"success of this propaganda is inexplicable","review":"For starters, Helen Fielding did it better (the brit-breezy funny diary) in Bridget Jones. But what makes me and other women want to throw this book across the room (that's how I wound up reading it, I caught it on an enraged flyover in my office and needed something cheesy to read on the subway home) is the over-the-top setup that would be satirical if Ms. Pearson didn't keep bringing in the violins (heroine's sad childhood) and, the predictability of an ending that would make Phyllis Shlafly pround. Working woman, thou cannot mother! Ms. Pearson tells us. I thought this was a hateful little piece of tripe. Don't know how it got such kindly reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"We All Know How She Does It --- Yawn","review":"It all seemed so everyday, a bit trite and neither so horrid or so glorious to make me feel that I was reading anything other than a woman's magazine take on things. A bit much \\"poor me\\". Unlikely and pat ending, the type available to only to those who really do have pretty much everything.If you want the real, real picture .. sharp, human, true and although the humour is dry and a touch cynical,also funny, .. take a walk back in time to Fay Weldon writing decades ago, but still ringing true for this age. Try out a copy of Watching Me, Watching You,(stories and the novella\\"The Fat Women's Joke\\") and I guarantee you will be excited by the writing and teased by her unsentimental perceptions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never evolved","review":"This is a story of a full-time executive who is also a mom, wife, and martyr. She is busy, rushed, and frantic all the time with a staunch refusal to delegate. That is the entire story, it never changes, and never evolves into any decent character portrayal. This book falls flat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and real","review":"Laugh out loud funny. Stab in the heart real.Any working mom will see herself -- both the parts she loves and the parts she secretly hates."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, great, fun, apart from the ending","review":"The ending of the book is disappointing, politically and otherwise. Pearson navigates the story's tensions so brilliantly through most of the book but at the end they seem to back her into a corner. Still, the rest of the book is SO funny, and the lead character's voice is SO likable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book","review":"I really enjoyed this book. I read the review in the NY Times and went right out to the bookstore to purchase it. I could really relate to Kate getting treats together for the class at 2AM in the morning (although that's usually when I'm doing laundry!) The only thing that disappointed me was how conveniently it all ended .... house in the country.. new job. Most of us are still struggling in that full-time world."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"Although the woman-trying-to-juggle-career-marriage-and-children is a somewhat overworked theme, Pearson's crisp and witty writing style give the plot of this story some freshness. As a stay-at-home mom who formerly worked outside her home, I found plenty of situations and characters in this story that were not only funny, but rang all too true(especially the \\"muffia\\"). The reason that I rated this book with 4, instead of 5, stars is because it did go on a bit too long with a far-fetched ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Modern Woman's Dilemma","review":"Another gem from an NPR interview! I laughed and wept my way through this book! It reminded me of my young years as working mum, and showed the esential absurdity of modern life. Kate's besetting sin is that she is an intelligent, highly competent and attractive woman and she is a better provider, financially, emotionally and practically than her husband. Will this marriage survive? Especially given the temptations put in Kate's way. The tensions between the working mum and the stay-at-home mums are well drawn, and that mother-in-law! What a character! Originally I bought this for my daughter-in-law, but now I am not so sure I want her to read it-- yet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The working mom's Bridget Jones Diary","review":"This book was a wonderful read while on a business trip, I loved the witty humor and could really relate to the juggling act of the protagonists, Kate Reddy's life. The mixed opinions of co-workers and family members that working mother's face as well as the conflicted emotions we ourselves have, are all represented but with a tongue in cheek representation that make them entertaining to read no matter what your stance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious and Honest","review":"I watched the movie with SJP and Pierce Brosnan and thought it was cute. I was curious to read the book it was based on and I am glad I did because as usual, the movie left out not only important portions of the story, it really scaled back on the sometimes brutal but refreshing honesty of the author as she assesses her relationship to her husband, her father and her children. Probably the people involved in making the movie thought the audience would not relate to the main character if she was not totally likeable but in fact, I related to the character written in the book much more because it was so much more honest. As a mom/wife/career woman with similarly dysfinctional thorny love-hate relationships with my own parents, the book really resonated with me. And it helped that a lot of it was laugh out loud funny. I am already in the middle of my second reading. This is like Bridget Jones all grown up married with kids, but much more raw and honest."},{"rating":"1","title":"More career mom guilt","review":"This is just another knock-off in the post-Bridget Jones female heroine genre. Except there's too much to not like among the main characters to make them sympathetic or even memorable. Must every novel produced in England include those clever little emails meant to provide character insight? While there were a few laughs, this was a disappointment. I feel like I've read it before. A few times. Enough. You do know how she does it. The real question is, do you care?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I do it - but without the nanny or housekeeper!","review":"This book is light-hearted in its attempt to relate the story of a working mother. Unfortunately the working mother, at the centre of the story, is not a true reflection of the majority of working mums. The conflict she feels is probably very familiar to most mothers, but it is a bit indulgent and certainly not the great read I was expecting."},{"rating":"2","title":"The question burning on every young woman's mind...","review":"Until I read this book, I never questioned that I wouldn't be able to juggle a family with a career. In our modern society, girls are told every day of their life that they will be able to bring home the bacon and cook it too. I never felt like this book passed judgment on whether or not balancing it all could be done. Instead, I felt that it was an honest reveal of the every day struggle of the moderm working woman/super mom. Extremely enlightening for a 20-something college student about to graduate into the real world. I highly recommend Pearson's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for its price","review":"This VCR has everything you need to play and record videos. It has helpful features like a jog/shuttle on the remote, time and index searches, and reasonably easy programming.

The remote is excellent, and the quality of recordings is outstanding. Its playback of commercially recorded tapes, when piped through my Sony home theatre setup, is as good as any high priced VCR that I have encountered. In addition its component video and audio inputs, and component and coaxial outputs allow the viewing of satellite or DVD component outputs on televisions with only a coaxial input, with superlative picture quality.

A WW II story... but with aliens. It had everything from politics to the galactic battles for power and planetary control and also some religious beliefs. The author's use of humor in the midst of galactic combat was clever. The battle scenes were very discriptive without being overly technical and difficult to read, and I thought his development of the characters was very believable. The story was violent when it needed to be. The author kept my interest in what was going to happen next.

These Sony headphones were priced well and were reviewed well. One persistent complaint seemed to be that they were uncomfortable. I don't even have that complaint.

Relatively comfortable but do tend to squish my head after a while,Only real complaint is they bleed sound. You ever sat net to someone that had their headphones not blaring, but still a bit loud and you could really hear them clearly? Yeah, I don't like that either. I've owned other big headphones like this that did a good job of sealing in the music so that everyone around them didn't have to listen to it too. These don't do that. The sound is great for me, but my wife complains all the time that they're disturbing her.Other than that, good headphones for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it","review":"A little bulky but very good sound (one of the best at tis price range) I recommend it for day to day use unless you are an audiophile, then you should consider Bose or similar brandname headphones"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Headphones","review":"I bought these for recording and layering music, and so far, they have been excellent. The highs and lows are quite dynamic, and the overall sound is very crisp. The only real issue is that these aren't as tough as I expected.

They have solid bass response and you can hear distinct instruments with the songs!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Far better than most 300 dollar headphones.","review":"A relative bargain when compared to \\"fashion lifestyle\\" headphones. The Sony 'phones were always known for being quite good and these out perform many costlier headphones. The ear pads will fall apart after a year or two, so expect to have to replace them. This happens to most headphones with this type of ear pad. This isn't unique to Sony."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best headphones I've ever had the pleasure to listen to","review":"The bass is VERY deep and mighty without ever getting untight. The attenuation of sounds from outside is pretty good, especially in higher frequencies. Build quality feels good too. Really comfortable to wear, you might get a little sweaty but that's about it.They are way superior to Sennheiser PX100 and to an old pair of \\"top-of-the-line\\" Philips earphones that I bought for a 100 bucks in 2000.Only thing I would change is to put a 3 ft, straight cable instead of the 5-6 ft coiled one. This would be better when I'm on the go with my iPod."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pleased","review":"About 10 years ago I purchased these headphones (or ones that looked just like them) and loved them. Over the years and many moves, I lost them. Recently I started shopping for headphones to use to mix music while traveling. I read reviews and saw that this model is still a favorite to many people so I decided to give them another try. As soon as they arrived, I plugged them in and was not disappointed at all. They sound great. They also do a very good job of blocking out other sounds which has worked out great for me - especially while traveling. To top it off, they were purchased for about half the price of others that I was considering. I am very pleased with these and would recommend them to anyone looking for a new pair of headphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love them.","review":"I have bigger-than-average ears and wanted over the ear headphones. These just made it (which was a first for me with other over-the-ear models).Quality, fantastic. If you wear them for more than a few hours straight (as I do), you may feel a little pressure. They also can be warm if worn it hot environments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Have had these for around 12 years now","review":"I first bought this set of headphones at a brick and mortar store for around $100 in 2000. A little while ago I noticed so distortion at a certain frequency which I had not noticed before. I was very disappointed, thinking I would have to get another set and hope that it is half as good as this one. To my surprise, they are still for sale on Amazon, and for less than what I first paid for them! I have ordered myself a pair. This set sounds awesome, much better than my boyfriend's $300 headphones. Sure, those have more bass, but these sound more natural and clear to me. They are very comfortable to wear, and I have a pretty large head and ears. The headset itself is light, but the cord, and especially plug, are pretty heavy. I don't recommend this set if you are planning on using them when moving around often, but are perfect for home use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Headphones","review":"These really can't be beat by anything else in this price range. They're quite comfortable (thinking about replacing the vinyl ear cushions with velour ones as the vinyl ones make my ears a bit sweaty after extended use..). I won't go into audio quality as there are plenty of reviews that do that. The build quality is superb. The coiled cable is sturdy, and the plug weighs almost as much as my cell phone! The included adapter screws on very securely. I ordered a few headphones when I was deciding on a pair and these beat out the XB500 as well as comparable Sennheiser and Sure headphones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly uncomfortable","review":"These headphones give me a persistent headache every time I wear them. As a matter of fact, I think they have created a bruise on the crown of my head.I am very angry that I paid $100 for these things, thinking they were going to be the best sounding and most comfortable pair of headphones, and ideal for long-term, hours-of-studying, use. They are not.I switched back to my $45.00 Sennheiser HD 212Pros that are probably 10 years old and sound 80% as good as the Sonys, but don't try to drill into my skull. I gotta tell you, any reduction in the sound quality is well worth a reduction of the amount of skull-drilling.I know, they're supposed to be industry standard. What can I say other than stay away if you're planning to wear these for more then 20 minutes at a time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly disappointed with Sony","review":"I purchased Sony headphones and the coating on the ear pads is coming off.

The reason? I use headphones for recording in my home studio. While playing guitar or any instrument for that matter, if the headphones move at all against my head, I hear the friction sound transmitted very loudly. It's quite annoying, and I keep finding myslef trying to hold perfectly still, which is awkward. Similarly, if I try to use these to listen to music while laying on a pillow, the slightest movment causes them to scuffle and squeak. I think maybe it's their lightweight construction that transmits external friction so readily. I'm not sure why everyone thinks these are so great. I had a pair of the old-school MDR V600s and those were amazing. I foolishly sold them and now I'm looking for another pair used."},{"rating":"1","title":"uncomfortable","review":"I didn't find them comfortable for long use at all, hurt my ears, made them red by pressing them against my head too much.

Instead, replace with a velour type of ear pad to maximize the comfort. After replacing the ear pads, the uncomfortable tightness went away :) I have been using these since 2003 and I still love them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent headphones","review":"The sound is almost excellent, excellent quality of construction, materials are good. I had a chance to compare them with Sennheizer HD-280 PRO and V6s are much much better in everything, especially in sound quality. The only problem is that these headphones are slightly tight for my head and I can't use them for more than 6 hours, but from my point of view 6 hours of continuous usage is more than enough. One thing to note is that these headphones have quite good noise cancelation so be prepared to not to hear surrounding environment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff.","review":"Years ago I owned theSony MDR-V600 Studio Monitor Series Headphones with Circum-Aural Earcup Design, but the plastic headband eventually broke.So far these have been a great replacement.

More 'bassy' than my Grado SR60 headphones which are in the same price range. However, these phones surround the entire ear which accounts for some of the additional bass whereas the Grado phones sit on the ear and allow for more \\"soundstage\\" and in my opinion more accurate sound. The Sony phones shut out much more of the room noise than the Grado phones do because of their 'sealed' design. The Grados don't shut out any room noise at all by comparison so if you listen in a noisy place you may want to go with these Sonys. These phones are good for editing, DJs, microphone usage etc. They are fairly comfortable. Much more than the Sennheisers I tried on, not as much as the Grados. However, I don't find any headphones \\"comfortable\\" really."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vey good headphones.","review":"U bought these headphones for a Christmas gift for my father to use with his iPhone.

But the sound quality is really good and sometimes Sony surprises with some of their products that dont look that robust but last for a long time. I believe that this is one of thoses cases. Otherwise why after so many years on the first edition release would they still be seeling?

Other brands deliver in that area sometimes, but Sony always does. I was impressed with everything concerning these even the packaging is fancy. The chord and jack are made to last.

The first pair that I received had some issues with the audio jack though - sound was erratic, I could only hear through one ear and there would be static and I'd have to twist the audio jack around to ensure better sound. So, I contacted Amazon and was sent an immediate replacement. I was not disappointed. Sound quality is excellent in this one, so I put down the first one to a lemon.I did experience a dull ache on my ears after usage for an hour or so with the first piece that I received. Thankfully, the replacement seems a much better fit and doesn't cause any such problems for me. But, I can see that it might still be an issue for some with even bigger ears. If you are worried about comfort of the fit, perhaps there are better ones out there, but this one has very good output quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I needed!","review":"These are the headphones my program director swears by.

For the price, these are fantastic sounding. I haven't worn them continuously for more than about an hour, so I don't know how they would be for long term use. Around the ear area is fine, but the bridge which contacts the top of one's head could use a little more padding, I suspect. It feels a little bit like having a board on your head. Then again, I have kind of a pointy head (hey, no one's perfect), so maybe that is why, and for a \\"normal\\" person, they would be just fine. They still get five stars, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saved a lot of money","review":"I highly recommend these baby's! Some reviews said they were tight and had to change ear pads...huh? I've got a big ol' head and they were fine from day one, very comfy. As far as sound goes they are phenomenal. I've heard some very high end audiophile speakers and headphones in my day, as stereo is my hobby, and these Sony's are equal to or better than most. Clean, clear, crisp, good bottom end, no sharp and screechy treble, no muddy mid-range, just what's in the music and nothing more. I've got mine dedicated to a Denon DCD 860, a 1972 GREAT cd player and they sound amazing. For the price I'd say the sound quality is right up there with headphones costing in the hundreds!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Older but Great","review":"I brought these headphones over 10 years ago after doing several reviews. The sound is phenominal- 5-30,000 HZ- Check the specs on any audio you own- 5HZ is almost unheard of for the low end. The sound is very balanced and you'll hear instruments you never heard before. The second thing that makes these so good it that they require low power and can be powered from any ipod. This is my second pair since the other one is getting old and I don't want to loose out on having these years down the road. I'll put these up against any of the new ones- even the \\"noise cancelling\\" ones- other than maybe on a plane- don't have the 5-30,000- and balanced sound that these do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't go wrong with these headphones","review":"I've had these headphones for six months and have been very pleased with my investment.

They were around $100 in 1986 dollars and well worth the cost then. They lasted about 10 years before abuse finally cracked them. I went without nice headphones for several years, I am very happy that they still sell this model, they are compact, have great range bass to high and put any of my other headphones to shame. They are by far the best value in headphones, kudos for Sony for keeping production running."},{"rating":"2","title":"great sound, funky mechanics","review":"First, the sound emanating from these headphones is simply wonderful. They are not boomy, but have clean and tight bass as well as crisp highs, and everything in between sounds equally as nice. The cord coils nicely and doesn't tangle, entering the left side of the headset and with a very nice strain relief at the plug on the other end.The \\"funky mechanics\\" that I refer to are related to collapsing the headset and the adjustment of the headband. The headband adjustment will not maintain position and slips while putting on or taking off the headphones. I also find myself being (overly?) careful when collapsing/expanding the headphones, but maybe that's just my paranoia considering the cost.The sound quality is without par in any headphones I have ever had and I would definitely buy another pair IF these don't fall apart mechanically within the next couple of years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice headphone","review":"The quality of the headphone is really nice,and I like the sound pretty much,but the treble sound is a bit sharp...anyway,it's still a nice headphone"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price","review":"Paid $67 on Amazon.

It may be 10 feet long but because it's coiled you really are limited to where you can go. Go too far and out comes the plug or down goes the stereo. Just need to limit your range. No biggie. I just move the chair closer to the stereo.Also, the cushions are fit just right around my ears where they do a good job of blocking out outside noises."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best headphones I've ever heard","review":"These headphones are FANTASTIC. Not only do they produce incredibly full and clear sound, but they're also lightweight and extremely comfortable. They fit firmly on your head, cancelling outside noice marvelously without giving the feel that your trapped in a vice.My dad bought a pair of the Koss Pro4AA Titaniums and I have to say that this Sony pair blows those away. While the sound quality is similarly great, the Koss's are about 5X as heavy! They really put a dent in your head and start to hurt your ears if you wear them for much more than an hour. The Sony's are much more comfortable and MUCH more lightweight and portable. I definetely recommend these. You won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell apart in two weeks","review":"I bought my first MDR-V6 around 1980 (possibly even earlier but my memory is foggy on exactly when I got it). Round about 2011 the left side stopped sending sound. Up until then, for over 30 years, those headphones were as good as the day I bought them. I retired them and bought a second set. On the first day the outer seams on the lining covering the foam padding came undone on one side. About a week later the inner seams on both sides started to come undone. Now the outer seams are unattached on both sides. The sound is still good, but the craftsmanship is very disappointing. 5 stars for sound and comfort - minus 3 stars for poor craftsmanship for the model I purchased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad quality Dont buy this item","review":"I bough these headphones with great expectations.

Awsome sound. But then, I took my daily walk with them. The first thing I noticed was that they amplified every step I took like a bass drum. They also amplified the cord as it swished and rubbed against my body. When I scratched my face, it sounded like sandpaper. Then when a slight breeze began (5 - 10 mph), it sounded like I was in a hurricane or wind tunnel and drowned out the music. I am returning them. If you just want to use them while sitting still inside, they are awsome, but not good if you're moving around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the price","review":"Excellent design, fairly good sound, nothing like I had in the 1980s growing up, those could blow your eardrums and still sound great, guess I would need to spend more than $[...] to get that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for the price","review":"Bought this item for use at the office at my cube. The sound production is very good. I've only tried it through my phone's music player using high bitrate mp3's so not exactly the best source, so I'm not going to dig too deep into sound quality. I'll just say that I am happy with the sound production.On the comfort side, the cups are pretty comfortable. I've repeatedly worn these for an hour or so at a time and have not had any discomfort from my ears. The only slight discomfort I experienced was from the head band. I wish there was a little more padding so the band conformed more to my head. As it is, the band makes a pressure point at the top of my head which can be discomforting after awhile. But that could just be the shape of my head.In terms of manufacturering, the product feels quality made, from the band all the way down to the end of the plug. Overall, I'm happy with the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Quality!","review":"Absolutely worth your money.

Everyone says that you will hear instruments in your music that you weren't aware of - I didn't believe them, but its true! On another note, I would like to say that I was originally considering purchasing the Bose Triports for twice the price. I had a chance to try the Triports at an Apple Store and I'll say right now that the MDR-V6 outperforms the Triports any day. Why else have they been in production for over 20 years?

I have had these about one month, and they allow me to hear sounds in my music collection that were not audible on other equipment. They significantly improved the realism. Plenty of balanced bass without distortion or overwhelming other octaves. These are also very comfortable on my ears for extended periods. The cord is a coiled type that can stretch. Very enjoyable listening, and would probably have to spend a lot more just to get a little better sound. I have listened to others that did not match the sound quality at double or triple the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical and comfortable","review":"I love the coiled long cord. For me as a musician this is much more practical than the short cords you get with most headphones. Great sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Quality for Price","review":"Got these headphones a week ago. The sound is very clear, I can hear all the details. They fit very comfortably and they do not hurt my ears at all even after long usage. Hear the songs like they are meant to be heard. The bass is a good level, especially for the price, but it's not super heavy if you are a bass head you might want to get something a little more bass intense. I wish it was a little more intense but these head phones are great and produce great quality sound. The extra bass I'm used to is overkill from my subwoofers, so if you're looking for great quality headphones for a great price these are them. If you're a bass maniac you might want to get something heavier, but for the average listener these are great, and they do have good bass its appropriate, not overwhelming - which some people look for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome buy","review":"Amazing buy, awesome comfort, great sound quality.

Good quality headphones, with excellent sound. No noise reduction but excellent isolation. I use it on my home studio and on the road to listen to music on my Ipod. The are bulky for the road, but i do not care the extra load. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Owner for 1 day","review":"OMG!!! These are awesome straight out of the box. No need for burning in!!! I also own Audio Technica ATH-M50, and Monster Beats Studio. These Sony MDR-V6 blow em both away. The ATH-M50s tend to be a bit flat, the Beats a bit bass heavy. These MDR-V6s are dynamic and LIVELY along all parts of the spectrum. I'm hearing notes, bravados, instrument fades, break-beats that I haven't heard before. As I am writing this, I've only on hour 2 of listening. I'm using my 5G iPod Nano w/o an amp (imagine with a headphone amp!). Seriously, you won't be disappointed in these. Very comfortable, quality construction. Buy one now, the price is right, its worth 3x the price in all seriousness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Was gunna be 4 star... but then I couldn't find anything wrong with them.","review":"I produce digitally composed music.

My soundcloud will improve now that I have these headphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"20 years of perfection","review":"Sony has been making this model for over 2 decades. I purchased my first MDR-V6 in 1988. It was $100 back in '88. It was one of the best sounding headphones back then and still is. Used it for for nearly ten years, until the padding fell apart. Two decades of production says a lot about the product. I was surprised to find it again for the same price of $100 after nearly 20 years later. There are other \\"higher quality\\" headphones available for a significant premium. But I doubt you could tell any difference in sounds with ipods. In fact I purchased two, one for home and another for the office. I don't usually give 5 stars unless it's absolutely perfect. So, 4 stars. For this I almost think it deserves 5 stars ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent headphones at a decent price","review":"Decent headset for not too much money. Decent sound.

I have recently replaced the pads due to age, but other than that perfect performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Head this headphone was a classic !!","review":"I've had other headphones around this price range in the past but they did not come close to how great this set of cans sound. I did my research and just wanted for this baby to go on sale and I wasn't left hanging. The sound is sharp and clear and just enough bass for me. I'm not really into how the Beats headphone are so overpowering when it comes to bass but that's just me. If you want to hear all the detail in the music at a reasonable price this will not disappoint : ) !! I once had bad headphones but now I hear !! Taking this to church."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good quality/sound for price","review":"Listening to my old music with these headphones sounds like listening to new songs. I finally hear the small variations and imperfections in vocals and instruments that makes the music come alive. I don't give them five stars because at \\"loud\\" volume, the bass sometimes doesn't quite hit as hard as I'd like. They feel great, often times I forget they are on my head at all.

Before it's arrival, I've always settled to using cheap earplugs. It did the job (i'm no audiophile), but i had been severely pining for over-ear headphones for the longest time then. Now, I absolutely love using it every chance i can get. It's nearly borderline abusive that i wear them while commuting on foot/car/bus/train. Having these on long flights and lengthy road trips is an excellent escape to an isolated music-listening heaven.A friend recommended buying replacement pads for when the original pads begin to deteriorate, or just replace it all-together with the Beyerdynamic set as it reduces sweating. I'll probably get to those when my pair wears out then.Without question, I would buy this same set again if the need arises."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Headphones for a Great Price","review":"These headphones are exquisite. They have changed my experience of listening to music greatly, as I have heard small intricacies in the sound that I had never noticed before. They are very comfortable and very durable, with a frame consisting mostly of metal. The sound quality is comparable to a pair of headphones that you would get for triple the price. The bass is also quite good. For studio work or just listening to your favorite music, you can't go wrong with these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shocking headphones","review":"The sound quality is good, they are well constructed, the sound is decent, but they shock my ears, repeatedly.

The cord is coiled and very long but heavy. Note: this headset is not over-the-ear. It is a large on-the-ear design. My ears are average in size but there is not enough space inside to accomodate my ears and the edges of the pads press on the outer edges of my ears, making them uncomfortable after a few minutes. Listening for more than two hours is out of the question. Oddly the headset is large enough for over-the-ear design, but the ear cushions are flat and will not allow the ear to tuck behind the ear cushion as with my Bose headset. Overall, the discomfort made this a purchase that I regret."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped Working After Five Months","review":"When these headphones were working, they sounded great. However, after five months of light usage and no abuse, the right speaker started going out one night and an hour later completely stopped working. All of my headphones have been Sony and this is my first issue with any of them. Most people love these and I can understand why but I would think that they should last longer than five months."},{"rating":"1","title":"It broke after only 18 months of use.","review":"I brought this headphone 18 months ago. It's not mobile, just sitting on my office desk for my computer. It was not used heavily. Then suddenly on day only the left channel was working, no sound from the right channel. Check with Sony and found out that it's out of warranty and repair cost more than the original. Any idea? It seems to happen to Sony product a lot: product breaks soon after warranty expired."},{"rating":"2","title":"alright","review":"pros: great sound, comfortable, closed headphones: when you put these puppies on you can't hear ANYTHING apart from the music, also it's hard for outside world to hear you even when you're rocking it.cons: i'm already on my 3rd pair because of the same problem: after about a half year of abuse (i.e shoving them in my backpack) one of the speakers stops working. for the life of me it happened with the first two i had. so i now bought mdr7506's which is basically the same but priced more (go figure). i think sony should make the v6's more tough though. throwing headphones into a backpack is a pretty important thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"crackle in bass","review":"First pair I bought got stolen outta my car, somebody smashed my window and took my bag that held it :(Anyway, first pair sounded great.I bought another pair, there was an extremely disappointing crackle in one of the headphones from a low frequency.

Sony packaged it like it was a limited edition. I paid 50 bucks for headphones that were mediocre before and this is only around 75. Very solid sound and great for monitoring, I thought about needing a 300 dollar pair of sennheiser but a colleague said you won't get more out of a more expensive set than this. I'm not sure what's the difference between this and MDR7506 but I can only image how awesome the professional ones are though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"These headphones are amazing. I'm coming from earbuds, which sounded fine to me, but they're nothing compared to these. I got them on sale at $40, which is an absolute steal in my opinion.

Great sound, great base gives new depth to music, games and movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best headphones I have ever owned!","review":"These are awesome. You can definitely notice a difference between these and cheap headphones. The bass on these is great. I looked into headphones alot when buying these, and people said they were the best avail. under $100.Buy these, you wont regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Phones","review":"Great phones. I had been using 18 year old koss pro 4x-plus for my guitar recording and home stereo listening. I always liked the MDRV6s for their clarity and tonal balance. I was surprised that sony still makes these, so based on my past experience I bought a pair, and am completely satisfied.Believe me, as a guitar player the 100-4000 range is critical. Too much mid projection and your guitar tone turns to an AM radio, and too much bottom turns your arpegiated chords and sweep picked notes into conjested mush. The V6s shine at accurate reproduction of notes and clarity of tone.As a semi- nit pickey home audiophile, I wanted a phone that again was accurate and projected a nice acoustic balance over all freqs. The V6s deliver, and at half the price of many inferior competitors. I really like their clarity and detail the most."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sony MDR V6","review":"These are great headphones!I work in the music industry and for the price point, I would rather buy these versus any of the higher price Sony MDR models."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sony mdrv6 monitor series headphone","review":"Good product and clear sound. My son really like this product and I will recommend this also to all my friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very functional for travelers, good price, look good","review":"I bought these headphones for my husband. I was looking for ones with good and detailed enough reviews but still affordable for my budget. Due to his business, he travels pretty frequent and the noise from the surroundings in a plane, especially in very long flights, sometimes can be very disturbing. These don't cancel noise 100% while no plaing (Zvideo or music) but they do pretty good while playing; he can listen pleasantly his music (very good base), concentrate better to read or work and even help him to rest some. They fold nice to carry 'em, they look nice. He finds them still comfortable after more than 6 months using them, they don't hurt or bother him when he falls asleep; we were surprised of how long the cable is, but that helps they don't pull when he moves. He always take 'em with him, he really likes 'em. The only reason i don't give the 5 stars is because not 100% noise-cancelling so they are not excellent, but they are very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sony mdr v6","review":"Good quality sound.. perfect for practice on my room with my piano and sequence with out making to much noise. Good delivery time"},{"rating":"1","title":"Severe issues with Cabling","review":"The sound and performance of these headphones were great for about 6 months. Then the insulated cabling around the joints began to crack severly exposing the inner cabling. I frequently lose signal to the right side of the headphones and I have to bend, twist, stretch and adjust the cable for about 3 minutes in order to restore sound.I think this is a design issue that results when the cabling on each side of the headphones become mashed between the plastic frames and pivoting headphones. If you decide to go this route, the sound is good and I have no other complaints. Just be wary of leaving the cabling slack near the pivot point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meh, they're okay","review":"Still breaking these in but I think the sound is okay compared to my grado sr60/80i's and ATH-AD700's. They seem well made(in Thailand) and are pretty comfortable. I use these at work since they fold up, and block out my coworkers b.s. chatter. The included pouch is nice as well.CCAW voice coil? As far as I could find googling, CCAW is just a weight and or cost reducing feature. Maybe I'm wrong, but I wouldn't put it past Sony to market something like that as a positive feature.I am pretty happy with them for $60 bucks, and once I get my headphone amp this coming week, I'll update the review should it improve the sound. Though I'm no audiophile."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but defective within 1 year; bad Sony support","review":"These are very comfortable headphones, and the sound is natural and deep. Construction seems to be of good quality. I enjoy using these when computer gaming and listening to music.Purchased 1/13/07 through Amazon, I started having my ears shocked at the end of December. It was noticed during Unreal Tournament 3. I thought at first it was a sound driver problem, but after checking it on a home stereo, it also caused the shocks, only much less.I hadn't realized it was a year, so when I contacted Sony today (1/14/08) I found I was a day late for paid labor service. Since they don't offer repair of these anymore, it would cost me fifty-eight plus shipping to get another model. Even if it was within a year, it would have been forty -four plus shipping. I paid about seventy.I'll never buy Sony products again with this kind of support."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good!","review":"Ok, this is a fine set of cans. It is excellent for rock any others, because it can go so high. if you are a dj or something i don't think this offer a good amount of punch. I've listened to the v700 and they are of courese better bass pounding experiment, but sound a lot louder. THis is a great headphones for people who would want natural sounds. when i plug this into my keyboard it's sounds so much better than my other headphones. sometime I think this goes up in the treable way too high, and not engouh bass to back it up because i love dance music with requires lots of bass. But the bass aren't horrable."},{"rating":"2","title":"These things rock!","review":"I have never written a review of any product, but since I use reviews all the time, I thought that I would take a moment and give my opinion.

If there are any cons, they are a little bit heavy.ThanksNathan"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cans for the price","review":"I have been a commercial radio DJ 35 years. I can't remember how many of these I've bought over the years but I have never bought a different variety. Sure I could just buy new ear pads and keep the same ones. But between 30 hours of on air abuse and another 10 at remotes a week over time it's best just to replace them every couple years. If you don't use them in your line of work and only need them for the occasional computer session then you might not have to replace them for years.They are perfect for my air monitor needs. If I were wanting to listen to music only I'd use my Boze set I paid $300. But for studio work when on the air I find these are exactly what I need.They are durable, easy to slap on and off in a hurry and the expandable cord is a must for moving about the studio without getting your headset jerked off by a too short cord."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the little lady","review":"She is highly satisfied with them.....

I guess it takes some getting used to because my ears hurt after watching a TV for a couple of hours.Maybe it was because after I put them on and then leaned back on my recliner which is extra plush with a pillow back headrest , the head band slightly pushed on my ears so after an hour they were painful.I fixed this problem by readjusting them after my head was already on the headrest. Either that or I have become accustomed to the headphones ? I think the sound quality is not as good as the Bose headphones I tried at Fredmeyers .

However, you do have to keep them in your sight. Have you ever seen a fight between a 3 & 6 ? Well it is a lot better than hearing it!

These units were used at normal to just above normal listening / monitoring for artists to track with. In other words, loud enough for the talent to hear tracks to perform to comfortably. The units were never driven to the point of distortion or levels that would be considered excessive. Just at the 5 month mark, one of the headphones had the left driver blow out. The headphones were driven by a Presonus Central Station monitoring system. Obviously others have had a much better experience, just relaying what happened with one of the sets I bought.Update: Now in just under a week after the 1st pair had a speaker blow out, the second pair had the right side ear cushion pop completely off when the studio talent was removing the headphones from his head.

It will let you hear all the things in your tracks the good and the bad of mastering - you can hear them all on Sony's.

When I bought these I was on a budget of under $100 and now that I have more funds I've been shopping around for something better, but everything I've listened to is simply inferior in one aspect or another. Either they're uncomfortable or don't sound as well, but either way I gave up and I have gladly decided to stick with my MDR-V6s. The attenuation from ambient sounds is incredible, especially in a car/plane. You can have the volume either as low as it goes or pumped up and these headphones deliver without missing a beat.

The physical quality of these headphones are very good as well. I use these all the time. The black material covering the foam ear pads is starting to tear at the base of the speakers. I will have to buy replacement foam pieces in the future but the tear has not propagated so I think they should last a while longer.

They get the job done well. When plugged into the 1/4\\" jack the sound is sharp and clear; I personally like my ear/headphones to sound a little on the flat side, so these were perfect, but I'm sure if you're looking for decent bass, and clear mid and highs these could fulfill your needs. But when plugged into my iPod using the standard 3.5mm jack the sound isn't anything special. The sound was nearly on par with my old pair of cheap earphones, albeit a lot less painful to use. Which brings me to my next point, these things are pretty comfortable! Although extended use can sometimes leave my ears sore and sweaty. All in all a solid product from Sony. Oh!

These have a crisp sound that are showing me things in songs I hadn't heard before (I recommend \\"Shooter\\" by Robin Thicke). They look extremely sleek and I can't wait to chose these off to people in the computer lab at Texas A&M."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Great Headphone for Home/Studio use, Not for commuting","review":"It's not a solid 5 star, BUT it still deserves it. At this price, the sound quality is wonderful. I did burn-in with an app on android, using pink noise. Before the burn-in, the sound is good but not smooth enough. Now it just sounds right. The sound is much smoother. Good build quality. Nicely packaged. A decent leather bag is included.Now the CONS or insufficiency:1. don't expect light weight but it is ok;2. cable is \\"telephone wire\\", maybe good for moving around in studio, but ugly and unnecessary for other use;3. the can doesn't hug your head tightly. It is comfy for home use but you probably can't go commuting unless you walk smoothly like a snail.Overall, a great quality headphone for the price.

The silicone is sticky (maybe grippy would be a better word), they look great and they are very heat resistant. The other day I was forced to hold a super hot pan for well over a minute and although my hands did get warm, they were nowhere near being so hot that I couldn't have kept holding it.

Admittedly I am a bit biased on that account. However, considering all of the fiction I have read, this novel clearly shows the author's hard work and editing through its consistently descriptive writing, lack of cliches and paragraphs to skim, good story line, interesting characters, and the general flow of the text.

His legless brother, Garrett, mortgages the family ranch to start up a software company in Austin, Texas. A dastardly take-over jackal tries to buy Garrett out for a mere three million and sabotages his new program when he refuses. Then Garrett is framed for the murder of one of his partners. There are suspense-laden scuba sequences. The real killer interpolates commentary into the text.It is a well-written and ingeniously plotted page-turner and I feel churlish about denying it the fifth star, but the problem for me was a certain lack of originality. We have so many tough male private eyes. The plot involves adopted children and long-lost relatives like Ross MacDonald. The interpolated killer's voice reminds of Thomas Harris. None of this detracts from readability, so as far as entertainment value is concerned it's irrelevant, but it stops me putting Riordan in my pantheon of the great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fragment cd review","review":"Luna Sea fans will definately lap up this solo album from Inoran.

It's understandable, as it's a worthy goal. 99.5% of them fail - perhaps it's a lack of education, maybe it's poor upbringing that has reinforced self-absorption, and it could be that the superficiality which makes them such a good fit in Hollywood directly leads to this end. The only redeeming quality of the film is that it exposes human foibles (and this is not a new concept - it's typically an element of every movie). It seems that movies these days fall on either end of two extremes: telling stories of people who unrealistically do the right thing, or blathering of shallow morons who are poor subjects of empathy. This falls into the latter category.

I have been robbed of 2 hours of my life.This would indeed be a great movie for the health care insurance industry to sponsor, except that it is so excruciatingly, boringly, aggravatingly awful that the underlying message of 'unplug' those who you love will never be delivered.Prior to this evening, the worst movie I had witnessed (and walked out of 20 years or so ago) was TeenWolf.The only dividend paid by this movie was that it has allowed (forced) me to appreciate the movie that was once my most hated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Several good movies rolled into one very bad one","review":"I kept hoping that this film would become good.

I am thrilled because it is exactly like my old one that I am replacing. My other one was 7 years old and the material on the wrist pad was becoming loose and worn. My old one has a softer, cushiony feel to it, but that's because it took a while to soften it up!!This one will soften in time too. It's rare to find the same exact product after so many years, but it proves to me what an excellent product Fellowes has made. The surface of the pad is perfect for gliding my mouse over. I am very happy with this product!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fellowes Gel Wrist Rest Mouse Pad","review":"My favorite mouse pad of all out there.

The gel pad was a little bit high but it's tolerable. After a year of long term use, the gel sunk in the middle and it's not coming back out. I find it hard to use now and looking for another one. If you're looking for a mouse-pad to use for a long time, I wouldn't recommend this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor design.","review":"This product is just too small. A regular 99 cent mouse pad from Walmart is better than this product. I have to constantly pick up my mouse to manuver my screen. I was so frustrated with the item that I pushed it aside and grabbed a nearby magazine to use as a mouse pad. Believe me that magazine did a 100% better than the Fellowes pad. The wrist pad is great, but if you cannot manuver your computer a nice comfortable wrist rest will not be needed. I wish I could return the item. It's creators did a very poor job of thinking through its design after manufactured. So Welcome to \\"Made in CHINA.\\" We send our plans to China, they slap something together and return to America. I do not recommend this item to anyone until or if Fellowes looks at the design flaws of their product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the same as old","review":"Agree with other reviewers. This is NOT the same quality as the original. I ordered a few of these and sent all but one back since a client seemed to like. The biggest downside is the wrist pad is smaller, harder, and does not come off of the plate like it use to. I still have my original (60143) on my desk after 10+ years and am completely satisfied.. was simply hoping to pass on a quality product. No joy here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too hard","review":"I prefer gel to memory foam wrist pads so I thought I would like this product. It is too hard and was very uncomfortable for me to use.

Tommy Flanagan plays impeccably, but his side men trashed the performance. Bass man Betts rushed all the tempi to where drummer Durham had no choice but try and keep up with him. Tommy tried to keep the tempi down but Betts kept playing way to far ahead of the beat to where it felt like a runaway train.Compared to the rest of the Norman Granz series the sound is not the best on this one. The bass is over miched and the overall balance of the three instruments are uneven. The only saving grace were the slow tracks where the tempi remained steady.Tommy deserved better.

Quite how someone who could confront the \\"void\\" with such clarity and seeming courage could end up falling for the most vapid conservative twaddle is quite beyond me. Perhaps he was exhausted by living life standing straight up and felt the need to just throw in the towel? As someone said of Huysmans after such a book one either falls at the foot of a cross or the takes a revolver in the mouth...Novak hit the foot of the cross and apparently left his intelligence behind...Still this is an essential read.

Unfortunately, the book is just one logical fallacy after another. At first, it was still an interesting book, because it showed what a flawed view on the topic would look like, but you can only take so many pages of non-sequiturs, bald assertions and stolen concepts before moving on to better books.I give the book two stars instead of one because he does have some interesting things to say. If you're reading in the sense of having a nice conversation on the topic, the content of which is to be largely forgotten at the end, it might be worth a run-through. But if you're looking to gain knowledge about nihilism, it's not very useful, not very well-integrated, and not at all well-argued.

The book's greatest strength is the way it connects the events in the three kingdoms -- England, Ireland, and Scotland --which is essential to see the overall picture in a confusing time.

The format of this book is like a long essay, which makes it difficult to read, and not very useful as a guidebook. It goes something like: \\"if you take this street, first you'll pass this restaurant, which some people like for the chicken, and then this museum, etc\\" without giving definitive recommendations and must-sees for the tourist with limited time. I'm glad that my boyfriend brought a Fodor's, which was pretty comprehensive.

So it is good. There are other great similar books - where the author/researcher does qualitative research where they really hear people's real stories (as opposed to having people fill out surveys and then add up the stats) - and some have men's and women's stories. And then there are books who just interviewed women. But I liked the unique focus of this book just on men. It's been a while since I read it, but I remember that it was good, and very similar to other researchers who interviewed men and women or just women, but this is just men."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing","review":"As a parent and educator, this album is very refreshing.

Connelly pulls a Michael Crichton---dropping globs of sci-fi blather to distract from a storyline. I found myself skimming or skipping the parts to deal with science--just too boring/not interesting.

They are gritty, taut, descriptive, and darn good reads. When Harry does something \\"stupid\\" it's because he needs to do it, and he has the street smarts to survive and get the job done, though often at a cost.Henry Pierce, the subject of this book, is just an idiot. He does stupid things, and you really can't figure out why. He's a research chemist, and a pretty clever one at that, but Connelly can't really dish up the reasons for his stupid behavior. I have to admit here that I tossed the book at the end of chapter 31 (There are 40 of the dreadful things). By that time I was praying that someone in the novel would take pity on me and just grease Mr. Pierce, but with 90 more pages to go, you know that just wasn't going to happen.The USA Today blurb on the cover should read: \\"Unremarkable....Forgettable.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment","review":"I love Harry Bosch- this was a great disappointment.

That would be a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy to put down","review":"I bought this book by mistake, thinking it would have the same humor, tension, and grit as a Harry Bosch mystery. Instead I got a book in which the protagonist's actions are not only unmotivated but psychologically implausible, the dialogue wooden, and the plot absolutely unconvincing.

While searching for answers, Pierce must enter into a world of increasing danger and soon finds himself under suspicion for murder.Superlatives after superlatives is how Michael Connelly's book have been described .

The last time he deviated from the Bosch or McCaleb genre with Void Moon it was a great stand alone change of pace.Not so in this case. This book never gets off the dime! The characters are weak and thinly drawn. The dialogue is missing Connelley's usual crisp punch. This is an intriguing premise for a story line and one can only imagine what Connelley could have done with it if he had applied half the effort he puts into a Bosch novel.If you want a book that takes no effort to read and a story that neatly wraps up in the last few pages, give this a try just don't expect the exquisitely plotted stories we have come to expect from Connelley."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THOSE YOU CAN\\"T PUT IT DOWN BOOKS","review":"Have given this book to several people, They enjoyed it as much as I did.

He usually writes about very bright police officers. I do not know why he wandered so far away from familiar territory, but he has managed to create a character -- Henry Pierce -- who may be a genius, but is also unbelievably stupid. I cannot accept the reasons that he tries to learn about a missing escort simply because he was given her former phone number. He not only puts his life at risk but his entire company and the careers of his associates. I was so disappointed in Henry Pierce that I began to side with those who wanted to arrest him or kill him. That might have been the most satisfying ending. I won't give up on Michael Connelley -- books he wrote since Chasing the Dime were better, including one that moved into the courtroom. However, I will no longer assume that his name on the dustjacket insures a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you hang on to the end.","review":"He really makes you hang on till you've read the entire book.

Chasing the Dime seems like a book that was written because he had to fullfil a contract. The book lacked character development. The reasons given for our heroes obsession are never explained completely, and the only other character in the book worth a hoot (the detective), disappears and suddenly rears his head without explanation. The book moves along fairly well but is jumpy and disconnected in parts. I think Connelly wrote this without involvement of his talent and, it seems, to make a buck off of his previous works reputation.

It isn't a bad read but don't expect anything at a higher level than the average romance novel. Not that this is a romance novel, it isn't. Throughout the entire book it is simply very difficult to suspend one's disbelief. The premise is okay and might have worked if the execution wasn't so lazy. This is one of the few books in recent memory that I am sorry I purchased and it has definitely turned me off to Connelly. On the flip side, if you can get your best friend to loan you a copy and you are really bored on a dreary Sunday afternoon, go for it. Otherwise, skip it and find yourself something by Jonathan Kellerman (or his wife)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read Connelly's Other Works","review":"I found the plot didn't make much sense and for the first time (in reading Connelly) wishing for the book to be over already.

CHASING THE DIME is in the same class as THE POET, a must read. The subject is right out of today's headlines, headlines in SCIENCE or NATURE, that is. Connelly's protagonist is in the midst of the nanotechnology revolution and, as usual, the money on the table leads to blood on the floor. And on the bed. And in a storage locker.This is very close to perfect, with a few key exceptions. The plot turns on two expectations: that an inventor/scientist named Henry can be a crime fiction hero and that he will have a sense of curiosity so hypertrophied that it will lead him to take unconscionable risks at just those points in his life when he has everything--both romantic and financial--to lose. Both of these expectations are a stretch.The plotting, however, is superb, the subject fascinating, the pacing state-of-the-art. Suspend your disbelief and come along for the ride."},{"rating":"1","title":"insultingly stupid plot","review":"Henry is supposedly a brilliant scientist on the brink of a major professional triumph.

Shockingly, the author makes him behave not as a scatter-brained scientist, nor as high IQ owner perhaps too removed from the world of normal mortals.

I felt like my very young children could have written a more interesting and less silly (I say silly, but at times I was almost embarrassed for the writer that he thought some of the ritual antics of the characters would be amusing) book.

I am a big fan of Connelly, having read every one of his published works. After being bowled over by \\"The Fifth Witness\\" I eagerly grabbed this one, which I had somehow missed. I soon became disappointed with the lame characterisation and untypical prose. All along, I had the feeling that this must have been a once rejected early work. Gradually, clues to this started popping up. In the high-tech world of the novel, nobody seemed to have wi-fi, the technology had a dated feel, there was mention of \\"last year's anthrax attacks\\" and so on. Finally, I found on Connelly's web site that it was from 2002. The fact that it has just surfaced should act as a warning about this one. Read at your peril!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total waste of time","review":"It's difficult to fathom how Connelly's editor(s) let this one pass. It's a totally ridiculous and formulaic book. All I can say is that after reading this drivel, 'Void Moon' doesn't seem so stupid after all.While it may be nice to write a novel without your most famous character, then do it without referring to him or the other novels. If Connelly wasn't writing a Bosch book, then why the inclusion of Janis Langwiser as a character, much less one who refers to Bosch in this novel? That crap didn't float when Patricia Cornwell did it, and it's no less silly here.There must have been some contractual obligation to get a book published at the time this came out, because there's certainly no redeeming value to the reader for this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chasing the Dime is ironic","review":"This book is a terrible disappointment to all of us who enjoyed Connolly's previous stories. Talk about \\"chasing the dime,\\" Connolly is certainly doing just that with this formulaic, flat, boring, disaster of a novel. The plot is simplistic and who cares about the nerdy premise? The characters are thin and predictable. Take the protagonist, for example, who's a super-wealthy, science-whizzbang, handsome, dashing fellow with whom all of us are familar from junk novels. Guess who the villian is: A) the hero's old pal ( also brilliant but depraved ), B) the hero's office women's issues snot or C) the hero's newest vavoom babe? Don't read this book.

The story line just doesn't make sense because the main character is supposed to be a very smart, experienced scientist. I'm not sure who would be so stupid to get dragged into this plot, but scientist Pierce wouldn't even have considered it! And then when you see who the \\"bad guy\\" is and why he did what he did, well give me a break! Connelly has certainly tried to weave intrigue and mystery into this story but it just falls flat.

To buy into this book, you have to believe that someone could devise a plot to destroy someone based on an errant phone number assignment.

Fairly early on, our hero stands at the empty house of a women he doesn't know. He can see in the window that she hasn't been there for days. His response...Let's go inside!

Unfortunately, this one falls very short when compared to his other works.(..)There are two main problems with this book caused by the use of two overused literary clichés. First, everything that happens is built around the real culprit knowing exactly what Henry is going to do every step of the way. (Many of us don't even know what we're going to do ourselves half the time.) Second, the plot also uses what I like to call the \\"Stupid Cop Syndrome\\". This is where a police detective is so focused in on the hero as being a criminal, that he ignores all logic or common sense in developing the case. (Like Henry nearly being beaten to death.)Connelly has written a number of very good books, but the last few have not been up to his prior standards. \\"Chasing the Dime\\" isn't the worst book around, but there are so many books out there that are so much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"More exciting as you go...","review":"This is my first Connelly book to read after my wife's repeated recommendations.

Henry Pierce, the main character, is a hot-shot scientist on the brink of a landmark project and strays off to chase personal demons that have haunted him for years.The first 50 or so pages lay the groundwork for what is to happen and then it becomes a story I didn't want to put down. While the writing is fairly typical for this genre of book, I was kept hooked because of the ease in determining the top 3 choices for \\"who-dunit\\" in an effort to blackmail Pierce.

The story ends up centered more around on-line prostitution, murder and haunting memories than science and what nano-technology holds in store for us (see Prey) but it keeps the story moving and enticing.

There are two major problems. First, the protagonist - a research scientist - makes decisions that are consistently silly and illogical to the max. (Think \\"The 3 Stooges,\\" or the two idiots in the \\"Dumb and Dumber\\" film, for example; unfortunately, this book is not intended to be humorous.) There are a number of turning points where, if he does only what anyone with an IQ over, say, 80, would do, the story is over. Second, this same protagonist is a manipulative, compulsive liar...not exactly an endearing trait for the character the reader is supposed to care about.

Don't you see what you're doing?\\" Totally unbelievable actions and a motivation that even when explained is a stretch. Of course, this total stupidity is what lands him in the mess that it takes his brilliant mind to get him out of. What's really frustrating is the book is still a page-turner.

How can a reader sympathize with a character who makes one stupid decision after another? I constantly found myself thinking, \\"No, don't do that,\\" or \\"Just leave well enough alone.\\" Hell, even Forrest Gump was able to learn from his experiences. Another major flaw is the main character's motivation-- why jeopardize his career at a critical juncture to find a woman he doesn't even know? Basically what is lacking is adequate psychological depth that would give this novel some real weight.Other complaints: 1) There are way too many references to \\"chasing the dime\\" in the first quarter of the novel, 2) female characters and hit men are not Connelly's strong point, 3) the ending left some unanswered questions, and 4) everyone walks in at just the right moment to bring this novel to a tidy conclusion.

He gave up on this book half way through and gave it to me because I'll read anything. I got all the way through (with lots of skimming). This book makes no sense. Maybe there is enough trauma in Pierce's life to explain his very nearly throwing away his life's work for what, at first, appears to be nothing, but his background isn't developed enough to explain it (saying it doesn't make it so or understandable) and there is certainly no explanation for his continuing and repeated stupidity.

I hope this doesn't mean the end of Harry Bosch.

The \\"perfect\\" crema disc is far from perfect - it doesn't allow the stainless steel filter to fit correctly in the holder. After using the machine a few time the steam knob became stripped.

Tasted Great!!!BUT--Less than a week after I received this machine the knob on top for frothing the milk melted! The inside threads stripped and I had to use a wrench to turn the frother off. After several weeks they did send a (free)replacement. But the post the knob sits still on got very very hot and I suspected this would have happened again, so I took the knob off until just before I needed to froth. That sort of worked.Okay, so that was an annoying problem. Then, less than two months after I began using it, it simply stopped working. It would not heat up. The heating element burned out. I assume my earlier melted-knob problem might have been caused by the heating element over-heating and that's why it burned itself out. But the mfr. told me I left it on too long and that's why it burned out and they would not fix it. So I now have a $250 paperweight sitting on my garage floor.Get something else. Great coffee, but very unreliable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works well","review":"We just received the Gaggia 35008 last week. We read all the reviews first and decided that we would try this out. We were concerned with the complete \\"split\\" of those who either completely loved it or hated it. Turns out, the problems that were cited in the reviews - drippy frother, muddy mess, complicated workings - we encountered the first day, but these were all due to operator error (the directions are not as concise or plain as they should be) and after some practice we're enjoying cappuccino every morning. I used to have a Krups espresso maker and I loved it for 12 years (finally broke). Though cheap, that coffee just doesn't compare to this and I find that the \\"ritual\\" of coffee making is not that much more effort with this machine. They spent all the money on the brass insides. Do wish that it had a heavier body - but whadya get these days for 200 bucks?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Melted knob but still good","review":"I still will recommend this product even though the plastic frothing knob melted the first time I used it. Yes, I followed their directions. Be warned to make sure the frothing knob turns freely before powering up the first time since the brass stem gets VERY HOT and can melt the knob. My knob turned and turned but I didnt know it was turning nothing since it melted and I thought the frother was broken. This is a design flaw since a more heat-resistent plastic should have been used. Gaggia reps said they will send a new one so I hope they keep their word. Other than that noise is not a big deal since it lasts about 20 seconds and I don't hear it when I am drinking the coffee. ;) Froth is nice too after you figure the best technique."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gaggia 35008 Carezza Espresso Machine","review":"I am very pleased with my new espresso machine.

Plus, I liked the way the cover looked. Suprisingly I loved the book and whizzed through it in a few days. While I was reading it it was all I could think about. Now, a few months later, I can't really remember much about the book accept that I loved it, unlike most books I read that fast that I can still discuss in detail years later. So, if you're looking for a great but easy read this book is perfect for you. If you're looking for a book that will change your life, this is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breakfast With Scot","review":"(...) Don't read it.

I think his parents died, but I don't know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh and Cry!","review":"Ah, what a gem! Breakfast with Scot made me laugh and cry, frequently while reading the same sentence. When I grow up (if ever) I want to write just like this. Downing is a very gifted man with insight and compassion that can only come from more than one lifetime of experience. Much of the book derives from between the lines...between the chapters. It is about letting people be themselves and what can happen when you try to change them into something acceptable by society. It is about raising children.....it is about family.....it is about acceptance....and about how the human heart can so quickly become attached to another heart and never want to let go. Yes, this is a keeper! It ranks on the top of my 99' list and maybe even the decade. PS: I loved the cheerleading and splits scene! Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Queer as family","review":"Ed and Sam are a gay couple striving to blend in among their middle American, somewhat conservative neighbors and friends. Suddenly, they become the guardians to a unique 11-year old boy. A boy with a love of make-up, wild outfits, and zest for living. Scot shakes up Ed and Sam's relationship, their friends, and their lifestyle, ultimately redefining everyone's notions of family. Downing's story is a zany one, full of poignant moments and hilarious episodes. This book is an utterly delight to read. I found the beginning rather without depth, and I couldn't connect with the characters or the story then, but as I became enraptured by Scot and his effect on Sam and Ed, then I found I couldn't put the book down. This would make an excellent movie, in the vein of \\"The Object of My Affection\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun Novel and Then Some","review":"The reason I liked this book was because it seemed to do exactly what it set out to do: it entertained me. I didn't find the characters particularly engaging or deep and the most interesting thing about the plot was the fact that this nelly little queen-to-be gets dropped into the lives of a gay male couple. Then, almost as a fun extra, Mr. Downing gets to explore the meaning of family, gay and non-gay, and he does so without ever seeming pedantic. Another interesting tributary was a lambent treatment of how two \\"masculine\\" gay men deal with Scot's unabashed, unrestrainable effeminacy. Maybe not deep and thorough, but just enough to fit the story he told: it opened up quickly and unobtrusively toward the end of the novel when Scot observed that he might not be gay and that his effeminacy might be an acting out of other issues. That was a very good move on Mr. Downing's part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gone in 1 year","review":"I have bought this product for 2004 Christmas.

This is not grand music for lavish royal spectacles, but small, intimate music for private worship. Most of the motets recorded here employ three voices and continuo, the ones scored for three sopranos being my favorites. The combination of the high voices together is characteristically French, and very effective. The Salve Regina is a particular favorite of mine, the last part coming to a delicate and pathos-laden end.There are few recordings of Lully's small scale church music, and this is surely the best of them. I know it has been re-released on the Music d'Abord series, and also as a Harmonia Mundi Anniversary reissue.

I believe I am in a good position to review this, being a student at Phillips Exeter Academy in a beginning Chinese course. The book itself is about a smart girl who lives in rural china and would like to attend school. The only problem is that the school (Hangzou) will only accept boys. The girl goes to Hangzou dressed as a man to pass un-noticed in the school. Things start to get interesting when she falls in love with a fellow student. A fun read, but not something I'd read on my own time. It's a good book for chinese teachers who want to teach their students through book reading that I would reccomend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everyone should own this.","review":"This should be the very first book anyone interested in book making should buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for fine arts projects","review":"The book was great as a reference book and had a lot of new \\"cute\\" ideas.

It also speaks on how running brings one closer to true realizations about your life. If your believe running is about more then miles and you see your running as a time of reflection for your mind, body, and spirit then you should pick up this book. Instead of just telling you about that experience it gives a framework from which to understand and appreciate that experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Running Within","review":"Many people start to run because they want to get in a better shape. This book teaches your mind to get in a better shape too. You learn to focus in a new way and you are able to concentrate much better. Your mind learns not to wander so much and stay within the race. I have used the exercises in the book for my preparation of the Boston Marathon which I finished, despite running with an injury, with a new personal best by more than two minutes. I recalled the learned exercises during my preparation in the race and was even able to float up heartbreak hill without considerably more effort. I wonder how I would have raced hadn't I been hindered by a nagging hamstring injury."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Book was great.

It is how she, her daughter and friends marshal the system to survive after a tragic set-back. It is the story of a single, diabled mom and a d bright,inventive, daughter finding a way to make it all work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It!","review":"Not the happiest story in the world but I could not put it down. I can't give much of a review right now as I am at work (haha)but I will say I have always found Elizabeth Berg's novels to be heart-warming but not overly sentimental. You will root for the characters in this book. They are immensely endearing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Parting was such sorrow","review":"Berg is an amazing writer. There were so many passages in this book that either struck me as darkly humorous or profoundly witty. Peacey, especially, was one with a sharp and humorous tongue. Half way through this book I made a mental note to never lend, nor donate it, as will definitely read it again. The story was very appealing and I also enjoyed the era it took place in (60's). It was accurate to that time period. Berg definitely does her research. It was a book I couldn't wait to pick up again (a rare thing) and felt gloomy when I finished it....like I said goodbye to a few old friends forever. I've read a few of Berg's books in the past but now just added about 8 more to my wish list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I love Elizabeth Berg. I have written every book she has ever written. This one was not good. The characters werer there, the potential for a really good plot was there -- but it didn't work. It seemed like it was all just smushed together and given a schamltzy ending so the book could go to market. Really disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my favorite Berg book!","review":"I think the only reason I finished this book was because I was on a 6 hour plane ride. Not my kind of book. Seemed very depressing. I like character studies but this one just did not have enough happen in it. The reason it gets 2 stars is because of Berg's other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Welcome here - but not a pleasure","review":"Upon completion of this book, my brain felt assaulted with the breakneck speed at which the writer told the story. It was written as tho if she didn't hurry up and get it down on paper, she was going to forget what she wanted to say. I understand the \\"theme\\" was supposed to be about redemtion and forgiveness with a splash of 1950's history, but for me, it never completed the mission.Very much in the genre of The Glass Castle by Jeannette Walls, it appears as almost the same story. Different names and setting but so similar it is striking. There was not a single character in this book that was likeable except perhaps LaRue, but he played such a minor part, he got lost.Have never read anything else written by this author. Perhaps she is better elsewhere. But I for one, am only grateful for one thing about this book - it was short and could be read in a few hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"POLIO, CIVIL RIGHTS AND ELVIS TOO ....WOW","review":"I think this is what happens to gifted writers when they sign binding contracts with their publishers to get a certain amount of books written and ready for market in a given time. Miss Berg has given many pleasurable reading hours but, IF you are short on money yet, still feel the need to read this disappointing novel ....borrow it from the free library and wait for something better to fill your shelves .She was given a good idea from true life and mucked it up like a bad soap opera . sorry fans ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing story, but not an amazing book","review":"I LOVE Elizabeth Berg. While this book was not her best, the story of the people about whom this was written was really amazing. I just felt the book was boring, and I think it lacked Berg's wonderful prose and poetry on life. I think she made one reference to life being like fabric on a sewing machine, slipping out of your fingers, or something like that. I always love her comparisons like that, and this book did not contain much where I said \\"Wow - she is SO right!\\" I also don't like books from a child's point of view. I'm 41 and want to read from a woman's point of view.If this is your first Elizabeth Berg book, do yourself a favor and go read something older by her. She really is wonderful, and I look forward to her next novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read by the author on Books on Tape","review":"I listened to this story, which was narrated by the author. While the author does not have a commanding voice, she does a great Peacie voice and it was a most entertaining book. The book flowed well and often I would drive slowly, waiting to hear how a situation played out. My only complaint was the ending, it was a tad trite and quickly written, though a charming ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Winner for Elizabeth Berg","review":"Elizabeth Berg never lets her readers down. She shows a depth of understanding of young women and their feelings as they grow up. I bought this for my daughter who is a young mother; as she unwrapped it, she exclaimed, \\"Wow mom, I didn't know there was a new Elizabeth Berg out!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Even Elvis is Welcome Here","review":"I'm one of Elizabeth Berg's biggest fans, have been since Durable Goods, and have everything she's ever written. But, sad to say, look for this one on eBay soon.Elizabeth Berg is an elegant writer and I can't fault the writing in this book but the story is tough to stick with, improbable and contrived. The civil rights story line seems tacked-on and was distracting. So much in this book is implausible. I'm more than willing to suspend belief if a story is well-told and I'm really sorry to say this about Ms. Berg's work, but this one isn't. And the absurd Elvis situation is just laughable. Whatever enjoyment I got out of this book up to that point was completely overshadowed by that ending.Read Durable Goods or some of her earlier work if you want to see how talented Elizabeth Berg really is."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Disappointing Read","review":"I just finished this book. As usual, with Elizabeth Berg's books, I couldn't put it down. But it wasn't my favorite, and I wouldn't recommend it for someone new to Elizabeth Berg. In the Author's Note Berg explained how the idea for this story came to her from a reader's letter of what happened to her and her mother. Berg said she didn't want to have someone else's idea for a story limit her, but I wonder if that happened. Because she was writing with an idea already in her head, did that limit her usual style? As Diana wrote the second letter to Elvis, I knew the ending and wondered if she would really give up on a story so easily. That made the story seem like a fairy tale with a \\"happily ever after\\" ending. I still love Elizabeth Berg and everything she writes-- there's great stuff in every book-- but I wouldn't recommend this one, especially to people who haven't read her before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed ...","review":"Elizabeth Berg's books are generally to be savored, devoured and celebrated -- this latest was a major disappointment. I reserved it from my library months ahead, looked forward to the trip into another complex, rich and slighly offbeat world -- the kind that Berg creates in all of her novels. It never happened ... I just couldn't warm up to these characters, never found empathy for them ... and the ending -- just plain dumb!This one lacks on all counts. Much as Berg devotes won't want to, I'd skip it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont judge Berg by this book","review":"I have been a huge Elizabeth Berg fan for several years now so when I heard she had a new book coming out, I ordered it without even reading the blurbs. Once I got the book home and I read the authors note about this being a story idea from a fan, I was intrigued to see how it would play out.Well, I am sorry to say that I think Berg tried so hard to tell the story in her own way that she might have lost the most important part, the initial idea. If the book would have just been about Paige and Diana, I think it could have had a lot of potential but Berg brought in a civil rights storyline that in my opinion did not fit and tossed Elvis in to boot.If you have never read an Elizabeth Berg book, and you did not end up liking We Are All Welcome Here, don't let it stop you from trying another. She is an amazing author and I think this one just missed the mark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Picked up on a whim, no regrets","review":"I picked this up off the discount table at the bookstore, was headed out for summer vacation and it looked like an interesting read for the beach. I have to say I don't normally read this author but the premise for this book sounded interesting to me. I was not dissappointed, really enjoyed the story and when I realized it was based loosely on a women's real past history, that just made it even more interesting. It was a quick read, which will leave you somewhat sad, and wondering how would I have dealt with something like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little something different","review":"This novel, though fiction, is based on the real-life story of a woman with polio who gave birth in an iron lung, and insisted on raising her daughter, even after her husband left her. This is a heavy premise, and a little intimidating. Still, Berg's warm voice, amazing insights and affection for her characters (even as she shows us all their flaws) really bring the story to life, and after a while you forget that you're reading about someone disabled.The story is emotionally affecting, and will probably move many readers to tears; but it's nonetheless a beautiful rather than uncomfortable experience. I do have a slight preference for Elizabeth Berg's other books about women navigating the more ordinary vicissitudes of life, but this was an excellent read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I give this one star because Elizabeth berg has so many other better books for you to read!!! This one was awkward and boring, and Elvis!!??? Really??? I really disliked this book, and the swearing in it I also could have done without. It's hard for me to take a liking to the heroine of a story when she swears at people, maybe that's just me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Elizabeth Berg Triumph","review":"I normally cringe when I read \\"Read by the Author\\" on the front of a book on cassette because so many of them have no idea how to read out loud. Elizabeth Berg is a clear exception. She not only presents us with clearly delineated characters, each of them vocally fits the emotional description written by Ms. Berg. Listening to the story is a delight.The story itself is a triumph. Each character is endearing and embued with the Berg warmth. Paige is remarkably optimistic, Diana is properly rebellious, and Peacie is tolerantly loving. As I am listening, I am seeing them all in my mind and I'm happy that they have come into my life for a few delightful hours."},{"rating":"2","title":"in good company","review":"i recently put a trio of cds on our new outdoor system to listen to when in the outdoor jacuzzi - weather report, spyra gyra and karl latham."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good.","review":"Very good book for repairing antique radios.

I paid only $340 for this unit and I got what I paid for. Nothing really works consistently or smoothly. When you play a DVD and are on the menu there is no way to hit ENTER! Also, the touchscreen doesn't seem to work on half of the DVD's I try and play. Odd. All I am saying is save up your money and get the better name brand product. It's worth the wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I originally bought this unit because of its many features including IPOD control and the big one for me - multizone control. I was extremely ecstatic when I got this product. All worked as advertised for the first six months. However, soon afterwards, the unit started to fail after 60 mins of use. Of course, this was a huge disappointment, because most of the DVDs my kids watched is well over that time. I've had this unit from hell a little over a year now and new things seem to be breaking. As of 2 weeks ago, the eject button, the stop button, joystick and mute button have failed. My recommendation would be to avoid purchase of this product at all cost. It is definitely not worth the money. For a few more bucks, you can purchase a more reliable brand like Clarion."},{"rating":"2","title":"The visual side of Web marketing","review":"This is a solid book on Web site design and online marketing, but of course there are many solid books on these topics already published. What distinguishes Ilise's book is its emphasis on the visual. Oversize pages and four-color printing on glossy stock allow you to really see what the Web sites she is analyzing look like much better than a conventional black and white book.

At first, this seems like a fairly straightforward account of forbidden passion, but then we discover the existence of Mitsuko's male lover, Watanuki. At this point, the figure of Mitsuko becomes increasingly enigmatic as the reader attempts to discern which of her actions are motivated by passion and which are calculated to keep herself enshrined as an object of desire at the center of a convoluted human drama. The schemes and manipulations become ever more outrageous until, by the end, we are forced to conclude that \\"Quicksand\\" is a very dark comedy, despite author Junichiro Tanizaki's cold, controlled style. The suspicions that the narrator reveals on the very last page of the novel shows just how tenuous her grip on reality has become."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good translation and a good book","review":"This book is very good for a number of reasons. It is funny and maliciously dark, yet at the same time shows humanity and it's weaknesses. What makes it even more interesting, though, is the translation: Idiomatic phrases like \\"I knew something was up\\" crop up all over the text, and though I really don't know what I am talking about, as I don't know Japanese, I can't help thinking that Howard Hibbet deserves some sort of award for such a cool translation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Light Output","review":"Purchased this for the supervisor so that it will always be charged.

As other reviewers have noted, the graphics are wonderful, the content rich and engaging (and I'm saying this 10 years after the game was released!). In terms of \\"puzzle difficulty\\" it is not bad at all. You can adjust your preferences as the player to get more hints or fewer, so in that respect, you can control the difficulty of the game.Those who are accustomed to more difficult puzzle/problem-solving games might find this a bit \\"light\\", but I would encourage those players to focus more on the content than on how easy it may be to get to the end. Take your time and enjoy the experience!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read","review":"For those readers who like a little analysis of their movies, as wrll as the usual review, this is it. This focuses on what the title says, Women Scientists In Fifties Science Fiction Films. And the way she defines them, there are a lot (including those who just work for a scientist in some capacity). The book is well-written, and the analysis of these films is not so academic that it would turn off the casual fan. I thought it could use more photographs, but I'm a huge 50's sci-fi fan and will always want more photos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would have been better had it been larger","review":"The stickers may be larger than a postage stamp - but not by much.

But it fails on the very basic must-have use of a phone...connecting. I have a Nokia 6010 & this one, both active with T-Mobile. The reception of Samsung t809 is far inferior to the Nokia one. In the same place, I can see 5 bars on my Nokia against one on Samsung. And this is consistent. As if that wasnt enough...if you try to connect with anything less than 3 bars, the phone just goes blank and does not connect at all. In a nutshell, you can use it for everything but making calls and receiving calls.So, overall, I would not recommend this phone to anyone, except if you are more interested in using it more as a camera or digital diary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Returned","review":"This phone dropped LITERALLY every call I made. I had to call 611 at least a dozen times during the 4 days that I owned this phone.The organizer and contact features are years behind in usability compared to SonyEricsson or Nokia.

Anyone who would charge some much for this POS really doesn't deserve my business."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice phone but be warned....","review":"Very spiffy, though the menu isn't very intuitive. BUT - and this is a big BUT - if you want to use Bluetooth to connect your pda or computer to the internet, avoid this phone and/or avoid T-Mobile. T-Mobile DOES NOT support this function on this phone. I spent 5 hours on T-Mobile tech support with a tech who said the phone definitely should do this and that the fact that mine wouldn't meant the Bluetooth on my phone was not working right. But T-Mobile customer service refused to exchange the phone. They said that the only things the phone's Bluetooth will connect to are headsets and other Samsung phones. What's more, they told me they had checked with Samsung and Samsung said the same - although its website says the phone connects to computers via Bluetooth. So if that function is essential, buy another phone (asking T-mobile first to check its internal documents to make sure it supports the function) or go to another provider."},{"rating":"2","title":"Value for Money","review":"This phone is a real VFM. Great looks and cool features.Lots of pluses the only negative aspect being its battery life. compared to my previous nokia phones, t809 battery life is far less.

First off the battery is HORRIBLE. You have to charge it every day and if you are using a blutooth headset, you have to charge it every two hours. Now listen to this. I slid the phone up and started dialing, and the screen broke. I was extremely disappointed because for the amount of money i spent on the phone I did not expect the screen to break. I made the made the mistake of calling t-mobile which were very rude and said that since the screen cracks it is physical damage.

I loved the clarity of the pictures, even though the 1 megapixel camera was pretty lousy, and I even liked the video feature. But the phone is only good IF YOU CAN USE IT!!!

I went to a genuine T-Mobile retailer and after working on the phone for a good half-an-hour, they were still unable to get the battery cover to fit. The sales rep had a t809 himself and was easily able to get his personal battery cover to fit. Clearly, a manufactuering defect by Samsung. I contacted Samsung for a replacement... after six weeks of hassling them over the issue, the end result was that \\"the t809 battery cover is not included in the warranty.\\" What?! End result, I get to duct tape my battery in place. Thanks. If you're going to spend serious money on a high end phone... go with a brand name that actually stands behind their product.

It's about a publishing magnate's life that is tossed upside down when he is accused of murdering a woman he's had an affair with. At first, the charges appear to be trumpt-up, that is, until his own son shows up in court as a witness against him! Greg Evigan (from \\"BJ and the Bear\\") is exceptional in his role as an adversarial character. Although it's somewhat of a cookie-cutter suspense script, it's still very enjoyable.

The great 11th century French teacher answers the question of why, if God made two great lights --- one to rule the day and the other the night --- He made them large and small.God created the moon and sun the same size, Rashi explains. But then the moon objected to being equal in size to the sun. For this lack of humility, God reduced the moon's size and its shine from a blinding light to a soft glow.In this story, two children ask their father why the moon appears smaller and less bright than the sun. Their father, Abba, answers in a lovely rhymed poem that teaches even small children to be happy with what they have, and not to begrudge others their good fortune.--- Alyssa A.

As a result they have little idea what was going on on the Spanish side.This book gives a comprehensive history, backed by reproduced documents, of the development of the Viceroyalty of La Plata's defences in the 18th Century.Beverina is a first rate military historian of the old school who would be far more widely known in the Anglo-Saxon world had he written in English and not confined himself almost exclusively to Argentine history.I first ran into this book twenty years ago at university.

The trumpet in \\"Miss Riddle\\" is to die for. Songs like Desire, Sarah, Call That Love, will get into your soul, tempt you while they stir you, and beg you to play them again and again and again.

If you thought Come On Home and Some Change were cool, then you might like this disc. At least Some Change had one truly beautiful song in Sierra, but there's no tune on here to even come close to that, let alone a classic like Silk Degrees' Harbor Lights or We're All Alone. This album is instantly forgettable -- no hooks, no riffs, no soaring melodies. The only semi-memorable song is Get On The Natch, because it is so laughably inane and lame; here, Boz tries to disguise his voice as Texas geese farts.Boz traded in his silk slippers for a lounge jacket a long time ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Miss Riddle","review":"This is one of those songs that when you first hear it, stays with you for a long time.....first heard and knew I had to have the album.Of the 11 tracks, 5 are winners....check our \\"Get on the Natch\\", different for Boz, but will wake you up in the morning!Highly recommend this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dig It!","review":"If you love Jazz and R&B you owe it to yourself to get into this album.

It's not exactly happy music but is quite minimally beautiful.

Yes, occasionally his singing is very good; the songs and performances lack soul and fire, and there is very little lead guitar or soloing of any kind to pick up the enormous slack. Sadly, this record is for \\"must have\\" fans only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed.","review":"Silk Degrees and Slow Dancer remain among my favorite albums. (I am, however, so old that I refer to them as \\"albums.\\") Accordingly, I was thrilled by the comparisons of Dig to Silk Degrees. I was, you guessed it, very disappointed. I found the songs on Dig to be almost universally unremarkable. I found Boz's voice to have retained the muted tones that made it distinct but to have lost the slight edge that prevented it from being, well, muted. Some orchestrations were interesting, but the whole thing lacked the singular style or thru-line that a singer or group needs. Truth is, I gave it two stars instead of just one for purely nostalgic reasons; its lacking made me dust off some of Boz's old stuff again."},{"rating":"1","title":"airport reader . . .","review":"> Positives: nice glimpses of buddhism in different countries, well researched, taps into the desires to better understand the \\"big questions\\", held attention during a long plane ride> Negatives: rarely goes into depth regarding the many strains of buddhism described, doesn't seem to leave reader with much at the end> Big annoyance: 50+ year old white author's views on Asian women.e.g. \\"I was becoming enamored with the beauty, charm, and mercurial quality of Chinese woman.\\" . . .the same later happens with a Vietnamese woman. . . these parts were not needed and definitely turned me off (or would've rated book a bit higher).For a buddhism related book, would recommendHappiness: A Guide to Developing Life's Most Important Skill"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not ready for prime time","review":"Doesn't do much to reduce glare.

The only solution is to fight fire with fire and a hunting duo is also brought out of stassis to halt this deadly assasin. Hinz weaves a wonderful tale.

Back in the 90's I had read it a few times and wondered how it now stands in the pantheon of sci-fi history that come before and since. Well I can honestly say there is still nothing to touch it. Brilliantly plotted, intelligent and descriptive world building, visceral action sequences, fast paced with not a page of fat (harkens back to the 60-70's era where sci-fi writers had honed their skills with short stories, unlike today's 1000 page soap opera's). The above sounds like a reviewer cliche but in this case it's true!I still cannot believe this is a debut novel, such is the mastery displayed here. Forget that extremely bad cover artwork and just buy it. Liege-Killer is a stand alone novel, with 2 more books completing the trilogy thought they never reached the heights of this one.The sad part is after releasing this masterpiece series in the late 80's, Christopher Hinz just disappeared off the face of the earth."},{"rating":"2","title":"A warrior from history battles an alien menace and his past.","review":"Make no mistake, Liege-Killer is a very strange novel. The name gives little indication to just how bizarre it is, but it's an excellent insight into a new alien race (which consists of two beings who are similar to siamese twins, but can merge at any time) that has a few surprises of its own. Enter our hero, a cryogenically frozen man out for vengeance (the Paratwa killed his wife), and a dwarf. Their specialty: to kill the unkillable Paratwa. This book has a pounding rhthym that matches its hero's mantra: I move, I am, I want, I take, I see, I learn, I grow, I make.

Took it back to the store and they replaced it. Printed more 4X6 prints and exactly 2 full size sheets and the printer again refused to feed the paper. The store refused to give me a refund - only a replacement and HP was equally unhelpful. Have since had several people tell me these printers are famous for this problem.

The book tries to make Americans feel guilty for something that modern Americans had nothing to do with. The book feels preachy and at times strays from the facts.I'm very disappointed with the book.

It's disgusting. The recipes are loaded with fake and processed ingredients. (Have you ever seen margarine melting in a pan? It's gross.)The book is also misleading, blurring as it does the difference between saturated and unsaturated fats. Olive oil, inaddition to being an actual food as opposed to one with a bunch of artificial ingredients like Pam's recipes, is a healthy thing. You can cook intelligently and in a healthy way without foregoing pure, healthy ingredients.Lastly, there are many things that go into being healthy. Exercise, for instance. If \\"low-fat\\" were the factor Pam hypes it as, the French wouldn't have a significantly lower incidence of heart disease.

This cookbook is average, at best! There are MANY other low-fat cookbooks on the market that far outshine Butter Busters. The texture and flavor of many of these recipes rarely even resemble the \\"real thing.\\" Breads and cakes are often spongy and some recipes are over-spiced (as if the cook is trying to hide something). The whole concept of using Butter Buds in place of ALL fats just ruins the taste and flavor of many recipes. If this is your first low-fat cookbook, don't throw in the towel just yet! This is a bad first impression! Low-fat cooking CAN be delicious...Butter Busters is not."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Truly Exceptional and Timely Collection by Roger McGuinn","review":"This collection of traditional folk songs, originally recorded and posted on the Folk Den website, and now rerecorded for The Folk Den Project by Byrdmaster Roger McGuinn, is truly exceptional, timely and masterfully performed. Many of the songs collected on the set have been rearranged and reworked by McGuinn with very positive results. In a number of instances the new recordings are far better than the original Folk Den versions due to the availability of new recording technology, such as in the case of the deeply moving \\"Ain't no more cane.\\" An exception, however, is \\"America for me,\\" which in my opinion is better in the originally recorded version (Roger's Rickenbacker 12-string is wonderful there). A must-have collection for those who love folk music with Byrds/McGuinn echoes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very delightful folk music","review":"This is a very enjoyable 4 disc set.

With the absolute highest point here being We're Calling You, other high points are Nursery Rhymes which goes into, \\"Hush little baby don't say a word, silk is gonna buy you a mockingbird\\", which caught my attention. And Treated Like a Lady. Also, check Afterplay and Don't Go with Toni's little sister Tamar Braxton who unexpectantly holds her own with Silk's amazing vocals, she gives it a great shot, the end result is a great cut. Overall, the only problem with this album is that it needs more songs, but after the monster that was Tonight 10 songs with 3 interludes is probably acceptable. For any true fan of rhythm and blues, this is truly one of the first must have releases of 2001."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still' Keepin' it Hot!","review":"This being Silk's third Cd, They are still keepin' it hot.

This study points to poor self-esteem as the cause of poor school performance. But it does NOT tell you that black boys were found to have the HIGHEST self-esteem, but the LOWEST school performance! This book focuses on just girls, although most of problems pointed out are also experienced by boys.(Latina gangs? What about Latino gangs? Now THAT'S a problem!) This book seems to be highly \\"subjective\\" in form. Her suggestion that girls are afraid of giving the wrong answer to questions (hardly a girls-only issue) and hence refrain from answering questions conflicts with the opinion of the AAUW report (which inspired this book!) that suggests that girls don't answer questions so as to not appear to be too smart and aggressive!

This book employs a familiar and effective--but flawed--journalistic technique to build its case. Vivid interviews with individuals of one gender at two schools are coupled with broad-brush generalizations about all girl students and all boy students at all schools. The reader is encouraged to assume that the girls suffer greater anxiety in middle school, because only girls are interviewed. A book that only reported interviews with these girls' male classmates could have built up an equally powerful picture of anxious, underachieving boys at the same schools. This is not quality reporting.

She thinks it is great that there is a class where boys have to act out womens roles and write essays for NOW.

On one hand I feel Ms. Orenstein underplays the self-esteem difficulties teenage boys experience in middle school and later high school. After all many of them engage in drug use which often is a sign of a low self image. As an educator, I often run into boys who think very little of themselves.On the other hand, I know many female students who are constantly applying make-up in my class and flirting with the boys as their grades melt away. And I see other teachers who, to my horror, call the female students \\"sweetie\\" and \\"honey\\" and constantly comment on their looks instead of their minds. That is why I am recommending this book. Ms. Orenstein does have some flaws in her book, but she puts a spotlight on a grave problem in our society. The fact that teenage girls are taught and encouraged to be body conscious at a time when they should be taught to develop and trust their intellect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coming of age is bad news -- but there is a better way.","review":"First studying girls in an affluent, suburban jr. highschool, then the same age group in an inner-city school,Orenstein shows the terrible oppression that grinds downyoung females in America, despite their struggles to over-come it.

But in this book, the hero and heroine--really, those terms are too strong--were barely in existence. Why would anyone love either of them? What was so special about them? Both seemed passive and cringing, and it was difficult to see why each found the other transcendant. But at least it was short. Thane's strength was in history--even in her magnificent Williamsburg series, the earlier books were better and more vivid than the contemporary volumes.

A call from the store didn't help Samsung understand that the TV is still covered. Our six month old $1699 TV, is now going to cost us $717 to fix. Thanks Samsung...from a guy who bought two laptops and two TVs and a microwave from you...never again."},{"rating":"1","title":"defective","review":"Excited to wait for ship't arrival today.

I haven't played around with the settings, I found the picture type I like and that's it so far.I ordered it online on a saturday evening, and I had it delivered to me the following Thursday, very impressive, and ahead of the expected delivery date from Eagle couriers.

I don't know if this is common in LCDs or not, but it can be annoying at times.Also needs better speakers. Not saying what it has isn't good, but it needs better ones for such a great television.Overall though, it's a great value buy. Great picture and a great price.

Gotta say that the whole shopping/shipping experience with this TV was pleasent. The TV arrived about a week after I ordered it, and was delivered in perfect working condition. The TV itself is beautiful, and blows the Sony LCDs out of the water.

He was present with unpacking and told her the TV was completely defective; no images could be viewed, only multiple colors appeared on screen. I live outside the U.S. and told her to call Samsung and they told her they could only 'repair' it, not exchange for a new one. I was indignant that I had to pay for a new (not used)TV that was defective and had to be repaired prior to even turning it on. I tried amazon returns but the site is down. I hope for a resolution because I am really upset that a new tv can be delivered completely defective, and i no longer want a samsung and expect a full refund and hope i don't have problems with amazon with this.

I got it for an excellent price on Amazon with free standard shipping. I was a little worried abt Eagle shipping delays(seeing some of the user reviews). Surprisingly, they delivered it in less than a week and their service was good too. Abt the TV, the picture quality is awesome and best among all the 32\\" LCDs I'd researched for a couple months. The TV speakers are awful though. They make a very annoying buzzing noise and are of inferior quality. But, this shouldn't be a problem long as one has an external speaker system.

The set arrived in Orlando at the earlier part of the promised delivery window, and the actual physical delivery to my home was on time.Less than a month after my purchase I repeated the process for a 40\\" model of the same set. There is nothing like repeat business to tell a service business that they are on track."},{"rating":"2","title":"Samsung LNS3251D","review":"After researching LCD TVs of this size for a few days, I decided on this one after seeing it in action at the store. I came home and checked prices online and realized this TV, brand new, was around $500 cheaper on Amazon than at Best Buy. The shipping takes a while if you get Eagle, but the savings is worth the wait.The only big problem I've read about with this TV is that some apparently have dead pixels, but not mine. The quality is nice. I have it hooked up to my Xbox 360 and set to \\"Game Mode\\" and the graphics are simply amazing.People are saying the sound is lackluster and they are probably right. I have always used the speakers on my TV so I have no point of reference, but they have served me well.All in all, this is an excellent TV for anyone looking to go high-def without paying the ridiculous prices they charge at chain stores."},{"rating":"2","title":"Choose the right size","review":"The Samsung 3251 provides a great picture, but will benefit greatly when coupled with a home theater sound system. I wondered what size would be best for my family room and now wish that I had purchased a larger model. The 32 inch widescreen actually becomes a 27 inch size for programs that are not in high definition format. Until all programming is in high definition, it is going to feel a little small. I believe the 40 inch model would have been about the right size for my average-sized family room. With that said, I am very satisfied with the picture quality, variety of inputs, and the appearance of the television. The speakers do not deliver the same quality experience, and I highly recommend running the audio through a surround sound system with an optical cable. There is definitely a pleasing difference in high definition, and even though programming is lacking, it is now sufficient to make the purchase worthwhile."},{"rating":"1","title":"If it doesn't ship UPS, buy elsewhere","review":"Picture is very similar to my old Sony.

This is not a problem in itself, but it will prove to be of little benefit to anyone who needs to construct a banking application using a real object-oriented language such as Eiffel or Smalltalk."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic, but a little difficult to read","review":"The author has what I would call an \\"academic\\" writing style which makes the book a bit more difficult to read than it needs to be. It is full of great information, but sometimes you will have to read a paragraph several times to fully understand it. This is not necessarily bad, but if you prefer a more practical or conversational style you should probably find another book.The book thoroughly covers all of the fundamental concepts of object oriented design in a language-independent way. Although there are some C++ code samples they are brief and it is not necessary for the reader to have a C++ background to learn the OO concepts presented in the book.Even though there are newer books out there you still should consider this one because the concepts presented such as encapsulation and polymorphism have not changed and are well covered in this classic work."},{"rating":"2","title":"nice book on programming methodology","review":"This is an vary cool book on object oriented methodology. It takes you from scratch and teach great aspects of programming methodology , before reading this book i was not knowing anything about object orianted methodology ,now I have enough knowledge on this topic so that i can understand any descussion on object orianted techniques. Basically this book gives me the way to think in objects."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overrated somewhat dated book of great historical importance","review":"This book is of immense historical importance. The author is brilliant and influential. Still I do prefer Bertrand Meyer, Meilir Page Jones and Martin Fowler. They are much clearer and to the point.It is difficult to fairly judge this book. So many of the ideas are now commonplace that it is hard to see the unique points of the author. Clearly the Booch notation is unique. But this notation is now also a problem. It is superseded by UML. It is also difficult to figure out the authors' unique point, because this book is filled with myriads of citations. Some of the cited works I know quite well and strangely enough reading Booches version of their work makes their special appeal disappear."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of words to explain a few graphical notations...","review":"Like a lot of books ( Yourdon, Ward - Mellor , etc.. ) about analysis and design: a lot of words ( 589 pages ) to say very few new thinks and to explain a few graphical conventions that could be explained in 10 pages. If you are a beginner you can find all the provided ideas at the same time that you read a tutorial about C++ and learn a concrete OO language, for example the Stroustrup book. I agree with another reader comment saying that Booch ego is notable. He uses the third person ( majestic plural) when refers to him... He provides a bibliography so big that goes form Aquinas and Plato to Wirth to give you an idea about what you need to read to become a methodology guru."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book but not a great book..","review":"Have had this book on my bookshelf since 1995. Won several notable jolt awards which says it deserved a look..First of all, this books is kind of old(1994) and still illustrates using OO diagramming techniques before UML unified the major offerings. The C++ used in the book is not a problem.. its the concepts that are important and are generally well explained.Second of all, OO methodologies IMO are immature (especially back then) compared to more mature functional analysis and design methodologies(like IE) and this book shows it. Nonetheless, it is a good book to get you up the initial learning curve of OO.It may not be a dummies book(as some reviewers previously lament) so if your looking for a dummies book look elsewhere. In my opinion it is sparsely full of good OO information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strawberry/Banana Yogurt Dips","review":"My birds love these treats and would throw a temper tantrum if they didn't get them every morning for breakfast!

I never really saw what the commotion was about with Bright Eyes, The Faint has far superior creativity and musicianship. But that's just my opinion. Blank Wave Arcade I wouldn't reccomend for new listeners, but it's an excellent album nonetheless. All the tracks you can hear the influences of The Cure, Duran Duran, OMD, and New Order; but Cars Pass In Cold Blood sounds like a Depeche Mode throwback (I bet Dave Gahan would have loved to have corroborated!) and it happens to be my favorite track on the album.Danse Macabre is a superior album, and Wet from Birth is their most accessable to date, but that doesn't mean BWA should be overlooked.

While any one of the books in the series can be read alone, in this 3 book trilogy there is a lack of real completion. As a result, at the end of chainfire and phantom there isn't a satisfactory closing to make it a stand alone book though I suspect that book 3 will provide a full resolution.This brings me to one conclusion. TG should have waited until all 3 books were done before releasing them.That being said, I like where phantom takes the trilogy. It is a good build up for content in the 3rd book.

At one point there are 60+pages of preaching and retelling the anthems from the series. Felt like a bored grade-schooler waiting for the end of the school year to finally #@!!# learn something new. Not sure if it's worth the wait anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolutly... disapointing","review":"Well, to make it short I've been waiting for this book for a long while. After less than 50 pages I had already some doubt about the quality of this book.Goodkind keeps watering the story by paraphrasing Faith of the Fallen and other books of the serie. To sum it up, nothing or near to nothing happens in the 576 pages (especially if you compare it to wizard first rule)So Mr. Goodkind, it's time now to finish the serie, I hope that you'll manage to at least end it well (but I doubt it, since the last 4 books weren't good at all)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally Moving Onward","review":"I really enjoyed the book, but the best part is the note at the end, \\"Be sure to look for the next and concluding book in the Sword of Truth Series.\\" I feel that the earlier books were dragged out too long, and that the series would never end. I kept reading eagerly, because I wanted to see how things turned out, but a couple of the books could have been condensed considerably. It looks like TG is starting to wrap things up for the grand finale and I look forward to it's publication."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally we're moving again","review":"I won't rehash plot lines and development you can read the book for that. I will, however, take slight issue with Goodkind's heavy handed philosophy. And actually it isn't his philosophy but just reguirgitated Ann Rynd. There is a place for theology and philosophy in fiction and even fantasy, but the masters are subtle with it, letting the reader discover their own feelings and interpretations. Goodkind is as subtle as a brick to the head. Page after page after page of how the Order believes and why that is so bad, and the other point of view ad nauseum. We get it already, just tell the freaking story! Nothing new is added with these endless digressions of a philosophy we have been told time and time again by virtually every character in the books. I do enjoy the overall stories, and they would be a 5 star rating with a better writer at the helm."},{"rating":"1","title":"The imperial order is evil and that's about it...","review":"The first half of the book is devoted entirely to describing, YET AGAIN, how awful the Imperial Order is. The saying \\"thou dost protest too much\\" kept coming to mind. I am so sick of hearing about how bad the Order is I've almost started hoping they win so I don't have to hear about it anymore!Plot progression was almost non-existant. Very little happened in a book of so many pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Read!","review":"I found this book in the Chainfire Trilogy to be up to the authors usual standard.The one con that made me rate it 4 stars rather than 5,is the pages of detail spent explaining the workings of spells and prophecies.I feel it is really unnecessary filler that doesn't really add to the storyline.I was also pleased to find at the end of the book that the next book will complete the series.As much as I have enjoyed the series,I was ready to see it completed.I am anxious to see where Terry Goodkinds extrodinary talent will take us next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy the Audio Book","review":"I love Terry Goodkind so I bought this latest audio book, but I can't even finish it. The reader is sooo boring. He has a monotone voice that you just pray will end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrendous","review":"I loved this series up till about 5 or 6I liked this series up till about 8I liked 9 barely enough to get through itI loathed 10 so much I could not get halfwayThis is only about the 3rd book in my life that I have not read all the way through, and I read a lot. Mr Goodkind you should be ashamed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing ovreall with sparks of quality here and there","review":"I am about ready to give up on this series, but I think I can make it one more book. This one was again disappointing. It rambled on and on over the exact same tired ground covered in other books. Then there would be a bit of action that was interesting and might have a good twist. Then it would ramble some more. I skipped whole paragraphs and pages and missed none of the plot. If you have stuck it out this long with the series, sure, so ahead. Otherwise don't bother."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book 10 Phantom","review":"This book started out with a lot of promise then after getting half way through it started to really drag and it had a lot of preaching still. Even the gory scenes of the order killing people got repeptative. We get it the order is bad. I found myself skipping ahead and not reading several pages just to try to keep the momentum of the book going. This book reminds me of a musical that has too many show stopping numbers. A phrase that all good writers should follow is don't use 100 words when 1 would do. Mr. Goodkind should follow that saying more often. But all in all the book was better than chainfire. I really do like the series but there should only be about 8 books. Then a 2 book collection of the wizards philosphy."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's almost over","review":"As it turns out, Goodkind actuall wrote a review of Phantom himself--here it is, on page 147:\\"...went on in endless detail...the senselessness of it was almost too monumental to comprehend, much less endure.\\"Enough said. . .oh, wait-here's some more. If your plot bogs down, and as an author you've written yourself into a corner, then here's a couple of tips:1. Bring back several characters you haven't heard from in several years - they'll be glad to help the plot along.2. Discover that there is a previously unknown book called, \\"Everything you need to know to defeat the enemy, but were afraid to ask.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"I just want to tell the characters to shut up already!","review":"Ok, so my first problem is probably the fact that I bought the book on a cd to listen to as I drive to work. I did this with Chainfire and I loved it. But in Phantom, the characters just go on and on with their preaching. With a book I would just skim over the paragraphs (pages... chapters...) that incessently drone one, but that doesn't work with a cd.I'm currently about half way through the novel. I know I will finish it and I will probably buy the next book just to get closure. But boy am I dissapointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"PHANTOM is a ghost of a good Goodkind novel...","review":"Like so many others, I have loved this series from the get-go. Wizards First Rule, followed by my favorite of the 10 books, Stone of Tears, set solid precedents in the very fabric of the fantasy genre.Then the slow decline ensued. Some books were better than others. Richard started yammering about his belief systems in large sums of paragraphs, making most of us yawn. But still, the overall core of the story and its characters were good.PHANTOMS is without a doubt, the weakest of them all. I prectically skimmed the entire 587-pages of this vast volume of which about only 10% of it was interesting. What a shame.Just when the series has 1 book left in it, one would think that Terry Goodkind would put his very best into it. And perhaps, according to him, this is! (Lord, I hope not.)There are some good scenes in the book. But they are unfortunately few. I hope the very last book in this once great series ends with a bang. It truly needs it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed Readed -- Warning this reveiw has spoilers!!","review":"I Just finished the book, and i'm a bit dissapointed. Nothing new is really added, and the plot of this book is the same as his previous books. Richard and Kahlan are seperated AGAIN, Richard looses his powers AGAIN, Kahlan Looses her powers AGAIN, Goodkind spends half of the book talking about Objectivist pychological nonsense AGAIN, Violet terrorizes Rachel AGAIN, Rachel saves a box of Orden AGAIN, The Chimes are destroying magic AGAIN, Lengthy descriptions of the evils of the Imperial Order AGAIN.I could go on, but what upsets me the most is the last quarter of the book is rushed. The first chapers are long and boring, but at least they are well developed. The last quarter chapters are short and not developed at all. It's pretty much just an outline of the chapter.Sometimes a good author needs to know when to quit writing a series"},{"rating":"1","title":"they get worse and worse","review":"ok the first book is still one of best books ive ever read.the potential was mesmerizing, the characters possibly the best ever in fantasy series.now this is my first review ever i just couldnt resist.since book one the magic and chemistry of the pages was the interaction between richard and kahlan. now book after book and its the same regurgitated story.and guess what no richard and kahlan.now after reading phantom im convincedterry goodkind is trying to build a cult of nazi followers.perhaps he wants to be the next l ron but who knows.and to think i fealt this way before richard rasised his fist in the air during his speach.which was the highlight of the last say 6 booksi know this isnt a love story.but it doesnt have to be propagandalet alone regurgitated propaganda.terry id love to say im so disapointed in you but ive been saying that to myself since book 2ill continue to see where this goesbut hopefully all this banter wont change my veiws on democracy lol"},{"rating":"1","title":"Real slow read","review":"The only thing that kept me from throwing \\"Phantom\\" in the trash,is that I paid $9.00 for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Service from Amazon.......hated the book.","review":"Terry Goodkind has exhausted this storyline. How many times do the main characters have to suffer unspeakable agony and be separated to make a point. No spoilers but it would have been nice to have some plot resolution this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the previous books","review":"Well, this one is giving me a hard time.I enjoyed all the other Sword of Truth books, but Phantom leaves a bitter taste.I am tired to read again and again about the religious ideology of the order and how bad and cruel Jagangs army is.Come on, this is interesting the first time, it is also ok to mention it again briefly in another book, but if I have to read it a third or even a fourth time in great detail it gets boring and annoying.You could easily cut out 200 pages from this book without loosing any new information.Don't get me wrong - I think Terry Goodking is a great author, but I think Phantom does not meet the high standards of his other books. He just did not focus enough on the story. There were too many detailed descriptions of unimportant things and too many repetitions.Well, I think fans should (and probably will) read it anyways. It is ok, but I hope that the following books will be better..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phantom","review":"What a looser,and a thief.Still couldn't come up with but one chapter of new material for the whole book.After all these books in the series came out the publisher should have trimed it all down to five(5)books as of book four(4) there is but one new chapter in each book.Who wants to read the last book?I don't,and I have them all except the last.It's boring Goodkind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as Chainfire, but...","review":"...does it ever set up for what will surely be a spectacular conclusion! I can't wait for the next (and, sadly, final) book in the series.This book contains several great new characters and plot developments, including Richard's new foreign policy direction for the D'Haran empire (it's about damn time!) which is highly relevant to the real world today, and a shocking twist at the end.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plod development...err Plot","review":"To preface -- Wizard's first rule remains one of my favorite (of hundreds) that I've read in this genre. Sadly, the magic is long gone.Book 10 seems to be the culmination of a series of books dedicated to an ever-increasing number of pages of characters hanging around and pondering things. Unfortunately, nothing else is happening. Though the not-so-subtle metaphors to the human struggle for liberty and freedom from oppression did get me thinking, I still ended up rather bored. Philosophical debate between characters (and little else) doesn't make for a particularly interesting story nor does it leave much room for interpretation.Most interestingly was the jacket-liner note which indicated that the next book would be the last."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good writer who doesn't know how to end his work","review":"Wizard's First Rule was excellent; Phantom (aka Wizard's Tenth Rule)is fair-decent character development, good texture of description. But, as is the case for many modern, popular authors, Mr. Goodkind doesnt know how to wrap up his story. Maybe we should blame L. Ron Hubbard with hs Decology written 20 years ago (although, admittedly, Goodkind is a much better author)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much dialogue, too little action","review":"I've read some of Goodkind's work before. I know he can write better than this. The story of this book was so short but taken up by a lot of dialogue filler, it's as if he wanted to make a trilogy so bad he put in a bunch of nonsense.673 pages for no movement in the story line. I'll not be reading the sequel as I barely finished this one.What happened in this story?The queen was a slave to evil Sister and didn't know who she was at the beginning. At the end she was a slave to the evil king and didn't know who she was.The king, her husband, was searching for her, discussed a LOT of things about magic (Boring), decided there would be no final battle, lost his magic and got captured by who? the evil king. 673 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"trailing off to nothing","review":"Goodkind's first Wizard's books were great, but then he lost his dynamo in 2 major ways: 1) he started pounding the pulpit over his philosophy, a put-me-to-sleep act, and 2) he started padding his books with recaps of prior books. This last book \\"Phantom\\" had about 200 pages of new stuff and 500 pages of review; in fact, the last 5 books could have made 2 books if all the redundancy had been removed. Like others have said, I skimmed over page after page off recaps and pulpit pounding. Mr. Goodkind started off his series good, but he has really trailed off to nothing. For the last book, \\"Confessor\\", I'll wait to find the paperback in a used book store someday."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a giant cliffhanger","review":"This plot and dialog is as compelling as all of the other books, but do not expect the complex plot to be resolved. I don't know when the Sword of Truth series will end, but it will definitely be in some future book. I'm reporting this because, if you read this book, you likely have read the previous nine. I expected big resolutions of plot issues and they just did not happen. Great cliffhanger at the end, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Up To Terry's Usual Standards","review":"My first gripe might be seen as trivial... though not to me. There is no place on the book's cover (paperback) where I was warned that this book was the 2nd in a trilogy (I haven't read the first). Terry has written some decent fantasy so I grabbed it. Imagine how annoyed I was upon realizing that much of the story was referring to things and issues about which I had no idea and then, to get to the end without any closure at all. For the price of this book, I had to weed through some of the most pedantic, bombastic and verbose nonsense I've ever read since reading Stephan King. Since finding out that this is book 2 of 3... I can't imagine what this one added to the whole story except to sell more books by stretching 2 into 3. I suspect those who read book 1 could skip to book 3 without missing anything important. Definitely not up to Terry Goodkind's usual standards. Ptooey!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book. Keeps you in suspense.","review":"This is one of the better books of the series. If you've read the 9 books before this one, you won't be disappointed, except maybe for the end, since it doesn't have an end. Read it, it's a good one. Richard finally does something I think he should've done a long time ago. Not gonna say what though. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because the ending. It's still a great book though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Analogy to communism? Please","review":"I am seeing the same massive understatement from nearly everyone. The last four or five books, as well as phantom, are not \\"referring\\" to communism, they are nothing more than 50's style dystopia books. The worst part is that the first two books are probally the best fantasy novels I have ever read. The series then degrades into this Orwell-huxley ranting where capitalism is this glowing piece of heaven, and of course the order is hell on earth. Like the dystopia writers he emulates (and does not match) he pays no heed to the massive failings of capitalism, nor the successes of communism (as far and in between as they are). Goodkind is brilliant at painting a world, a religion, a magic, etc. but it is clear that he has taken it about three books to far with his ranting. I guess the word that I'm searching for is propaganda"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"I enjoyed this book, as I have for the last nine before it. I truly anticipate the final war between Richard and Jajang, once and for all. If you have enjoyed the series so far, then you will not regret this edition as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"somewhat disappointing","review":"All along in this series, I've been troubled by Goodkind's use of violence - both regular violence, sexual violence, and the way he kills horses off. (Apparently, concern for life doesn't extend to animals)But this book is over the top with violence. I'm only about halfway through, but was it really necessary to have Jebra's graphic description of life under the Imperial Order? or to have Richard's vision of being one of the people about to be killed? As Richard thinks at one point \\"we know all this\\". It does nothing to advance the plot, it's merely page filler.It's possible Goodkind was looking for something to make the book longer. I think Chainfire & Phantom could have been combined into one book if a lot of the redundant \\"this is what happened in the first few books\\" passages and the graphic violence were removed.Hopefully he eases off on that stuff in the final book."},{"rating":"1","title":"bored","review":"I shouldn't be writing this as I am only halfway through the book, but that is kind of the point, I am halfway through and all the characters have been standing around in the Keep yapping at each other in a repetitive drone that is going nowhere. I keep reading because I paid for the book. I loved the first half of the series but lately nothing seems to happen. I can't remember much from Chainfire, other than a whole lot of stuff that has been re-explained in this book so far. Finish series.....make a movie and be done with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"almost over...","review":"if you're like me, you're reading this book because it's the second to last and you just want to finish the series. because the series started out as amazing books that had non-stop action without all the nonsense and unrealism and lecturing that we get to deal with now... one more to go and then richard and kahlan can live happily ever after. yay!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing ending to a wonderful series","review":"In the last 3 books the \\"chainfire Trilogy\\" a wonderful series was destoryed. Terry Goodkind was my favorite writer, untill this. It seemed as though he forgot to write. reading something as simple as \\"the sky is blue\\" is bad enough for a writer who had created such a wonderful story, but to have that same line repeated 17 times in 2 pages, just in case you were unaware that the sky is blue. This book is so poorly writen in fact I will never read another Terry Goodkind book. I guess he just doesn't care to put time and effort into writing like he used to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bubblegum","review":"As much as I like first book...

I must say that I also enjoyed chainfie as well. I enjoy these books because Goodkind is pulling together all the elements of his stories to end it and using them in a way that most of us didn't see. From what I can tell he all this planned from the very beganing and not its just coming into play. Not much really happens in this book but like any second book in a trilogy like this one, it is just setting up the third and final book. And I must see I didn't see it come as of how it would end. I have my own ideas and guesses on how it will end but knowing that Mr. Goodkind is a good writer I will probaly be wrong. This book does a very good job of setting up the end of the series in what I will belive will be dramtic, action fillied, and will not disappoint."},{"rating":"1","title":"the worst goodkind book yet","review":"i just finished reading phantom and this was the worst piece of drivel that i have read to date! i don't know who this steve author is that other people have written about, but this book was so dull it was unbelieable. it seems as if the author enjoys repeating the same sentence multiple times in a paragraph. the prose is written for the average elementary student (i think that the highest level word i found in the book was virulent) and the story flows like an early reader. for those that do not want to waste their money here is the book in synopsis: see kahlan run. see richard run. see richard chase kahlan. run kahlan, run."},{"rating":"1","title":"New to the series? Don't make it this far.","review":"I'm glad I'm not the only one that is completely disappointed in how this series withered into a ranting, preachy, recapping bore fest. The only reason why I am still reading is to get to get done with it. It seems that most of Goodkinds books could be reduced to a mere 100 pages if he did not spend chapters recaping the other books, and what happend earlier in the current books. \\"I know what happend I just read it a paragraph ago\\" If he did not spend so many pages recapping, he would not have to recap. I loved the beginning of this series and somewhere along the way the writting just became redundant and aggravating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roped In & Hating It","review":"This series started out with so much promise and now, 10 books down the road, it has degenerated into something sophmoric, pretentious, and lazy. Still, I buy the books, knowing better, just to see the end.Goodkind must have taken lessons from Robert Jordan, where I am also hopelessly roped in. I liken these authors to lazy pro atheletes in their last years, just collecting paychecks, riding the gravy train. And I, the consumer, continue to buy their product.Alas, I have no one to blame but myself, but I know for a fact I'm not alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"The continuation","review":"TG in his SFT series has always felt the need to repeat himself hundreds of times so that a full third of the book rehashes the series up to the current point. However up till now the story had continued to advance enough that by the end of whatever book I had read it seemed worth reading. Phantom was a complete disappointment in that it did not. As slow paced as his books are I somehow doubt he'll be able to masterfully end what still stands in my mind as a good series in one final novel. Those who have the time I still would recommend the series, this book one just has to suffer through and in all honesty may not even be that bad if the reader can quickly move to the next one due in Nov 07'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blood! Death! Rape! Again and again and again and....","review":"I've been an avid Goodkind fan from the beginning. And honestly, the last few books have just been a downward spiral. If he's not overtly spouting out his political views on current politics through his characters, then he's graphically describing again and again the evil and carnage of the enemy. It makes his books frankly much longer and much more difficult to read than they need to be. I most likely will read the next book because it is the last in the series, but after that, I'm done with Goodkind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Isn't The Irony Delicious","review":"First, I need to acknowledge Terry Goodkind's remarkable skill in creating characters about whom I've come to care enough to continue to wade through the Objectivist drivel that oozes from these books. I'm really sorry that Ayn Rand's father lost his business to the Soviets, but how long do the rest of us have to pay for it?That said, you really have to love the irony (or maybe it's just plain hubris) of Goodkind having a character spend dozens of pages ranting against ideological indoctrination.If I were not such a slave to my feelings, I'd stop buying these books -- but I am, so I await the conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Done, done, and done","review":"I'm done with this author....I have loved this series from the beginning but this time he's gone too far with page after page of philosophy and just plain old filler....there are too many good books out there to waste my time on such drivel just waiting for the good parts....I stopped at page 172 and said no more....so long Richard and Kahlan, I wish I knew the end to your story but I cannot waste another minute trying to find it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Goodkind must get paid by the word","review":"I swear, he just goes on and on and on about the most mundane things (4 pages to describe how to leave the keep from the second floor??).

They'll appreciate the sound, and you wont have to listen to some angry spiky British kid screaming at you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice songs ruined by poor mastering","review":"I've listened to this CD maybe two times since I bought it years ago. Why? Because the sound quality is so awful, it pains my ears. Whoever mastered the recording, destroyed it, by compressing the life out of it. You'll hear moments that are distorted, moments that have been squished beyond belief, and moments that sound like mud. I like loud music, so it's not the recording. And sadly SK is not unique to this mastering problem. But I truly wish they could re-release this album with a better quality master."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great new direction for a great band","review":"Sleater-Kinney's first few albums were easily some of the best, most explosive sounding and melodic punk albums of the 90s. In 2002, they started experimenting with their sound, and released 'One Beat', a more complex and more layered variation of their previous sound. With 'The Woods', they continue to experiment, and do so magnificently.Now, it should be noted that 'The Woods' is easily Sleater-Kinney's most difficult album. Some of the guitar sounds are loud and dissonant, and there's often a whole lot of noise over the magnificently written melodies. You might even say the sheer amount of noise is detramental to the album's overall sound. But anybody who loves it as much as I do when their favorite bands move in interesting new directions should love this album. Probably one of the best albums of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unnnf#&%$#^g believable!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Hello World,Kinda bought this CD by mistake.

Luckily, I wandered onto the IFC website where Henry Rollins had the grace & good sense to post 2 stellar, brain-stem shaking performances of Jumpers & Entertain.Needless to say, I became quickly addicted, racking up about 30 visits over 4 days. Bought the cd soon after. & yeah, I still hop over to IFC to watch them nail it down live at least once a day.Being a father of 4 little kids kind of limits my concert going to just about around zero, so Henry's little freebie is probably about the closest I'll get to seeing these ladies rumble .Buy it now.Really.If ya don't believe me, head over to ifctv.com & see for yourself.Get 'em while they're hot & free & much better than these little Amazon snippets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good. 4.5 stars","review":"My impressions: Sleater Kinney listeners will be taken by the freshness of the sound, the different mix. I was wowed! It sounds like the songs were recorded on one track -- it's very organic, yet mature. Underneath all the excitement surrounding a new album though, I'd say this album's quality is about the same as One Beat. I LOVE One Beat; there's not really a weak song on it. The Woods has moments of sheer brilliance and Mrs. Carrie Brownstein's six string investigates new territory not explored by SK previously. The drums are savage and complex. And I got chills once or twice at Corin's wail (love that passionate voice). \\"Laaaand ho!\\" Overall, SK remain head and shoulders above most acts today. Definitely worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly Awful","review":"While my experience with Sleater-Kinney really only goes back to \\"The Hot Rock,\\" I have to say all the reviews I had read of this album's endless eclecticism must have been the product of payola (a.k.a music biz bribes). If you enjoy the sound of guitars being hurled against a wall, you'll be in heaven. Otherwise, dig around for \\"The Hot Rock,\\" and hope it was all a bad dream..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD sucks!","review":"No melody, no rhythm; just noise.

It's probably already surpassed Dig Me Out as my favorite S-K record, which says alot. The last three albums have been good, but none blew me away like The Woods. I can't wait to see the tour.Make sure to pick up the dvd version, has some nice live footage of 4 tracks off the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay, everyone. Put the Kool-Aid down. Slowly.","review":"I need to preface this by saying that I do like this album. A lot. That said, I wouldn't put it in the same league as Call the Doctor or Dig Me Out. It's not a de facto classic album just because it's by Sleater-Kinney.Buy it. Listen to it loud. See it live, but don't like it just because of who made it."},{"rating":"1","title":"REALLY wanted to like this one.","review":"\\"One Beat\\" was swell. First S-K album I ever bought.This one has about 2 songs that I felt like hearing again. Period. Sounds WAY overworked, like they're trying to be \\"serious\\" artists or something.Pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Depressions","review":"This album was heralded by Pitchfork. I thought I was in for something phenomenal and captivating. I found nary. Sure the songs are musically sound and the singing and instumentation are pretty interesting, but it's nothing that grabs you nor does it make you want to listen to it again. You should know that this is an all-girl band. If you have a doubt as to whether you could like an all-girl band then you definetly won't enjoy it so do yourself a favor and don't buy this. To conclude, it's good enough music, but what good is it if you don't want to listen to it more than once."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music?","review":"I can wail.The difference between me and Sleater-Kinney is people don't pay to hear me wail into their ears for an hour.

It is not just how to add props to a few poses, as I expected, but also has ideas for how to 'teach' your body what it should be doing in each pose. It does this first by explaining what is meant by concepts such as 'press the top of your thighs back', or 'rotate your upper arms inward', then provides instructions and photos for assisted exercises to achieve these concepts. Sometimes your 'prop' is another person (or two!) to assist your body in achieving these poses. This book has me looking forward to practicing more than any other book I've seen recently! While this book will not satisfy those looking for a traditional yoga instruction with spiritual and breath aspects, it is an excellent beginning and intermediate guide to the physical practice of yoga."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly Recommended","review":"This book is chock full of helpful hints for those who want to take their practice to the next level.

I would recommend this book as a valuable addition to the serious yogi's library."},{"rating":"1","title":"SIMPLISTIC, VERGING ON BORING","review":"There is nothing cool about Miriam Austin's cool yoga tricks. Her incredibly simplistic adjustments and variations are demonstrated in blah black and white pictures, pretty much the sort of thing one would find in an introductory Iyengar class. No revelations here, but some good reminders. A yoga teacher or student with common sense and a few props is probably doing all this stuff already."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great reading about discrimination of that period","review":"The book caught my attention because (1)I like historical novels,(2) my last name is Mireles but no relation to author and (3)the fact that it's written by a woman. It's amazing how this manuscript remained hidden out of fear of what the \\"gringo\\" community would do/say mainly because the book addresses what it was like for Mexicans/Mexican Americans of the period and well into the 70s. Being a Chicana this book also told me a lot about how the mujer was treated but inspite of it how brave Jovita was and finally finding the courage to release her manuscript.

I've been a Nora Roberts fan for a long time -- so long, in fact, that I've grown tired of her books. Therefore I was happy to discover that I could still pick this one up an reread it with a sense of fresh interest.Roberts practically has the patent on trilogies, the reason why being exemplified nicely here. The Bisset siblines -- Gabriella, Alexander, and Bennett -- are all very strong, appealing, and well-developed characters. Each has their own, unique personality and play a noteworthy part in the grander story that stretches across the three novellas.I find it typical that, in many trilogies, there's always one book that falls flat compared to the other two. Such is not the case here. Each story is interesting, quick of pace, and brilliant in their simplicity.This is the Nora Roberts of old, the writing that I used to devour."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better than expected!","review":"I was looking forward to this book when I first heard about it, but I was unable to get a copy right away. I decided to buy the newest Cordina book, Cordina's Crown Jewel, and read that one first. Big mistake. I couldn't even finish it. As a result, I put off reading this one until a friend told me I should. It is very good. It is early Nora Roberts so the mystery is not as developed as in her latest books, but it is there. The stories follow the princess and 2 princes of Cordina. The same bad guy appears in all 3 books.

It's a wonder that it's still on television.The new characters are lame and the whole show just seems like the writers ran out of ideas for the original characters but yet didn't want to forgo making money! Also, they dumbed down this show significantly from the first 3 seasons.I absolutely hate it when shows sellout and become all about the money rather than just being concerned with writing good entertainment and sadly this is what this show has become."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must see show ,this season is Awesome!!!","review":"I love this season of house. I don't think this is over priced. Go to any other web site and you will find it for more. Not only that other web sites don't give you the free shipping. House keeps getting better and better.

I have been a major fan of Hugh Laurie's since the days of Blackadder III and of Robert Sean Leonard since Dead Poet's and Last Days of Disco. I even have all of the previous seasons on DVD and had set my TIVO for a season pass this past year. After the first three episodes I began to delete them without watching them. Part of the interest of the show was the interplay between House and his three underlings -- to have some elimination contest like a bad reality show really turned me off. I realize that they had to do something to mix things up since the show was getting pretty formulaic -- but bring in a bunch of doctors who we don't care about was not the answer. It jumped the shark. Too bad. It was far superior to any of those overrated CSI shows."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought this item for my daughter and I as a Christmas gift.

Writing, Camera Angles , Funny sarcastic Dialogs, Loved House. But in this Fourth season I don,t know what happened. Its shallow, lacking of depth and as other reviewer said House is a parody of himself. So I suggest you better rent it first before you make the purchase. Hope the season 5 gets better I think it is because the writers strike Its a shame though because of that situation House suffered a cut in its Grandeur first three excellent seasons."},{"rating":"2","title":"silly fun","review":"Hugh Laurie is perfect. House is the most compelling character on television, and did I mention, Hugh Laurie is perfect? This episode was silly, fun, but silly.

As Series Three progressed, House became increasingly troubled and dare I say unsympathetic (am I the only one to think that arch-villain, Tritter, actually had a point?)So the solution? Get rid of the sympathetic characters and in Series Four make House increasingly unsympathetic to the point of actual repellence. Series creator, David Shore, what are you thinking? Series Four is consequently the first series we have not bought.We hang in there with Series Five but not much longer. The character of House has virtually become a parody of itself, with credibility sacrificed to cheap laughs. And in these truly benighted times do we really need a hero who gets results by being selfish, self-absorbed and totally amoral? The character is on record in one episode as saying he needs an epiphany. Bring it on!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost its Edge","review":"My local library has the first three seasons on DVD & I tore through them. The shows were great, House was the perfect character & the surrounding cast was outstanding, too. Then season 3 ended, I couldn't wait for the new season to start, but man, was I disappointed.The edge was gone, House no longer acts like jerk with a purpose, instead, he's just a jerk. And why did the writers hold onto some of House's staff, they're trying to have the best of both worlds, ie, keep the old and bring in the new.I could go on, but for me, the surest sign that the show's going downhill is that House didn't take one pill on the season opener. Not one. That's not the same House I've been watching for three seasons."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Play on UnBox Viewer","review":"Sorry to say that this episode doesn't play on the UnBox Viewer.

This book gets off to a good start, but doesn't maintain the excitement. It was hard to keep the multiple characters straight, and hard to care about the outcome, and the protagonist didn't even have enough personality to make us care about him. A surprising distraction is that the writer has some annoying tics that weren't corrected during the editing process, such as the term \\"at all\\" - spelled \\"a-tall\\" - being uttered every page or two by some character or other. Sorry, can't recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read but...","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The story hanga together well and the suspense was well sustained.

Is there a reason for this irritation?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ms. Wright's style is maturing","review":"I don't read a lot of mysteries, so I compare them more to other things I read (novels, literature, history, etc.). With this work Ms. Wright's style moves more toward what I consider a novelistic style. Not only is there the usual mystery plot and the clues along the path to the solution, but there is a whole story of characters and their relationships. Ms. Wright's other works have a good eye for detail and a nice sense of character, but this one delves further into personalities and their interactions.The suspense carried me into the intriguing world of a number of people. The delightful interplay between the English, Scottish and American characters and their eccentricities fleshed out the mystery. Not to mention the charming tour of Scotland that I was taken on.All in all a fine work. Not great by \\"novel\\" standards, but I judged this as a mystery, since that is what it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Principles of Turbomachinery","review":"Prior to the purchase I read several good reviews. I completely disagree. The book does not show how equations are obtained, saying only \\"it can be shown that...\\".

The author brings together chess aphorisms of the masters, poems about chess, accounts of tournaments and games, word portraits and photographs of the masters, and similar topics like the great moments and human failings of great masters like Staunton, Euwe, Alekhine, Reshevsky, Capablanca, and Lasker. The famous 18th century story of Maelzel's chessplaying automaton, \\"The Turk\\" and so much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'd give it 6 stars if I could.","review":"It's rare to attend an concert and have magic happen, so I was overjoyed when I first heard the Urban Verbs' complex music and intelligent lyrics at the U MD Student Union in 1979.

My favorite tracks are \\"The Angry Young Men\\" and \\"Tina Grey.\\" I'm delighted to see it available again on CD.If there were any justice in the world, the Verbs would have enjoyed long music careers. Sadly, they broke up after only a few years. At least we have this CD, though it's a shame they never recorded one of my favorite songs, \\"Pensive People.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best of the 80's - Severely Under Appreciated","review":"The Urban Verbs were a DC based group with connections to the Talking Heads through Chris Frantz. The sound of this album at times mirrors the alienated frenzy of the Talking Heads' \\"More Songs About Buildings and Food\\" or \\"Talking Heads: 77\\". The Urban Verbs add a strong droning element to many of their songs, with synthesizers looping sounds a la Philip Glass. A very potent musical mix to which is added some exceptional new wave lyrics.I haven't listened to this album through in years, but I have all its songs on my Ipod and every time one comes on I stop and listen. Outstanding songs off the album are \\"Next Question\\" (great lyrics - \\"If this is love, I was born a survivor\\" and \\"Is this love, or just a feeling\\"), \\"Ring-Ring (My Telephone'S Talking), \\"Only One of You\\" and \\"Subways\\". If you are a fan of the Talking Heads or good new wave music/early 80's, pick this album up. You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Norton Waterstone 4000 grit","review":"I have three of the Norton Waterstones for my knives, and they all work great.These stones provide plenty of surface area to work with, and the case (blue hinged plastic box) works as a perfect base for setting the stone on. The case has rubber feet on the corners to keep everything from sliding all over while sharpening.I have sharpened many knives and the Norton waterstones show little wear and do a great job at getting an edge. Since I have three of these stones, two are combination stones....with two grit's on opposing sides...it makes it easy to flatten the stones by rubbing the highest grit stone against the lowest grit stone under running water."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book bites","review":"This was easily one of the worst books that I have read. I can't imagine why anyone would like it. It was childish and inconsistent. I certainly wasn't on the edge of my seat waiting for the end.

But in this case I whole-heartedly agree with everything that the only 1-Star critic said about the stilted dialogue, the cartoonish characters. The story offered juicy promise - a crazy priest abducting and torturing a nun - but the presentation falls completely flat. I am only happy I paid $0.02 used.

This CD has some of the most relaxing and beautiful music that ive heard in a long time. Its perfect if your tired, stressed, or if your just feeling mello. Yes its softy music. But theres nothing wrong with some beautiful ballads on a peaceful afternoon. Definitly a buy. Please take the time to enjoy this good music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent background noise.....little more, sadly to say.","review":"As difficult as it is to say, this is Ms. Merchant's most uninspiring work yet. And this is coming from someone who would leave his wife for a chance to be serenaded by Natalie's talents...the most lovely voice man has ever known.... Ophelia proves to be wonderful dinner music, pleasant background fluff that moves effortlessly from song to song yet with very little charm. Where Tigerlily bloomed, Ophelia withers."},{"rating":"1","title":"LIGHTEN UP!","review":"One word sums this up: BORING. Natalie sounds as if she is ready to pack it in and move into the retirement home for old has-been singer/songwriters. Time for an outside producer to save this girl from oblivion and re-introduce her to the fun side of life, ala her previous work with 10,000 maniacs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs a bit more oomph","review":"Taken individually, there are any number of achingly gorgeous songs here. \\"Life is Sweet,\\" \\"Break Your Heart,\\" and \\"Frozen Charlotte,\\" to name a few are hard to dislike. They will continue haunt after repeated listenings.Collectively, however, all this stuff begins to run together, and it becomes rather tedious to try and listen to this album from start to finish in one sitting. Maybe if you stick this in your CD player with several other discs, program a few songs out, and hit shuffle, its charms will reveal themselves in a more suitable fashion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing","review":"I was expecting it to be as good as Tigerlily, but it was just so depressing. She has such a beautiful voice, I've liked her music ever since she was with 10,000 Maniacs, but this is just a little too bleh for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ","review":"Snoooooooooooooooooooooore. If you want to listen to depressing, over-produced music by everyones least-favourite preachy liberal activist, then Ophelia is for you. If you like your singers with no sense of humour and singers taking themselves oh so seriously, then Natalie Merchant is for you. I'm very generously giving this album two stars because of the track My Skin. It's a gorgeous song worthy of all the praise it's received."},{"rating":"1","title":"N. Merchant: Get me outta here!","review":"Well, this is just going to tee off all the Merchant fans. My wife was looking for a version of \\"When They Ring The Golden Bells.\\" I searched around and found the one on this album. Merchant's voice is paired with that of Karen Peris. The arrangement is direct, uncluttered, backed by excellent musicians. The result is sublime.Then I listened to the rest of the CD. Red Alert, Red Alert! Reality Disconnect! Earth to Natalie! PHONE HOME!If Merchant ever wants to be anything but an ethereal voice meandering among the clouds she needs to do more work like \\"Golden Bells,\\" over which her fans are probably scratching their heads. But I doubt she will, based on the CD photos of her, which are as shallow and pretentious as her music. Proof she knows how forgettable this CD really is: \\"Golden Bells\\" is the only track that cannot be purchased separately. It certainly is the only one worth buying. That rates it one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOSURRENDER","review":"THIS CD IS THE WORST CD I HAVE EVER HAD THE NONPLEASURE OF LISTENING TO.......I USED THIS CD FOR FIRE WOULD I DIDN'T EVEN THINK THAT IT WAS WORTHY TO SELL"},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving!","review":"I've been a huge fan of Natalie Merchant since I saw her open for Sting in Europe in the Spring 1996. Not only was her voice beautiful, but I'd never seen anyone so full of JOY on a stage. She sang and danced with reckless abandon, and pulled us into her mesmerizing music. Right away I bought Tigerlily and all 10,000 Maniacs cds. For two years I'd waited for her latest, and was definitely not disappointed. The range of emotions she conveys in Ophelia is amazingly beautiful. I've seen her perform most of these songs in a benefit concert, and she sang with as much feeling as she did on the album. As for Ms. Merchant, keep up the good work. It is inspiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let There Be No Mistakes,...This is a GREAT Album !!!","review":"As a Non-Merchant fan, I must state for the record that this is a very refreshing album.Ophelia is easy to listen to and relaxing. Natalie Merchant has a remarkable voice and this album showcases it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I received Natalie Merchant's CD as a gift immediately after it was released in stores, and I loved it. After awhile, however, I began listening to other things more, and I hadn't listened to her CD in about a year. However, I just saw it yesterday and put it back in my CD player. Wow. Her voice is truly wonderful and her tunes are haunting. This album always puts me in a creative mood. Her lyrics, although difficult to make out, are fascinating. Merchant has impressed me, not only for her terrific songs, but for their ability to last and continue to move me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite perfect","review":"Merchant has followed up her diverse debut album,\\"Tigerlily,\\" with a soft brooding concept album, \\"Ophelia.\\" This works for a number of reasons. First, Merchant continues to write some of the most beautiful songs in existence (ophelia,frozen charlotte, my skin).Second, her supporting cast is excellent (Daniel Lanois, Karen and Don Peris). In fact, frozen charlotte seems like a song Karen would write. However, the album does have problems. A few songs sound similar and go on too long. For example, my skin has the same chord progression and tempo as thick as thieves and king of may has a few too many \\"his long life's.\\" This is, however, consistent with Merchant's tendency to indulge in her favorite things. All in all, however, this album earns a fourbecause of it's brilliant melodies, instrumentation, and the fact that my favorite singer (Karen Peris) sings back-up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much Natalie Worship","review":"I've been interested in Natalie since 1985, and she sure has a singular voice. I miss the frolicking-on-stage Maniac, compared to the adored pretense of today. When she sings about \\"thanking\\" everyone, I am not persuaded of her sincerity."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Great Album\\" \\"one of the best by Natalie Merchant\\"","review":"I thought that this was a really good album for Natalie Merchant. I especially liked the song kind and generous. But other songs like opelia the main song weren't that great. Over all I recomend this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOTALLY ENCHANTING!","review":"Natalie has managed to compile an amazing cycle of artistic and creative songs!! All I can say is this CD as a whole is spell binding and mysterious, while at the same time emotional and intelligent. Even though it does lack the tempo of some of her other work, this is Natalie at her most innovative yet. A must buy for anyone who likes music to make them think and feel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Natalie was let down by her engineers.","review":"Unfortunately, there was a new recording team for Ophelia. Natalie's beautiful and distinctive voice does not stand out from the band like it did in Tiger Lily. Too bad. Her singing is what makes the music, not the band. Better luck with your next album, Natalie"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop the pain!","review":"I just don't get the Natalie Merchant thing.

To say the least. Then, after reading what all these other people have to say, I am positive that this is definetly not her best work. I do love the song \\"Life is Sweet\\", but in Kind and Generouse It seems that the only leric is thank you. That's all. Thank you. (snicker snicker)"},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH","review":"Unoriginal and uninspiring. Merchant's ego was too big for 10,000 Maniacs, but her talent just can't cut it. How I yearn for the days of \\"Eat for Two.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS ALBUM!!!!!!!!!","review":"Natalie Merchant is one of the most overrated artists to come down the pike since Celine Dion. Listening to this album was painful. Her lyrics are uniformly depressing, and her mushy vocals only make it worse. The only thing I got out of this album is that she looks down on all of her fans from her high horse. If the songs were catchy, this snootiness might be forgiveable, but there's nary a hook in sight. Avoid this album for your own health."},{"rating":"2","title":"An album worthy of Merchant's reputation!","review":"Critics may say what they want,bottomline is their illiterate arrogance.They rather put porno teen stars in their cover,rather read,research and discover.Miss Merchant's Ophelia album,distinctive,unique and independent from being 10,000 maniacs,proved that she can and she has gift of a real artist and a poet.Lyrics of her song either sang or read has context,depth and meaning,compare to Emily Dickenson,Chomsky,Ginsberg,but she will humbly be Natalie.Miss Merchant's works are threat to mainstream media,because it defies their voracity for ignorance,arrogance,violence and greed.They rather see and jubilate for \\"artist\\" lip singing,dance and strip,mash pitting,stampeding and cursing.They want us to like who they like and admire who they write.Fortunately we know and we know what we want,if they can sing,write like Natalie I dare to challenge thee!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, not her best","review":"This album has some great tracks, but has a looser feel than Tigerlily, which is my favorite NM CD. Overall very good, but a couple of the songs tank in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Beautiful!","review":"Sumptuous melodies abound, while Natalie's angelic voice and understated piano give this an almost unbearable poignancy. And, despite what critics say, there are certainly variety and texture to these songs. There is no false pathos whatsoever. Still, the tenor of Ophelia is one of undeniable sadness.From the hopeful \\"Kind and Generous\\", to the emotionally harrowing \\"My Skin\\", these songs crystallize the melancholy of the human condition. Accordingly, Ophelia is truly beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift for someone","review":"I have a friend who loves this womens music so I got it as a gift for her, It was a fast shipping, in a cover and of good quality. As for the music, she is an excellent artist in her music industry and of course, opinions in music are for the individuals own \\"taste\\" of music, mood and enjoyment. I would recommend you listen to her samples of music which is always nice to be able to do through amazon before purchasing anything. There are times I will go through dozens of artists, new and old to listen to their quality and type of music and often purchase from amazon just because of this ability to go here and listen to music first before buying it. I have also never had any problems with buying as they say, used CD/ nor DVD they have all been of good quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"music lover","review":"I purchased this item afterr hearing somr of the music on a tv show.

There are a lot of mid tempo songs with strings that compliment Ms. Merchant's voice very well, as well as a couple of sparse and haunting tunes that, again, compliment her voice - she's extremely versatile. Any one of these songs could be from Tigerlily (her more successful solo debut cd) - they're of the similar mindset. It's got a bit more orchestration, like her last studio release with 10,000 Maniacs, Our Time In Eden, but for a reason I just cannot pinpoint, it falls a tad flat of being 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funereal, lugubrious, plodding.","review":"I returned this CD despite a few lovely melodies because it's 90% slow, haunting very personal, but almost funereal, and not what Natalie does best.10,000 maniacs mixed tasteful folk-rock with a little of this kind of stuff, and the mix was right. So be forewarned, there is almost no rock and roll to this offering, and almost no spirit. Try 10,000 Maniacs MTV Unplugged instead, as it truly captures the spirit that (at least used to) lie within this artist, and that was impressive."},{"rating":"1","title":"She needs the other 9,999 Maniacs back!","review":"Oh, Natalie! Where have the days of \\"Campfire Song\\",\\"Candy Everybody Wants,\\" even \\"Carnival\\" gone? She is maudlin and dry on these songs; everyone talks about the diversity of the players on this disc, but they have such a dour leader! Being a 10,000 Maniacs fan, I am sorely disappointed by this release. Where is the lyric sheet? We can't understand a word you're saying (except \\"thank you, thank you, etc...\\" on \\"Kind and Generous.\\" If you've heard that track and liked it, don't expect more like it. ) Perhaps, at best, an intricate exercise for an exquisite voice, but I need more than that to hold my interest. Natalie has always held the world outside in small regard, but the Maniacs provided her with zippy tunes with which to do so. Skip this one and stick with \\"In My Tribe\\" if you want to hear Natalie at her best... Self-indulgent and unlistenable!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleepy and Dispassionate","review":"This CD was a big dissappointment. It is not comparable to her other CDs, including 10,000 Maniacs efforts. To me, her vocals are void of passion and border on monotone (something I would have never said about previous CDs). Yes, she has a great voice, but she doesn't really display it on this effort. The first time I listened to it I had to take it out of the player becuase I was falling asleep, and my wife was begging me to change it to something better. Admittingly, I have not given this CD much of a chance, because I have many other better CDs to listen to. Hopefully she will follow up with an improved effort next time."},{"rating":"2","title":"beautiful album","review":"I thought this album was really good. I thought the title song was haunting and had beautiful lyrics. Life is Sweet also I thought was very encouraging. Merchant has a wonderful voice and has a talent for songwriting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adjectives don't do justice","review":"Upon first listening to this CD- it was the first one I listened to by MS. Merchant- I was struck by the depth it had. When you turn on stations like MTV and see what they have to offer (which, to be precise, consists mainly of shallow, superficial \\"artists\\"), and then listen to this CD, it becomes apparent that while some critics have dismissed her efforts, she remains so much more affecting then most any other artist out there.\\"My Skin\\" is a song I feel compelled to discuss in this review. It's the most haunting song I've ever heard, and yes, while it is sad, it also contains hope.Of course, there are other excellent tracks as well, but other reviewers have already mentioned those. While it is a serious disk- for the most part- it is far from the word \\"gloomy\\" as a critic neglected to say. It is sensuous, at times moving.This is powerful music, and I'm glad Merchant chose this new, more mature sound- it suits her nicely, and shows her growth.4.6 stars for musicianship."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Incredible Music","review":"Natalie's wonderful voice is showcased in this incredible work of musical art. The CD is well balanced with soft mistical songs as well as upbeat postive ones. There is not a bad song on the C.D.. I would recommend to anybody. Two listens and most will be hooked. Well worth the money!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing.","review":"Although 10,000 Maniacs is my favorite band, and Natalie's solo Tigerlily is one of the best albums I have ever heard, Ophelia is just plain boring. It seems to me to be a collection of tracks that were never added to Tigerlily for one reason or another. Although the extra instruments used throughout Ophelia does broaden Natalie's application of her unique musical style, it is simply not enough to turn this into something provacative. In a word, it's disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wonderful voice, Lame songs","review":"I have always been a great admirer of Natalie Merchant, until now. While her voice has the same tender qualities as always, this album does not do it justice. With only one even half way memorable song it whines on till an unimpressive ending. I hope she gets back on track on her next effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Natalie officially switches to decaf","review":"Though this album has a few catchy songs on it, the pacing and overall flow is nothing to get excited about. A far cry from the upbeat tunes of 10,000 Maniacs, Natalie opts to kick it down a notch (or ten) from her last album (Tigerlily), which was slow itself. Slow music is not bad, but it begings to drag and blend together after awhile, making very few of the songs on this collection memorable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad and depressing","review":"Apart from the best known title \\"Kind and Generous\\", I found the songs very sad, and rather depressing. It's a pity because the accoustic tone of the CD would otherwise be quite pleasant. I didn't know the artist very well before buying this CD, and I'm disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Sad","review":"I love KIND AND GENEROUS and THE GOLDEN BELLS, but otherwise, the songs on this album plod along - too sad and heavy!

Its scholarship is strong, yet, unabashedly acknowledges the level of \\"the heart,\\" in this sense, the importance of spirituality and ethics in the eradication of individual and social pathology, which the authors cogently argue are mutually related. Infused also, is a fine attunement to literature, revealing once again the importance of a knowledge base grounded in the liberal arts for adequate interventions in the helping and health professions.

The last movement, \\"Crater Hug\\", is my favorite piece -- classically romantic, tear-jerking movie music that you'd expect to accompany one last climactic scene before the final fade-out... which is why it's the last track on the CD even though \\"Facts\\" comes after it chronologically.

The main goal of the author is to expose the ideas and scientific achievements of Einstein, explaining in detail his theories. This is a taugh book for someone without a physics background, because Pais has written a book on the physics of the last century, with a detailed account of the origin and development of relativity and quantum theories. And it uses all the mathematical concepts physicists are familiar with.Otherwise, this is the best biography of Einstein I have read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good buy for a good bishop!","review":"I was also pleased to receive 10 copies for the extremely low price of $1.50!

I consider her poetry book to be one of the best 21st century contemporary poetry books out there. It's so much better than all that post-modernist poetry I had to read for my MFA.

The problem is with the detachable shade. The shade is removable and it simply snaps on to the stroller. That presents a problem during folding. You need to take off the shade first and then fold the stroller. That is an inconvenience... Plus, you need to squeeze the shade somewhere in your trunk. We did not let that bother us too much. But then the shade started snapping off during use! It started getting twisted and not holding on to the stroller. After struggling with the shade for a while, we decided to return it. Instead, we purchased Chicco Caddy. That stroller is lightweight and comfortable to use. And the shade is attached to the stroller and folds with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty but not much else","review":"This product is difficult to use and not the best quality. You have to detach the shade in order to fold the stroller and it is difficult to reatach. Also, the cup holder is flimsy and falls quite often. The Ipod adaptor is not intended for the Ipod Nano, and only works with the Nano placed upside down in the holder. The music only plays very softly because the speakers are weak.The only good things about the stroller are that it is very nice looking, lightweight and partially reclines. Also the padding inside makes it a little more comfortable than conventional umbrella strollers.Overall, however, I would say it is overpriced and there are better models out there. If you are considering it for the Ipod Adaptor, it's certainly not worth it..."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome!!!","review":"I didn't have high expectations to start with but the stroller is everything that I was looking for in a simple umbrella stroller. It has the little speaker for mp3 players which is fine. It plays soft but it makes sense as to not blow out a child's ears too early. It nice and padded, my daughter loves riding in it.

It's nice and light if you need to haul it around too."},{"rating":"2","title":"iBaby Stroller","review":"My granddaughter just loves this stroller. I can listen to my video ipod while enjoying the sights around the neighborhood while calming my baby. The only problem I have is strolling around while the sun is out.

Well, the Richter was excellent -- and Postnikova blew me away. Incredibly dynamic, even daring in its assertiveness, and Rozhdestvensky proves the perfect foil. The sound on both is excellent; the brass in the 1959 Richter is a bit too brassy, but otherwise the sound of that is both warm and dimensional, while the 1991 Postnikova has, to my ears, one of the most living living sounds provided by an orchestra on a CD. I love this recording, and quickly ordered my own copy from Amazon. One drawback, which is sadly a very frequent one on disks: this is no more than ONE SECOND separating the 2nd the 3rd concerti.

The coffee itself is very smooth, considering the cold brew process doesn't burn the beans as hot methods do; and it removes the acid, and the caffeine is reduced substantially. If you add cream and sugar you'll add a great deal less. There is no messing with filters and coffee grounds. The cool brew packaging containers have a built-in measuring device.

The Swing: doesn't swing smoothly, is too low to the ground, therefore, child's feet drag or catch on the frame constantly, and it tips forward easily. The Ladder: awkward to climb up for small children. The whole set causes a lot of tears for 12-24 month old children who aren't totally steady on their feet--they can bonk their heads on the blocks (very painful), fall off the platform or the slide (this can happened even with close supervision). I found once my oldest grandson was 18 mo. old, he was too tall for the whole thing (and he is not tall for his age). I also had a hard time putting it together.

I read the other reviews and agree it was a bit of a challenge to put together but I still did it by myself in less than an hour.

He loved climbing on it, using it as a fort and racing his cars down the slide. We never had any problems with it tipping over, it has always been very sturdy. He did out grow the swing quickly because it was very low to the ground so he ended up using it for his stuffed animals instead.We kept it on an enclosed patio with sun exposure and the swing straps did rot. The Hedstrom company replaced all 4 straps and the seatbelt for free, they were very nice.One nice feature is that the slide and ladder fold up so it won't take up quite as much space when it's not being used.

I received this for our 1 year old and she was almost catapulted while swinging. Very jerky and limited motion. She is a tiny 18 lbs. and would have outgrown this in a matter of months had we not returned it. The \\"adjustable deck\\" is a joke-- it raised the deck only a couple inches higher, but in turn made the height under the canopy less. She was within a few inches of not being able to stand under it already. No way would this accommodate her at 2 or 3 years old. There were many sharp plastic molded edges which we had to smooth so she wasn't cut. This is overall a very poorly made, unsafe childs toy.

The characters are strong, the historical details are impeccable, and the prose is lilting. I especially enjoyed the subplot about Grace's brother Sean and the Irish revolutionaries. However, I did find Bram Donnelly's character to be a bit over-the-top. The subject of spousal abuse was an interesting one to include, but I wish the author had given Donnelly at least one or two redeeming qualities.

My suggestion is to pop open a beer, sit out in the sun and take the trip with Mark. Just don't expect to be an expert camper when you finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic","review":"it's amazing how obscure this book and this author is. he is an obvious talent, one of those writers whose words are so effortless to read that the reader gets completely absorbed. his travel adventures do evoke comparisons; the best of jon krakauer, bill bryson, and david sedaris. he mixes that whole existentialism of travel with history as well as a very personal tale. he is self-deprecating about himself, calls out the hypocrisy of rich tourist towns, and recognizes 'truth' when he encounters it. i highly recommend this book, especially if you love travel books like i do, although i may be biased in several counts as i always been drawn to the desert as he has."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, funny book in laconic style","review":"This is an \\"On the Road\\" for the 1990's. Semi-autobiographical, Sundeen tools around the desert southwest in his beat-up Subaru having adventures and climbing on stuff. He also meets people and rolls his car onto its roof in a cataract canyon. A great ride!(That anyone thought this was going to be a Fodor's-like guide for car camping is the funniest thing, though.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Review by Lynne Ellsworth Larsen","review":"A Year in the Life of an African Family offers visual documentation of village life in Burkina Faso. As a teacher of African Art History, I found the chapters on pottery, divination, and festival dance performance especially useful. In addition, the sections on farming, family life, and food preparation offer good contextual information and demonstrate the close connection African villagers have to the earth. It is difficult to find good, current, films on African life and culture. I'm very pleased to have this one. The running time is approximately 1 hour and 5 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic, flat recording...","review":"There's no sense in me commenting on the performance itself as any life that there might have been was completely lost to the recording medium.

It is nothing like the other two novels Ledwidge wrote, stories that were tightly woven around a few characters whose decisions and mistakes drastically changed their lives.\\"Before the Devil....\\" relies not on tight plotting, but on major coincidence after major coincidence, all stacked in a row from one chapter to the next. The story is so dependent on coincidences, I can't give examples without giving away the plot to those who want to discover it for themselves.Sure, this is fiction, but Ledwidge gives us no chance to enjoy a story we can believe might have actually occurred. He can write like the \\"devil\\", though. Check out his first two novels in paperback. Think twice before shelling out twenty bucks for this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Thriller!","review":"BEFORE THE DEVIL KNOWS YOU'RE DEAD is an utterly thrilling thriller that satisfies on every level -- great storytelling, fascinating and complex characters, captivating moral dilemmas.

You have to wait six minutes for the machine to warm up, and then you have to put in the precise amount of coffee, perfectly ground, gently tamped down, and wait for a weak cup of espresso to come out of it. I called their help line, and the customer service rep essentially said to keep trying different grinds and adjusting the amount of tamping down until I got the crema that came automatically with our old Krups espresso maker. For $250, I shouldn't have to experiment with a clunky machine to get a decent cup of espresso."},{"rating":"1","title":"utterly confused","review":"i am desperately trying to figure out what is wrong with my machine. i read heaps of wonderful reviews about the great coffee the gaggia is suppose to make and the ease of use. these were some of the main reasons i went with gaggia. i have tried everything to get even a half decent shot of espresso from the machine without success. it leaks, pours bitter shots without creme (no matter what grind used) and it doesn't froth milk it just blows bubbles in it. i am terribley dissappointed wtih the machine and the company. i have tried to contact them several times to get help and have gotten no response. i would not recommend this machine or company to anyone. i wish i had coughed up the extra money to get a better espresso machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk!!!","review":"I don't know if these positive reviews are coming from Gaggia employees, but the machine is an overpriced piece of junk!

Hewitt walking outside and that crazy girl with the yearbook asks her to sign.

I was happy with the few songs that were on it that I recognized, but dissapointed by the few they left out. The CD does, however include the edited version of Blink 182's ...[---- it !], which isn't easy to find.

The only reason why I gave this CD 4 stars instead of 5, was because it did not have ALL of the songs on the CD that it had in the movie.

Sounds interesting, but it is not. This is manly MOR rock with horns and some completely loungy ballads, well played, but strictly for the Dinha Shore show.David Clayton Thomas worked well for the band in 1969 because the material was soul influanced, and he aced the bands 60s soul sound. By 1976, AM slick pop was the commodity of the hour, and no one epitomized the smaltz of the genre more than BS&T; does here.Great musicans playing bad music.

The fifth title, Color Craziness, is far from one of the \\"greatest\\" Stooges shorts; it's a compilation of live-action skits made in 1965 with \\"Curly Joe\\" DeRita incorporated into in their cartoon series.

In the tradition of classic film noir, luck turns against them and they wind up being in way over their heads. Director Robert Wise uses his black and white photography to great advantage. The film is fascinating as it shows us the pressures that work on the initially reluctant Ryan and Belafonte to force them into cooperation on the heist. Unfortunately, this otherwise nearly flawless film becomes too heavy-handed with its anti-racist theme in its final moments. Still, it's well worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"I plugged my Zen, half charged into the charger, to let it charge, the player turned on, and wouldn't turn off,(which it does on the computer too) but didn't charge at all, leaving a totally dead Zen, which I then had to plug into the computer and let charge there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Save's time","review":"I use the Home Travel Wall AC Adapter just about everyday or every other day.

The real value lies in the album tracks, in which there are some excellent finds for the uninitiated.

It also includes beautiful prayers and many gorgeous passages from the Baha'i Writings, and explains how the Baha'i Faith relates to other religions. This is a book so well-written that it has been used for decades. A more recent book with a similar introduction to the Baha'i Faith is God Speaks Again by Kenneth Bowers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gettin' medievil!","review":"Being a furry myself, I was drawn to this book simply by looking at the cover art. In fact, the art throughout (even at the beginning) is really sweet compared to what else was out there at the time. The character development and facial expressions are there, and done quite nicely, although Mark (rest his soul) doesn't explain where Maya (the elephant) comes in...she's just there starting in one chapter and then for the duration. Speaking of development you see friendship begin between Marphissa and Alix, not to mention how the girls start to develope the muscles and strength necessary to be warriors. I thoroughly enjoyed this book, cover to cover, and can promise you won't regret making this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complex and unique","review":"She uses formal invention to evoke (not describe) what lesbian life is like.When I took her writing class here at UCSD, I realized how sophisticated her writing is.

Amina reconfirms that the Quran does not prescribe a rigid social structure. Although gender reform is often resisted in the Arab and Muslim world, this book will help in the debate of many interacting and overlapping issues that our region is witnessing. While the book is aimed at the academic reader, it is straightforward for the average reader to grasp.It helped provide me with some answers and opened the door to a new perception of things. That is why I set my mind in 2002 to translateit into Arabic because I deem it necessary and important to open this kind of debate in my part of the world. I am now in the process of securing a publisher and when the book is out, it will be interesting to witness the discussions it will raise.

I loved reading the history of the income tax and how it was used as leverage in a lot of ways. This does that well and gets pretty name/background heavy. As I said, some folks would love that, I was more into the story of how it was manipulated through time, rather than every single person who played a role, BUT that is what makes this book so thorough so I'd give it 4 1/2 stars. : Get it, it's cheap and enlightening."},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"Great\\" Tax \\"Wars\\"","review":"This book was weak. Mr. Weisman's account of the income tax in America is elementary. This book is more a story of the major players then an account of the facts and events.

No matter that they're out of print - search everywhere - they're worth it. I began reading Douglas in 1959 at the age of 14. After that, I eagerly awaited each new offering and occassionally managed to catch Douglas on T.V. As I remember them (more or less in the order published and the recommended order for reading): My Brother Was an Only Child, Never Trust a Naked Bus Driver, A Funny Thing Happened on My Way to the Grave (Autobiography), Huckleberry Hashimoto, The Neighbors Are Scaring My Wolf, The Japanese Sex and Cookbook and How to Raise Wolves, Shut Up and Eat Your Snowshoes, Going Nuts in Brazil, Benjamin Franklin Slept Here, and What Do You Hear from Walden Pond.

While this is not a bad book by any means, it was just less than what I expected. This book reads more as an overview of Windows 2000 features. There is VERY little how to or instructions. Definitely not an on the job reference book or a certification study guide. I recommend this book as an evaluators guide or as an introduction into what Windows 2000 can do, but the use of this book can be replaced by using the Windows 2000 help system."},{"rating":"1","title":"really snake crane secret","review":"stupid but good kung fu.

It should have been titled Panjam 3000. While everyone else was doing the same old reggae, and dancehall, the folks at Ragga Force came up with new tunes and new rhythms. This is a very good sampling of some extremely talented Jamaican and Panamanian Artists. The Admiral Bailey and General Degree tracks are great, as are many of the tracks from other Jamaican Artists. The track from Renato is original and unique as are the other tracks from the Panamanian Artists. Definitely worth having in your music library."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a Smokin' CD!","review":"We were at a club and heard Admiral Bailey and were knocked out by the great music and went to get this cd the next day.

However, most of this CD is just too light and happy to be X-Files. Where is the paranoia? Where is the mystery? Where is the tragedy?

The mixtures of styles a from intence music, re-done classics, girly music, Soul Coughing, and instrumental will please any music listener.

Typically (for Hollywood producer-types) the haunting quality of the original arrangement, which set the tone of the show perfectly, was lost in this Bo Diddley Revival version. Maybe in the context of the film this will work - maybe. The rest of the preview cuts: Foo Fighters - pretty good. Everything else - BORING.

While a couple of the tracks didn't impress me, notably \\"One\\" and \\"Invisible Sun\\", I love \\"Flower Man\\", \\"Beacon Light\\", \\"Black\\", and \\"More Than This.\\" Anyone who is a fan of the show should enjoy this CD. It truly captures the spirit of The X-Files!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really Great","review":"I thought this CD was positively wicked :). Songs like \\"One\\" by Filter, and \\"More Than This\\" by The Cure were personal favorites, and many of the songs fitted the spooky, for lack of a better work, X-Files atmosphere. Overall, a great CD. Get it if you like the X-Files."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent soundtrack...","review":"I am a cure nut, so of course when I found out that the cure was on this compilation, I went right out and bought it, not knowing if any of the other songs would be good.

(Not to mention that the Cure song didn't dissapoint!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The songs are out of this world!","review":"The first time I saw the movie I stayed until the credits finished. The reason was that I want to listen to the songs and when I listened to Foo Fighter's Walking After You, I was determined to get it on CD (Soundtrack) and I wasn't dissapointed. The songs in this CD are out this world! Shame they didn't include the original Main Theme of X-Files and I was very dissapointed with the remix of the main theme in the CD. But an excellent soundtrack overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's awesome","review":"I'm usually not a big fan of alternative music, but with this soundtrack, it all sounds good. The only song I don't like is the Bjork song, but everything else is awesome. My favorite song is \\"Walking after You\\" by the Foo Fighters. This is the only album that lets me tolerate alternative music. I highly recommend it to any alternative music lover, even if you're not a fan of the X-files. And what's so great about this album is that the songs don't reflect any aspects of the show, except \\"Walking after You\\". To me, that song reflects Mulder and Scully.I highly recommend to all!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"One\\" reason to buy this soundtrack...","review":"Richard Patrick of Filter once again lays down another excellent track for the X-Files soundtrack. \\"One\\" the Three Dog Night song was well mixed.

Excellent soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"the tracks clearly capture the ethos of the X-Files","review":"With a show as diverse and involved as The X-Files it seems near impossible to capture the gestalt of the characters, their emotions, their thoughts.

Next came \\"Flowerman\\" by Tonic which I could and can swear is describing Mulder. For a long time \\"Flowerman \\" was my favorite song. Then, I moved on to \\"Walking After You\\" and then on to \\"One More Murder.\\" I love the sad, haunting, disturbing lyrics to that song. \\"Hunter\\" by the Icelandic goddess Bjork is an premo piece of muzak also. \\"Black\\" is just that; black.

If so, for which movie was this fluff-ridden monstrosity written? The songs do not flow well, most do not have a melodic \\"hook\\", and the band's virtuosity is noticeably absent. As a huge fan of this band, I could not be more disappointed with this effort. It strikes me as a 3rd rate Tales of Topographic Oceans-type release. Yet, despite lots of filler, over half of TOTO is genuinely excellent music. Only 1-2 cuts from this album qualify on that score. I am hoping for a Relayer-type rebound effort from their next release"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Intended to be YES","review":"This is a great 2 CD set that Sounds like, that's right, Glass Hammer!

At times you thought Jon Anderson was was singing. Nope, Glass Hammer need not make any apologies. They are a great band with great talent and writing skills. And as long as they continue to put out CDs, I'll continue to buy them."},{"rating":"2","title":"They Did It Again","review":"This is another in a chain of excellent releases from Glass Hammer. If you like the previous few releases, you're sure to take to this one quite well. CD1 is keyboard-driven symphonic prog that at times smacks of ELP and Triumvirat; CD2 is more orchestral and features fine, ethereal female vocals. Although this is truly great music, I can't help but ponder the even greater product that could have been achieved had the group relied more heavily on the female vocals (rather than the male vocals) and had the drumming been less thunking and wooden. Nevertheless, bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A unique and one of a kind novel of history","review":"This novel is written like no other book of historical fiction.

On silent hunter the graphics were pretty bad but the gameplay was amazing. Silent hunter 2 has fixed all the problems of silent hunter.

The graphics in silent hunter 2 are better than silent hunter but are still not amazing but even with that the game is awsome. The missions range from recon to sinking enemy troop transports. I always enjoy playing the game. To sum it up: amazing game with better graphics than silent hunter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of fun until it crashes","review":"I like this game a lot, but I quit playing.

I even purchased a new video card to give the game a better chance, but it still hangs up and malfunctions at almost every sitting. I have a 64meg video card, 256 megs of system memory, and a 500 mhz CPU and am not able to get the game to function properly.

I don't know whether there is a quality control issue and one of every few units is defective,or if I operated the machine incorrectly, or if there was some part missing. In any event, even if the leaky messy operation that produced horrible watery coffee was indeed caused by my error, again I blame Gaggia because I noticed that there were lengthy instructions in Italian but much fewer pages in the English section of the manual.

I was looking for a long power strip to mount to the back of a workbench and this fit the bill.The \\"rugged all-metal housing\\" touted in the description is a bit of a gimmick. It's rugged enough, but the extruded aluminum frame is so thin that plastic could have been just as strong. I was a little disappointed in the mounting brackets, which snap into a groove on the aluminum. They're sturdier than I expected but they result in the entire unit being elevated slightly above the mounting surface. This causes it to flex slightly when you plug something into any of the outlets toward the center. It would have helped to have a third mounting bracket to locate in the middle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surgical Tape","review":"I am a cancer patient with a feeding tube in my stomach.

After 3 months use, the valve for the frother will not shut off completely and so it dribbles hot water all over the counter with each use. When making coffee, it sounds like a '68 VW with a hole in the muffler. It uses large quantities of pricey burr-ground coffee and makes a weak, lame brew in microscopic quantities.

Simpson trial-ie a \\"white girl\\" marrying a black sports star entrenched in the \\"white\\" social scene. However, her lack of originality and LONG drawn out attemps to make parallels would put the most uninteligent reader to sleep.I aslo thought the character was so naieve that she could have passed for a ten year old child.

Needless to say I was not a happy camper come page 402 and felt like I had wasted some valuable reading time, as I saw this as a whodunnit type read. I know the author wanted to convey a poignant love story, but she lost me there. I never bought the idea of two people madly in love who was willing/able to weather any storm put before them. Their relationship seemed more superficial than anything of substance. Additionally, another frustrating factor was how many items/relationships were left open, unresolved.

He will sit, fascinated, through a longer library book with beautiful pictures and large pages, while he just wants to chew on these books.

Anyone with an adequate amount of research time and a microfiche of Philadelphia newspapers from the period could have produced the same, perhaps better, results.The author chronicles the season from begining to end but in the interim, his narrative is sadly unable to capture either the drama of the season or the personality of the team. There is no effort to get behind the headlines and boxscores to the real story within the story.Save your time and money or, better yet, spend it on the Roberts/Rogers version of the Whiz Kids historic season.

In other words, this is a great espresso machine.That said, Gaggia uses the identical internals on their Evolution, Carezza, Espresso, and Coffee de Luxe machines. The only differences are in the external \\"looks.\\" I personally find the Evolution the most attractive, with the Carezza a close second, but you can form your own opinion by simply looking at the pictures. Why these models sell for different prices remains a mystery. In Europe, I have seen the Carezza typically cost the most, and the Evolution sell for the least. (For example, just check Amazon.co.uk.)

So, the editors try to provide reading interest. The book is very thorough, covering most of the issues one should address with an aging population. However, textbooks rarely convey experience or depth. I would suggest 'Falling Upward' by Richard Rohr (also wonderful as an audible book, See audible.com) for the spiritual aspect of aging.

So while some of the dings may have been from shipping, some bends are simply too mangled to have happened during shipping. Now I realize bent fins won't affect functionality much (too many bends and airflow blocks WILL affect cooling), but it really calls into question the integrity of the pipes. Were they bent too?

If you are having trouble sleeping, rent this, the pace is slow enough to lull you to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible movie","review":"This is the worst movie I have ever seen. The acting is poor, the story line terrible, and the theme is beyond belief. Psychopaths are giggling at the absurdity of this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"ANOTHER B MOVIE","review":"This movie lacked a good script, direction,and acting. There was way to much of Ray Liotta who is the main character in this movie. Ray Lotta usually plays a secondary actor at this time in his career. He doesn't have the charisma or acting skills to bethe lead actor when you have a boring script. The script needed a script doctor to tweak it to make it more suspenseful and interesting. If you are looking for suspensethis movie is not for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE RIVER MURDERS is nasty and foulmouthed.","review":"A nasty foulmouthed murder story about a middle-aged homicide detectivewhose ex-bed partners - about a hundred of them - are dropping like flies,killed by a handsome freako who thinks he's revenging his unborn dead brothersand sisters.The star. an out of condition Ray Liotta, is miscast as the homicide detective.The River Murders is a dark story with religious content bordering on thesacrilegious, containing sexual elements of the old X rated porn flicks, couldhave been something special, or at the least watchable, if in the hands of anexperienced or mature director. But as is, The River Murders looks like it wasmade by and for fifteen year old boys.On the plus side, the director Rich Cowan has given up directing and isrunning for Congress in Washington state's 5th District."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad at its Best","review":"If you are a Ray Liotta fan you may like it, but the story is bad, and sick on top of that. The only thing I can say good about this dvd is the reproduction of it is good, as good as some blue ray disc I have seen. This movie is better left unseen by anyone, when Christian Slater ask Ray Liottas character if he had f***** is mother, you should be looking for the stop, and open buttons on you dvd player. The movie only goes down from there. Ray Liotta has done some good movies, but this is not one of them. If I were asked about this movie, I would say DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY !!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Please....tired choice of villain","review":"Good actors but very tired worn out villain. Hollywood you can do better than that! You have good actors, come up with a more clever plot....forget the politically correct choice. It is a retread!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"Normally I would review the quality of the transfer media or product, but not the movie itself.However, since this is only a DVD format, and a relatively new release, I am actually violating one of my own rules this time to warn those who might be considering buying it.After having anticipated its arrival greatly, and typically enjoying good murder mysteries, I found this one to be severe let down. It had potential but never seemed to ignite for me.A sick premise doesn't offend me if it is well designed and amply terminated after its exposure. This plot did neither.I wanted to like it. I liked Ray in most of his other films and one would think that having Mr. Slater on board would give more horsepower to any flick. Nope. Sorry. Just MHO."},{"rating":"1","title":"its not worth your time","review":"It's not worth your time. Watch striking distance with Bruce Willis instead. Same story only better.Basically the biggest problem is the writing and the lack of emotion from the actors."},{"rating":"1","title":"The River Murders","review":"Starts off Good then just goes downhill,A Priest of course has to be involved and not in the best light sadly.Not Ray Liotta or his Funny Accented Wife can save the movie,Pretty much vulgar and sick.But I am sure that was the goal to shock in order to create \\"Art\\" which I have always found to be faux-art. The movie had potential but once it uses Religion in a negative Light to advance The Film makers agenda hidden or not then the movie is no longer a movie but a statement and therefore becomes just another form of bigotry."},{"rating":"1","title":"A significant hole in the plot","review":"It involves the DNA evidence. Police cleared Liotta's character via DNA evidence, while the murders were in progress -- his did not match that of the killer. But when performing the comparison, the DNA examiners should have observed something else that was extremely important."},{"rating":"2","title":"The River Murders","review":"This is a fine thriller! It is somewhat unbelievable, but I am glad I continued viewing it. The confrontation at the end made it all worth it. Good acting and fine atmosphere make this a must see!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Product","review":"I love this product. Ventiliation in top is super. I recommend it. I use it to keep worms for feedeing my pac man frog."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bahmp-ba-dumpa... bahmp-ba-dumpa","review":"Most Jobim purists don't like this album. But if you like Frank Sinatra and you need a little dinner music or company on a long car ride, you'll love his rendition of these Jobim favorites. From the opening intro of \\"Girl from Ipanema\\" to the closing strings of \\"Once I Loved,\\" this album has a tenderness and longing only Sinatra could deliver."},{"rating":"2","title":"Genius","review":"This album is a standout even by Sinatra's own highest majestic standards. It epitomizes elegance, romance, class and masculine feeling. More than anything or anybody, Sinatra proves in this album the sublime eloquence of understatement. There is no better music for a romantic dinner or a quiet drink than this album. There also is no better or more convincing interpreter of the magnificent Jobim songbook. I would rank this album as among the very top of Sinatra's work right up there with \\"Only the Lonely\\", \\"Swinging Lovers\\", \\"Wee Small Hours\\", and \\"September of my Years\\". It is an absolute must for any jazz or vocal music lover."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterful Example of the Art Of Singing","review":"For those intrested in the TECHNIQUE of Sinatra's singing, this album is revelatory. Sinatra functions as what Sun Ra called a \\"sound scientist\\" in that every line, word, even SYLABLE of each song is sung deliberately nuanced and inflected, both lyrically and melodically. The amount of DETAIL in the singing here is stunning-even by Sinatra's own standards. Of course, none of this would matter if the music lacked feeling. Don't worry-this is probably Sinatra's most consistently soulful singing since the \\"Nice & Easy\\" set and arguably his most emotionally mature work ever. Two bummers, though: 1-short playing time, but don't let that stop you; and 2-the depth of the work done here makes you ponder, with not a little sadness at what could/should have been, the emptiness of so much (but by no means all) of his later, post Capitol work. No worry here,though-this one is infinitely deep and majestically real."},{"rating":"2","title":"Subtle but swinging","review":"Amazing music; never have I heard Sinatra singing with such subtlety, never have I sensed so much swing in his singing, and yet this is far les \\"swing\\"-oriented album than many others from this era.Collaboration with A. C. Jobim is not something I would expect to work so well since it was recorded in the era when Sinatra was mostly about more extrovert, self-confidently \\"macho\\" renditions of often cynical songs.The magic that is Jobim somehow managed to inspire this intriguing merging of worlds and styles and it is quite difficult for me to pick a favorite tune from this brilliant album."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a very good CD","review":"but at only 28 minutes, the record companies certainly are fleecing you. It is worth 10 bucks or so, but it would have been nice if they had put some extra tracks on the CD version"},{"rating":"1","title":"I love both performers, but I was disappointed by this CD.","review":"I love both performers, but I was disappointed by this CD. I didn't feel these arrangements brought out the best in the both of them as I had hoped. I was simply bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A SINATRA CLASSIC BY FAR.","review":"If this is your favorite Sinatra album, your collection must be horrible. Because there are dozens of cd's out there with him paired up with Tommy Dorsey, Billy May, and Count Basie that destroy this cd in its quality. And for you new Sinatra fans out there don't start off your collection with this. Go with the young Sinatra, back in the Columbia years 42-52 with Dorsey. Or you can take the popular route and get all the songs you know on Reprise. However, you won't get the great voice that he had, but you'll get some great songs with a swingin' band that make you wan't to dance. COME DANCE WITH ME. a must have, check it out on amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not their best work","review":"I have to tell you, I love Sinatra, I love Jobim, I love Bossa Nova, this album is horrible. I am literally shocked at the response that people are giving this. This product was produced at a time when Bossa was the rage, and every crooner and jazz musician was making Bossa albums. This album introduces nothing new, and the vocals and arrangements are mediocre at best. Really, do not get this album, it is awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Off key and off rhythm","review":"I bought this CD without having heard any of the songs on it. It's terrible. Sinatra sings off key and he just doesn't phrase right for the rhythm - it seems he's phrasing for a pop standard and it doesn't work for me. Antonio Carlos Jobim is great however."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it.","review":"If you want kitch, buy this record. If you want quality brazilian jazz, get \\"Elis and Tom\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Classic","review":"This is a smooth album from 2 of the most listenable musicians of their era. I grew up on Jobim, Getz, Gilberto and have a fairly extensive knowledge of the songs of Jobim. There could have been a few more Jobim songs that I would have liked to be included(altogether the songs are not the cream of his compositions).I am wondering where 'Agua de Beber' is. I've heard it performed by Sinatra before and I thought it was on this disc.The best cuts are Girl from Ipanema, Change Partners and Baubles, Bangles and Beads. I love this album for these cuts and usually play it late at night.A classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Truly Beautiful and Magnificent Album","review":"Like many of the prior reviewers of this album, I believe that this is a truly magical collaboration. The pairing of Frank Sinatra and Tom Jobim with Claus Ogerman conducting has resulted in music that is so unbelievably hauntingly beautiful. I do not believe that there is a better CD to be found anywhere. It is just so absolutely magnificent. Especially pleasing to hear are the three original American songs set to the \\"new beat,\\" of which \\"Change Partners\\" is a two minute and forty second masterpiece worth the price of the album alone. That and the lyrically beautiful \\"Dindi\\" are the highlights of a truly outstanding album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A master piece that took very long to arrive!","review":"The people on bundatrade(don't like the name as it has double meaning in portuguese) took about 6 weeks to send me the cd.Once it got here it was ...gues what? The wrong Frank Sinatra's album and No Tom Jobim....Anyways after a complaint (which i will have to give them that) they sent the write cd and I sent back their cd. I think in the end they did ok and fair.The album is great anyone that ever heard the girl from ipanema with them both singing know what I am talking about."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums ever!","review":"Frank Sinatra and Carlos Jobim combining to create a masterpiece.This is one of my favorite albums of Frank. The songs are very relaxing to listen to. All the songs feel like they should be on the album as well, no clutter thrown on this one.This album is short and sweet - A must purchase for the Sinatra collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sinatra at his best","review":"This is great music sung by a great voice in his prime. It is soft,yet very sensual music. Sinatra and Jobim are quite a pairing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My absolute favorite Sinatra CD!","review":"O.K., so I'm a Reprise-Sinatra fan first and foremost. There is a huge body of work by Sinatra from the 50's that is to be admired; however, Sinatra really found his voice and maturity in the 60's (ignore the fodder and look for the jewels). How many incarnations did Sinatra have? How many comebacks? Well, the best and most interesting of these is the Sinatra-Jobim album.. Sit under the summer nightime sky, ponder past loves or current flames, and listen, really listen to this CD. This is in the top-5 Sinatra CDs that everyone should own and become intimately familiar with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably the best record ever made","review":"What can I say to convince you to get this record? Just the two brief occasions when Antonio Carlos Jobim sings (in \\"Girl from Ipanema\\" and \\"How Insensitive\\") alone justify the price of the record. The contrast between those two voices, Sinatra's and Jobim's is so dramatic and rich, that it lends the whole record a golden aura. Aw, what the hey, just get the goddam CD and thank me later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Here is the Classic Mauser Reference","review":"I have a number of books on Mauser's but this is the definitive work.
