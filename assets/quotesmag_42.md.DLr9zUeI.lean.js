It takes a few hours to get your hands on weaponry, the majority of the city is locked off from the get-go, and the driving controls take some serious getting used to. I am a decent gamer, and play a ton of games in all genres, and I had to retry quite a few of the early missions due to some seriously tough vehicle handling. that's not to say that it's bad, but rather that you won't immediately be zipping around, pulling off perfect drifts and turns. The combat, however, controls brilliantly, and is a blast.So, basically, this game's amazing, but not without its flaws. If you get frustrated easily, it's still worth getting, just because there's so much \\"free play\\" stuff to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Amazing","review":"GTA IV offers amazing graphics, great story line, and tons to do.The amount of content in the game is simply astounding.

The talk radio is very good, but the music leaves alot to be desired."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's easy to be impressed by Liberty City. It's as close to New York City as any game has ever got.

From the pedestrians that make up the neighborhood to the realistic design of the buildings. The weather changes and the days progress realistically. This is one of those games where you can just take it in and enjoy the scenery. In Grand Theft Auto you have the freedom to do what you want. This game is intended for adults. The language and content can be mature most of the time. Although that is at a parents discretion. I wouldn't suggest this game for everyone. Although I would suggest it for those who have enjoyed previous Grand Theft Auto games. I would also suggest it for those who enjoy mafia or crime movies. This game will have you sitting back and enjoying the incredible story.

Just tired of the pro-Euro bias in that pops up periodically, with America as the sole representative of everything bad and Europe as the sole representative of good. Any European immigrant is shown to be corrupted by America, one even proclaims as much. The little websites and ads promote this idea. Claiming, for example, that most Hollywood movies have villains with British accent. In reality what would it be--maybe 1% of Hollywood movies have British villain? As a Roma, my family has experience discrimination and hate in Europe which hasn't been paralleled in America--and Europeans have been doing that to us for a thousand years (so much for Americans making Europeans evil rather than the other way around.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring GAme","review":"I highly recommend that people rent this game before buying. I honestly dont get why its rated so high. I was so bored while playing this. The controls are difficult and when you walk the screen always jumps to the wrong direction. Fighting multiple opponents is so awkward. I stopped playing it because i was so bored. I first had to pick up some girl and take her bowling.

The graphics is nice but that really don't matter its the game play that counts, you can fly a helicopter but the thing is the police just come after you when you fly one and you can't go in not much stores, exept bowling, pool, the bar, clothes store, and thats it.

Everything is there, although I am feeling as if there is a bit of the 'crazyness factor' missing that was apparent in the previous titles. I have yet to see an all out riot in then streets. But the freedom is still compelling. Want to create a traffic jam on a bridge? Done. Want to set the 1st car on fire and watch them blow up one-by-one? Done. Sweet.

Lots of other reviews here--I'll only say that I loved the realism so much so that it ultimately deflated the experience for me. After a while, honestly, I tired of living in a run down neighborhood, driving old cars, and being what amounted to being a low level criminal and killer. I asked myself \\"why am I doing this?\\" I get the moral ambiguity, the social commentary and all that, but give me some glitz and some pizazz. Kind of like the Goodfellas of games--gosh the bars were dingy, and the dates were pretty depressing. Again, I understand that's part of the point. I hope GTA 5 offers some high living.

I GET IT, I may be biased being a CA native but I could care less about New York. Why not switch up the scenery with Philly? Same-ish accent and different scenery. Overall this game is pretty fun, the multiplayer is surprisingly FUN. The story and graphics are awesome, I am just SICK TO DEATH of Liberty City. Also I was a little surprised to notice this game lacked some of the depth that San Andreas had with the gambling, safe houses, vehicle mods, lack of airfield, less boats, no skydiving, slower cars & the soundtrack on this GTA doesn't hold a candle to San Andreas. The story line is still typical GTA flair, there were a few times I laughed very hard and groaned in discomfort but it was a fun ride.

Gameplay plus story. The pinnacle was San Andreas. Awesome gameplay mechanics. Epic story that carried through during the entire game. What's missing in GTA 4? The story. Characters (Like Brucie and Little Jacob) are developed and then dropped almost entirely. Other characters (Roman and your old, now gay, friend) are simply annoying. There is no consistent \\"bad guy\\" / nemesis, per se. In San Andreas you had the corrupt cops antagonizing you from the first scene to the last, literally. Your Grove Street amigos, Woozy and others were woven into the story in meaningful ways throughout. GTA 4 lacks all of this. I felt disconnected from the plot and was simply \\"driving over there, shooting some guys, driving over here, shooting some guys, driving back over there, shooting still more guys, and so-forth.\\" Worth a play through, but leaves you wanting much, much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great looking but glitched out!","review":"WAY too many glitches to be worth it. I've never had an experience like this with a video game. For the longest time I couldn't get through to multiplayer. Then it started freezing up. If I try to stop the game it will restart the entire system. I loved the other games and the graphics are stunning and the physics are cool in this one. But wait until they fix the bugs before you purchase. What makes this thing so funny is that Take 2 interactive is trying to avoid being hostily taken over. They argue that they are worth more. I think instead of the game that saves them this might be the game that sinks them."},{"rating":"1","title":"+++ABOMINATION+++","review":"I thought halo 3 was over hyped but gta 4 redefines the concept. There is no way this game deserves the landslide of perfect scores it has recieved, and the only reasonable conclusion is that the reviewers were paid off. The gameplay is the same as ever and it gets very repetitive and dull. drive to point a. shoot some dude. drive to point b. repeat ad nauseum. The story is a complete joke where they throw in every gangster cliche and rascist sterteotype in the book. Includes numerous lame, banal attempts at satire. Nico Bellic has the personality of a cardboard box, save yourself the trouble and watch scarface instead. And the graphics are seriously sub-par. The characters are super blocky and look like something from the original xbox or ps2, textures are bland, and overall its pretty unimpressive. Unless you have a thing for the demoiselles d'avignon you are not going to find the strippers here attractive. dont be fooled by the press. save your cash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whats with the driving?","review":"This could've been a great game if driving time was reduced by 90%.

It had some issues online the first 3 day's of release but it was server issues and not ps3 issues, so if your thinking of getting something that will last you more than 6 hours of entertainment for your 60 bucks well this is a good choice, soo order it and ill see you online."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I was sent a defective game.

You'll cahnge your reviews immediately. As for the gameplay, BORING! I picked up this game the day it came out, stopped playing less than midway and have not picked it back up. I cant stand the fact that I have to drive 10 minutes to get to a mission, die in 1 minute and then have to start all over again and drive another ten minutes. (real time, sometimes the driving is longer). I have more important things to do with my life. Also, the story line sucks.

The graphics are much better than PS2 games. Don't you know that this is PS3 meaning Blu-ray games. The game is dark when you first start playing that's why you go to the display & you change the brightness,Contrast,Saturation. I don't beleive the comments.

At the same time, I just can't give it quite the 5 stars I want to because I miss the expansive world of San Andreas. I find a lot of the city feels identical and it can get confusing and almost boring at times.

The missions and reputation you have to get with the others makes it more interesting than just going around destroying everything I wish they would just make it so you could download more missions or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack of difficulty levels makes it unplayable for me","review":"This game is too difficult for me which made the experience frustrating and ultimately unplayable. I see others find it too easy. This could have been easily solved by having 5 levels of difficulty from very easy to very hard. The game would appeal to a much greater consumer base and would have had much greater sales if it had 5 difficulty levels.The other major related problem is that one cannot save in the middle of a mission. Because of this one must repeat the same driving sequence over and over to finally get through the hard part of the mission (ultimately I could not pass missions and had to stop playing the game).Because of the two problems above, I find this game more frustration than fun. I will not buy any more games of this series or any games that do not have levels of difficulty (hopefully 5 levels)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Freezing Issues!

Steve is a very gifted player and teacher. However, the production of this DVD and the lack of TAB will make it frustrating to even advanced students who do not read standard notation. If Alfred Music had inserted more chapter markers it would have made it much more user friendly. Steve breaks down the licks very well, but without TAB or a way to quickly return to the top of the lick, it is much slower going than it needs to be. This is an older lesson that was repackaged by Alfred. They should have spent the nominal time and expense to make these lessons accessible to non reading guitarists or clearly marked that it contains no TAB. Tab is the industry standard for stringed instrument instructional material. Alfred took the cheap way out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be warned","review":"I read the reviews on this and was prepared but must say even being prepared didn't get me ready.

That is not the scope of this book, despite the title. It does not address LD in depth, test results and their meaning, educational alternatives, etc. My main concern is the misinformation about IDEA federal law and the rights of the learning disabled. Specifically, there is the sentence that states a school evaluation \\"can take up to six months or longer.\\" (p.27).

As someone who did not live through the bizarre historical events, I thought the premise of the book had promise. The potential of this premise is lost in a hodgepodge of overdeveloped characters.

During each segment of internal dialogue, of which there are a billion, I kept thinking, \\"Noone thinks this much, and even if they did, just tell the freakin story!\\" Minutae rules the day in this book, and I kept at it in the hopes that a story would jump up and pull me in.

I stubbled across the Mad Catz expansion pack and decided to give it a try when i saw the price. I instantly put the extra ram to use with an all nighter of Star Wars episode one and Turok 2. After hours of play I was completly satisfied and impressed with the advanced graphics and action. I am also happy to note I have not experienced any of the crashes or frozen screens that have been reported with some other non-nintendo expansion packs. I'm sure this is because overheating is eliminated with the special \\"vented\\" cover that comes with the product. I would recommend the expansion pack to anyone, especially with the new games that are coming out. The fact that Mad Catz is less expensive than nintendo's pack is a true decision maker for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the one made from Nintendo instead!!!","review":"Do not get this one it is a ripoff compared to the nintendo i got it then sold it i tried it out for 5 minutes it freezed i then got the nintendo one i played non-stop for 2 hours it didn't freeze do not get this one!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A holding pattern but nice","review":"Die-hard fans will find this a necessary purchase even if a little redundant.

The panel is thin-gauge steel, and is well painted. Has plenty of knockouts at the top and bottom, as well as sides, and even a few on the back. No sharp edges to speak of, pretty durable.Has a knockout for a single duplex outlet at the bottom right.Comes with some velcro stripping and, edge protection material for the knock-outs and various screws. Kind of pricey for what it is, but in the world of structured wiring, that is the norm.If you are considering a structured wiring panel, skip the smaller sizes and get the biggest you can. You will fill it. Great place for cable, telephone, network distribution. Mounting brackets are available for all sorts of things, from PC boards like alarm systems, to your own routers, cable modems, switches, batteries, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"IF ONLY IT HAD AN ON AND OFF SWITCH","review":"IT WOULD HAVE BE NICE IF IT HAD A ON AND OFF SWITCH, I THOUGHT THE ONE I ORDERED HAD ONE, WHEN I CALLED A CUSTOMER REP THEY TOLD ME THAT ONE DID, AND ONE DIDNT, I JUST HAPPENED TO GET THE ONE THAT DIDNT,IT IS VERY ANOYING TO HAVE THE LIGHT ON ALL NIGHT AND IN ORDER TO SHUT IT OFF I HAVE TO PULL THE SCANNER OUT OF THE SPOT IT IS ON MY COMPUTER DESK AND UNPLUG IT.

I called the seller who said they would refund my money with a business check, I am awaiting that... the rest of the quality of this kit is poor for the price you are asking for it, it is an old mold and has lots of flash, pock marks and seams also not many parts, no engine, etc...

The highlighs for me was NWA doing Nutin but a G Thang, Powerman 5000 Nobody is real, Mya case of the ex, Nickleback leader of men, and last Bionic Jive Pump. The bad part of this cd was in my viewpoint track 8 Ja Rule Between you and me, track 10 Eve love is blind, and track 15 the song called and you know us by the trail of the dead just couldn't do anything for me.

I absolutely love it! I watched the short video online to see if I would like itand decided to order it. I feared that I wouldn't get a good workout, but I was surprised. I knew what moves were coming dueto Violet's teaching method. I am going to order more of her DVD's. I have tried many other trainer's video's and truly enjoy Violet'steaching and training method.

I look forward to continued success workingout at home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite!","review":"I have a couple different workout DVDs but this one is by-far my favorite. This is a varied, high-energy workout that leaves me feeling really good by the end of it. And it's honestly really fun to do--after my first workout with this DVD I was actually looking forward to the next one.For those who want to ease themselves into a workout, Violet has two back-ups working out behind her, one of whom does the same workout, just not as high-impact. I think that's really great that that option is included.I would definitely recommend this DVD. Even if you've never done kick-boxing before, this is a great one to start with. Have fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tried several times.","review":"I have tried this workout several times through streaming here and netflix. I just could not get into it. I love cardio/weight mixes but this was just hard to understand her cues and didn't pose a huge challenge for me. I heard she was part of Powerstrikes or some kickboxing brand so I was very interested, but I just didn't find it here. Seems like a knowledgeable instructor that practices what she preaches (you don't get that body by not working for it), but it didn't translate well onto this video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but could be more effective","review":"I have taken various kickboxing classes so I am accustomed to the various combinations that this workout applies. However, if you are a beginner or not totally coordinated you may end up finding yourself spending more time trying to figure out what you're supposed to be doing rather than sweating.To me a lot of the strength training was a waste - not enough repetitions to really get any burning feeling.The cardio is decent a few times I felt a bit winded and I would definitely say that this is a fun work out - fast paced and the instructor is upbeat and pleasing to listen to.I was sweating by the end of it but wasn't as thrilled with the workout as I was hoping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Changed the way I feel about working out","review":"This is the first product review I have ever written, but I read so many reviews when I started my at-home workout routine that I wanted to give my input.

Worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent video","review":"This is my second Violet Zaki exercise DVD and once again - for me - she hits a home run. It's challenging but also a lot of fun. You will know you've worked out, but it's doable, she's encouraging and a fabulous teacher. You can choose the segment you want based on how much time you have - 20 - 51 mins. etc. She definitely - most definitely - knows her stuff and makes it fun. You get toned but you also get the needed cardio - and the kick boxing moves in this one work you but are not too difficult to master.

Secondly, the set was dark, and the camera angles were horrible. This made it difficult to see what you were supposed to do (proper form and movement). I have went to kickboxing classes in the past, and this DVD just does not do kickboxing as a cardio workout justice. I had to go running afterward just to get my workout, and I will not be adding it as part of my workouts anymore. If I can't get a good workout the first time I use a workout DVD, it's not worth my time. There are too many DVD's out there that will give me a good workout the first time. Maybe it is better for people who are just beginning to workout for the first time in their life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great work out video.","review":"I have many workout videos and this one is perfect for a 30 minute workout. Not a lot of jumping around, you do get winded in the first minute and feel like you want to quit. Great work out for cardio and conditioning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Energized to exercise","review":"Today was my first time trying this workout. Although most DVD's these days try to scam you by not really caring about your weight loss, but money for the matter. But Violet sure does not do that! She is ready to help you achieve your goal, by getting you motivated to have a great workout! It's fun to be able to kick mid air, and get some of a hard days aggression out. One of my favorite parts was the cool down at the end. It completely relaxed you and your muscles, so I know I won't be as sore tomorrow. And the other great thing about this video is that once I have gotten used to doing one of the 20 minute workouts, I can eventually do both. Weight Loss Cardio Kick is completely recommended! During the workout she knows when the tough parts come along and really pushes you to go the extent you need to go. I will post some of my body results after I try this for about a month.

I breezed through this - many of us already teach these moves in classes - there is NOTHING innovative here. If I was a beginner interested in doing something to take me to the next level, then this is PERFECT. There is nothing wrong with this video, Violet's technique or anything else, it is simply a BEGINNER, and in small moments, INTERMEDIATE level - this information should be releflected in the title and description."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs more direction","review":"The dvd isn't that bad but I find that it's defintiely not for beginners.

But I just started out with this and I am not that pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Instructor doesn't talk-she works out with you!","review":"I own quite a few workout DVDs and the issue I have with most of them is after I initially learn the moves, I get irritated with the instructor discontinuing her workout to show me someone's butt or abs. Violet Zaki is hardcore, does every single exercise with you, never pauses to point at anyone's butt,legs or stomach. I find myself working hard because she is too. The only other instructor I've ever seen work out with her audience all the way through is Tammy Lee Webb in her Buns of Steel video (equally motivating)."},{"rating":"1","title":"a little dry","review":"Cheese was a little dry to eat with fruit or bread, however the flavor was good.

Are these \\"beautiful\\" people so sheltered in their insulated little worlds; that when they venture outside they are reduced to giggles by a fat man? And why does everyone harp about her weight?

I agree with the reviewer that said a better editor would have gone a long way.

I guess that is just the way bamboo is.Anyways, these coasters DO NOT soak up any water. When I go to pick up my cup of ice water, it is sitting in a puddle of water on top of the coaster...which then spills over the edge of the coaster defeating the purpose of keeping the water off of my tables. In addition to this, after some use, I noticed some black spots in the crevices of the bamboo. Upon closer inspection I discovered the coaster was molding because it was constantly wet. Maybe I just use my coasters too much, but I've never heard of moldy coasters.I am terribly disappointed in my purchase, and I would probably return them if they weren't moldy...don't waste your money on these."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"You can buy this product at Wal-Mart for 6.99!

The remaining content is primarily focused on project management and UML is only used in the examples. Even the quality of the project management content is questionable.The authors focus on the top down approach. Management makes all decisions. Programmers are considered to be nothing more than allocable resources, despite the fact that they have in-depth knowledge of the technology. A recent project undertaken by my company followed this development process. After two years and six million dollars, there were no deliverables and most involved were no longer with the company. Instead of accepting input from the staff programmers, the management gained all their information from salesmen and sales presentations.If you are looking for a UML book, this book will not fulfill your requirements.

There is a huge case study of a concert booking and ticket sales system, which is a good idea, but any meaningful information is lost in a sea of extra-verbose descriptions of what all the different 'architects' are doing and how they are being motivated to do a good job.

That segues into the animated story which looks very like the illustrations in the books, but the drawings come to life with actors' voices. It's really charming. the only irritating thing is that with the live action beginning and ending to each story, there are only 3 or 4 variations of it and after a while it wears on one. But my daughter is quite happy and it's for her anyway. This series is from an old BBC miniseries. It's very sweet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Delightful","review":"I bought this DVD collection for my daughter and we both absolutely adore it.

Because I used to have a licensed day care, every month I would buy new things for the children in my care. We always had such a good time together, and these videos were ones we would watch during our movie time. The children never tired of them. In fact, I even had the sound track that I would play during lunch and quietly during rest-time. In this day of VIOLENCE AND SEX in movies, these are so refreshing to show to the little ones who come to visit.

Unfortunately, after you plug it in, you will not continue to be impressed. Dialing a number is painful, to your ear. Even with the volume turned completely down, the dialing tones are excruciatingly, and unnecessarily, loud, and the ringing you hear for the next few minutes won't be an incoming call. The microphone is a failure in design. It only extends part-way down your cheek, not to your mouth, leading to comments like \\"You sound like your sitting across the room from a cheap speaker phone.\\" That is if they can even hear you, and don't hang up. Plantronics really needs to consider revising the design to incorporate a voice tube... This should have been a great product, but based upon the two significant shortcomings I mentioned, I cannot recommend it for purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Headset only Plantronics T20 -- Choose Another","review":"I've had this phone for about a year and have been unhappy with it from day one.

The listening sound quality is okay, however, callers often tell me they can't hear me unless I jockey the headset microphone right to my lips and speak loudly. Having to locate the headset to answer a call is a real pain. I don't think the description adequately explains the fact that you cannot answer the phone without locating the headset, untangling it and putting it on your head first to speak. Also, the dialing tones hurt your ears when you dial with the headset on. Other than that, it's great. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for listening, not for talking.","review":"I've used Plantronics headsets for years.

I then asked if they knew that the dial tones were far too loud, and I was told that they had NO complaints about that either. Don't they every read the reviews here?This T20 is going back to Amazon.

Second, upon playing the game I felt a bit betrayed. Nothing on the packaging indicates that this game has a specifically Christian outlook, but it becomes apparent upon play. Had I know, I wouldn't have bought it in the first place. Now that I have I suppose I'll have to sell it in an attemp to recoup something. The designers, et al, should have had the integrity to be honest about the slant of the game BEFORE unsuspecting people buy it and discover it for themselves.

Finally I looked on the manufacturer's website and found they had something called \\"the book of dead ends\\" but it is out of print. There are a lot of dead ends in this game, and unless you know how to get from point A to point B, you might want to search the interenet for the walkthrough that I found where someone tells you step by step what to do to get anywhere.Other than that, the graphics are pretty good and you will enjoy the discovery of what's inside the great pryamid and the sphinx (if you ever get that far). If you're looking for every clue to solve a puzzle, you won't find them all because they're not all there (as far as I can tell).

I loved the puzzles and walking around the Giza and the Cheops pyramids.My dissatisfactory comments goes to the graphics--something Dreamcatcher is notorious for. The sky graphics are inadequately designed with bands and the helicopter needs work to display the the realistic texture. The immersive experience of \\"Riddle of the Spinx\\" is 3 from a scale of 1 to 5. \\"3\\" because of the helicopter and the skies strips the immersive factors away from the game.If you can't wait for Myst 3: Exile, purchase this title to alleviate your impatience for Myst 3.

BIG MISTAKE. the game crashed and reset system settings more than once. the game controls are primitive -- they are similar to games 2-3 years old. the graphics are a joke. check the sky -- heavily banded. there is more wrong, but suffice it to say: don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing and offensive","review":"Disappointing because the graphics were often beautiful and the premise interesting, but the technical glitches were too much to bear.

Ok. Don't get me wrong but this is a great game. Graphics and transitions need a lot of work but music and storyline are majorly awesome.

I think its optimum sytem is a win95 less than Pen3, rather than a win98 Pen3 as it became sluggish or locked on activated puzzles, or jumped ahead on occasion (I got into the River of Death early, but forgot to save it until I'd already hit the wrong bird tablet)But a lot of historical accuracy and a fun manner of tying together many of the legends about the area. Plus you get to explore monuments you probably wouldn't be able to see that much of through the crowds and barriers if you went to the real ones."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't get it to run","review":"I bought this game because so many were saying how great it is. Well I had problems right off with sound and the computer freezing. Now this was weird as I have a new Dell 8100 pentium 4. So I went to Dreamcatchers site on the web only to find out that my processor was too fast. I had to turn the graphics capability down so low that it was impossible for me to see anything but grainy shots and it still froze (although I did fix the sound problem). Probably a great game but not for the super fast computer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game","review":"If you like interesting, non-violent, adventure games, then this is a must have. It starts off by giving you a run down of discoveries made with the real Sphinx and Pyramids and then pulls you in to make this one of the most \\"real\\" feeling games I've played. With many games I have gotten stuck and frustrated trying to find solutions to puzzles that are not logical, but in this game everything seemed to flow beautifully. Whenever I got stuck I would just go back and explore again, and see things I hadn't the first time.The only downside to this game is its primitive graphics. Though good, it could have been much clearer and more advanced. This game has problems on PC's with the minimum requirements, yet doesn't do well on very fast machines either. Thankfully I was able to use a friend's 333 pentium and it ran just fine then. The music is occasionally intrusive and annoying as well.Overall, though, I'm glad I got it, and it was worth the cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"ROTS - The Best PC Adventure Game Ever","review":"Over the past 5 years, I've been very selective with the PC adventure games I've played/purchased.

I must rate Riddle of the Sphinx well AHEAD of all of these games, for the following reasons: outstanding themes, wonderful ambience, coherent game structure, marvelous soundtrack, and the logical nature of puzzles. In sum, Riddle of the Sphinx is the best adventure game I have ever played. My suggestion is to BUY IT. If you enjoy pure adventure, this game delivers it in spades--you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have (but...)","review":"This game was so cultural and interesting, I felt like I often got lost in it. You have to have this game, I can't even stress enough how good it is.The only flaws is like everyone is saying. It crashes if you play too long. So you might want to go for about thirty minutes, then stop and reboot your computer. And it WAS too dark down in the pyramids, and although I hate having to adjust my monitor for games, it is well worth changing the brightness ahead of time because you'll want to see everything.

Nearly","review":"When I first bought this game I thought, 'Well, you control an island... it can't be that good.' How wrong I was. It goes so much deeper that you will be surprised by the sheer amount of detail! You could call it a mix between Simcity and Constructor in that you build on a large scale and are unable to control them directly. It's only real drawback is its occasional difficulty. The bickering citizens with all sorts of beliefs may start to get on your nerves. Apart from that this really is a GREAT game but with 'Simsville' coming out soon, how will it fair?

The options are EXTREMELY limited. You have roughly 10 political options to choose from, and essentially your only other choice is building. The buildings are nothing special, and the game clock moves too fast, even on the slowest setting.Maybe the best modern political simulation, but you'd still be better off buying AOE or Civilization."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Idea Bad Interface","review":"How a great concept went this bad is unbelievable. The interface is awkward. The statistics are presented in such a way that you are never quite sure what exactly is going on. There is no easy way to change anything, you must hunt around the screen to find anything, for all the micro managers out there it might be worth trying. Soundtrack is good for the first game or so then it must be turned off or a headache will occur. The manual is the type that requires the purchase of an \\"Official Strategy Guide.\\" There are no real explainations in the manual at all. The final problem is the appearance, the graphics were great in Railroad Tycoon II (Tropico uses the same \\"Engine\\")because there you really didn't have to hunt around the screen to play the game, there was always a menu choice. In Tropico the muddy graphics muddle the mix and just make it frustrating to have to click on the smallest building to change its settings.

The list of his opponents is remarkable e.g., Byrne,Tal,Geller,Petrosian,Larsen,Spassky,etc starting about 1956 to 1978. Mr. Pandolfini gives the level of difficulty from 1 to 5 for each diagram-one large diagram on each page.

While it is not a book for learning tactics it is basically a tactics puzzle book. I love this book bc its not very long and I use it along with lev alburts book to warm up before tournaments.

Fischer exemplified pure genius in his games and incredible tactical imagination. Bruce Pandolfini has collected combinations from 101 of Fischer's games complete with clues to help you try to discover what Ficsher came up with as well as brief commentary on each combination.Fischer's moves really were the epitome of what makes this game of chess so beautiful. Any of us would be so lucky to gain even a fraction of the genius Fischer demonstrated on the chess board.

The product is very easy to set up and program if you read the remotes carefully. Also, it is very durable. It survived 3 years of weekly usage in my class.If you're a teacher looking for better solution, however, there is a newer set, model #8000 for the main unit, 8001 for the extra scoreboards, and 8002 for the extra remotes.

First, they are terribly dated and there are only four episodes on each. I have a lot of DVDs from old TV shows and most are very enjoyable. This series doesn't hold up over time. Beware that if you buy Private Secretary 1 and 2, you already have half of what is on Private Secretary 3 and 4 because four of the episodes are repeated from 1 and 2 to 3 and 4. That should not have happened. If they couldn't come up with four episodes for each one, they should have stopped with Private Secretary 3. I made the mistake of buying all four at the same time. If you think you are interested in seeing this, buy only Private Secretary 1 and see if you want to buy more. It's not a good value to pay for four of these and only get twelve different episodes."},{"rating":"1","title":"same as Red Hot and Live","review":"This appears to be yet another reissue of the same concert recording as Red Hot and Live with a extra song.

Paid more than I wanted to (Just found one for $16 at Menards home supply). Worked fine for 90 days then went dead. When I contacted the Vendor, I was told that I could exchange it for the first 30 days, but if it was defective (It wouldn't work), I had only one week from the purchase to report the defect. The Vendor would not offer any remedy for my useless lamp. (I am used to this kind of lamp operating for several years.)

IMO, not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! Just What I Needed!","review":"After writing a book and then reading all the other books on how to promote it, I was stumped. I had great ideas on which outlets and reviewers to approach, but I had no idea what to send them. Do I send a book to review with a quick note? Do I send a full package of materials that's longer than the book itself? What kind of information did the media and bookstores want to see? These are all the questions I had, and this book answered each and every one. By the time I finished reading Putting It On Paper, I had every element of my press kit created, and the results are outstanding. I've already had numerous media outlets contact me as a result of my press kit, and my book just got picked up by a large distribution house. Plus, I was able to arrange for three book signings with local bookstores. I highly recommend Putting It On Paper to anyone who has published a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for people without investing knowledge!!!","review":"I have to admit that this book is the best one I have read so far that is dummy proof. I did not had any background in investing and I could understand everything. Also, I was very fear to take my money away from a bank. But Samuel Case made an excellent job explaining this fascinating world and how to start from the beginning with only $50.00. Now I can follow the idea of a bull vs a bear market etc. I hope I can meet this author in a future. Excellent book for beginners. Nice ideas and thoughts. I hope more college students read books like this so they can learn the importance of starting to invest early. Recommended A+++++."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for absolute beginners and intermediate level","review":"This is an excellent book if you want to begin to invest your money. It assumes that you know nothing and guides you step by step. Extremely readable (I read it over a weekend), it gives you all the necessary working knowledge to start investing. I also appreciated its careful approach and several warnings against risky techniques and investments. My wife, who has just completed an MBA, thinks that the book is very well organized."},{"rating":"1","title":"Politically packed text book","review":"This book reads like a textbook. While it covers a breath of topics, it does so lacking any of the excitement that is inherent in investing. I found the political comments littered throughout the book (such as the benefits of socially responsible investing and the author's dislike of investing in defense companies) inappropriate and nothing more than soapbox banter. I was able to make it 3/4 through the book before it hit the trash can. If you are more interested in learning about investing than you are being preached at on the wisdom of political correctness, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it!","review":"I admit when I first bought this CD, I thought \\"Grave Dancer's Union\\"was better. However, the more I listened to it, the more I fell in love with it. That's why I was so surprised to find poor reviews. \\"Runaway Train\\" was great, but it's been what, 5, 6 years?

When I first heard it, I was very disappointed. However, I saw them live in Chicago and I realized that the songwriting and musicianship is still there... but Chris Kimsey's production s**ks!! Maybe S/A are to blame, but the recording doesn't come close to capturing the strength of the material... this record could have been as strong as their past records, but instead it sounds like a weak Eric Clapton record.

And thats why it flopped and nothing good came on Radio Stations and TV from Soul Asylum. I am a big fan of Soul Asylum but what is this mellow sh** they came out with. I am not saying they were kick in your face punk rockers, but some songs they have done are like punk or metal. Not even some songs, maybe 1 or 2 were like that. They should change to Hard Rock or punk because the songs that were heavy were cool like 99% and Miracle Mile."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best book i have ever read....","review":"yes, here comes the cliche: this is one of the best books i have ever read....it fundamentally changed my life. it is a well researched philosophical treatment of a fundamental ethical issue. even if you oppose the animal rights movement, i encourage you to read this book because you may realize that you have been deceived...there is so much eye-opening information in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Worthwhile Book","review":"I predict this: one day our species will wonder why it took so long to adopt the view espoused by Singer today. The basis of morality is not rationality, as so many suppose. It is our ability to suffer, to have consciousness, or the loss of it (death). The basis of moral agency is rationality. This confusion has led people (including some of the reviewers here) to believe that only rational people have rights. As articulated so capably by Michael Berumen in Do No Evil: Ethics with Applications to Economic Theory and Business, it is the conjoining of our rational prohibitions (i.e., no one desires pain or death for their own sake...only for a reason) and impartiality (no bias in application) that enables us to extend our own egocentric prohibitions to others...including other animals, who most certainly suffer. I think Michael Berumen's book is even more compelling than Singer's, but the latter acknowledges his debt to Singer in understanding the nature of suffering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marred by Fallacious Reasoning","review":"Singer's position seems to be that since certain animals are mistreated, all legitimate experiments and uses of animals for food should be halted. That seems to me to be a grossly exaggerated position which smacks of fallacious reasoning. To put it another way, it is an example of what cognitive psychologists refer to as \\"All-or-Nothing Thinking\\".I don't doubt that the abuses that Singer describes have occurred in the past, but that is not a sufficient reason to cease all experiments, which have demonstrably improved the lot of mankind. We can work together to improve the conditions of animals used for research. Similarly, we can work to improve the lot of animals raised for food, without losing the benefits which they provide."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of ink","review":"Animal Liberation has some interesting points on the surface, but the more thought you put into the arguments, the less persuasive and more ridiculous Singer's arguments become. I first encountered Singer's writings in college, and was unpersuaded then. His further forays into \\"ethics\\" in regards to euthanasia, infanticide, and--recently--bestiality bear further witness to the intellectual and ethical bankruptcy of Singer's philosophy. His is an exercise in extendio ad absurdam from which few, it seems, have managed to divine the absurdity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Work, Warped Writer","review":"First, let me say that I haven't read this whole book, just a little bit here and a little bit there. The reason being is that I won't spend money that would benefit someone I find disgusting. I have read many of his other writings which either exhibit warped logic (beastiality is OK because the animals are consenting) and warped values (parents of children with any handicap should get 6 months after birth to decide to kill them because they aren't \\"persons\\", and we should allow families to kill relatives with Alzheimer's disease or other disorders if they decide they are a burden- they aren't \\"persons either.\\") Just goes to show, a brilliant mind can find words to justify anything. I find it interesting that animal rights advocates put him on a pedestal while overlooking the less desirable ideas from this Princeton philosophy professor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Equal Consideration--not equal rights or treatment","review":"I have only read \\"All Animals Are Equal\\" from this book, but Singer sums up the main point of his argument in this first essay. He isn't saying animals deserve equal rights, the same as humans. He says animals deserve equal consideration of interests, meaning we should respect their lives as much as we respect our own. He does make the point that equal consideration does not necessarily mean equal treatment or equal rights."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful, informative book","review":"I found \\"Animal Liberation\\" a very informative book for those who wish to expand their philisophical viewpoints beyond the norm. Singer & Reich provide good arguments for the equality issues that animal rights bring up, as well as solutions to problems such as animal testing that plague conserned consumers daily. The reason I only rate this book an eight is that the authors provide a very one-sided argument, and don't go into the opposing viewpoint. I also found it very dense, and hard to stick with all the way through it's 320 information-packed pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"do you really want to know","review":"I read excerpts from this book flipping through it in a bookstore.

His grasp of ethics is frighteningly shaky for a man whose field is ethics. Singer, for example, trumpets the importance of \\"animal liberation\\" at the same time he defends in other works the morality of infanticide and bestiality. Singer's entire philosophical anthropology is flawed, inherently contradictory, and, ultimately, leads to grotesqueries (such as his aforementioned support for infanticide and defense of bestiality). Skip this book and pick up _Dominion_ by Matthew Scully instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"promotes speciesism, has nothing to do with rights","review":"Not to be unkind, but Peter Singer unfortunately has very mistakenly been given the title of \\"Father of the Animal Rights Movement\\". All large animal organisations --that promote \\"humane\\" use-- tend to quote Singer and follow his utilitarian position.\\"Animal Liberation\\" has nothing to do with animal rights. As Prof. Gary L. Francione (Rutgers uni) who has written extensively on animal ethics has stated in an essay titled \\"Peter Singer and the Welfarist Position on the Lesser Value of Nonhuman Life\\": \\"the underlying premise in Singer's position is that the only way to be forward looking, to have hopes and desires, is to have them in the way that humans do. But that is clearly a speciesist position.\\" I would recommend to readers, if they want cutting edge animal ethics literature, I would highly recommend Prof. Francione's work."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the most persuasive case for animal rights.","review":"Peter Singer uses logic and reason, not emotion to persuade us that our circle of ethical consideration should reach far beyond our dogs, cats, and endangered species.

Consider this- viewers could find such greats as Lucille Ball (has there ever been a female comedian to compare to her?), Milton Berle, Jackie Gleason and others. There was also live drama being shown and not just ANY drama but that showcasing such writers as Gore Vidal and Rod Serling, who often had to create strong stories to hold audience attention while conforming to the censors of the time. After reading this book, perhaps you'll decide (as I did) that it is no accident that there have been a wealth of movie remakes of some of these classic shows.

Everyone should read this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away!","review":"Being an ardent RH fan, I was curious how this would be done. The old RH game (on my C-64 years ago) was interesting for it's time. This game has graphics that aren't much better than in that version from 1985. The only real difference is the inserted 3 second video clips, having Richard O'Brien say inane things like 'How did that happen?'. The music (except for the 3 added CD tracks), and characters, are horrendous and very unlike the movie. As a game, definitely worthless, even as a fan. As nostalgia, worth only showing that you own another piece of the RH history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure class","review":"I love this hat.

Two less-than-stellar episodes in a row here. THE PASSENGER suffers for a single reason, and that is that its central premise is buried so deep inside technobabble that I simply couldn't make myself care about it.The storyline revolves around a ship containing a prisoner and a captor. The prisoner has apparently died, while the captor insists that he is alive, based on the fact that he has managed to fake his own death many times before. This leads to an extended \\"he's alive\\", \\"no, he's dead\\", \\"no he's dead\\" argument, where nothing terribly interesting happens.The only way for me to describe this episode is \\"silly\\". The plot is silly. The technobabble is silly. And during the story's climax, even the acting is quite silly (though to be fair to the performer(s), there isn't much to work with here). This isn't an episode that you laugh with; it's one you laugh at."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Decent Thriller/Mystery","review":"Time of Fear is a pretty good thriller about an ex-cop and an FBI agent tracking down a crazy murderer.

In addition, the headset can become unplugged if you don't pick up the phone just right. Once this happens, your call will be disconnected. Very temperamental, but in all fairness, I've had two of the GE 900 Mhz (one with Caller ID and one without) as well as the Vtech cordless headset. All of them have their own problems, but for my money I will stay with the GE.On the plus side, this unit does clip on your belt better than the GE."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Nice Design Roped Me In Twice","review":"It takes a might cruddy product to induce me to write one of these reviews. Plantronics has hit that low mark with this little beauty. I have severe neck and shoulder problems and a phone designed like this one is a necessity. Ones with earplugs make my ears ache.I couldn't have been more pleased with the design! Small, comfortable. Clip-on the belt keypad. I could do anything while talking on the phone: wash dishes, dust the house, bathe the dog, etc. Gone were the neck aches.Well, that convenience doesn't last long! I've purchased TWO of these phones in the past year and a half, and after about 6 to 7 months, things go downhill in a hurry. The connection where the headset meets the keypad starts shifting and making all kinds of horrid noises. \\"Screeching\\" is a description that is too kind. I've had listeners on the other end howl in distress! When it's not screeching, the feedback is horrible, and the echoing is beyond the pale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but you can't see the keypad","review":"I ordered this from Amazon's \\"Beach Audio\\" marketplace on a Friday, it shipped Monday, and I received it Wednesday. I opened the box and at first I thought, \\"Hey, did they send me a USED phone? The numbers have rubbed off the keypad!\\" Looked closer and discovered that some designer numnut decided that grey ink on dark grey keys would be a pleasing feature. Hello?? Fire that guy, Plantronics.Aside from not being able to see the numbers, the phone works quite well. In addition to business calls here at home, I do teleconferencing via a digital internet phone connection, and listeners say my voice is very clear. The coolest thing is the noise cancellation, though. Even though the yard crew was outside my window with the leaf blower, no one could hear it. But I do still need to hit Mute if I'm going to yell at the dog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Such a disappointment","review":"I was so delighted with this when I pulled it out of the box and set it up. However, the beeping while the mute button is depressed means this set will be going back to Plantronics. I have to sit and listen for hours on conference calls. Due to the number of people on these calls, it is necessary for most of us to be on mute for hours at a time. I can not listen to this beeping for hours; it drives me crazy after just a few minutes. Considering, as others have pointed out, that the set already features a mute light, whose bright idea was it to add the beeping? AWFUL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plantronics CT10","review":"Plantronics usually makes quality products. This is not one of them. The case is sturdy and headset is ok. The battery is built into the belt clip which is mounted upside down for some who knows why reason? Then I tried it... audio came howling back into the earpiece like an echo, similar to the original cordless phones 20 years ago. Totally unacceptable!! Back it went and replaced with the new Plantronics CT12 and its GREAT! Totally different, regular type lithium battery and sounds and talks great! Well worth the little $ difference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Built.","review":"Worked for about a year. Was a nice headset phone, small & easy to use. But then the dial pad hinge broke rendering it useless because you could no longer charge it. Very poor construction. Buying this phone turned out to be a very expensive mistake on our part. Look elsewhere, at anything but this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super phone for home use","review":"Because my mother has lymphedema in her \\"phone arm,\\" I bought her the CT 10 to provide comfort in long phone conversations. Neither she nor I could be more pleased! The phone set up is super easy, and the initial charging only takes a few hours--and you can use the phone while it's charging on the base. The sound quality, both receiving and sending, is magnificent, and the headset and phonepad are so lightweight Mom can easily forget that she's \\"wearing\\" them! Also, this phone has marvelous range. Mom's phone's base unit is on the main floor of her house, but she can even use the phone when she's on the treadmill in the cellar.Though the price may seem a bit steep, the CT 10 is worth every penny. It's much better to spend for quality than to spend for junk. The CT 10 is nothing but quality. We love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"25% of the time, I cannot hear.","review":"When I first opened this I praised it with a 4 star rating. Well, after 30+ days I cannot take it any more. The volume in the earpiece is not loud enough for comfort. I am always pressing it against my ear, asking the other person to speak up or just requesting that I call them back on a corded phone. The only time I can hear is the volume fully cranked up and complete silence in my office. Man I love the design and concept, but back to Office Depot I go. I think I will try a Siemens cordless w/headphone attached. I am not hard of hearing.......am I the only finding the hearing not perfect and acceptable?"},{"rating":"1","title":"it broke in less then a week","review":"This got really good reviews so I decided to pick one up...

The headset works good too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad product from a good company","review":"As others have observed, this is a really sub-par product from a company with a good reputation.I've had this phone about a year. One battery failed within months. The phone itself failed after about 10 months. Plantronics replaced both without hassle, though I paid to send the defective phone back.Others have mentioned the beeping-on-mute issue (what WERE they thinking?) and poor battery life -- both true and very annoying. There are other design issues that make this an unacceptable product, in my view, e.g., it's easy to hurt your fingers removing and installing batteries.If you are looking for a 900 Mhz phone, my recommendation is to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost great","review":"I've used the phone actively for abou 6 months now and overall it has been great. Overall, I highly recommend the phone. However, there are three things that could stand some improvement. 1) its battery life could be longer for those of us who use the phone a lot. I find that I sometimes have to use the phone in the cradle while it recharges because an active day of calling will drain the battery. 2) It does have some issues with volume. At its highest volume setting, it is noticeably not as loud as my other cordless phones. It is probably okay but if you have any sort of hearing problems, it will be too quite for you. 3) The headset can get uncomfortable after a long time on the phone -- but that is why you need speakerphone."},{"rating":"1","title":"For a C-note, this thing's not worth it...","review":"SO far, this thing is hit or miss. There are many times when I turn it on to make a call, and I can't hear a dial tone. It seems like I need to push the button a certain way. Other times I'll answer a call, and people on the other hand can me, but I can't hear them. For the dough, it's of fairly cheap material. When it works, it's great...I just hope I can learn the ideosynchrocies of this unit soon...Good luck!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Plantronics CT10 900 MHz Cordless Headset Telephone","review":"I bought this to replace my $50 GE hands free phone that I bought at Best Buy. I admit I wore it out! I thought I was getting more for more. Not true, I think the GE product was far superior to the Planitronics. I was quite surprised I expected this to be a better product.! Before I bought this phone I searched for another GE hands free and couldn't find one. My complaints with the Planitronics are mostly to do with lousy reception, it often beeps when I have it on a table next to me, never mind putting it into my pocket and walking around with it.... I'm looking to replace this product with something superior."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality for a high price","review":"Like many of the other reviewers, I found many problems with this phone. There was an audible hiss as I used the phone, even after I plugged it into different phone jacks. The headset cord needed to be jiggled to keep it from getting static crackles if I moved. The belt clip kept popping off whenever I wore it. And you certainly wouldn't want to use this phone for incoming calls since you have to fumble around with the headset and touchy cord connection. I prefer using my cordless phone with the headset I bought ...--the reception is clearer, the volume is easier to control, the phone stays clipped to my belt, and it cost less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I am so disappointed with this phone for two reasons: the phone volume is very low and can not be adjusted and the mic often makes a high-pitched noise."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor quality phone","review":"I have had mine a little less than a year and in that time, at different locations. The hiss is constant, the volume is too low and not adjustable, the battery life is useless if you are on the phone all day as I am. Many times it just will not work unless it's sitting in the cradle, even at full charge. The beep while muted makes conference calling useless. Bump the plug for the headset and you receive a nice blast of static in your ear as well as the person on the other end. Unlike many other cordless models that tell you when the battery is low and lets you complete the call, this unit just shuts down, no warning, no chance to end the call.For the price, there are many other brands out there that are by far a much better investment. I would recommend staying away from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Solidly Built Phone with Poor Quality and Functions","review":"Regardless of where the base is located there is a general noise or hiss in sound quality. While I believed this was a flaw with my location or version of the phone I have altered both and it is inherent in the phone.By far the most annoying 'feature' of this phone is the mute. There is an auditable beeping while on mute that you cannot shut off. While on a conference call this is obnoxious and poorly thought out functionality.To say something nice this is a solidly built little phone with an easily replaceable headset. Not that I am going to keep it long enough to replace anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"unacceptable quality","review":"Mobiity is nice, but after using mine for 6 months I've had too many people say they can't hear me speak with this product.

I did a lot of research before buying this phone and am satisfied with my decision to purchase it. The phone portion is very small, a bit larger than a pager, and easily clips on a beltloop. The headset is sturdy, well built and sounds really clear to callers.There are a couple of problems with this phone though... *Headset volume does not go loud enough *When the headset jack into the phone moves it sometimes produces feedback *No caller-ID on unit*Reception is averageOverall I would recommend this phone so long as you are not using it in a noisy environment. I've had mine for over six months now without problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drops calls","review":"I bought this to replace a wonderful GE 900 MHz cordless.phone that quit working but is no longer made.The Plantronics works great -- as long as you're in the same room.

If I wanted to stay in the room, I wouldn't have bought a cordless phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best from Plantronics","review":"I'm a huge Plantronics fan. Their products and customer service are first-rate. This phone, though, is sub-par. Mine, at least, discharges too quickly; loses its speed dial settings when it discharges; has poor, staticky sound; and doesn't charge reliably on its stand. I recommend paying a little more for the CT-12, which is very good."},{"rating":"1","title":"can't hear","review":"This phone was very small. You could hardly dial the numbers. Also, you could not hear through the earpiece very good. The last phone I had a GE you could adjust the volume so you could hear better.

If you want a phone that you can hear on buy the GE that's what I did to replace this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as \\"Extra\\"ordinary as Season 1","review":"In Season 2 of Extras, Ricky Gervais's character now has secured his own sit-com, but nothing has gone quite the way he envisioned it. While I enjoyed thoroughly eveery episode, Season 2 lacks the freshness of Season 1, and I much more enjoyed the characters actually being \\"extras\\", but of course, how long could that really go on? I guess the show had to reinvent itself a bit. A moment of absolute brilliance is the episode with David Bowie, when he serenades Ricky about his sad existence.I was pleased to see that Ashley Jensen was still with the show. I am hoping with the success of \\"Ugly Betty\\" that she doesn't have to bail on this hilarious show. While I didn't enjoy the episodes as much as Season One, I still love this show, and am eager to see more of Gervais and Jensen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid comedy","review":"Although not as good as Season 1, this program is still head and shoulders above any current comedy program on television today. Gervais continues to poke at the silliness of much of our popular culture, and the episode with David Bowie includes one of the funniest scenes I have witnessed on television. The intelligence and willingness of Mr. Gervais to take on the shallowness of much of modern entertainment stands in stark contrast to television's current offerings, where utterly banal shows like \\"Modern Family\\" are considered worthy of acclaim."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT YET RECEIVED","review":"4 weeks and have not received anything, the other item i ordered a book came very promptly, but am still waiting for my Extras DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Second time I received the same titled dvd defective","review":"About 6 months ago I ordered the Extras complete series dvd package & season 2, disc 1 would not play.

I have oily skin and this wash gets my skin clean without drying it out. My dermatologist told me to use Cetaphil and I used that for a year. That didn't dry my face out but problem was that it didn't really control my acne. I've also tried some of the acne washes available at the drug store (like the Neutrogena ones with salicylic acid) but those irritate my skin too much.

I know--I'm just a grumpy old coot but still an avid movie fan who likes an entertaining family film. After all, we're the ones who buy them!I generally enjoy Richard Riehle and Edward Hermann, but their characters and dialogue are just poorly written. The dog voice characterizations are generic and uninspired and interchangeable. Adding CGI effects to the black demon cats is embarrassingly bad.

I personally suggest Interacts better one because it offers better quality at a lower cost than Monsters. The cables themselves are thin and badly shielded, thus the audio performance is also sub par.

You may think I'm overreacting, but J. Buckley said himself that he didn't make his music for the magazines or the radios, he made it for the people who screamed his songs walking down the streets, people with wild souls. I heard Sketches before being introduced to Grace, and that blew my mind too. With Sketches I got a look at Buckley, rough and uncut. Then I got the finished look with Grace.

Not a fake track in sight... Like its predecessor Grace, it takes the listener through a spectrum of singing styles from the powerful ballard \\"morning theft\\" (a truely beautiful song) to a hard and definant \\"the sky is a land fill\\". From rock to soul to folk to even a slight R&B tinge in the lush \\"every body here wants you\\" (does anyone pick up a Pink Floyd vibe listeneing to this tune).

This shows Buckley's willingness to evolve into a true artist. He finished 'Grace' with class, it was time to move on. Some of the songs on this album would fit perfectly on Radiohead's recent releases, while others could be attached to an almost endless list of random artists. The first disc is a group of studio cuts destined, most likely to never see the light of day(not these versions at least).The second disc is comprised, mostly of home recordings(after Buckley was dissatisfied with direction).This record may just be \\"sketches\\", but one day it will get the attention it deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tasteful, challenging, last goodbye","review":"A very good album, that could be rated anything from 3-5 stars. It is impossible to separate the man from his music, and as a collectable this is an essential item. The booklet that accompanies this CD is revealing, and the second CD rough but musically stimulating. Listening to Buckley is akin to listening to Nick Drake (another talented musician who died too soon). Unlike Drake who suffered from severe depression, Buckley's joy for life shines through.This is not as polished as \\"Grace\\", but more rewarding to repeated listens. Rewards open mindedness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leaving Us With A Satisfied Heart","review":"Some of the gig reviews following the release of Jeff Buckley's second CD, GRACE, were to the effect that Buckley was losing his glorious voice, that he was squandering his talent. What a delightful surprise, then, to find in SKETCHES, his posthumous double CD, a voice that is stronger than ever, and some of the sense of humour for which Buckley was known privately (see \\"Yard of Blonde Girls\\" and \\"Your Flesh is So Nice\\"). Tracks such as \\"Nightmares by the Sea\\" and \\"New Year's Prayer\\" approach musical genius and need to be played often, and as loud as possible to appreciate their full, mesmerizing flavour. Buckley's music often reaches behind us, draws us near, and knocks loudly on our hearts, leaving us no choice but to open the door. Buckley may have known the benefit of a \\"Satisfied Mind\\" when he left us, but one thing's for sure: he also left us with musically satisfied hearts."},{"rating":"1","title":"probably would pass on this one","review":"not a very entertaining book, just some words for a few toys, lots of better books outthere for toddler/babies"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Customer Service","review":"I will never purchase another product from either Amazon or AUTOWAY Parts.

Anggun has a really great alto voice, very powerful, but it lacked some expression. My guess is that she isn't fluent in English, so she may not be able to emphasize particular words. I say this because the foreign language lyrics (which I believe are in her native language) are much more impressive, The CD is filled with lots of variety, but I especially like the Asian ethnic instruments. My favorite track is \\"Rose in the Wind,\\" which I feel shows off her voice best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Inspirational","review":"Anggun came to Malaysia on 28 January 1999. It was a showcase hence, it wasn't easy to get the entrance ticket which was not for sale. I took all the trouble to get the ticket and I was so excited that I showed up at Sony's office at 9:00am sharp. I was at the front row and I was truly captivated, mesmerized and possessed when I see my idol singing right before my eyes. I've always dream to watch her singing live, this is a real dream come true. She makes the entire Asians proud. Anggun, you gave me the inspiration and motivation. You're the best!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Anggun songs are poetry in motion especially the Snow song","review":"I had the opportunity to hear Anggun sing live in Addison, TX, on July 3, 1998. Wow...It was a great treat. The CD has many good songs but I don't think that it's a cross-cultural success. The main stream American audience is not touched even though it is a great CD in my opinion. Snow on the Sahara is not only a beautiful song, it is also very poetic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great singer ever ...","review":"I bought this CD about a year ago and never got tired of it.

Sasmi offers a haunting collection of gems filling in the role of the female counterpart to Seal. This worldly collection honors its ethnic roots, but gives into the French flair for romanticism and melody. As can be surmised by the titles, Anggun takes a poetic and visual approach to her musings. Standout tracks include the title song, \\"A Rose in the Wind,\\" \\"Secret of the Sea,\\" and the album closer, \\"Life On Mars,\\" an homage to David Bowie with an extraterrestial finale that does not betray the overall mood of the album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Indonesia's Best Kept Secret","review":"Anggun has an amazing voice. I'm surprised that radio here in America hasn't caught on to Anggun's brand of infectious pop/r&b. Who wouldn't love the title track \\"Snow on the Sahara\\" or the dreamy ballad of \\"Dream of Me\\"? I am normally not a huge fan of pop and r&b music but I can definitely make an exception with Anggun's beautifully orchestrated music. I hope someday Anggun will break into the US market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never tiring","review":"Anggun has one of the most mesmerizing voices I have ever heard. I first heard \\"Snow on the Sahara\\" and HAD to find the CD. Since finding it, I have purchased many additional copies to share with friends.

I'll be looking forward to hearing more from this very talented singer."},{"rating":"2","title":"soul-searching music!","review":"Anggun'a music and voice leave me speechless, the whole CD fills my soul.

I immediately bought the original French version. A month later I bought the English version for a friend. Musically no two songs are alike, and all have a fresh energy to them that's really nice to listen to. The French lyrics are poetry in and of themselves, and the English translation is very good. Add to these that powerful and sincere Annie Lennox style voice and you've got the perfect album. Where do I go to get more Anggun?!?!?!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Anggun has a wonderful, mystical quality to her voice.","review":"This album incorporates the best elements of pop and jazz - and sweeps you away with its international flavor.

It comes with the adapter so that you can use it in digital cameras. I tested it on the camera and it worked great. The real test was the compatibility with the SONY PSP. No issues there. The card worked flawlessly. I've already used up 600 MB.....its a must buy!Plus, at $99.99, its much less than other retailers. btw, i ordered it at $104.99, then contacted amazon about the price drop.

Well now its been done, and I found it to be a very enjoyable read.Kel Richards has done a great job putting the gospel into an Australian setting, using typical Aussie phrases. Every time I pick it up it brings a smile to my face. True, it can never be a study Bible, although the wording of some of the verses did on occasion enlighten me.Some have expressed concern that the book is blasphemous. In my opinion, it isn't. It is a fairly accurate expression of how Jesus would speak, had he been a true-blue Aussie. Not on one occasion did it ever question His divinity or integrity. Perhaps there are hints of disrespect to certain figures, like when the prophetess Anna is called an old duck, but God or Jesus were never slighted.If you're not an Australian, in the back of the book is a reference for particular words/phrases that will help you to understand what has been said. A very funny book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautifil graphics, horrible gameplay","review":"Age of Sail 2 has some of the best graphics I've seen in any genre of computer games. It's too bad that the graphics are the only good thing.The gameplay is horrible. All you do is keep clicking on a ship to shoot at it until it sinks.

However, if you like a game with pacing, then skip this turkey by. Yes, it does have lovely graphics and the attention to detail is admirable. But it all boils down to maneuvering your ship(s), firing your cannons, then waaaaaaaiting for the reload so you can fire another volley. That's the whole game. One-on-one battles are decent to kill 15-25 minutes, but multi-ship battles are nearly impossible to manage.Summary: buy this game if you LOVE naval warfare from 1775-1815, otherwise, skip this."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy","review":"Great concept!

Don't buy it, go to Arcade games... But if you know the esence of the games and strategy... welcome to this one.

Welcome aboard captain!...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game!","review":"This game has many scenarios with multiple battles and historic battles that cover the whole range of difficulty. Some are simple and some impossible, and you can change sides once you have beaten it on one side. The graphics are fantastic, although the land could have been much more detailed, but this is a sea game not a land game. The other fault is I thought that the game should have had more campaings where you could buy and service your fleet. This is the best sailing game I have played. I recomend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustratingly buggy","review":"As several reviewers have noted, this game has a lot of potential. It's visually nice, has tons of scenarios and flexibility, and is probably about as authentic as such a game can be. But it doesn't work. It often fails to load games properly, the game often freezes the computer (a P4, so it's not an old computer), and various key options--like manual firing--don't always work. Further, Talon Soft tech support was useless--they merely said to get new drivers for the graphics card, which was clearly not the problem. The game says it is Win Me ready, but it's not. I keep checking for new updates to see if they fix any of this, but the .1 update out so far doesn't do a bit of good. Until it's fixed, I find the game unplayable and I feel ..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some day it will be good","review":"It's too bad that this was released well before it was ready, because it is plagued with bugs. Due to the lack of any real documentation I struggled with the interface. After finally resorting to searching the internet I found that I was not alone. Many of the features just don't work, while others cause the game to crash. After downloading the first (and only) patch for the game a few bugs were fixed, but there are still many more.On the upside, the game is beautiful to look at, and if you can work around the bugs (emphasis on work) it is pretty cool. I'm hoping that it'll actually be playable by summer, so I'm packing it away for now in hopes of a better future."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game is a demo","review":"I say that this game is a demo because it is clearly was released six months before completion. The bugs and glitches are multitude. We have become used to seeing games released before they are totaly de-bugged but this (believe me) is the record. Buggs aside, the main problem is that the game has not even been completed--it is a rough sketch of a possibly great art work. Perhaps 50% of the scenarios fuction reasonably correctly (excluding the bugs). If you have Voodoo 3 don't buy this untill its Voodoo problems are sorted out (check the message boards at the Talonsoft website). In fact, if you have been eagerly awaiting this game , check out the message boards over the next few weeks (or possibly months) and wait untill a completed, functional version of this product is available. I suspect the problems may be too large to fix with four or five downloads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bugs, Bugs, Bugs!!!","review":"I was so looking forward to this game. However, when I got it there were more bugs in it than under my refrigerator. First i couldnt play a battle without the game locking up. Second, you seemed to be unable to load saved games (which are a must in the campaigns)just getting a saved file processing error message over and over again. There is nothing more frustrating than to go two or three battles into a campaign and then having to start all over again! Another thing is the commercials for other talonsoft games (that look pretty crappy) every time you boot up or shut down the game- very tacky. Otherwise, the graphics and battle interface were fantastic and the ship modeling top rate. Too bad it didnt come together in the game"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted to like it","review":"After reading some of the Hornblower, Lewrie, and Blothio books, I was really craving something like this. Unfortunatly the game has so many bugs and the documentation on how to play is so bad, I ended up wasting what free time I had frustrated over the whole thing.Since the documentation was so bad, once I got the game somewhat stable, I thought purchasing the strategy guide for the game would help. It didn't. The guide was so full of pictures of ships and useless data that for my $20 I only received about 6 pages of actual strategy buried in all the \\"life of a sailor\\" garbage. In a strategy guide I would expect a lot more strategy hints and tips. Perhaps I'll find a book on ship tactics that I can apply."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic, Funny Movie","review":"As a German Studies student, I am constantly looking for new films to watch to practice language. It is particularly nice when the film is a good one. This film does not take itself too seriously, but it does have a heart, and parts are laugh-out-loud funny. The female lead in this movie is a cutie-pie, and the supporting cast is fantastic. You will appreciate this movie more if you understand German, but even if you don't, there are plenty of good sight gags. I am glad some recent German filmmakers have learned that movies don't all have to be grim and existential. Film can entertain as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally delightful movie (and soundtrack info...)","review":"This is a delectable movie. The Viktor Vogel character is hilarious, yet believable. I couldn't help laughing out loud at the way he lived into the lies (the resume embelishments, etc), which eventually caught up with him.

Although there is no sex in this movie, there is drinking and some obscenities, so I can't show this in class. What a shame, as I liken this movie to a toned-down Jim Carrey movie. It's clever, quirky and hip and actually conveys a message about current social issues without in any way being grim or preachy. Age discrimination from both the young and the old play a dominant theme in this offbeat comedy.Victor Vogel is the protagonist who somehow gets mistaken for a high-level ad writer. He quickly catches on and goes with the flow. The outcome is hilarious and sweet. \\"Vogel\\" ironically is also the animal the Germans use to describe someone who is a big crazy. \\"Er hat einen Vogel\\" means \\"he's crazy!\\" and this Vogel is no exception.The acting is well done, the script well-written.

The result is music that drew me deeply inward - perfect for the focused practice of yoga asanas, or for meditation.I found that the CD enhanced my experience of hatha yoga, and allowed me to go more fully into a practice of meditation-in-motion. The music became part of my practice, and seemed to resonate from the inside out. Because there are no abrupt changes of pace or key, the 70 minutes of music presented in this CD can accompany and support any contemplative practice.As a poet, yoga teacher and practitioner, I highly recommend this, and all Todd Norian's musical CDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent yoga CD!","review":"I own a yoga studio that offers a variety of classes - some with students who prefer more mainstream, relaxing music, and other classes with students who prefer music with a more Eastern sound.

But anyway...I myself have found that, though it has been technically \\"compatible\\" with my GT3, it's not a realistic wheel. The steering is looser than a giant old U-Haul I rented! If you're looking for that nice, tight steering of a German-engineered automobile, this isn't it. I also agree with a previous reviewer about the pedals--they're an all or nothing thing, absolutely no pressure sensitivity. All in all, a very poor product."},{"rating":"2","title":"exellent","review":"Racing wheels have been around for about as long as racing games, and while great improvements have been made, they're mostly the same. The V3FX is the best. It comes with a good-sized wheel and plenty of customizable features. Comprised of the wheel and a separate, two-pedaled foot piece, the V3FX has a built-in Dual Vibration.

Blackburn's experience both as a researcher and as one charged with the responsibility of reviewing grant applications shows through. His book provides a step-by-step approach that, if followed, should lead to a higher probability of success and avoid wasted time and frustration occasioned by poorly prepared and submitted applications. Those just entering the sometimes perilous fight for funding will find this book indispensable, and even old hands will find it provides handy reminders of all of the points we think we know by heart, but sometimes forget to apply. This little book is a \\"must read\\" for anyone whose professional life depends on getting funding for his or her research. You simply can't afford to ignore it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must purchase for every researcher!","review":"Getting Science Grants provides readers with a complete introduction to the grant writing/submitting process.It is important to move beyond the perspective of being the salesperson of your research. You need to know the perspective from the other side of the granting process and what will impress your program manager in your proposal.Thomas Blackburn is an experienced grant writer and as well as having significant experience on the other side as an assitant program administrator. Here he provides researchers with the skinny on finding funding agencies, writing excellent abstracts and proposals, preparing budgets and moving beyond very good to excellent and super proposals.Buy it, read it and share it with your colleagues!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must see for everyone!","review":"I've been interested in the peak oil energy depletion problem since I read the Long Emergency in 2006.

I'm sure he meant well but its seemingly written as a tribute more so than an objective biography. It goes up until the time preceding his first fight with Tyson so its also outdated. Holyfield really shouldn't be fighting anymore but even though he's pushing 50 and has been through many out and out wars in the ring he continues on. I saw him being interviewed on CNN recently about how he's converting his ridiculous 54,000 square foot, 109 room, 17 bathroom mansion/estate into being as \\"green\\" as possible and he didn't sound very good.

However, there is little to quibble about in the very moving version of Jerry Jeff's, Mr Bojangles,(the definitive recorded take), Dehlia, or the unforgettable, Sammy's Song.

Alot like Slick Shoes' \\"Burn Out\\" but much more infectious and catchy. Rufio put alot of time into writing these songs and they deserve some applause for it, a very worthy effort.

The material, linen like, is slippery and comes undone easily. That said, last night my baby was crying a different than usual cry (10 weeks). I went in and the entire blanket was off of his body but the fabric around the neck was still on him and was covering his mouth and was snug on his neck-needless to say I was mortified. I can't ever use this blanket for swaddling again. It was an awful experience. We have the kiddopottumus swaddler, really like it, it's a bit warm for the summer. I just ordered the woombie-the USA one has a lighter summer fabric and it's made in the US."},{"rating":"1","title":"An expensive piece of cloth","review":"Maybe others have had a better experience with this blanket, but I was disappointed.

She sleeps with it, she puts it in her cubby at preschool and now that it finally looks like a life time has passed with small tears.

It can cover your infant carrier seat when u are in the store when they are sleeping too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best swaddle blanket ever!","review":"This is our 6th Swaddle Designs blanket, two for each of our three kids. We have also given away several as presents. They are, by far, the best swaddle blankets we have seen or tried, and the feedback from our gift recipients has been similar. They are generous in size, making the swaddling process easier and the swaddle itself tighter without the need for any additional velcro, etc. The blankets are amazingly soft and comfy, and just get more so with washing and love. The blankets are still in active use as favored blankies/lovies for our 5 year old and 2 year old, and we are sure the new baby will love his just as much. The recent addition of a large tag with simple, clear and pictured directions for swaddling is a genius move for sleep deprived new parents."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great baby blanket","review":"I love this blanket!

The king has an acute philosophical mind, and asks the monk challenging questions about the Buddhist teachings, and in particular about the puzzling doctrine of anatman (\\"no self\\"). Why do Buddhists believe that there is no self? If there are no selves, why do we (including Buddhists) talk as if there are? How is ethics possible without the notion of a self? How can Buddhists believe in reincarnation without there being a self that is reincarnated?The reader should be ready to do some serious philosophical thinking, but Nagasena helps us by using charming and vivid examples to illustrate his points. For example, he says that what the Buddhists mean by reincarnation is like a flame being passed from candle to candle: no \\"substance\\" (or self) is transmitted, but there is an important causal connection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reservation's Blues","review":"Alexie's ability to paint the characters in his work is only surpassed by the caliber of their authenticity. Sherman is not a Native American William Faulkner as other authors of the genre (like N. Scott Momaday) and in Reservation Blues, that serves him well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reservation Blues Review For Class Reading","review":"Reservation Blues was a moving and historical book that used humor along with great stories and tales told by the characters. In this story it tells about the life of Native American's life on the reservation and the frustrations and complications they went through in everyday life. Although the book start out slow with the visuals and setting up the story line it starts to unfold into a more moving and interesting story. It tells about family, struggles, alcoholism, and other things that conflict with leading happy and fulfilling lives on the reservations. These were interesting facts to learn about but after a while the story became predictable and didn't leave much to the imagination.By Sarah and Anna"},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly plot, flat characters, disappointing","review":"I bought this book after hearing Alexie's \\"Phoenix Arizona\\" story read on the radio. That story was simply great and moving, but this novel was a big disappointment. The women characters were so flat, he couldn't even bother to give them real names (Chechers and Chess, Betty and Veronica!); the white characters were all pure evil; the plot, involving an all-Indian rock band inspired by Robert Johnson's guitar is very thin. (Johnson wanders in at the beginning and is forgotten nearly until the very end.) It was a quick read, at times Alexie is a very good writer (though I thought most of the dialogue was terrible), I liked learning about a different culture, and I like the two main characters, but overall I wouldn't recommend the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alexie does it again!","review":"Just as he had in THE LONE RANGER, Sherman Alexie, in RESERVATION BLUES, almost literally puts the reader in the world of the Native American Indian . . .the world of Victor, Junior, Thomas, and all others. You can almost feel the burden of poverty; the joy and pain in the rise and fall of Coyote Springs; and the blues of everyday struggle in life on a reservation and in America itself.I am again moved by the emotions and tickled by the \\"black humor\\" that have comprised this book. Alexie is well-deserving of the acclaim he has received."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought Provoking","review":"Reservation Blues is excellent and should provide interesting conversation at a book club meeting, or between friends. American Indians are a forgotten group of people trying hard to maintain their culture or just survive. I believe this is a must read. It is so well written and will make you think long and hard about what has happened to the first Americans."},{"rating":"1","title":"a fairy tale","review":"I didn't enjoy this book at all. It began to go downhill -- steeply -- when the broken guitar repaired itself and then began to play itself.If you like reading fairy tales, then it may appeal.For me, it reads like the kind of experimental writing college kids are asked to write, or the kind of writing their profs write to show that they are different.Another example: A Fedex delivery person lands and leaves via the addressee's roof.Too much suspension of disbelief required, at least for me.For the record, the movie \\"Pow-Wow highway is one of my favorites. Mysticism appears there, as well, but artfully handled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget this book--read THE LONE RANGER & TONTO","review":"Maybe I would have liked this book had I not read Alexie's incredibly moving \\"Lone Ranger and Tonto Fist Fight in Heaven\\" first. While \\"Lone Ranger\\" is original and real, \\"Reservation Blues,\\" by comparison, is full of platitudes and stereotypes. It drives its transparent and hackneyed message home hard again and again on almost every page of the book. It belittles the characters' experiences because they are so predictable--any stereotype you've ever heard or conceived of about life on an Indian reservation can be found here. I'm sorry I wasted my time with this book; on the other hand, I will not let this experience besmirch my attitude about \\"Lone Ranger,\\" which I consider a must-read for all literature fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"trite storyline","review":"This is Alexie's worst text. His storyline is an adaptation of Damn Yankees. The character names are pop culture at best, i.e. Chess and Checkers, Betty and Veronica and Wally and the Beav. I was waiting for Rocky and Bullwinkle and Alvin, Simon and Theodore to show up. The story takes forever to develope and is miles behind his masterpiece \\"Indian Killer\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reservation Grey","review":"This book gives a creative insight into life on a reservation. But the plot wasn't very interesting. It was true to life in some places but not in others. The strory was boring. Hence the title."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written and intelligent","review":"Having seen the movie Smoke Signals before reading this book, I was somewhat familiar with some of the characters and the situations. That didn't detract from the enjoyment of this fine piece of fiction. The mythical references flowed well with the reality (as I believe it) of life on reservations. The characters were unique but totally believeable, and Alexie did a seamless job of melding even the most over-the-top symbolism into the narrative. I would highly recommend this book to fans of Native American and music history as well as anyone who has a taste for engaging, intelligent fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining!","review":"This is my favorite Sherman Alexie book. There are times when I laughed out loud and other times when I had to wipe away a tear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reservation Blues","review":"Sherman Alexie writes another poignant novel about tragedy and triumph on the reservation. This book is thought provoking and heartbreaking. Irony and sarcasm gets the point across loud and clear, as only a Native American can express. You can't help but root for the underdogs (Thomas and Victor) as they try to make the American Dream come true for them."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Native Struggle","review":"This is a brilliant example of Native American literature. It has a magical sense of the Indian experience. This book keeps you on the edge of your seat from start to finish. I had mixed emotions towards the characters and the effects. Sometimes it would make you want to laugh and other times it would make you feel saddened. It gives you the reality of the Native American people which is usually blown way out of proportion by movies and t.v. shows. After reading this novel it gave me an interest in Native American literature and other Sherman Alexie books. I would reccomend this novel to anyone looking for an adventure through an exciting cultural experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Overall pleased with service and product","review":"Product came quickly and was for the most part what I expected it to be.

I like the design of the phone, because I do not have the space on my desk for separate phone and amplifier units. The headset is very comfortable; I use the over-the-head set up but there is also the ear-piece which provides flexibility for those who would prefer.The reason I gave this product two stars is the amount of hum on the line. It can be very annoying at times, especially when on a call with someone who speaks very quietly. I use my phone for telephone work between two and four hours per day. I would say that on at least 75% of the calls the hum is very loud in the background, but in fairness, there are some calls where I hardly notice it. Unfortunately, these are in the minority."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hands-free phoning at the keyboard","review":"This headset and keypad are perfect for working at the computer and conducting business on the phone.

Found many folks that bought and unit had a loud buzz. I ignored these and bought anyway. Guess what?? My unit had the buzz and believe me the buzz is loud and is more like a screech. It's so loud you have to hold the headset away from your ear. Nothing corrects it. I called Plantronics and they said it was a bad unit. I will not purchase another because I think the odds are I'll get the same thing.Good Luck.Hooray to Amazon.

For several months I assumed it was my land line, however even after moving out of state and using a completely different phone company, I had the same awful, loud humming. Too late, I realized it was the phone. The volume issue is also true and customers will complain about both.Save your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"it is GREAT","review":"Recieved on time , Great equpment.I can talk as much as i want without any pain in nick.go for it .Thank you AMAZON"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Quality","review":"Do not waste your money on this product!! Whilst Amazon has a very good price for it, the headset is junk! I tried two different sets and both had a terrible hum. The hum was audible at all jacks in the house and on two different phone lines. It could be heard by the other party and made my hearing the other party nearly impossible.

But low and behold to my surprise when I received a T20 instead of the T10 I had ordered. I had to work with the darn thing and could not get to return it. So now I'm stuck with a product I simply didn't order. The product itself is a fine product if you want something that requires the use of electricity, but I didn't. The fact that I ordered a T10 was for the sole purpose of not having to plug yet another device into a wall jack.

There is such a bad buzzing in this phone, you cannot hear anyone. Then I asked one of my coworkers and he had to send his back it buzzed so badly, said he tried the plantronics 12 also and it did the same thing. He sent it back too. I tried this phone because it was one of the approved phones on the company's list we're working for as did he.

Terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Product","review":"The reports of a humming or buzzing noise are true. The noise can be heard in the earpiece and is also transmitted when speaking. When not speaking, mic mutes and the buzzing is not transmitted but is still heard by the user of the headset. If the mute button is depressed, the buzzing stops. However, the noise is not the type of noise generated by a faulty mic, it is simply different. You would need to hear it to understand, but hopefully you won't since you would be a fool to buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can hear talk radio","review":"Like most people I purchased this for my home office.

Not acceptable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Picks Up Radio Signals","review":"I purchased this phone for use in a home office and discovered immediately that it picked up a local radio station at a very audible level. I visited the Plantronics website and discovered that were well aware of this problem because it was listed in the FAQ on how to address the situation which they claimed was cause by living too close to radio station towers (we don't live near any radio towers). It went on to suggest ordering a filter to be installed between the phone and the headset control unit, but since this model has the head set control and phone fully integrated, I was doubtful of the solution. The alternative was to try several different locations and I finally discovered that if the phone was placed in my closet, the intereference dissappeared. I finally threw it away because of this ridiculous issue. Apart from this, it's a great phone, but this fatal flaw made it useless to me though I'm sure some users may never encounter this problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 Trys w/this product & both buzzed horribly","review":"I tried two different units & the line buzzes no matter how much you adjust the tuner & volumn.I saw the reviews that said this and thought - what the heck I'll try it - well I tried twice & both were the same - really sad.If you're on mute the buzz is gone - but truthfully - how many one sided conversations do you have on the phone?Married individuals & kids need not answer that question! te he"},{"rating":"2","title":"Corded Headset","review":"We are very pleased with this product.

This was tried calling several people, with different users on the headset. All produced poor call quality.The volume is a minimal adjustment. It is definately not amplified.Tone was a nice feature, but again, minor adjustment. Not like the tone settings on a radio for instance, from 1-10. But more like from 5-6Poor product, plan on returning it.The earpiece is also silly, hard plastic, so if you plan to wear on the ear, it will be unconfortable for extended wear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great concept, terrible quality","review":"After reading the reviews on Amazon, I decided to still go ahead and pick this headset up. The concept of the phone is fantastic, a small footprint and very intuitive controls. The large buttons and lights make it easy to tell when the line is active and mute is on.The big problem with this phone is line noise. After using it for a day, I have to retire this phone as it is completely unusable. The noise can be heard on both sides of the call. Also, I tried two different phone lines at two different houses, same result.

Cordless phones and headsets always have too much static in my house.I noticed right away that the sound quality was too amplified with too much bass, creating a muffled sound with the caller's words often running together in an unintelligible mush. I tried adjusting the earpiece and volume to no avail. It has become so frustrating and embarrassing to be constantly saying \\"Would you please repeat that?\\", \\"What? I didn't catch that.\\" Finally ditching this thing!My cheap RadioShack corded phone has much clearer sound quality - next will try a separate corded headset to plug into a corded phone, but am wary about using Plantronics brand again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for the work-at-home professional","review":"I have pretty severe hearing loss in my right ear but I was able to adjust the tone of the phone and I could hear everything being said just fine. I highly recommend this phone. It's an inexpensive solution for an at-home professional or any office professional needing a hands free telephone.

Its very convenient and I would definitely recommend this product to anyone in the W@H Customer Service industry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This product works but is disappointing. I've been using it everyday for three months now and have decided to get rid of it. Although it's adjustable, even at the lowest setting the volume really is too loud. I have to remove it when I dial or the tones actually start hurting. Also, if the other person happens to speak loudly it gets painful fast. I solved this by taping in some cotton - but, really, that's not what I paid for! It's nice to have a mute button, but, as another reviewer points out, it's too close (adjacent) to the button that hangs up the phone. I've hung up on people when I was rushing to turn off mute several times now. Last but not least, the microphone is too finicky. It has to be placed in just the right place or people say they can't hear me. I know a lot of people are too polite to say anything and just grin and bear it. Caller ID also is lacking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only good if you don't care what the other person is saying","review":"I use this phone at work. I have been looking for a replacement. The features are nice and the headset holder is nice to have, but it has one terrible flaw - the clarity is non-existent! It sounds like the person on the other end is talking through a pillow. Turning up the volume doesn't help, either, it only amplifies the fuzz. We have another, older Plantronics phone that has much better sound quality, so maybe we just got a faulty one. I wouldn't risk it, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great purchase!","review":"i really like my Plantronics headset and phone combo. The need for a headset for my home office was essential. Not only does it already have a dialer key pad but the handsfree option makes the day go by some much smoother and more productive without having to use 1 hand to hold a phone handset. I give the Plantronics and 8 out of 10. and thats only because i had to turn into a Mcgiver to get some things back to normal. i opened the box to some things shaking around, it turned out to be the tone and volume knobs which are adjustable and some how came off. who knows why? i broke out some tools opened up the phone screwed back in the 2 knobs and everything has been great since!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Plantronics T-10","review":"I intended to replace an older Plantronics unit with this newer one.

The sound quality was not wonderful, but it was adequate for the price. Easy to use and I would have been satisfied until I could afford a better product, except that it quit working after only 2 months of use. The on/off (answer) button stopped working. Too late to return to Amazon and Plantronics are not customer friendly when it comes to repairs and replacement.Edit: I was given a refurbished model as a replacement for the original purchase. It is now not working. So, after only 4 1/2 months of use, two of these have stopped working.

Not to mention the humming sounds that is so irritating. I bought this because I knew that using my speaker phone was annoying to the folks I was speaking to. It turns out they prefer the hollow sound when I talk on a speaker phone to the sound quality of this unit. That's saying a lot about the poor quality of this thing.

The rest of the material is written for law enforcement officers, not criminal defense investigators. Such topics are discussed such as 'taking charge of a crime scene' (please!). And dealing with suicides (as an investigator). Somehow I doubt that a private investigator is going to be allowed to examine the scene of a suicide very often. The real world of the PI is not the TV show 'Monk' and we're not allowed to just run around under the captain's protection.Apparently since I had the kindle version a couple of weeks prior to deciding 'this book isn't really geared towards my profession' I'm now stuck with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Austin City Limits","review":"This is a nice CD to purchase if you remember all of the great performances seen on ASL. We love the variety of performers on this CD and it brings back good memories of days gone past. Always a hit when played at a gathering. Blues lovers should not pass this buy and should add it to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fundamental","review":"This work was an excellent fundamental genealogical guide. Numerous family lines are portrayed as they relate to John Barber White's multiple New World ancestors. This is a great reference book, but not a source for derivative information. It is not a book that demonstrates or references family lines through actual vital records. This book is a great way to pick up some valuable clues should you be researching the family lines contained therein. I have found that due to the numerous pedigrees in this book that I have referred to it time and time again to find a genealogical staring point in my research."},{"rating":"1","title":"Basic Understanding, Disappointing Strategy","review":"This book did help me understand all of the different bets you can make at the Craps Table. However, after stating you could reduce the house odds to less than one half of one percent, the book recommends 20+ strategies without ever identifying a strategy which would help you play at the lowest possible house odds."},{"rating":"2","title":"SUPERB","review":"Even considering that I am not a native english speaker, I found this book easier to understand than Guyton in spanish. Now that I teach physiology I use it to remember concepts at a glance, and to better explain concepts (a good image comes in handy sometimes). I also have encouraged my students to get it, as it does not only make it easier to understand physiology, but also is very helpful in improving comprehension of medical english, which is a must nowadays. (how about that for a new use for this book!!!!!!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"state-of-the-art","review":"What makes this book a state-of-the-art is not its content, but the manner in which it's presented. Each subject only occupies one page of text, & opposite is a page for illustrations. But it's not the illustrations that explains the text, but rather the text that explains the illustrations (a method created by Leonardo da Vinci). This not only helps in recalling of the subject, but also helps in sustaining an interest in it. An ingenious beautiful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"An outstanding quick reference","review":"I teach Physiology at University and this book is my first port of call in areas in which I am not an expert. It is the easiest way to jog my memory as the index is good, the text is concise and the figures add a lot to my understanding. The only trouble is that it is getting a little old, so although it is great for most of the basics, it lacks a bit of detail on signal transduction pathways etc"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic debut of a promising young singer!","review":"With a great selection of classic Mariachi songs (plus a couple of original selections), Daisy showcases her tremendous talent backed by the always impressive Mariachi Sol De America.Though it is difficult to not be overshadowed by a group like Sol De America, Daisy displays tremendous prowess while maintaining her own distinct \\"Daisy\\" style.I'm certainly looking forward to following her career as she continues to mature into the unique artist she has the potential to become."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite what I expected","review":"So I was hoping for color pages and images. A more up to date where is it now section, since it did address the diamond and the smithsonian institute. Great information but was not at all what I was looking for.

Plug your controller into one end, the other end goes into the N64, and you end up with a much longer controller cord, allowing you to sit more than 3 feet away from the TV so your eyes don't melt from the screen. Haven't had any issues with the 4 I bought. Great little product for those still feeling a little nostalgic and hooking up the N64 from time to time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works very well, as advertised","review":"I recently started using my Nintendo 64 with my large flat screen TV. Until I found this product, I had to put an uncomfortable chair close to the N64 system to play.After I bought a couple of these though, my girlfriend and I can comfortably play from our couch! This cable gives us more room than we'll ever need. Great product!A word of warning though, the connectors are a VERY tight fit on the actual unit. Please be careful when inserting. Also, the point where the cable connects to the controller IS NOT the tightest fit, so make sure you aren't jerking the controller around as it could become unplugged."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a bad game, if you have the HD Space (850 megs)","review":"Rustin Parr is a pretty alright game....Play it in the dark, at night, and I guarantee a scare...

Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"I bought this game hoping that it would be everything I had read in the reviews. It isn't.

Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Movie=Bad Game","review":"The Blair Witch Project game was a good idea but falls short in depth..........and fun.......and sound.....and controlling.......and last but not least graphics.I have a good Graphics card but this kinda looks like Doom on my computer.So avoid this game at all costs.I would suggest that you buy Oni when it comes out or Quake 3,Unreal Tournament,Halo,and Diablo 2.Just don't buy this game at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Filled with action. Slow start, but worth the read.","review":"I must have started readin \\"Requiem of Stars\\" 4 times. When I finally decided to get into it, I am glad I did. The book is full of action. The detail involved in the personality of each character made me see them in my mind's eye. The imagination expands and escapes the limits of reality and physics.Fantasy intertwined with science fiction was a surprisingly refreshing change. Space travel, magic, mystisicm all rolled up in one story that breaks the boundaries of sci-fi/fantasy.You love and hate each character. The detail given to the personalities of each character or without limits. If you can't see each individual character and their personality in your mind's eye, then you must be like \\"Djan\\" after his meeting with the attacking aliens. (Read the book to find out what being like Djan means.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definately worth to read","review":"In general, I would say that Requiem of Stars is a very good book. While action, for the most part, is low level, the plot and setting are very developed and believeable. The characters are also very developed and each of them has a destinct personality and behavior. This is Tracy Hickman's first solo novel, and a very good one it, which definately leaves a tase for more."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a terrible book","review":"I have to say that I hated this book. I have read some of the authors other works and found them entertaining but this book was not. The entire idea of wooden sailing ships in space just makes me cringe. This is a fantasy book that is trying to grab some sci-fi readers by saying it is about galactic conflict. If you feel the need to read somthing by this author find a fantasy work and stay away from this piece of garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"such a dissapointment","review":"i am a huge fan of the work hickman and weiss have put out together. and i have read weiss without hickman, and i still like her work. and i've read hickman's The Immortals, and it was excellent, so i was rather dissapointed in this book. it was slow, dull, i couldn't even finish it, and believe me, i tried. i know the man has more talent than what i saw in this work. hopefully his next solo novel will be up the par of The Immortals."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for anyone who wants to make dolls","review":"This is a great book, it gives lots of information covering many aspects of creating a doll. I recommened all of Susan Oroyan's books for anyone interested in being creatively stimulated to explore the world of doll making. This book will get your creative juices flowing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Find!","review":"I really love this book. It helps you to realize your own doll possibilities. It gives enough instruction for those of us who just want the process needed to get what we want done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent is understatement.","review":"This book is worth much more. I absolutely desagree with those who says the author promotes her dolls only (btw,they are stunning). The book covers all stages of doll making and the evolution of the doll industry in general. Images of the dolls are carefully selected and represent dozens of doll artists, each of them unique in style. I personally, find most helpful info on joints, face painting, soft sculpture. And of course, just seeing works of all great doll artists is a great inspiration."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Gold Standard of Doll Making Books","review":"I am a cloth doll maker and never fail to find inspiration when I read this book. I look through it frequently for ideas and for technique - and never fail to find something I can use. This is a basic book for any cloth doll maker and I can't recommend it highly enough. I belong to a cloth doll club and everyone owns one of these books and wouldn't be without it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low on technique - High on Creepy","review":"I own many doll making books most of which are about making cloth dolls. I turn to them for technique, patterns, creative ideas and even comfort as I find the pictures endearing. But this book I returned.I returned this book because I could not find any useful (original) techniques, pleasing patterns, ideas to inspire me and the pictures gave me \\"the creeps\\".I attribute my reaction to the fact that many of the dolls were depicting anger, holding or wearing satanic symbols, carrying weapons, etc. If you have a sensitive spirit, like me, avoid this book. Or, put another way, there is enough violence and anger in the world - why sew it up using old techniques."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not buy because I can't look at the pictures/","review":"I do not buy craft books that I can't see whats inside, because its a good way to be bummed when you get the book. When I tried to look at the pictures in this book, and their other book, they were all blocked; what a bummer looked like a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent documentary - powerful truth","review":"Excellent documentary about women in combat. It highlights the dilemma of the law that says women are not supposed to be in combat (and therefore are not trained) vs. the fact that women ARE in combat and should be trained."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lioness","review":"This is an excellent documentary video which seems to accurately present the involvement of female members of our armed forces in combat in Afghanistan, from the time they deploy until they return and transition back to their non-military lives. Although it depicts a struggle, both related to the external pressures of war and to their internal strengths and values, the film demonstrates the heroic and positive manner that they performed in combat. The film should help citizens who have not experienced combat to better understand how difficult and long-term the transition is, following return from a combat zone. It should be noted that male military members experience very similar situations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"The footage starts off with a redneck woman shooting a turtle after watching peaceful scenary.

If you don't care for that style, don't buy this cd. I was so disappointed when i put it on, expecting to hear Brazilian tropicalia/bossa nova style music. Instead, I got the lost and forgotten soundtrack to Miami Vice. I've heard her other stuff on compilations, and its really good. But this was not the Gal Costa I know and love. Always remember to check the original recording date, because you may find yourself with some scary stuff like i did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second Hand Review","review":"This book uncovers an earlier view of economics than Adam Smith, which is not only Austrian, but finds free-market policies compatible with a moral and religous tradition.

As a big Posies fan I bought this EP immediatly and I think it is great. Compare it with Dear 23 & success and you know what you can expect: beautiful melodies, great harmonies (their voices being the best harmony-voices in pop today) and 5 very emotional songs. Great stuff! I'm eagerly awaiting their next album (I hope)."},{"rating":"2","title":"You could charm your way out of a hearse...","review":"Surprise! Five new Posies recordings: \\"Matinee\\", \\"Chainsmoking In The USA\\", \\"With Those Eyes\\", \\"No Consolation\\", and a fine cover of the Byrds' \\"Lady Friend\\". The gorgrous \\"With Those Eyes\\" is my favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"over priced photo copies","review":"This book is photocopies of old out of print boxing manuals and this book does NOT present itself as such which makes it an over priced book when Kinko's charges less for photocopies.

I'd previously had two other different plantronics headsets. After a year or so, the sound quality in the mic (the way others hear me) seems to degrade to the point of being unusable for anything but short, casual conversations. You'd think I'd have learned by now!Anyway, worked like a charm for the first 6 months. All as advertised. Then the sound quality started to deteriorate (people complained of echo & a muffled tone).I used it heavily (4+ hrs a day), and have quite a loud voice. Maybe others who used it less wouldn't have the same problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oreos in a nice size holder","review":"Nice number of cookies per box (i think its around 15).

I would suggest buying the cookies in the 6 pack unless you have multiple ppl eating these within those few days!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Well Produced","review":"I wanted to like this video. The substance was good overall, but the presentation was poor. A few of the \\"talking heads\\" were not easily understood and tended to oversimplify their comments. Other times they tended to ramble on without making a point--scenes which should have been left on the cutting room floor. Also, I don't know whether it was just my copy or what, but the picture on the video screen kept bouncing around at random intervals, making for an unpleasant watching experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Welcome To","review":"What a great game with its city lush envierment. Well every city has at liest one mob Don and Lost Hevan has two who would love to err well just like to ahh... Kill... Each other. The sound is amazing in this game,for the guns,the cars,and your suroundings in general,church bells,ehcos,you name it. There are around 60 slick 1930's cars,all of them a site to see. The guns look great too(and sound great)use the legandary Tommy gun and,my persenal favorite the Colt 1911,along with others. Enough said THIS GAME RULES SCREW GTA"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun! This one's a swell game to play!","review":"No, I don't have the game, just the Demo. If the game is anything like the demo, it's going to be among the elite of games this year... A bit costly though... I'll have to wait awhile before I can afford it... Still, I've had a great time playing the Demo. Lot's of shoot em up action. Looks very similar to Grand Theft Auto III. Excellent graphics and cut scenes! Controls are pretty easy on the keyboard. This is one game I'd recommend for sure. But, use short bursts with your machine gun if you want to be effective."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Game Ever!","review":"This game is the best ever. It takes the real 1930s and combines it what a real mafia life would be. It really lets you feel what it nearly would have been like. The assortment of cars are amazing and wait until you see the weapons. This game just has it all and I think it might be one of the best of all time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Laggy and Boring","review":"If you don't have a newer computer this game will be terrible for you. Although it only requires 128 mb this game is extremely glitchy and laggy even if you have 256mb. I also found this game very boring and repetetive. The first part of the game is very boring, all you do is drive people around. This game also has terrible AI, if you almost run someone over they will jump back and then continue walking. Not like in GTA3 when they start running away. The cars are bad too, if you park in the middle of the street they will just stay there they won't go around. I have a Gateway ME and I tried playing this game and its just to glitchy and laggy which ruins the fun. However I'm sure its fun if you can afford a brand new computer with a great video card and 1000mb of ram."},{"rating":"2","title":"All my life I wanted to be the soldier and not the commander","review":"Well in this game you are the soldier. You are the one thats on the streets taking the orders. You are the one shooting at the targets. You can go whatever/do whatever you want in this game without interference. You can hit someone in the face, shoot up a whole street, take a subway, or hijack a car. Anything is possible in this game. That is why I give it 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sluggish and Awkward","review":"This game is definitely one of the worst I've played. Mouse movement is really awkward. if your into games like Counter-Strike the aiming and shooting of weapons in this game will definitely frustrate you. It's hard to aim exactly because teh movement is sluggish. The radar on the screen when driving can use some improvement. A radar should have been used when just run on the street. It's difficult to tell which way or which door to run into. The radar with arrow points to a lot of dead ends if you are not sure where you are running. Doors you are supposed to enter should be more blatant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best.","review":"I got this game the day it came out. I gotta tell you, it is genius. The graphics amazing, game play outstanding, it is the best. I'd have to say, this game is better than GTA3 for PS2. The realistic game play clobbers the rest. I reccomend this to anyone, anyone with a fast computer. I say this because the graphics can become choppy if you don't have a fast enough computer. When i brought this home i played it, and next thing i knew 4 and a half hours had gone by. Get this game!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fatal Murderer In Lost Heaven.","review":"Tom Angelo this is your name in the game a taxi driver looking for a chance to be a rich man, Don Salieri will give you that chance if you do what he says.He will make you a fatal murderer without heart and he also will expolit your good driving in doing missions, So pick up the tommy gun,colt1911,pump action shotgun and magnum and spread the blood everywhere in Lost Heaven the city of Mafia and drive over 60 different vehicles with the most realistic car physics ever made in a game.Now you have respect after long struggle to make money and power.You will married Sara the girl who will change your life you have a wife and a daughter now what will happen ?you will care about them and....

Mafia is a fantastic game, with amazing graphics and a fabulous storyline. Strict computer requirements, but an upgrade will be worth it for this game. Even on my nForce motherboard with an Athlon XP 1800+ and a GeForce4 Ti 400, I'm still not completely satisfied with framerates. However, turning details down helps a lot. But it's hard to resist Mafia at 1280 x 1024 x 32 with 4x AA. It's one of the most graphically intense games I've ever seen, with an environment even bigger than GTAIII's. Believe me, you DO want this game if you want to experience the thug life of the 1930's. 4.5/5.0 due to some physical flaws."},{"rating":"1","title":"company obviously doesn't care about customers","review":"I agree with the other reviews that this game looks extremely good, fun to play exciting ect., but it was supposed to be released LAST YEAR!

Plus, there are many sub-quests which can only be unlocked after beating the game.Can you really beat the price?Con: It runs blocky even on my computer (2.8 GHz P4, 512 MB RAM, 128 MB graphics card)Note: Cheats for this game are basically nonexistent (if thats your thing)"},{"rating":"1","title":"DRIVE you crazy!!!!","review":"This game should have been called \\"Mafia-The Chauffeur\\"You spend more time driving from one rediculous task toanother.

It has a great replay value, and has two free play modes on top of that. Graphics are great, sound is very immersive, and the control is similar to GTA3. The level of detail that was put into this game is exellent, and the cars, though renamed, are from that era and perform realistically. Police in the game will ticket you, arrest you, or try to kill you depending on the crime (running a red light, killing someone, smashing into another car, etc.). You can win many special cars in the \\"Free Ride Extreme\\" mode that are fun to drive, some top speeds of close to 200 mph, others are bulletproof or fast taxis.

It's commendable that the author provides a logically consistent realization of this machine. Unfortunately, a good idea and scientific accuracy alone do not make a good book.The characters are shallow, the plot thin, and the writing style atrocious. The small blurbs before each chapter were painful to read, and I struggled to get through this book. I like to see a book to the end before I judge it, particularly with science fiction, but I put this book down several times and hesitated each time to pick it back up again.I originally purchased this novel because it was referenced in the show \\"Lost\\", and I thought it might provide insight into the show itself (but it did not).I would love to see the author take his idea to a more talented writer and work it into something with a little more substance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uuuuuuuuhhhhhhhhh.......No","review":"OK, I love bands such as Muse, Starsailor, Radiohead, Travis, and Frou Frou.

Hours and hours of using the 15% overnight did not produce nearly the same results, and actually made my teeth more sensitive than the 35. I assume this was due to the length of time involved.I agree that this is strong stuff, and it did burn and irritate my lower gums when I applied too much in the lower tray.

Caution - if you do not have good mold or get the gel evenly placed, your teeth will whiten unevenly AND your gums will turn ghost-white. Seriously, ghost white and you will need to chill a bit to give your gums time to turn back to red. Likely an excellent product but definitely WAY too strong for the average user. I have head the 15-20% work better and more uniformly. I also tried the Aquafresh pre-filled molds and had great suggest. I loke this product, but again, the 35% is WAY too strong for the average user and the white gums are both shocking to look at and painful in the process."},{"rating":"1","title":"No, no, and no.","review":"I have used Opalescence before, but never 35%. My gums were sooo tender after only 4 hours of use and never with the lesser concentrations. I could barely brush my teeth for fear of hitting my gums. For 4 days after using!! It tore them up!!

It's my case."},{"rating":"1","title":"To strong","review":"I've used the 15% solution for a year and bought the 35% solution thinking it would take less time to whiten my teeth. I ccould keep the 15% solution in overnight. I kept the 35% solution for 45 minutes and that's because I forced myself, it was actually painful. My gums and teeth hurt for several days and I haven't used it since. It even bleached my gums around my front teeth. My gums cleared up in 2 days. Everytime I hit my gum while brushing for the next 2 days it bled. I would purchase again but only the 20% solution."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with a lower potency","review":"I have the custom made trays from the dentist and ended up with white gums-I was trying to whiten my teeth!The white gums went away but they were burned and are still sore.

There are questions about long term use of whitening products so I am very leery about them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too strong and irritating","review":"Initially I was given the Opalescence 10% Teeth Whitening from my dentist along with custom molds that he made for me. They worked great over the weeks that I was doing my routine. Years later my teeth starting to fade back I decided that I should whiten again, I found this product which was the same brand and a lower cost then my dentist had given me and the potency was way higher which I figured what can be wrong with that. Immediately I noticed that my gums along with my teeth were turning white and also I had slight bleeding along the gum line... but man my teeth were white so its a trade-up but I definately do not have sensitive teeth and/or gums and this happened to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Whitening Results But Not Worth the Pain!","review":"I had my custom trays made by my dentist & was given the 15% Opelescence. It whitened and brightened my teeth after only 4 days but my teeth ached from the sensitivity for days on end! (I have always had sensitive teeth.) I couldn't continue using the product. If you don't have sensitive teeth, this is the best whitening gel on the market but you MUST get custom trays from your dentist that fit properly. A good tip is to store the gel in the refrigerator. It keeps the gel's whitening concentration from depleting and the syringes will be good for at least a year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Used this to whiten","review":"I started using this product YEARS ago. I do have a fitted/custom tray and originally used this product to whiten all of my teeth before getting front tooth veneers. GREAT prod!

I can't say that for other favorites of mine like Elvis Costello and Graham Parker, whose harsher styles and voices turn off many listeners before they can appreciate the depth of the songwriting.This is a great album for fans of Mr. Lowe who prefer his rockin' easily accessible music to the more morose slower paced crooner songs he's into now. From the opening drumbeat, these songs have your toe tapping. Lowe combines a great sense of humor and a unique smooth singing voice to make songs that just make you smile. The Production is typically Nick Lowe....low-tech, and those who prefer a crisper \\"sound\\" may be disappointed.

Where Sholem Aleichem writes in an inexhaustibly stylish, idiomatic, quotable Yiddish, the efforts to replicate his fluency come across as awkward, patched-together, and completely removed from English as it's spoken anywhere in the world today. Moreover, his efforts to replicate the voices of uneducated, lower-class Jewish women of Eastern Europe--always the most dramatic, comic, and memorable of Sholem Aleichem's characters--come across like a vaudeville performer in drag and in blackface: an offense simultaneously to the Yiddish original and to the English reader. The cumulative effect of this depressing and unreadable collection suggests that Ted Gorelick in fact must have hated the Yiddish language. I KNOW that he hated the English language.

Not much different from the original album version, but still has an edge over it. The Hybrid Dishing Pump Remix is an excellent, hi-energy mix that infuses some pretty good beats. The other remix by Pete Heller pales a little but still great for a good dancefloor workout. The two non-album tracks are Ain't Never Learn, a trademark Moby song which features beats and soulful female vocal and The Sun Never Sets (also on B Sides) which is a perfect closing for the 7-track maxi.

So he was a sissy, too?Maybe the author is just cynical and sarcastic. \\"Blood? Guts? Raw, animal hatred? Sure. But Tao?

Anyway, Stanley Bing needs to donate the proceeds of this book back to those of us who were dumb enough to purchase it.

The book meanders through Sun Tzu with little application of the original Art of War's paasages and waxes philosophic through various vignettes and asides in the \\"warfare\\" of the business world. Sun Tzu's brilliant work was written in the vein of self promotion through his deep beliefs on warfare. Bing's book is written with a self-promoting title and offers little in the way of a consistent philosphy other than being a rotten SOB. Call it what it is, business is business.

It's like that Travolta sci fi movie, and take out the special effects. If you ever wage war and need to torture your prisoners: this book is it.

I particularly like how Sanchez handled composer Bobby Capo's \\"Sonando con Puerto Rico\\"; a beautiful piece that will certainly linger just a little longer in your ear. Then there is the dreamy \\"Essa Muhler\\" penned by Brazilian composers Joyce and Anna Terra: ebullient, samba-isque, gentle, sweet as a lover's whisper - this is music that can romanticize the most unromantic of folk!It is evident Mr Sanchez really wanted to make a most personal musical statement and he succeeded.

It failed after only a little less than 3 months. The pump motor stopped working, then it started to blow the circuit breaker it was connected to. After talking with WATTS, the only warranty option is to take the pump out of the hot water system and return it to them for evaluation. If it is bad, they will replace it... I pay postage both ways!! Only problem with that is when you take the pump out of the hot water line, you end up with a \\"hole\\" (gap) in the water line. Basically, you'd have to shut down the entire water heater while WATTS decides what they want to do. Again... failed in less than 3 months. The concept of a hot water recirc system is great... the WATTS pump, however, is a piece of crap. I saw several bad reviews about WATTS qual;ity, but did not take them seriously. Now I'm out my money with this piece of junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ah, hot water","review":"The Watts hot water recirculation pump and the under sink valve installed easily.

No big deal, yet it takes 2 to 3 adjustments to get the shower right.All the components are high quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works very well!","review":"No where in my house was I able to get hot or warm water without waiting a fair amount of time. After reading the reviews here I initially bought just the valve to see if it would work by itself as suggested in one of the reviews. It did not. Then I purchased the item described here, pump and valve, at Costco for $180. What a difference! Because of the layout of my house I needed 2 valves so my experiment with just a valve did not wast any money. The hot water at the valve could be hotter and the cold water could be colder - obviously mutually exclusive. The faucets upstream from the valve have much hotter water and this is an obvious but unexpected treat. It is nice to have something that works better than expected. I definitely recommend the Watts Premier Hot Water Recirculation Pump."},{"rating":"1","title":"It does not work for us, neither in another house.","review":"The pump was received very fast in good condition, we had the plumber installed it, the hot water comes out faster but still have to wait. My estimate was 1 minute wait before the pump installed, with the pump installed, takes about 30 seconds. Not worth the several hundred dollars invested and the trouble and cost of hiring a plumber.My sister had the same pump installed, it works for some of the rooms in her house, not all rooms, my mother did the same, but does not work for her house.

I called Watts today and the representative told me to program the timer to run for an hour and then shut off for an hour during our peak hours, which is 6am - 10pm.

Turning the shower onto full hot water never resulted in anything more than a tepid to lukewarm shower, about two months ago the water heater gave out and was replaced with a new gas unit, but the shower still ran lukewarm. We bought and installed the Watts Hot Water Recirculation pump about a week after installing the new hot water heater -- instantly we had HOT water in both the shower and the tub, for the first time since we moved in we actually had to turn the cold water valve on to bring the temperature down to a comfortable level. A really great product, next I will install one at my parents home."},{"rating":"2","title":"You can \\"pump\\" me for information!","review":"This pump is as handy as a doorknob, is somewhat challenging to install, but works as advertised. If you're particularly adept at home and plumbing repairs, I'd recommend taking a shot at it. Otherwise, get a plumber to crawl under your sink & into your water heater closet. You might need some additional tools/hoses/parts, but you'll be happy with the results; I know that we are. You might find that an external timer with multiple ON/OFF cycles is handier than the built-in timer. Finally, Amazon.com featured the *BEST* prices for the pump and manifolds, so you can't go wrong. If you want HOT water at the tap fast, this is definitely the way to go.

That is perhaps the only angle that works on this album. One must question the logic of a tribute album: what are any of these bands adding to these songs?...and...what CAN be added to a Devo song?

Both units had the identical construction. The piece fell of easily. What happened to the old practice of making the thumb mechanism permanently attached to the stand?

Otherwise it looked pretty well built considering its price."},{"rating":"1","title":"a DISASTER that happens every time its used","review":"This stand is a DISASTER every time we use it. Not only does the stand not allow any adjustment of its music support in any direction--neither tilting back or forward or turning left or right, the top is not attached to the bottom with any kind of fastener. It just slips on the post at only one angle and one direction, the direction of the base. So to adjust the stand even the least bit, you're going to need to pick the whole thing up. And every other time you try to move the stand a little to get it sitting right, you invariably forget and lift it by the top, which slips off the post, with all the music on it which of course falls to the ground, hopefully not during a gig. I HATE THIS STAND.There are far better stands for the same price, like the SLM stand I use all the time, adjusts in every direction, and has fasteners for everything that moves or comes apart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent stand for the price","review":"I am impressed that this stand arrived only 3 days after I purchased it, with standard shipping.

The AC cable that came with the camera is only good for either 120 or 240 volts. You MUST use different cables for different voltages.

This is a bunch of pop crap nonsense, none of which have anything to do with the film just as the film has nothing to do with Godzilla. Only Arnold's tracks have any merit, and if you buy this album, you are sending the unfortunate message that original orchestral soundtracks should be downplayed in favor of marketing gimmicks of pop-schlock in no way related to the film. WAIT FOR THE REAL SOUNDTRACK RELEASED LATER THIS SUMMER!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment, and here's why:","review":"Let's face facts. Lots of well-known bands/singers on the Godzilla Album, but many of them were horribly mainstream, which explains the pitiful quality of many of the songs. The only actually decent songs on that entire CD are RATM's No Shelter and Silverchair's Untitled. O yeah, and DOTN's Running Knees is alright. Otherwise, though, the songs just weren't what they should've been. Many artists on that CD have gone so mainstream, their song quality has really diminished...although most performers on that CD are just plain bad. All in all, a major letdown. Is it worth the 3 good songs? With the lack of singles...still debatable."},{"rating":"1","title":"What? This cd is good? NOT!!","review":"I absolutely was disappointed in this CD. The movie was OK but the CD stunk. The only song I could really listen to again with any hope of enjoying was the cover by the Wallflowers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it.","review":"I was very disappointed with this CD (Thats putting it mildly).All it is a collection of dumb songs(like \\"Undercover\\")that only come up in the backround of the movie when you can't even hear them.The only good thing about this CD is the two tracks of David Arnold's perfect score.I hope they release the actual score at some point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soundtrack closely resembles the quality of the movie.","review":"There are about 4 songs that I enjoyed off of this soundtrack. Puff Daddy's \\"Come With Me\\" produces a burst of excitement for the first couple of times you hear it. Then you want to think \\"When is it going to be over?\\". Really, the song is about 6 minutes long. A favorite that I still listen to is the song by GreenDay. Another hit includes the song by SilverChair. Other than these groups, most of the songs seem weak and repetitive. If you're thinking of buying this CD, take my advice and listen through the tracks first."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a horrid waste of a CD","review":"Godzilla was by far one of the worst soundtracks that I have ever heard. I was highly disappointed with the product(as was the case with the movie). This soundtrack has a large variety of music types, but is lacking the type that it needs the most... David Arnold's! The soundtrack would have been far more enjoyable if it was solely David Arnold's original score for the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Variety of any 90's soundtrack","review":"This is probably the first instance ever in which a soundtrack should make more money than the movie for which it was released. Artists like Puff Daddy ,Green Day,and Jamiroquai give the album personality, but certainly the best written, best performed, best overall track on the album is \\"No Shelter\\", Rage Against the Machine's best effort yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Shelter? Where else can i find it?","review":"Sorry, i guess this review won't be 'helpful'. But I was just wondering: is this the only place i can find No Shelter? That song rules... Rage is so good.

So anyway, sorry i haven't heard it, the movie and the rest of the soundtrack look terrible, too............."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hokey at Best","review":"It's not enough that the film was an insult to the 1954 original. They had to make it worse by attaching this pathetic soundtrack filled with 3rd rate groups bleeting their mediocre efforts.

It is full of noise aimed strait at teenagers and all the groups on it have no musical talent whatsoever. The score by David Arnold makes me wonder if all he did was fart on the recording. For some reason, it has only two tracks of his on here and made me spend $30 on a bootleg for the whole score which is almost as bad as the porno music from Godzilla VS Megalon."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD needs a parental warning!","review":"We took the kids to the movie, and it seemed to drag on and on.

Cotton Candy Music.","review":"I bought this CD because of the Jimmy Page/Puff Daddy colaboration. Very disappointing. Puff Daddy takes away the power of the original Zep beat by adding a busy high hat and the bass drum sounds like a Phil Collins record. Over compressed. Also, on all the commercials hyping this movie I kept hearing Blue Oyster Cults song \\"Godzilla\\". This song isn't on the CD. What's Up? I would have loved to hear Nine Inch Nails redo that classic. The David Bowie song \\"Heroes\\" redone by the Wallflowers is the only number worth listening too and, being a cover song, you can only listen to it for a short time before you want to hear the original."},{"rating":"2","title":"I thought it was a fairly good cd!

It was worth most of the money, though. However, this CD excells, and is worth every penny. Puff Daddy&Jimmy Page's song, Come with me, is great. Hitting a high note especially if you listen to it while angry. Deeper Underground is the best song on the CD (hip hop meets alternative) All the other songs are just as good, with the exception of Fuzzbubble's song, only mediocre at best. David Arnold's score is exquisite, hitting all the right notes, and adding the perfect atmosphere to the movie. Now if only they included more of his music...But it was a stellar follow-up to his great Tommorow Never Dies soundtrack. All in all a great CD. It certainly was worth the twenty dollars. Go buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"good and not so good","review":"Puff Daddy and Rage Against the Machine head the list of songs on this album. Both are extremely good.

Needless to say, besides the aforementioned song, there's nothing else on side 1 that's even worth listening to. OK, on to side 2... I hated the Foo Fighters' song, and I absolutely wholeheartedly DESPISE anything by Green Day, so my loathing of \\"Brain Stew\\" was a given. However, I immediately fell in love with Silverchair's \\"Untitled\\" (a beautiful, sombre song), and Fuzzbubble's \\"Out There\\" was great(the sci-fi theme was very cool). Another song I really liked was Joey Deluxe's \\"Undercover\\" (too bad he doesn't have any albums of his own out; I'd buy some more of his music anytime). Bar those four songs, this album is trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent soundtrack, big-name talents!","review":"The reason I got this CD is because of all the artists on here. The Wallflowers, one of my favorite bands, does a great cover of David Bowie's 'Heroes'. Puff Daddy and Jimmy Page pull off a great song, I think, with 'Come With Me'. Jamiroquai, who I've always liked for his disco-funk style, does a good job on 'Deeper Underground'. Rage Against The Machine does an okay job, although I think most of their songs all sound the same, with 'No Shelter'. Ben Folds Five is not a band i'm interested in, they're too boring. Days of the new isn't bad but I don't know too much from them so I couldn't really tell you. Same with Michael Penn. Fuel, another one of my favorite bands, does 'Walk The Sky', which is probably one of this albums strongest songs. Foo Fighters and Green Day also have good songs, and this makes this CD all together, a pretty darn good soundtrack!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Plain and simple, not every song is worth listening to","review":"This album was made to appeal to a broad range of music fans, mostly rock, and a little bit of pop and rap. I'd say that no more than 40 % of these songs are worth listening to, which comes out to a 2 star rating. Notables: Rage's great hard rock song \\"No Shelter\\", the funky dance song \\"Deeper Underground\\" by Jamiroqui, the ballad \\"Air\\", and lastly, the Green Day \\"Brain Stew\\" remix. The Puff Daddy-Jimmy Page collaboration was one of the worst rock-meets-rap songs I've ever heard. Noone has been able to make a good rap-rock song since Aerosmith and Run-DMC. The opening \\"Heroes\\" is very weak, and much of the album is just to take up time on the cd. Do not buy this CD! At best, just copy the aformentioned good songs from Napster.

When my husband got home, it took him over an hour to get the piece off with brute strength (not kidding) and reassembled. It didn't help that the part was clear and therefore I didn't even see it. Once we started trying to use it, it was too clunky. As the parent, the only control you have is pushing, so if your child, like ours cannot steer yet... you can't really use it for walks. In addition, the height of the canopy/handle is not adjustable - so when using it to push - it was too short for us. If you are under 5'6 maybe it will work for you. My husband after playing with our child for 10 minutes complained of a sore back.

First of all, the glove twisted around on my fingers, so I never knew where the bristles were inside my dogs' mouths. Your hands would have to be HUGE for these to fit snugly, and even then I am not sure they wouldn't twist around. Second, these are disposable, and pretty much trashed after one use. It is just not earth friendly to use this disposable product.

It is hard and fast and totally different than their first album. Page Avenue was great, dont get me wrong, but this takes them to a new level. Page Avenue was more \\"Radio Friendly\\" than this masterpiece. This album is raw and in your face and has a big F-You attitude. It's like they didn't sit down and write songs to be singles, they just wrote what they wanted to and didn't care. They mix punk,thrash,metal,and more in this cd and I think that is great. \\"Is this my fate\\" he asked them has a totally Pantera sound to it and Dan's screaming is amazing on it among others. That one is probally my favorite song on the album. Anyways, if you haven't picked this cd up, please give it a shot. Story of The Year are amazing and they have just gotten better so far. You will not be disappointed by them I promise. Metal For Life, PEACE!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Sophomore Effort","review":"If you grew up listening to fast punk music, you will like this album. Page Avenue was a good album, but a little on the pop side like many other bands do to get noticed. However, the boys from Story Of The Year prove on this album that they are musically inclined and want to let it all out. Don't listen to the negative critics on this page because I don't think they know what heavy music is all about. Its about personal conflict not blood and bitting things that you would not normally want to put in your mouth. Keep getting tattoos and piercings you angry little boys."},{"rating":"2","title":"A less poppy sophmore album..... UNHEARD OF","review":"Hearing that this album was coming out, all i thought about was how they probably ruined themselves just like all other bands like them to make more money by becoming more poppy, and less... musicle. Suprisingly as I listened to the album on Rhapsody, I was not dissapointed. Their old producer had them whipped (what do you expect from Goldfinger's front man), now they still have a few singable poppy choruses, which is(lets face it) what we old SOTY fans listened to them for, but they are not at all the same band. The new CD does lack in change in style, but at least we now know who the real story of the year is. This CD is not completely original in style, but I also can not think of a band that sounds excactly like them. Something new in this CD is the guitar, instead of lyricly driven, music, which is shocking from a band in this genra. This is different from Page Avenue, not better, not worse, just completely different. A pretty solid album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vomit, cough, choke.","review":"\\"These are the days we will remember. These are the days we wont forget. These are the times we shared.

Everyone keeps comparing it to Page Avenue, which don't get me wrong was a great album, but for any sane person that has seen SOTY live you know that Page Avenue was not the type of music they wanted or should have played. This Album fits the build. When listening to this Album, i can see them perform, i have by the way seen them 3 times, and i can totally picture them playing these songs. This Album is top ten on my list. The Guitars are amazing, and the lyrics and vocals are better. Track 11 and 12 are by far some of the most powerful songs i have ever heard."},{"rating":"1","title":"From a huge fan... very dissapointed","review":"Whatever heart these guys put into Page Avenue apparently stayed with that album. Usually bands mature, or at least evolve, in their sophomore effort. Wake of Determination only proves that SOTY is quickly losing their real punk (not pseudo-hardrock) sound, catchy choruses, and sadly: talent. Whoever said this album was \\"hard\\" probably moshes to the new Papa Roach cd. It's not hard at all... Page Avenue had its variety of hard riffs, harder screams, and more importantly, passion. Marsala's singing aside, \\"Is This My Fate?\\" is probably the best song on the cd, but being the last song on a list of real winners like 'Meathead' its just too little too late."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ingenious","review":"When I first picked up this record, I went in without listening to any of their songs beside \\"We Don't Care Anymore\\". I listened to it completely through, without reading the booklet, just to see how the sound was. My initial reaction was \\"Wow, they got a hell of a lot better in their sound. Phil is doing more harmonies and Ryan can wail out some pretty sweet solos.\\" That was my first impression. Then when I got home, I opened up the lyric booklet, and read along. My view only got better. I think when I told my friend about it I said: \\"This is so good it'll make peoples children explode.\\" Even though I don't relate to all the lyrics, they are all thoughtfully written and altogether make a great CD. I definitly recommend this to any fan of this genre. My favorite songs on the album are: \\"Stereo\\" and \\"Is this My fate he asked them\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A little of Both","review":"This album is different than Page Avenue, but it combines sceamo and metal in a great way. You can find songs similar to the first album in \\"Taste the Poison\\" (one of my favorites). As well as beats that remind me of Metallica in \\"Is this My Fate?\\" For the most part this is much heavier and less \\"popish\\", but you get the best of both worlds, showing that SOTY is an amazing and versitile band that is confident in their sound and rocks it hardcore!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as it should be","review":"I liked pretty much every song on Page Avenue but this CD is just gets anoying after a few listens.

Definitely pick this up, you wont be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome CD","review":"I have been a fan of Story of the Year's for a while. I have listened to Page Avenue obsessively since it came out and didn't think their next CD would live up to how great Page Ave was. In the Wake Of Determination definately surpassed my expetations. It is one of the few CDs I can listen to all the way though and not skip one song. It is definately a lot harder then their last CD, which I love. My favorite song on the CD is definately \\"Taste The Poison\\". It has all the elements that I think make a great song."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened?","review":"This record is garbage. I loved Page Avenue. John Feldmann may have gone overboard with the production, but it's crisp, you can hear everything crystal clear, and no one instrument drowns another out. That's what bands with talent are supposed to do. In the Wake has lost all of the flare that SOTY had before. None of the clever riffs, none of the intelligent drumming, no running bass lines, and virtually no screaming. The last thing I want to hear is some wuss singing on a screamo record. This album sounds like a crappy 80's record. The guitar sounds like it belongs in Bon Jovi, and the rest of the CD was produced to blend in with every turd metal band on the market. Bring Feldmann back. This record is awful."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm no longer a huge SOTY fan, just a huge PAGE AVENUE fan","review":"Page Avenue simply put was one of the greatest albums in my oponion ever.

They made the Cd they wanted this time, not the cd Maverick wanted like last time. Its totally different, no memorable songs, nothing. I am surprised at how many good reviews this CD has been given while in my mind i can't even force myself to like it.

The book improved as it went on, so I did not pitch it into the recycling bin as I thought I might early on. I was satisfied with the ending, which was very realistic to me. Yes, Babbitt went back to his old values and beliefs, but his midlife crisis served him well.

Babbitt is not my friend, no matter how much time I have spent with him recently. I wouldn't suspect you want to be his friend either. I suppose that this is a credit to what I think of your character. As for Babbitt though, he is an interesting character, but I don't know if Lewis created a new archetype or just adapted one.

The GPS function seemed to work well, and I liked the interface so I returned the faulty watch and requested a replacement instead of a refund. I had a similar problem with the second watch as well, except this one would never register below ~120 bpm. After several calls back and forth seeking a resolution with Suunto USA, I have given up on the product and the company.

It is among the most user hostile pieces of technology I have ever had the misfortune to deal with. Navigating the menus, erasing memory, pairing the watch with the belt, doing anything in real time to reset, control timer or laps, all nightmarish.

Our money was thrown away in buying this pepper mill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good design; poor performance. Very disappointing.","review":"This model is a nice little pepper mill: relatively easy to fill, easy to use, and reasonably priced. Unfortunately, performance leaves a lot to be desired. Turn the handle one direction and the pepper is very coarse; I would described it as cracked rather than ground. Turn the handle the other direction and it grinds so fine that nothing comes out. Perhaps if the mechanism were adjusted it would work; unfortunately I can't figure out what that adjustment would be. Based on other reviews, I'm guessing my experience is a quality control issue. If it worked I would be happy. As it is, I'm purchasing yet another pepper mill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money....","review":"This product did a terrible job of grinding and produced very inconsistant pepper grinds.

This book seems to miss the entire point of the Challengers of the Unknown, their origin, and their motivations. A couple of the characters are just missing their basic personalities entirely, to be filled in with humorous characterizations. The two plotlines in this book cross over each other on occasion - but have nothing to do with each other. They just happen to show up in the same story. And the deus ex machina devices stretch the boundaries of imagination. If you aren't a Challs fan, you likely won't like this novel; it isn't very engaging. If you ARE a fan of the Challs, please avoid this book; I've taken the bullet for you already."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad at all.","review":"I've read many many many superhero novels, and this was one of them.

Not only are the optics first rate, but the lens is not overly heavy. This enables you to screw it on and walk aroudn with it. Photos produced with this lens are stunning and very crisp. The only drawback I'd say this has is the limit of only 2x telephoto/teleconverter aspect, but that is what keeps it relatively light!

I purchased a cheaper 2X lens that was blurry in the corners and gave 1.26X rather than the listed 2X magnification. This lens gives me the 2X magnification (well just shy of absolute 2X - designed for 1/1.8 type sensor while the p5100 has a 1/1.72 type sensor) while still allowing me to use my optical viewfinder (1/3 of the viewfinder blocked at full zoom, less blockage otherwise). Here you would be out of luck and $200 extra with the TC-E3ED.I have also been able to use this lens without vignetting at much lower focal lengths than stated in Nikon's conservative specs. I get approximately 125-240mm (35mm equiv.) which works perfectly for me as the p5100 built in lens end at 123mm.

Yes, I'm still hoping they release the rest of his albums on CD, but this is such a treat by itself. Songs I'd not heard in ages, sounding better than ever. This is not some maudlin trip down memory lane, though. \\"Short Stories\\" is as applicable today as when it was written, and it still blasts you out of the chair. and \\"Old Folkie\\"--one of my favorites--is a fantastic tribute to Pete Seeger.

I used it for while converting to the uberman sleep schedule, and it was the ideal alarm clock. It's extremely loud on the highest setting, but has a mid and low as well. The hardest part of converting is actually waking up which I struggled with until I got this. Also it worked out really well since I would only sleep for 20-30 mins at a time this allowed me to set it for just 20 or 30 mins really quickly.

I have it set for 90DB, I think 120DB is a little loud. The one thing I have noticed is you have to reset the alarm every day, it kind of gets annoying. You also have to make sure you switch it off of alarm/timer and back to clock otherwise it will not wake you up. It also has an annoying pre-alarm that goes off ten minutes before the alarm time. You can disable it, but if you forget to, you will wonder why you are being woken so early."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good beginning to a series","review":"This was an enjoyable read, though grisly in places, and I hope the rest of the series is as good.

My only real quibble is that the first 2 murders reference the nursery rhyme \\"As I was going to St. Ives...\\" which then disappears for the rest of the novel.

There is a grisly series of murders, an attractive mysterious woman, links to The Vatican and the mob; a good mix for a thriller. But I just didn't warm to this one. I don't want to give too much away but for me there was a central part of the plot that just didn't sit well.There is a good cast of characters, I liked Nic's father and his expounding on the wisdom of dogs, but I felt the two main characters, Nic and his femme fatale were a bit shallow.I thought Villa of Mysteries, \\"episode two\\" was much better.

One thing for sure, they would have to be a lot more creative. The author is a talented writer, no question, but the silly plot in this \\"thriller\\" reveals a serious case of anti-catholicism. Oh, I forgot, it's not about the church; it's about the Vatican, an independent country that's depicted here as infinitely more corrupt than Italy or any Italian politican, or, I guess, on a level with the governments of Burma and Afghanistan.

The detail in each picture cannot show the clear consequence. 4.Built-up model which is very simple, but write the explanation that make readers confuse.As I saw from the writers' name, I think most of them have practical experiences in the business. I do not understand why they wrote this book to be a sleeping pill."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Everglades and The Florida Keys (DVD)","review":"I have done a lot of reading about the Everglades and southern Florida; I find the material fascinating. But I have never seen the area and probably won't. I had hoped I was purchasing a DVD of scenery, traveling through the area by boat, a little history, etc. I also hoped to see a few of the homes and people living inside the Big Swamp, but that is not the intent of this DVD. It focuses on the animal life of the area with up-close pictures of their daily life, including mating and feeding habits. The animal photography is excellent,very suitable for using in a teaching setting. But not the travelog I had hoped for. The product description should have been more accurate. The cost is high."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good guys prevail; Bad guys get theirs","review":"And what could be better. Hollenbeck's action packed story takes us through a former SEAL team member's effort to right a wrong. Wasting no time, the heavy action starts on page nine and rolls merrily along for the next 200 pages. It's a perfect \\"flight shortener\\" if you're prone to the tedium of commercial aviation. The SEAL tactics and gear are especially well employed in this very fast moving tale that leave Walter Mitty folks like myself wanting more. A wonderful first hack at fiction for Hollenbeck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Action packed murder mystery with a twist.","review":"While hero Scott Wolfe is a professional photographer, this novel is so fast paced with murder, exotic locations, and beautiful people, it makes Bridges of Madison County---another novel with a professional photographer as main character---look like a slow waltz. Among the roller coaster action and intrigue, the flashbacks to Vietnam give this thriller some suprising twists,turns, and loops that kept me turning the pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different than most","review":"Come into the world of photography and beautiful scenaries and images. Come into the world of Mexican villas and relaxation. Come into a world of violence and revenge that can't be mistaken. That is what this book is about, and Cliff Hollenbeck makes sure to focus on that point. The main character witnesses a murder through the lenses of his camera. He knows what he's seen now he must fend off agaisnt the drug dealer and incredible henchman that protect themselves from the Mexican and American police. Go cop it.~~Special K"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inspect these carefully","review":"Both my pans had scrapes- one on the outside, which is just ugly, and one on the inside- which is bad for baking, since the coating would have come off in the food.

The acting was fair to poor - too staged and not natural. When the main character \\"gets saved\\" there is absolutely no mention of Calvary or even the resurrection (which is essential part of the gospel according to Romans 10:9b). How can an evangelistic ministry like UF, fail so miserably on this key issue; I don't know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed the movie","review":"My family and I really enjoyed Milltown.It is a well-written and acted movie-Inspiring and well worth adding to the Christian movie collection!"},{"rating":"2","title":"High quality and roomy","review":"I bought this bench as a storage necessity as I was moving into a smaller room with a smaller dresser.

Homework problems are extremely complicated-little help comes directly from the chapter's content. This book seems to throw out conventions such as clearly identify the variables immediately following the VAST number of equations. The end result is page after page of garbled numbers and symbols which seek to intimidate, rather than enlighten. As a teaching tool, this text is of the worst I have ever seen. I used to have a genuine love of lasers., I was so passionate about them that I undertook much training and became the laser safety officer at my place of employment. However, since struggling with this textbook through only five chapters, I am thoroughly sick of the entire subject! Thanks, Davis!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun with Glass","review":"A truly fun piece of glass and I use it as both a toy and a tool. I love to shoot people and objects with it and see what the distortion does to the image, but it's also incredibly useful when you have no room to work or back up. I found it especially useful in the confined spaces of aircraft cockpits. But that fine thread to mount it on the camera drives me nuts! Especially when I'm in the confined space of something like an aircraft cockpit. But I always put it in my kit when on the road."},{"rating":"1","title":"Swindler!","review":"A very small boek consisting 28 pages (copie).

I took my set to the local Hooters Restaurant one afternoon and had EVERY waitress in the place lined up to have their writing done. They told me the most incredible things about themselves (things you would never hear until you were well into a relationship with someone) as I explained to them what the cards said about their personalities. Finally, the manager of the place had to come out and tell them all to get back to work! I was on a first name basis with many of the girls after that, and on my next visit one of them came over to me as soon as I walked in so she could introduce me to two others who were not working the first night I was there (so that I could do their writing).BTW, I'm extremely shy, and normally would never approach women in public or dare to flirt with waitresses, but these cards make it very easy to talk to people and get them to open up.

Everyone I tried them on was very surprised at how accurate they turned out to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"I revceived this about a month ago, was excited toget it but the card deck was missing. I tried contacting Amazon to let them know - short of returning this item I cannot see how I will get the deck that was supposed to be with it. No one has answered my questions or complaints to date. The only way for me to get back to them is through the packaging feedback button, which I gave them twice now. I was very explicit that the grapho deck was missing. Still nothing. Now I have this pointless pamphlet selling me on the reason I want the deck. I already knew I wanted the deck. Sheesh. Dont waste your time or money on this one. If you really want the grapho deck - contact the author directly, maybe you will have more success. I still have no grapho deck."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother ordering if you want the deck","review":"You get a cheap photocopy of the book and the deck is not included. The description clearly states, 2 items will arrive with your order. Amazon needs to delete the pictures of the cards and edit the description. What a waste of time and money. I'm getting a refund.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for conversations","review":"Anytime you can quickly and easily entertain people is always a great time!While you could carry the pack around with you, I would recommend trying to memorize the cards or at least half of the most common ones - it will give you the appearance of being an \\"expert\\" - and it just seems cooler.Overall - great product, great idea.Only negative I would say, is that in the \\"Special Report\\" it was a pretty blatant attempt at selling his other products and website - it had almost as much advertising as halftime for the Super Bowl."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for all students, parents and prospective teachers","review":"When I was teaching at a major university I was shocked at how ill-prepared the incoming students were. After meeting faculty and graduates of our school of education, I was equally shocked- but I began to understand.Kramer shows through example how the inmates have taken over the asylum in too many of today's schools of education. Run by people with little academic depth, and having degrees from other diploma-mill Ed schools, today's typical school of education is a sociological program run amuck. Priority is given to vacuuous notions of instilling self-worth while teaching content is thought to be of secondary importance- if it's given any thought at all.The education industry today is more of a closed shop than the auto industry. You can't teach in public schools without an Ed degree, but no spoecialized knowledge is needed at all. Gym teachers can teach physics, but PhDs cannot. Read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"READ THIS BOOK!","review":"I enjoyed reading Rita Kramer's first-hand account of what our future teachers are learning. Although she is not dispassionate, she is absolutely well-informed about the travesty that passes for \\"education\\" in the \\"ed schools.\\" Future teachers are indoctrinated, not educated, and that is the major reason for most of our problems in education today. If you care about improving schools, and if you are worried about your own child's education, READ THIS BOOK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Third Graders loved the intricate animal art.","review":"We perused the book for the absolutely amazing art work! My third graders can't wait to create their own detailed animals! The book is so fascinating!

I believe the built in MP3 encoder only has 20 uses before you have to register it. However, you can still output to .wav as many times as you like.Some people have mentioned that there is encoding in the output .wav file that stops you creating an MP3 file from it using a 3rd party program.Well, I've just tried creating a .wav in Guitar Tracks 2, creating an MP3 from it in cdex (freeware), then playing it in winamp (freeware also). I had no problems at all.My point is this - there is no MP3 limitiation with this product so don't let it put you off buying it because is it's fantastic!!..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent package - Best for the money hands down!","review":"When I bought this I thought \\"50 bucks! No way, must be kid's stuff!\\" This is not kid's stuff. 8 tracks of near CD quality audio can be recorded, the effects that are provided (delay, chorus, flanger, EQ, pan and fade, etc)are very high quality. The drums are very decent - not perfect, but remember - this package costs fifty dollars! All x-plugins are compatible, and there are plenty available to expand the effects library. I was using this package constructively within hours of installing it. There are some features that are more challenging to master, but overall, this is package is user-friendly, bug-free, and fun. A great tool for song writers. I reccomend this strongly.-Serious Guitar Pete"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these \\"bonding\\" workouts with my baby - but had to get it outside of Amazon","review":"I got these DVDs after having my second child Joel, and only wish they'd been around for my first baby! You actually do the exercises with your baby -- (Joel loves the action) so with these videos I kill two birds with one stone - I get my workout, and for my baby it's \\"playtime with mommy\\" (and he's normally ready for a nap right after).*The only problem* was that Amazon never sends the DVDs (always out of stock??) - I ended up getting them directly from the infantastic website & they arrived in 3 days.I suggest starting with the lighter exercises for the first couple of weeks, then working up to the more challenging stuff. I generally alternate between the strength/toning DVD (Baby-Reps) & the cardio/dance DVD (Dance-Baby-Dance), depending on my mood. Dance Baby Dance is a little too long for me still, but I'll build up to it. Great stuff - I recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Infantastic! - best postpartum exercise videos I've found!","review":"I saw an article about these Infantastic DVD's in Parents Magazine, and now I have both \\"Baby-Reps\\" & \\"Dance-Baby-Dance\\" (I actually got them cheaper from the infantastic site when I got them for my friends later.) All I can say is *I LOVE THEM!*I've seen all kinds of pregnancy videos & postpartum videos -- I have somewhat of a collection now that I have four kids -- and these top them all hands down. The workouts are definitely challenging, & you can get a good workout from a bunch of videos -- but it's the \\"bonding with baby\\" aspect that is so awesome with these. It's one of our favorite things to do together -- great way to lose that baby fat & have a blast with your new addition!!They've got demo videos & lots more info on the infantastic site too. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never available - don't bother","review":"I had the same problem as everyone else in getting any of the Infantastic dvds from Amazon. I waited over two months, kept getting reassured that they were still coming, and then discovered one day that they had simply canceled my order without letting me know. Not only did no one ever offer to check with the company directly for the source of the problem or actual anticipated wait itme, but Amazon continues to post these items on their web site with a delivery date of 7-11 days, which is at best a misrepresentation, and at worst a complete lie because they are well aware that they can't provide the product at all at this point.I don't really care whose fault it is that the product is never available - Amazon needs to stop posting these dvds for purchase until they are confident the orders can be filled in the time noted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon does not really carry this item","review":"I agree with the reviewer below who asserts that this item is always on back-order.

I worked out 45 min to an hour, 5 days a week before becoming pregnant and found this video MUCH too easy. After reading the reviews, I thought it would be a good place to start. What really dissapointed me was the repetetive instruction for each exercise that you have to watch before performing the actual exercise. There should be an option to skip this part. The quiet, classical music leaves alot to be desired as well. In addition, your baby must be sitting up to perform the majority of the exercises. I used weights instead since my baby is too young for me to perform these exercises safely with him. Overall, I am very dissapointed in this video. It leaves alot to be desired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a fan","review":"I did not like this dvd one bit. To do the workout you have to repeat each segment the allotted number of times which is really a pain in the rear. I disliked this dvd so much I am turning around and selling it.

Where is the equal-sided journalism? What about the economic drain to healthcare, gang violence and drugs that these people bring into the United States?

I have continued to follow Wetton on his solo journey. I miss having a strong CD from beginning to end and was hoping ICON would be it. It is not but it is a start. The songs and lyrics are thoughtful and well produced but I also wanted them to let go a bit and have some fun. There are some tracks here that are some of their best but overall it doesn't stand up to their original '90s CDs as ASIA. This is just a teaser though.

It felt like being told how and what to feel about my generation. Well I think it should've been written in 1999 or 2000. I think the boomers were trying to be hip with this book but it was too obviously contrived. I threw it out a year later, I got it in '94. It had no foundation to theorize on what we did or do because we have been having an extended \\"growing up\\" peroid throughout the '90s and just now am I seeing us maturing in the late twenties and early thirties. Also, I believe there are two categories of Gen13ers, the X-ers and the Y-ers. The Y-ers are separate from the Millennial generation. The Fourth Turning is a better book than 13thGen by far.

I know this book is necessary, because when I started to tell a boomer friend of mine about it, she immediately, and without hesitation, tried to expropriate all the commentary as applying to herself. It will take many more books like this to get boomers out of self-absorption; that, or we'll have to wait until they're all dead or drooling.

McAfee customer chat support, could not answer the question. They included advertising text from their product description and forwarded it in their responses. It was the same stuff on the box the product came in. Then they said they would email additional information and call me. They did neither.

I kept adding milk to make it thinner, but it never would work.I thought, maybe it's my fault, let's try again. I tried using a banana, strawberry yogurt, orange marmalade, 1/2 cup crushed ice and used over a cup of milk. The machine wouldn't even chop the banana, let alone finish off the ice.

You leave the smoothie maker on it lowest setting while filling up glasses of perfectly mixed (whatever you just made).Another big plus is that this smoothie maker is very easy to clean.

Good humor (though it may not have been intended), a snappy biographee, and interesting and engaging writing. What more could I ask?

I thought it was another visceral Bush-bashing book. It turned out to be dispassionate and as a result powerfully persuasive.I have voted for Bush twice and would do so again. (O'Neil says the same in the book.) However, I am more skeptical of him.One of the most important (and I think ignored) themes of this book is what a \\"tough town\\" Washington D.C. is. D.C. is a tough town because of the ideologues Suskind exposes in the book---namely Bush, but also including Senator Robert Byrd (D-WV)--and the impossibility of working cooperatively and productively with their ilk. Left-wingers appreciate this book because it legitimately attacks Bush as an ideologue. It is Americans, however, who should love this book because it exposes ideological thinking as the modus operandi in D.C..

How many more people within this administration would like to co-opt the Constitution for their own greedy purposes? I've been immersed in political media lately and I'm starting to feel overwhelmed. I've read this book, House Of Bush House of Saud, watched a fantastic, unusual DVD called USA the Movie (you can get it at manticeye.com) which immersed me in the times we live in, watched Fog Of War (through Amazon) which made me depressed and now I obsessively peruse political websites.

It is vapid. Few details as to what was wrong w/ Bush jr. administration. Bush is described as being inattentive, not interested nor savvy on the details of macro economics nor foreign policy. But there is no subsequent critique of Bush's intellect; nothing to tell us whether Bush is actually ignorant or a savant. I understand O'neill might not saay \\"Bush was a dope\\" but he could have said he was an empty suit who rode into the WH in his dad's station wagon. Too many mundane entries like \\"so and so poured himself a cup of coffee or wine and looked out the window.\\" Who cares? With O'Neill's corporate background and intellect he could've tossed in some charts and statistics that would have made his cases for economic policies that were ignored by Bush who could not grasp such ideas. If you are gonna write a tell-all book then tell us something!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent insight into the Bush administration","review":"The book starts off a little slow but then digs into how the Bush administration really works from an inside perspective.Some of this is already well known, such as that it is Cheney that really runs the show and that Bush is not very engaged in issues.

That's what the three of us were kind of known for, for being non-ideological, for walking across political borders and looking for common ground.

I'm not going to write a 1000 page critique of this. The book is well written and gives someone the inside scoop of what is going on in the Bush administration AS HE SEES IT IN HIS OWN REALITY. If you are a Bush hater, this is a brilliant account of a diseased administration. Also, this man would be your hero. If you are a Bush lover, this is a deluded account of a man that was fired by this administration for incompetance and stupidity. He is a traitor and a classless fool to the Bush supporters. That is specifically why this book is more of a novel than fact. How do you know that his account is accurate. You don't. How do you know his account is a fantasy. You don't. I would read the book, and I'm glad I bought it, because it is an election year, and this book will be remembered as a part of the folklore of this country, but as far as using it as a benchmark for an historical record of this administration, this is better classified as a novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting story badly written","review":"Interesting story that supports a lot of the other descriptions of policy development (or lack of it) in the Bush White House. It is a shame that in order come to grips with the real story one has to try and get over the poor construction of the text.Within individual paragraphs he changes topics without notice - sometimes even within a single sentance - most confusing !I found that the author explains the simpler economic items in detail while skirting over the more complex ones with an explaination of it being \\"complex\\" - why not give the reader some credit for intelect and let the reader decide if it is complex.Some observations from 9/11 are impressive - if true, which I doubt such as that as the towers were collapsing, O'Neill knew immediately that it was Al Queada - better than even the CIA, FBI could do.The book has clearly suffered from a \\"rush to print\\" and has not been properly and carefully edited."},{"rating":"2","title":"Those dashes drive me crazy","review":"Though I think this is an important book and anybody in America who is planning to vote should read it, I want to address something else.Mr. Suskind has a profound love of the punctuation \\"dash\\" (--). My rough estimate is that he uses on average 2 pairs per page, and on some pages 4.5 pairs! They interupt the flow of the sentances and drive me crazy! So a suggestion to the author: if you want more people to get through your book, take your hands off those dashes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Much Ado About Nothing","review":"Paul O'Neill comes off as a disgruntled, fired ex-employee with an axe to grind. He has some less than flattering things to say about President Bush, but, as I recall, when he was fired by VP Cheney in 2002, the administration had a less than flattering opinion of Mr O'Neill.You might enjoy this book if you desperately believe that President Bush was planning the invasion of Iraq prior to 9/11 attacks and other assorted black helicopter conspiracy theories cooked up about Democrats since Bush since took office.It is interesting to note that the day after O'Neill's 60 Minutes interview about this book, he clarified and/or retracted a lot of what he said.Like I said in the begining, much ado about nothing. Save your money and buy a Beatles CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"I never thought of O'Niel as a fool","review":"Actually, just thought he was very ineffective at his job...untill I read this worthless tome.

It's pretty clear that President Bush is undergoing on-the-job training during a very dangerous, volatile time, and the men who are teaching/training him are really in control. Bush's key personnel have their own agenda and it's hard to tell how much Bush truly understands. He asked Paul O'Neill to come out of retirement to \\"serve the people\\" and two years later is asked to resign. Thankfully, O'Neill saved himself and left with his integrity intact. I don't know if the same will be said after Bush and his Administration's term has played out."},{"rating":"1","title":"O'Niel is a very bitter man","review":"Paul O'Niel is obviously a very bitter man. O'Niel was unqualified for his job and justifiably removed. His comments against Pres.

Interesting how a bitter man who was fired decides to reveal his insight in a book released on an election year. It simply seems like sensationalism to me, and I truly question the validity of his claims (anyone remember what former Reagan aide Regan did?).People have jumped all over this to slam Bush because it lends a bit of credibility to their attacks. However, it isn't a very credible piece of work at all. Paul O'Neill has been backtracking like crazy and he seems to be alone in his opinions.A bitter man who didn't agree with Bush writes a book full of sensationalism and the press jumps all over it. Big surprise."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Price of Loyalty:","review":"Another one of \\"those books\\" written \\"about\\" someone else's experience by an author trying to utilize political emotion to sucker the blind into sending him their money. No administration is perfect, but with this one I am not spending any of my time explaining what fellatio means to my 12-year-old daughter. Paul O'Neill has been very lucky and very fortunate over the course of his life. It is a pity that the old fool would sell his name to Ron Suskind because his feelings got hurt when he was fired.

A book he didn't even write (surprise), by the way. There are no witty clubhouse stories and nothing at all about girls or hotel rooms.

The book essentially vindicates all the opponents of our president by portraying him as a slow-witted individual who was intent on invading Iraq from the get go.

There is a lot of conjecture about what is really going on, not to mention that O'Neill's popularity as well as wealth is increased immensely by this book. Too much conflict of interest and too many liberals interesting in name-calling and badgering those who are decisive and offer real opportunities for solutions, when the liberals themselves don't have any real substantive opinions or solutions.

Who knows he could change the way the real world works to fit his foolish ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insider Exposes His Own Flaws","review":"Mr. O'Neill now wishes to distance himself from his own book. Suskind continues to say it is \\"our\\" book when we know he took the internal memoranda and fictionalized the situation to fit his needs to sell a book. Lawence Lindsay and others in Wall St Journal op-ed pieces have said the although Mr. O'Neill is a nice guy, he did NOT understand the vast DIFFERENCE between policy development and the ministerial functions of a department head.

He said it wasn't even really his book. I was shocked at how he could say one thing in one interview and then another a few days later. As far as I am concerned he and his book lost all credibility."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book is Worthless.","review":"After reading this book, I come away with the impression that Paul O'Neill is either simply trying to get back at President Bush for rightly firing him, or he is so naive that he should never have been Secretary of the Treasury at all. I have no sympathy for him.Either way, the book provides no support for any of the many serious (yet plainly unfounded) allegations against President Bush -- it's all the word of Paul O'Neill who, obviously, has an ax to grind. This from a guy who spent the majority of his time as Secretary of the Treasury flying around the Third world with Irish singer BONO? Please. O'Neill's a joke.Alcoa's gain was the country's loss. This book isn't worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting views by a Washington Insider and Successful CEO","review":"I will keep it short.

It's explanation of 'policy discussion' meetingswhere the decisions are already made and cabinet membershave 'lines to recite', portrays a White House that isseriously disfunctional and unable to debate and cometo terms with complex issues. It's no wonder that somany blunders were made leading up to the Iraq invasion andduring the bumbling occupation.

This book was hard to put down, I finished it within a couple days of receiving it. O'Neill is portrayed as a white knight, but hardly perfect.

I have the Rogers Sound Labs system, which is absolutely the best, however they no longer manufacture them. These Altecs are a reasonable substitute. When you hear them side-by-side with the RSL's they pale in comparison, but they're quite adequate in a small room or on a computer. For large rooms and ambient music, they are brassy and too directional. The sub-woofer is either non-existent or over-whelming despite adjusting the setting. For the price they're a great value, but I wish RSL was still making theirs."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is great","review":"Sound is very good, the controller with the volume knob and aux in port is very cool.

For that matter, a beginning student can use the program and pick up the difference too.

It is embodied with examples from life and literature, and gives a very good idea of Kants views regarding everyday life and behavior of normal people, and also of insane ones.

I appreciated getting the song words with the album. This is a truly excellent offering. It's my second Vonda album. Most songs are of the upbeat variety; not background music, but, rather, songs you want to sing along with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring Covers but The Few Originals Merit 2 Stars!,","review":"From the point of view that this album does indeed contain the tracks that come from the Ally McBeal TV series, this album doesn't disappoint, however, from the point of view that the covers are very inferior renditions of the original, this album makes for very boring listening indeed. If you are going to cover somebody else's work, you should either do it very differently or a lot better than the original. Vonda does neither here but to her credit, the first track which is an original, \\"Searchin' My Soul\\" is the best track on the album and is the sole redeeming factor overall. Get this only if you want a souvenir or a memento of what you liked about the tv series but not if you are looking for a great music album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't they know it's the end of the world....","review":"Why does the sun go on shining, why does the birds go on singing...

Even if you do not like the show you 'll love this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best T.V. soundtrack ever!","review":"I love this c.d.! Anyone who has watched Ally know what a big part the music plays in the telling of the story. When you listen to this c.d. you will remember different episodes clearly. \\"You belong to me\\" clearly brings to mind Billy and Ally dancing. \\"Tell Him\\" makes you think of everyone waiting on the street corner and of course \\"Hooked on a Feeling\\" though not the version featured in the show brings the famous dancing baby to mind. If you are a fan of Ally or just like good music I strongly suggest you buy this c.d."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vonda Shepard hooked me.","review":"Vonda Shepard hooked me exactly three minutes and twenty-six seconds into The Wildest Times in the World. Right there, after what I thought was the final chorus, where the song could just as easily end, it turns on a dime. Vonda sings \\"Hey, Hey, Hey,\\" the violin's come up, and the piece slides into a long and mellow finale. The hook went in deeper with each repeat. From an uncluttered opening the piece tumbles beautifully into a section that carries you along like a big car on the boulevard. It's not the limousine feel of Sinatra's Its Was A Very Good Year -- the one that happens when the viola's pluck their little half-notes. No, this is more precisely the feel of highway 395 coming into Lone Pine, CA in late August. Oh yeah, its sweet, but I'm telling you, there really ought to be a law -- once they are inside your head, you cannot get those Hey-Hey-Hey's out! Wildest Times is one fine tune."},{"rating":"2","title":"i think its great","review":"This cd is one that gets you bopping along to songs you know well, as well as ones you dont but might be familiar with.

I DON'T CARE FOR TOO MANY FEMALES SINGERS, BUT THIS ONE I LIKE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many re-makes of old songs.","review":"Although Vonda Shepard has a lovely voice and is a talented song writer, this album contains, too many remakes, of songs that aren't hers. I was disappointed as I was hoping to hear more of her own, brilliant tracks, as featured on Ally McBeal. The initial, 3 albums (on, a different record label) are much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you say Michael Bolton?","review":"Sorry, but it is time for someone to utter a discouraging word. The only value to this album comes from reminding us of what was, and sending us back to the old vinyl. Sometimes, immitation indeed is the sincerest form of flattery. Other times, it just should not be done. Like here.These songs were better the first time around. \\"Walk Away Renee\\", \\"Ask The Lonely\\", and most of the others recorded here just don't hold a candle to the originals. And only in the interest of historical accuracy, to gently correct another reviewer, \\"It's In His Kiss\\" was recorded by Betty Everett fifteen years before Cher did (you could look it up!)Like Manilow singing Sinatra, of the aforementioned Bolton singing Percy Sledge, some things should just not be done."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Waste Of Time And Money","review":"I've watched the show a few times so I thought I'd give the soundtrack a listen.

If you buy this cd, you should be pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shepard does not disappoint with this album.","review":"I have listened to this album several times and am struck by the fact that each llistening brings out something new. Vonda Shepard has an easily recognizable tonality in her voice which I think that anyone would have to embrace in order to enjoy an album of her music. That tonality and texture come through very strongly. Additionally, her redition of each song is unique in that she varies from some of the time-honored approaches to the music to give it her own special sound. If you find her music appealing in the TV series, this album is a \\"must buy\\" since it provides the essense of the singer without having to compete with the foreground drama to find its place."},{"rating":"2","title":"A CD worthy of the show!","review":"I'm so glad that they've finally produced a CD featuring the great songs from the show.

Though I loved it in general, there were a few things about it that I didn't like. Some of it was just too... sensual, I suppose. I was bothered by the presence of some of the things, even though they were portrayed in a negative light. Overall, however, this was a great book! I'll have to add it to my own shelf someday."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Idea but","review":"the follow through not so much. It is a Christian book which I don't mind because I got it as a freebie and most of the freebies are Christian fiction and I like them well enough. This one to me kind of drags and while the murder mystery is interesting you pretty much figure out who done it early on. The daughter got on my nerves with her incessant whining as did the other children in the main family and that also kind of guided my view of it. It is like everything that is ugly about humanity was highlighted in this book, including not caring about your fellow man, reverting to sterotypes, and self entitlement which I know is apart of human nature but not something I want constantly brought to my attention when I'm reading \\"fiction\\" to escape. I had to read another book in the middle just to cut the depression in half. All in all not too bad but I probably won't keep it on my Kindle and won't buy the rest of the series if I ever want to finish it (a library maybe)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blackstock will draw you in","review":"I am a reader, but rarely do I finish a book in only a few days. Blackstock's books are an exception. I finished this book in three days. My recommendation is do not start this book unless you have time to finish it.Blackstock draws the reader in as the characters cope with a worldwide catastrophic event. In normal Blackstock style, the reader experiences the suspense of the murder mystery while following a subtle romance.Blackstock is a Christian author and intertwines themes throughout the book. Yet, this book is written in such a way that I believe those who do not normally enjoy Christian writers would enjoy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful new series, already hooked!","review":"Just discovered this author and finished her Intervention series and decided to read more of her work. Starting with Last Light this promises to be a very interesting and promising series as well. I was literally hooked from the first few pages. I can be a little more patient, but I do love it when an author manages to reach out and grab me right away. The story line was very believable, as were the characters. Interwoven in their stories is their Christian faith which I really enjoyed. It had me asking myself, how would I behave in such troubling times as this? Its so easy when things are good, its when you are really tested that your faith can deepen or be allowed to fade out. My thanks to the author for writing books that are fun and entertaining, yet make me think, and have a positive message."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christian good, everyone else bad","review":"The premise of the story is interesting. All the power is gone and the community must learn how to cope and thrive learning about strength's they didn't know they had. Be prepared to be saved, women will learn to obey and of course all the characters that are bad are not Christians. The \\"roll your eyes\\" moments are many. After reading this and considering this really is the way religious people think, that frightened me more than the story. Oh and there is a difference between religion and Christianity. Only christianity is right, everyone else's wrong. I'm glad this was a library book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scared Me","review":"I have read most of Blackstock's books and have enjoyed them a great deal. I was very excited when this one came out and started reading it right away. Although the murder mystery part was not as captivating as some of her other novels, I was totally drawn into the Brannings \\"new\\" world. It scared me at times just thinking about what could happen and at other times I wondered if that's not what we need to have happen. I loved the book and can't wait for the next one to come out."},{"rating":"2","title":"You keep wondering","review":"There are so many books about the end of days. While reading Last Night you keep wondering what it would be like living without engines, electricity, running water and especially without communication. No news, no internet, no TV, no radio. There are disaster issues from the government in our country that warn us to keep food and water for four days in our homes. But what about day 5... I keep thinking that in our western society the consequences of a disaster like this are underestimated in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thought provoking book","review":"This book will leave you examining what's important in life. I found myself wondering what our family would do in such a situation. It is humbling to think the Lord is in control of it all and we're to seek and do His will. There was a brief mention of 9/11/01. I felt it was tasteful and appropriate. It happened such a few short years ago and is part of our history. Let us not forget that tragedy while we let our mind wander and wonder: Could something really cause a power outage over the entire earth? How would we survive?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This series is EXCELLENT. It really makes you think. Right from the start it gets your attention.

I'm not sure why this author is rated so highly. I couldn't get through the first five chapters.

It really is based on an interesting premise. But it took me no time at all to tire of the whining children. Then it became clear that the only smart people in the family were male, and they were going to have protect the really shallow women.I don't have a big problem with Christian literature. Some of it can be uplifting - I loved the Mitford series and it helped me through the toughest part of my life to date.

It reads easily enough (the only reason I give it 2 stars instead of 1), but otherwise neither the character development nor dialogue are especially realistic.It should be advertised as more of a \\"Christian\\" book than what it is, as the reader is in for plenty of proselytizing.I'm glad it was free on Kindle, otherwise I would have wasted not only my time but also my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tried to read it","review":"I really wanted to like this book and have read Blackstock in the past. The audio is probably worse than the book itself. The man's voice is hard to listen to...esp. when he is voicing a woman...the constant whining by the children got on my nerves SO bad, I had to abandon it. Then you throw in a whole strange murder etc. and this book is too weird for me...one flub they made was when the flashlights worked...how is it possible when watches, cars, and all other batteries are dead? Good luck to others who may want to explore this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"trying too hard","review":"The book catches quickly and you keep reading. The issue is that there are long, long long sermons in the book. I found myself skimming through them to get back to the main plot of the book. There is a good story behind it, but all the fundamental christian preach seems too strong for my taste, and characterizes every non-christian or any person that touches alcohol as \\"bad guys\\". The problem is, you still want to find out how it all ends - so you're stuck with the book in spite of the constant biblical references. If you're not up for that, then I suggest to not even start reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Last Light","review":"I guess I should have read these reviews before I bought this book. I really enjoyed the book UNTIL she got into the religious Christian preaching. I am not Christian and really don't like it pushed down my throat. I read for entertainment and relaxation. This book would have been great and gotten a 5 star if she had kept religious beliefs out of it. The story line was good and something that people could relate to in this crazy world and it could have really worked just as well, if not better if it she kept the Christian preachings generic referring to god instead of Jesus. I guess this will be the first AND last Terri Blackstock book I read.

My son was 2 1/2 at the time. Worked great with the car seat I already owned. My son liked to sit on the back seat or stand. My 2nd son was born in 2010. Still using the stroller. Both older siblings manage to sit on the back seat.My only concerns:1) The back seat belt broke quickly. My husband repaired but we hardly use it now.2) One strap on the storage area broke within a few months. I have learned to live with it.3) The worst feature: It took months for the front seat harness to fit my daughter. It did not tighten to a low enough setting and she managed to get out quickly.I recommend this product mainly for it's ease of use with more than 2 kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stroller barely reclines","review":"This stroller is a great concept, for short outings. The only problem is the front seat reclines very little, there are only 2 positions. My 10 month old falls asleep, and his head rolls down into his shoulder, wakes up and ends up taking a very short nap. I still need a full size, comfy, fully reclining stroller. I should have bought one high end stroller instead of now 2 mid priced ones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty terrific","review":"There's a little bit too much minor stuff on this cd (you'd wish they could cull the best of this and \\"Songs of the Key of Simpson\\"), but the best of what's here is fantastic. If you have any doubt as to Alf Clausen's amazing talents, just listen to the astonishing underscoring for the \\"Gabbo\\" theme song--the orchestral coloring is absolutely brilliant, and (like the puppet itself) the music is simultaneously \\"fabbo\\" and irritating in a hilarious fashion. The best stuff is in the \\"Shari Bobbins\\" parody, but there are many other delights as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is more like it!","review":"Forget the disastrous \\"Yellow Album\\" and \\"Simpsons Sing the Blues.\\" This is the album we've been waiting for! \\"We Put the Spring in Springfield,\\" \\"The Love-Matic Grampa,\\" \\"Everyone Loves Ned Flanders\\"...

It is every bit as good as \\"Songs\\". The standout this go round is the brilliant \\"Sherry Bobbins\\" parody of \\"Mary Poppins\\", with all songs complete and intact, even the closing montage!

While \\"Songs in the key of Springfield\\" has many of the classics from the show, \\"Go Simpsonic\\" has more songs, 53 in all compared to \\"Songs in the key of Springfield's\\" 39. The best are the Shary Boppin's collection, Checkin' In, The Garbage man (Both versions) and The Land of Chocolate. If had to choose my favorite song on the track, that would difficult because they are all good (Though Checkin' In is probably just a bit better than the other's I listed).

With a total of 53 songs such as \\"Gonna Paint That Wagon\\", the Sherry Boppins collection, \\"We're Gonna Move Underwater\\" and other great hits! This song will keep you laughing for hours. So please I recommend that you buy this CD. Well, hope you enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Go Simpsonic Does Not Disapoint","review":"This CD lives up to the hype, and comes very close to equaling it's predescessor \\"Songs In The Key...\\" My only complaint is that in the songs on here, in some cases, are too short, like they just took some little thing out of the background and stuck it in. However, Rappin' Ronnie Reagan makes up for anything bad this CD could have on it!

Of course, that's why I bought it. The benefit is hearing them again on the go, and with crisp CD quality rather than one's old raspy TV speakers. Mmmmmm.Why the CD doesn't grab the full five stars is that the audio panning for the character voices is very annoying for headphone use. Furthermore, the panning was done poorly, as one character's final words may switch channels as another character begins to speaks. This only affects dialogue and not the singing, but I would have preferred no panning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Props to Alf Clausen!","review":"Somebody needs to speak up and give props to Alf Clausen, the music genius behind much of the music on this album.

Superb work!"},{"rating":"2","title":"As Mr.Burns would say, 'Excellent'","review":"The music plays a big part in the series as do the characters and such. GO SIMPSONIC WITH THE SIMPSONS is loaded with a heap of wonderful songs, and some funny tracks such as the ' Mr. Plow 'jingle, and ' Rappin' Ronnie Regan '.I'm impressed with the wide selection that this CD has to offer to anyone, a megafan of the show.Some personal faveroites of mine would be:'The Simpsons' End Credits Theme, by Sonic YouthWe Put The Spring in SpringfieldHappy Birthday Mr. Burns by the RamonesTrash Of The Titans: Before The Garbage, Man!Senor Burns (Extended Version) by Tito Puente & His Latin Jazz EnsembleAnd the Union Strike Song."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must-Have for Any Simpson Fan!","review":"My brother bought me this CD a while back, and as of today, I still can't stop singing along to it.

If you're a die-hard Simpson fan, this album is a must!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"I shall send you to Heaven before I send you to Hell!\\"","review":"This Simpsons CD is truly a delight, with comically memorable songs such as \\"Happy Birthday, Mr. Smithers\\", \\"Talkin Softball\\", \\"The Simpsons Spin-Off Showcase\\", and much, much more. And, of course, the album would not be complete without Sideshow Bob's classic rendition of the HMS Pinafore. Kelsey Grammer has got a beautiful singing voice, and I agree with another reviewer that hopefully they'll release another album with Sideshow Bob's version of \\"Somethin' Stupid\\" by Frank Sinatra. All of Sideshow Bob's are great. Another one of his songs that should be released is \\"I've Grown Accustomed to his Face\\", a song that was in the latest Sideshow Bob episode where he attempted to [destroy] Bart again but couldn't. This album is truly an EXCELLENT gift for avid Simpsons fans. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Procrastinator's Guide Review","review":"This book has many good ideas but it is not well organized for procrastinator's. The content deals more with how to be successful at work than dealing with procrastination. Even then, there is a lack of cohesiveness.

Serves as a pep talk for dealing with different work problems.Found other books more effective and better organized."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"If you are a true procrastinator, don't waste your time by reading this book. While the author has good suggestions for those who have trouble making decisions, she fails miserably at helping those who know what to do and simply can't take action. If suggestions such as \\"start sooner\\" is what you're looking for, then this is the book for you. If you'd be motivated by calling yourself a \\"smart little snuffle-bunny,\\" as the author suggests, then this is the book for you! However, if you are over the age of 10 and don't appreciate being patronized, I would not suggest wasting your time and money. After I read the book, I was so distraught that I had wasted 10 hours of my time that I could never get back.

Lynn Lively writes in a no-nonsense manner, not in that typical technical jargon that tends to bore readers. Right off the bat she has you ask yourself the \\"Key Question\\" (see page 5). And once you answer that question, you're on your way to non-procrastinating success. Lynn offers real-life examples and wonderful encouragement/motivation on each and every page.

It thinks my HP CD-Writer is not installed, when I've been happily burning CD's with Roxio software. Periodically its icons get all mixed up. Sometimes you cannot navigate through disks as you try to save. It takes too long to start up, because of some obscure check on the audio devices. But to give them credit, they have integrated their functions fairly well, and if I could have burned the playlist to a CD, I wouldn't be here writing this. But I couldn't, and so I have to recommend to all that you avoid these Cakewalk developers, who are slapping together things to force feed the market and then lollygagging when it comes to patches that will allow us to actually use the thing. Maybe Roxio, or someone else, but not Cakewalk! I am THROUGH with this company!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Music Compilation Program","review":"Cakewalk Pyro was the first burning software I bought. I purchased it because I knew the reputation of the Cakewalk name. Pyro is a very good music compilation program. It has a very intuitive interface, a good help system, and it works quickly and easily with sound files - especially those recorded from other sources. The only downside - and a difficult one to figure out considering that it is a program specifically designed for music CD's - is that it does not provide enough filters by which you can clean up your recordings. They insist that hundreds of plug-ins are available for download, but many of the plug-ins are not free and do not work. Other than that, it is very flexible, quick and easy to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont buy this!!!","review":"Mere words can not express my frustration with this product....to make a very long and painful story short I eventually deleted my hard drive just to get this program to work and.....you guessed it-- it still didn't work!!

Well, I have a good Dell computer with 384-MB of RAM, so I figured my power machine could conquer anything. Was I wrong. This software gave me several \\"Out of Memory\\" errors, an error message I've never encountered. So I figured I'd go to Cakewalk's Web site for help, and I got the same memory error. I then clicked on the \\"My Computer\\" icon to try and troubleshoot, and sure enough, I got the same memory error.My only solace is I used my time-traveling software (it can restore your computer to a previous date and time) to restore my computer before I installed this piece of junk, and all is well.Save yourself a tremendous headache, avoid this thing like the plague."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"I don't know if it's just me, but this program takes, what seems like eons, to read a song off a CD and convert it to an MP3.

I haven't done a lot of ripping in my lifetime, but I can swear that I've used other programs (like MS Mediaplayer) that took nowhere near as long as this one does to read a song and convert it. On top of that, this program demands like 100% of my CPU in the process of doing all this. Anytime I was ripping music, it was next to impossible to do anything else because this program was using all my CPU.

At first, I was somewhat impressed with the first workout/song, but then quickly realized the rest of the workouts were just slightly different versions of each other. It's basically dancing while holding your baby. If you know how to dance, and know how to hold your baby, then you don't need this DVD. The host gives instructions on how to do the steps before each workout, but doesn't mention if and how the steps help to isolate certain areas, improve strength, nothing. I felt like I was watching a kids' dancing instructor. In addition, the music was dull.

His harmonies are to die for, and each song has a very memorable hook. I give 4 stars because some songs aren't quite as strong as others. That being said, I don't dislike anything about this album.

His error and sin have been made whole, they have become the garments by which he understood his nakedness.He has seen the same world made new. Here, even the shadows are golden.The Union has been made in him. He has spanned the abyss. He has stood in the presence of Angels. He has proved the Divine. He has witnessed. And he serves the whole with his testimony.His writing is accessible to everyone, all will benefit from it. Yet only a sweet few will cry tears of joy and affirmation. For our memories, this friendship will last forever.To anyone interested in the miracle of being, I recommend this text. Don't waste time drinking from other men's buckets. Kook offers up the source.

The tent is held in shape by the two long rods that you can see bent across the top in the picture. They are under tremendous tension, and two days later, sure enough, one of them spontaneously snapped in half.JB Wholesale customer service is amazing; I called and they had the manufacturer send out two replacement poles the next day. However they're made of the same material and will be under the same tension, so I doubt they will last -- we'll see. But if you are considering this product, I suggest you get the Large tent instead -- because of the larger radius the tension on the poles will be much less."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak Poles","review":"The tent appears to be well made, but the poles are very weak, and with minimal pressure snapped during the first assembly.

Secondly, there's the handsome compassionate doctor who is from the opposite side of the tracks and has a hard time imagining merging his life with the heroine's.

All gamers and anybody who has played at least 1 movie game and 1 REAL game knows movie games have the worst graphics, gameplay, and game length.Overall: On the launch I would suggest getting 1st party games or some decent games like madden or COD3. Leave the cruddy 3rd party games(movie and tv games)alone. They will just waste time and money. Nobody likes them, and little kids that think they will like them will hate them or beat them in a matter of time.P.S.

In Deep Blue, Wilson creates imagery that is both original, and at the same time reminiscent of Manly Wade Wellman. Deep Blue contains passages that will take you, the reader, out of yourself and into a world you will be glad to return from in one piece. David Wilson weaves a tapestry of music, suspense, and horror that grips the reader and pulls them along for a great ride. This has been my favorite David N. Wilson work yet. This book is a must read for Wilson's established fan base, and a great first time read for those unfamiliar with his work. Bravo !

I figured that it probably just needed to be aired out, but after a week the smell is still just too strong. I tried to send this back but you must pay for your own shipping (both ways) and it would've cost me more to send it back (around 10 in shipping and another 14 to send it back) than would have been worth the bag.

I got it for my weekly soccer matches and it does the job. The shoes compartment is a great feature. It's roomy enough to accommodate not only my soccer cleats but also my sweaty t-shirt and shorts (i put them in a plastic bag). So all the smelly stuff goes to the shoe compartment and the rest is nice and fresh inside the bag. I love it. It has the right size for easy carrying around without being too tight on space.

I am very satisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gets the basic job done but not what I expected","review":"The bag is a good size and I like that the shoe compartment is separate from the rest. However, it cannot keep it's shape. The shoes stick up, almost out of the bag, and the other end of the bag pulls up, so the whole thing becomes pretty much a wide-opened V shape.

I bought it when I purchased the 60mm micro lens but I've found myself using it with my 18-200mm as well.Like another user, the only real fault I can find is that it could be made a bit sturdier (or priced cheaper), and the refocusing between 1x and 2x is a slight annoyance especially if your subject isn't cooperating by sitting still. Minor issue though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Viewfinder","review":"I wish that I had purchased the DR-6 years ago. It is great for macro shots, low shots, high shots and photos of pets and kids on their own level. It eliminated the need to bend way down to shoot plants or insects or to stoop to shoot mid height objects. It is also great for shooting high shots without bending backwards. The 2X adjustment allows you to focus with a greater degree of accuracy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nikon DR-6 Viewfinder/focuser","review":"I use this with both my D300 and D3100.

I have an 18 month old son and my knees and back were taking a beating getting up and down constantly trying to keep up with his fast movements and photograph him down at his height. This solves the problem and works great. I note some other reviews complaining that it does not lock on the camera.

Optical and mechanical performance are definitively first rate; providing more convenient viewing angle AND the advantage of the 2x magnification toggle that makes critical focus significantly easier. My 23 inch, 5 pound manual Soligor made the DR-6 an attractive accessory, but I use this viewer frequently when I shoot. It's excellent.Coordination of the camera's diopter adjustment with the DR-6 customized adjustor (the eyepiece turns to perfect the sharpness of your view) requires some getting used to, and the top half swivels 90 left or right parallel to the sensor plane for portrait orientation, as/if you so desire.The only shortcoming of this device is in its documentation which is perfectly supplemented by direct experience and the kindness of strangers in the internet. I couldn't be more pleased with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, not perfect","review":"This is a valuable tool, worthy of 5 stars with the usual caveats: slightly loose fit on the D200's eyepiece (a little black tape helps), the need to refocus at 2x and the current price (up 40-$50 from 2008).The DR-6 is very sharp & free from distortion -- sharp enough to show the tiny black feeds from the AF sensors seen even at 1x. It's great for landscapes, macros & manual focusing (all the better to make use of the deep pool of used MF Nikkors). Rotation is more useful than I thought at first. Another benefit I didn't expect is shooting into the sun. It's far easier to get a good view and relax one's eye muscles with a right-angle finder than the camera's own eyepiece. Sometimes the DR-6 goes on my camera for one shot then stays on most of the day. The good-quality belt pouch included is another plus."},{"rating":"1","title":"failed after 3 days","review":"bought this and a C7005 for two different cars- both worked fine for about 3 days, then both quit.

I bought a copy when it was first released. We listened to it everyday driving all over! A lover of music (all kinds!) all of my life, I grew up listening to everything and so did my children. We sang ourselves silly! Chicken Lips was a favorite!! What a great way to spend time together, singing, having fun and generally just getting along. No time for fighting, squabbling and bickering in the car when they're singing! Our original copy bit the dust, we listened it to sooo often. Now my children are 17 and 13!

We still listen to everything and this will bring back great memories, I'm sure of it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A few good songs and a lot of mush","review":"The songs by Ziggy Marley, Dylan, Little Richard, and Springsteen are inspired, but most of the rest are tedious or downright sappy.

I bought this book because it was described as a \\"Memoir,\\" but it should be classified as an Essay instead. She spends plenty of time discussing her views on life, but none describing the colorful characters she has met and worked with, or the personal experiences that led to her political views.

I see it in my own grandmother's attitude toward my mother: a bitterness bordering on rage. How dare my mother pursue a successful career outside the home? I have not suffered because of it. Children have only to gain from the success of mothers outside the home, for it only increases their respect for their mothers in this increasingly economically-driven society to see the mom contribute tangibly to the economic life of the family. (This, of course, is not to say that the mothers who do stay home do not contribute economically to their families; rather, they support in intangible ways.)It makes me sad to see the complete internalization of subjugation by Ms. Decter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!","review":"I enjoyed the first book in this series, but this book was just stupid.

I wonder if the publishers of this book packed up this web-site with false, positive comments to promote better sale...The book is useful, if you understand it. The author does not do a good job of explaining his code.It takes some time to understand the code fully and properly. I found the book to be thought-provoking and useful. Following the examples, there is much to think about and understand. The best chapter is Chapter 3, on C++ Com. If you read nothing else, but read this chapter slowly and understand it fully, you will gain much benefit from understanding COM. A tutor, for me, was essential. But reading the book allowed me to know what questions to ask.(...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"The great book that I am looking for.","review":"Should be a required reading for almost ATL programmers.I love the way that author uses to write this book.

I don't like plain old water, but juice is a little bit much. I like my water to have just a splash of flavor in it, but everything calorie-free uses some sort of preservative with a funky taste or they use excess sodium as a preservative.The reviews for this product were very good and it seemed like a better bargain than the Hint Water. When I opened the bottle, it smelled delicious - just like a fresh peach. The taste of it - not so much. It almost tasted carbonated from all the sodium they used to preserve it.

There are tracks that sound like Dylan ballads but are topped off with loud, rumbling rhtyhm guitar. I suppose he's a risk taker.That said, I just can't help feeling that the potential is only realised in a few tracks, like the sentimental 'One more dance' or the poetic, beautiful 'Get out' and 'Ride'.

He had over come a lot of problems to archive his passion to wealth. Best of all is the chapter about when to walk away, when to fold in a game. I recommend this book for the people apporching retirement, since there are many elderly suffered from retirement and have a hard time adjusting life outside of work.Sometimes in our lives, we create something out of passion, it maybe wealth, it maybe fame or object. We could get too attached from all of these. We need to have control over our lives, and learn when to give freedom to people, objects, business entities. The wonderful lesson of this book is to have trust on people and things around. When you trust, and set things free, freedom comes back to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding, and really funny","review":"Read it! This book was funny and educational. Plus, it sends the message that life success comes to people even when scholastic success passes them by, which is a very important message to get to people with \\"learning differences\\"(we still need to think of a better buzz word for that) who are obligated to spend 13+ years of the beginning of their in school with almost no one telling them they are going to get far in life. Paul Orfalea's story reveals his biggest failures, and his biggest successes. It has a lot of great advice, opinions that (thankfully) differ from the mainstream, and really great humor. And a truly needed and outstanding message."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done example","review":"I love reading well written works by successful business people, especially those who are dyslexic.

His motifs are inserted with the grace of a brontosaurus using its tail to perform an eye exam. There are so many things wrong with this book that I kept checking the author's bio at the back, trying to see if maybe I had made a mistake and picked up one of those books by a 10-year-old amateur that some publishing companies put out for laughs.Ok, I think I've made myself clear.Bones?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pitiful book in a stunning collection.","review":"This book convinced me to never read Mr. Brust's work. As a collector of Fairy tales and an avid fan of this particular Fairy tale series I bought this in hardback when it was first printed.As of this date it is the ONLY book in the series I have never finished. I found it trite boring and having little to do with the fairy tale it was supposed to mirror. The main character was so insulting and unsypathetic that I just couldn't finish it.It is truly a pity the a marvelous series as this should have this dud listed in its collection but as it is, so far, the only bad book of the bunch I count myself lucky!Read the other fairy tale series books and forget this one, it doesn't have half the imagination, skill or creativity of the other books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Dietary Advice for those with PCOS","review":"This is a great book! As a vegetarian, I love the fact that she gives vegan/vegetarian options for protein. Do not be discouraged by the rating on this book that complained about the foods listed. I recognized nearly every food listed. It does not list just aubergine as one person that rated this book said. It actually says \\"Tomato with Eggplant (Aubergine)\\" So I don't know why this was even brought up. I have seen all of the foods in question listed (most at my local grocery store, some like Quorn at my local health food store). I own many cookbooks, so I do not have a problem converting measurements. I just convert them once and write them in the cookbook.

The premise is to cut back on sugar and eat more veggies and drink more water. Now, really do we need to pay $21 to know this?

It has many shortfalls, including the metric and food issues mentioned in other reviews. After trying this despite its shortcommings, I moved on. I would recommend the Foundation Diet.

Once again he is assisted by fellow songwriters Jim Lauderdale and his wife Julie. He starts off with a raging country-rocker \\"Does My Ring Burn Your Finger\\", in which he peels off some stinging guitar leads. Over the course of the disc, Buddy moves from pure traditionalist country, to Memphis soul, to achingly beautiful ballads. The closing tune is a Pops Staples song done in a swampy, John Fogerty style. This disc, coupled with wife Julie's \\"Broken Things\\" released a couple of months ago, proves that the Miller family are making the most exciting music in Nashville right now. An excellent, excellent album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, functional lamp","review":"This lamp has a solid, heavy base.

He has been playing it constantly and he's seems happy with it so I'm pretty pleased. I appreciate it arriving before the estimated delivery time, that had me a bit nervous, but all good. It was in great condition as well. I recommend for kids above 7."},{"rating":"1","title":"Need For Speed? Two steps backward","review":"I finished the game a mere 8 hours after purchasing it. May be more fun online but the storyline part of the game is way to short. And it seems as the higher you get the worse your car's handling becomes. Blacklist was ten times better and Underground 2 was 5 times better. There are a decent amount of cars and customization but the gameplay is really lost in this one. The idea for Carbon Canyon was good but I find that there are certain aspects of the canyon that are just stupid. If you skip a race and come back to it later they still have the same car and if you are driving a Lamborghini you can not overtake them. And they never crash off the cliff and you cannot make them crash. When playing in co op mode half the time in the upper levels my team-mates cost me races by stopping in front of me or by taking short cuts that get me hit by other cars or the short cut slows me down. The game is only 10% of what it should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Game Received","review":"The case to the game was empty upon opening.

The story mode isn't too challenging (which I think is good, others may disagree), but in addition to beating the story mode, there's so much more to do. There are challenge races, various achievements to unlock better cars, and you can play online. With all of these features, this game is impossible to get tired of. After owning it for years, I still regularly go on and try to beat some tough challenges or level up online. Sometimes I play just to customize cars. This game has great customization that has been lost in the newer games. Fantastic game, you should definitely buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good game","review":"I've played all the NFS games and this one is ok. I liked Most wanted better but I don't regret purchasing Carbon, I really miss the intricate tuning of NFSU2. I like the team concept applied. Buy this game if you like the NFSU2, Most Wanted.

The Root-Bernsteins present thirteen characteristics of what they view as genius. With each chapter they list examples from art, literature, and a variety of other disciplines. I have never encountered references to Sir Arthur Conan Doyle and Bruno Schulz within two pages of each other. The book lacks enthusiasm. Someone like Desmond Morris or Steven Pinker could of made this material really compelling. Still this book is more insightful than one that encourages someone to visualize certain object to make you an Einstein."},{"rating":"1","title":"The little book that couldn't","review":"This book relies on an inherently flawed assumption: that one can say what artistic genius, or even scientific genius really means. Do they have some \\"genius-meter\\" that they hooked up to these people to test their \\"genius-tudaneity?\\" I think not. If this is the case, how can they possibly have a cogent discussion about what makes for a \\"better\\" or \\"worse\\" genius? At best, this book makes a nice coaster, and at its worst, it is a monument to how far an intellectual sham can be prolonged until a little boy in the crowd states, \\"the emperor has no clothes.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing and shallow","review":"I found the book to be shallow and mundane.

I keep wondering why they do not cite this work and vice versa. Other reviewers have listed the 13 types of thought presented. So, we have a chapter on a type of thought--what do we put in the chapter about the type of thought? It turns out we put lots and lots of examples of that type of thought being done by creative people of various sorts--scientists, artists, social leaders, and a few others. So we get a name of a type of thought and a paragraph explaining what it is followed by zillions of examples. This would in my mind make a nice 20 page book. At 200plus pages it is a bit of a windbag book. The earlier Root-Bernstein book, Discovery, was much more densely written with good ideas on every one or two pages. That was a really good deal--this follow up is a bit, frothy for my taste. I like meat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"Bought this and returned it the next day.

I used it over 2 seasons a total of 45 minutes and the hose has already failed near the coupler. It gets stiff when the outside air temp is below 40 deg. It should be made like a hydraulic hose but instead is more like a cheap pvc hose.I paid about $50 for this setup.

This is not an exaggeration. When I got the the end of disk 8, I went to the box to get the next one...and there wasn't one. It just...stops. Right before the Big Climax.Unacceptable!Seriously, this is like going to a movie and having the last reel missing. You can't win either way--either you like the series, in which case you'll feel robbed by the \\"ending,\\" or it's not something you'll like, in which case why buy it?So I recommend you save your money until the alleged next series comes out to complete the story.

Is a birthday party all about the presents? I just don't see why the story needed to include this 'complication'. Later, Emily Elizabeth puts on a big smile for the person who gives Clifford a gift certificate for the doggy salon, as she passes it on to someone else. I understand re-gifting is a reality for most people (incl our family) but I'm not crazy by the fakeness of EE's gesture here.Maybe these things would be good talking points to go through with older children as you read the book, but we're far away from that cognitively, so I'll just have to keep making up my own story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too inexpensive, wrong specs","review":"This is not the MSA7020TB which extends to 48 inches.

The chances of either the owner or the dog doing something (stopping, slowing, turning, accelerating, etc...) that is unexpected to the other one, and thus causing an accident, is far too high. A dog that no longer wants to run or needs to relieve itself will attempt to stop and depending on the size and weight of the dog and of the rider, the result will be either the dog gets pulled off its feet and scraped along on its chin and shins or else the dog causes such a slowdown that it may dump a smaller rider over the handlebars.

The author is from New Zealand where the sailing lingo is quite different from here in the US. So much so that I felt it would completely confuse a beginning sailor rather than facilitate his understanding. The video was more of a commercial for her film's sponsors and a pitch to come to her sailing school than a teaching aid. The only bright spot was that the photography was well done.

Tons is helicopter shot so you can see the entire ride down the mountain. Also there is some sweet helmet cam angles on a couple stunts just to give you an idea what it looks like from the riders perspective.

Within a few weeks of our first viewing we started doing advanced MTB techniques to prepare for our next Moab trip and we've been intermediates.

Great book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A terrible book for someone who needs real healing","review":"The very premise of this book is terrible. Women are told over and over how they should feel and judged as unchristian if they don't. I am a lay counselor with over 35 years experience, most with women who have been sexually molested. This book denies women the right to feel, the right to need, the right to have emotions. They are specifically told that normal desires from their husbands are sinful. It is FULL of shame. For the hurting, wounded woman who knows only performance, it is a cruel handbook indeed. There are more shoulds and shouldn'ts in this book than any I have seen. So they think, \\"if only I do one more thing he'll accept me.\\" Just like dad. This book is bondage...Christ is freedom!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I really disliked this book","review":"I really did not like this book at all. Because God made so many varied individuals and so many differing personalities, I am untrustworthy of any book that seeks to place an overemphasis on the behavioral role of women in marriage. We are all responsible to obey God and follow the Word, but for goodness sakes, there is no ONE mandated and rigid Christian formula for marriage. If you are type that firmly believes that the responsibility solely lies in your hands to \\"submit\\" to your husband...while totally ignoring the previous passage of how he needs to love you like Christ loves the church, I'm sure you will love this book.

The unit has a larger \\"footprint\\" than other units but I had no problem adapting to it. I found the operating instructions easy & food quality is consistently good.

It holds up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mom's Best Friend","review":"I received this steamer for Christmas last year. My son was 6 months old at the time. I started steaming food for him that I could make into baby food. Now I use the steamer 2-3 times per week for the whole family. It is so easy to throw vegetables in one side and potatoes in the other and start the timer. I don't have to wait for water to boil or over cook things while I chase my toddler. I only saw one other steamer that cooks two items side by side and it did not compare to this steamer.I have never used another steamer and this one is pricey, but the corn on the cob, broccoli, and lobster made in this steamer is the best I have ever tasted!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Product","review":"This product was horrible.

On the DVD however, it has been encoded using 1.33:1, the tasteless TV format with only 2 sound channels. I did not read the technical details before i bought it. I think you should read the details. It is like watching a movie with good VHS resolution. nothing more! What have North Americans done to deserve censored DVD versions of European movies. They pay the same price and it is not for public use. Any DVD without 5.1 channel or DTS sound and without anamorphic widescreen dimensions i.e 2.25:1 should be avoided. The stunning beauty of young Sharon Stone makes up for these technical goofs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly awful remake of great classic","review":"Blood and Sand was made twice before, in 1922 with Rudolph Valentino and 1941 with Tyrone Power. The first version was good but not excellent, but Tyrone's version was, mostly due to the lavish Technicolor and the excellent supporting cast. But this 1989 remake is absolutely ridiculous; it shouldn't have been made to begin with. None of the stars can save the plot, which is marred a thin, convoluted plot. So if you want to see this bullfighting story, do NOT get this version. Instead get the 1941 version with Tyrone Power, Linda Darnell and Rita Hayworth. You will not be disappointed. Trust me."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOTAL WASTE OF TIME AND MONEY!!!","review":"I bought this film in anticipation of seeing the beautiful Sharon Stone in some really hot scenes....on this count it was a letdown, you don't see much of the gorgeous Ms Stone, certainly nothing like in Basic Instinct/Sliver/The Specialist.I was also expecting a brilliant storyline like the 1941 version with Tyrone Power,the alluring Rita Hayworth and Linda Darnell...again another terrible disappointment. Really dull plot, totally disjointed and bordering on the incoherent.Finally..the quality of the picture was poor with blurred colour and almost hazy images.

My son couldn't use the pinball shooter because it detached from the main part of the toy before every shot. The plastic belt that runs the big ball mover wheel always comes off, and other pieces have fallen off frequently.

With the Echo Celeste I was expecting something like that but I was utterly disappointed. The sound is ok but it sits really uncomfortably in the mouth and the keyholes are too small as well so if you are playing single blow and draw notes you have to be really careful not to play the wrong note.

It also details the whole family screaming at the dog to \\"SHUT UP\\". This is a terrible kids book. Why would anyone encourage kids to scream \\"shut up\\" at anything? No wonder why kids are so fresh these days! I would not recommend this book if you do not want these themes being presented to your children. Reading should be fun and educational, not scary and sarcastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"My students love this book!","review":"This book is always a favorite read-aloud for my third grade class. I read the \\"balloon\\" comments really quickly, and my students laugh out loud! The book lends itself for teaching comprehension skills such as cause and effect and problem/solution. I had to order a new one because my old one was worn out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweeping, passionate romance","review":"In My Heart is one of the most wonderful books I have ever read. It reminds me of early Kathleen Woodiwiss novels. I was taken away to another place and time. I could feel the soot of London, see the displays in the museum, and could feel the tension and passion of Alex and Christopher from the moment they meet again, after a decade of separation and heartbreak. The hero and heroine have to let go of their pasts in order to find happiness in the future. I can't wait for the next book in the series to be published!"},{"rating":"2","title":"In My Heart (Donally Family)","review":"Beautifull Story!I started this book in the afternoon and continued through the night. I couldn't put it down. The author draws the reader into the story. You feel the heartache Alexanda feels, how domineering her father is but I truely believe he loved his daughter. You feel what Christopher feels as he tries to fight his feelings for her. The pain of the two major characters is felt. Throughout the story you keep wondering who the person is that is stealing the jewels. I never thought it would turn out to be Professor Atler and her uncle at that. Like many readers I hated the story had to end but I would have liked something more in the ending. Yes, they marry but maybe down the road she does have children. Her father and them make amends. Anyway loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Marika, The Best Tragedy Since Shakespeare","review":"This tear- tearing novel by Andrea Cheng depicts the difficult life of a Jewish teenager in Nazi Budapest. This book, written in first person, is a fantastic work of writing for ages 8 & up, though not recommended for younger or beginner readers. This wonderful piece of literature earns a full five stars, with the emphasis on the tragical parts of the story. Though short, this book is guaranteed to have you in tears by the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Watch for those that think telling time is not cool!!!!!","review":"I bought this watch for a friends daughter who really didn\\"t want to wear a watch. Boy did this watch turn her around, it's well made and the dragon design is awesome. High school kids comment on just how cool this watch is. The flip design provides versatility and a WOW factor that you don't see in other watches. I am ordering another watch for my nephew. It truly fits any size wrist and it looks like it should cost more. What more can you ask for. This watch deserves a 5 ++ rating hands down......I might just get one for me....:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Full reference text","review":"If you are learning economic for the first time this is a great place to start. As I look back on the different books I used to organize these concepts I wish I had used this book. The layout is easy to comprehend using the best of consumer choice and firm topics. The graphs and explanations are great even for someone that has already learned the material. Use this book in combination with a mathematical text like Simon and Blume and you will go far in undertanding Economics. I suggest this book for any advanced student as a place to make sure you really understand the basics of economics. Was a useful reference for graduate level study."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent reading of the ESV","review":"We are very fortunate to have an edition of the English Standard Version read by Max McLean. The ESV is arguably the finest modern translation, combining accuracy in translation and beautiful english--very rare among current offerings.As to the reading itself, Max is more understated in his reading of the ESV than in other versions I have heard--and I appreciate it. I have a hard time listening to over-dramatized readings of the Bible. There is background music, but it is pleasant and stays well in the background; I don't find it distracting at all.Overall I am delighted to have this audio Bible and recommend it to you without reservation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, someone reads the Bible with some passion","review":"Max McClean is great. He reads the Bible as if he is the author. Max McClean put emphasis and emotion throughout the Word. Very enjoyable. It really helps me in Bible study to be able to listen to a whole letter or at least several chapters at one time--and read with passion. Thankfully, in his enthusiasm he avoids undue overdramaticism. I really appreciate his work.Be blessed,--Jeffrey"},{"rating":"1","title":"not what i expected","review":"this ring is over price first is not like in the picture one stone is missing and i just open the box really cheap made this is going back for sure"},{"rating":"1","title":"beaded earrings","review":"I have new been so disapointed in my life.This is a cheap 20 page flier.That looks like a book.The instructions are very generic,look's like they were taken from other books and put together in this poorly writen manual.There are no real patterns, just sugestions.This is NOT even worth the $4.00 it cost.Stay away from this 20 page flier."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Awful................Thicker Fuller Hair Revitalizng Shampoo","review":"I was very excited in receiving this product,the reviews on it were mostly very positive,well, I really am not happy with the shampoo at allI have used it for several weeks now, trying to give ita chance but to no avail, if anything, I feel likethe opposite is happening and I am losing hair notlooking thicker or stronger......never again...................."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing product!","review":"These products have made my thin, fine hair look and feel so thick.

I'm rating this product highly only becuase it smells so good. I actually have a shaved head so I can't attest to it's qualities as a thickener. However, I am a big fan of citrus-scented products and Thicher Fuller Hair shampoo is a pleaser. It smells like they took a fresh squeezed orange and put it in a bottle. It smells so yummy, i use it for shampoo and shower gel. I wish they had a body lotion to compliment it! :)If you like your shampoo to have a citrus scent, you'll love this product. It's not overpowering or fake smelling. It's the perfect orange smell! For those of you with thin hair, I hope it lives up the it's name as well! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"It actually works!","review":"I've been using Mane & Tail shampoo for the past 10 years. I've tried other shampoos but would always return to Mane & Tail. Recently, I decided once again to try something new. I'd seen Thicker Fuller Hair in the stores before, but didn't think it'd actually work. Gave it a shot. My previously fine, limp, dead hair that would hold a curl for no more than two hours is now holding curls, tightly, alllllll day. My hair is much fuller and thicker in appearance too, just like the name says. Not to mention, soft and not at all weighed down. I can run my fingers through my hair and the curls are still there. Wind blows, curls are still there. Got caught in the rain the other day...curls were still there! I am a black woman with chemically relaxed hair testifying...YES! It works on our hair too, lol. I definitely recommend this shampoo and conditioner. I'd like to try their other products in the near future as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's my aroma therapy","review":"I spent an entire 1/2 hour smelling the various shampoos in the drug store where most of the shampoos and conditioners have a fake apple scent. This shampoo has a nice clean desert sage fragrance like Herbal Essence once did. I also have thin,fine hair and have noticed some improvement although I have to attribute most of this to a good cut and a tiny dab of mousse when blow drying. I'm going to stock up just in case there is a scent change."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic!!","review":"For those twenty-somethings....a must read. We are all figuring these funny things out and your not alone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehhh....","review":"This is a well written and clever book, and the author is very talented. The thing is, I'm a little irritated and bored by the story of a 20-something, commitment phobic, seemingly adolescent kind of guy who is such an emotional midget that he can't even say \\"I love you.\\" The protagonist reminds me of the quintessential young (immature) single guy whose self destructiveness is matched only by his narcissism...the kind of guy women (girls?) really go for until they get a little older and grow a backbone. Harry's a horrible jerk until she draws a line in the sand...then he realizes how much he cares and wants her back...have all of us not lived or heard this scenario in some way a zillion times since we began dating? Are we not tired of it yet? Maybe I'm getting old...it's just not very cute or alluring anymore...it was hard for me to sympathize and consequently hard for me to stop rolling my eyes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Viva le frog king!","review":"What a breezy surprise. The characters are fresh and interesting, the plot touching and original.Adam Davies has produced a fine book that is both beautifully written and painfully honest.I have recommended The Frog King to everyone. I can't wait for his second book."},{"rating":"2","title":"If I could give it MORE STARS...I definitely would","review":"Mr. Davies, hats off to you! You have written a truly spectacular novel, complete with all of the details that authors should pay more attention to. You have depth, humor, sadness...but above all, my favorite thing, is that it didn't end like you'd think it would, it ended like real life relationships do... I also liked the style that you used to write it...the narration and the descriptions, it was very well done. I can't wait until your next book comes out!(I LOVE the cover too, bravo! :P)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Green Light","review":"I was drawn to this book because of its comparison to one of my favorite books: \\"Bright Lights, Big City.\\" Like the main character in that novel, Harry Driscoll is trying to figure out how to define himself in a less than perfect world. He too responds to the soullessness of corporate culture by developing a shield of cynicism and a taste for a mind altering drug (in this case it's alcohol).Davies does an excellent job of describing Harry's love for Evie. He accurately conveys the subtle details that make up that love. Their relationship feels real and that makes it hard to watch as Harry repeatedly jeopardizes it.While Harry isn't always a completely likable character (he can be selfish and cruel), I still found myself rooting for him as I waited to see if he would save his relationship, and himself, before it was too late."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laugh-Out-Loud funny!","review":"This book is an easy read, but highly entertaining and laugh-out-loud funny! I was impressed with the whit and comical scenarios that were written about throughout the entire story -- very highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Problem with MFA Fiction...","review":"The titled character of TFK, Driscoll, tries the patience with his relentless self-pity, self-consciousness and exaggerated sense of self-importance. In otherwords, he's an adolescent. And a really dense one. The story is frighteningly shallow, superficial shilly shally non-sense borrowed from places we've been and authors we've read before. You're actually better off reading the Brothers Grimm original Frog Prince which is far more entertaining and has much more depth than this vanity project. This type of MFA fiction is precisely the reason I left writing school to become a translator with the UN. Honestly, write if you have something to say. Otherwise..."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"i was expecting more substance, but i got mostly fluff with this sophomoric effort. the story has some witty moments as do the characters, but there is nothing at the core that remains remotely interesting. it is sad, but i doubt the writer knew much about what real love is at all. a quick read, ok characters, but ultimately disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING: buzz marketers writing reviews for this novel","review":"Warning: people signed up to do buzz marketing on behalf of Penguin books may have written some of the reviews on here as mentioned in the piece \\"The Hidden (in Plain Sight) Persuaders\\" in the 12/5/2004 New York Times Magazine.

I recommend it to all especially those in the New York area."},{"rating":"2","title":"A not so love story","review":"I found the \\"The Frog King\\" an enjoyable read. As a 20-30 something, Harry Driscoll seems a bit too clueless about love and life, as we all are! I easily related to Evie, who either through naivity or desperation holds onto Harry. Reality hits home in Adam Davie's first novel..."},{"rating":"1","title":"A peek inside the process","review":"Seeing a few of the unrealistically rave reviews of this flawed novel reminds me to remind everyone how tainted the amazon reader review process is. When anyone can review a book there's the chance that the authors publicist, best friend, next-door-neighbor, and even mother can write a glowing review. I'm always suspicious of \\"best novel ever\\" reviews..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clever, clever","review":"After reading the author's \\"Goodbye Lemon\\" I was looking forward to \\"Frog Prince,\\" said to be his best work. True, I haven't gotten far in Frog Prince, but I find the clever New York smart-guy cliches to be too self-conscious and precious...as though they're the real purpose of the book, not any plot line or insights into character. Maybe I didn't read far enough. I can't."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book makes me feel that life will improve","review":"A true story of someone's complete downfall, to a slow rise makes one feel as though \\"life will be ok\\". The main character in this book truly loses it and manages to get his life back from the trenches. I couldn't put this book down - it's a solid read that I read non-stop for a few days until it was done. Sadly that doesn't happen often enough with books today. If you're between 20-40 you will relate to this book. If you live in NYC you will relate to this book. If you are in the book/publishing industry you will relate to this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre at best","review":"Davies' first attempt at a novel is amusing in places, and demonstrates that he is an avid subscriber to the \\"Word of the Day\\" on some dictionary website. However, the story is incredibly self-involved, and would really only appeal to those poor unfortunate souls who have made the serious error of pursuing a career in publishing. If you're being held hostage in a third world country, then this book would be a nice distraction. When you were done you could use it for [wall] paper as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Loved The Frog King","review":"The Frog King is a perfect example of having exactly what you're looking for right under your nose, but not seeing it. Harry has the perfect girlfriend in Evie (who he loves but can't seem to tell her), yet he continues to womanize. Of course when they break up, he does whatever he can to get her back (yet can't quite stop lying to her).On top of his woman problems, Harry hates his job at a publishing company and seems to sabotage everything he does there.Harry frustrated me so much! I wanted to give him a little smack to wake him up. Frustrations aside it was hard to not like him, as he is quite charming. I couldn't put the book down, I just had to keep reading and hoping that things to work out for him in the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fat drunk & stupid -- no way to go through life.","review":"The hype said this book was about a modern Holden Caulfield.In fact, it's just about a drunk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Yourself","review":"Save your time, money and most importantly your stomach bile by not reading this book. It had the nauseating combination of a boring storyline and unreal dialogue. It seemed to me as I grudgingly turned the pages that this book was simply a vehicle for the author to display his command of pretentious never-used words. I would have honestly prefered to read the dictionary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Again","review":"I have to confess my shock upon picking up this book in the bookstore in realizing that there are people still writing these fantasy New York books. Presumably for people who don't and probably never will ever live in New York City. What nonsense! But that's forgivable considering the immaturity and inanity of poor Harry Driscoll. Re TFK's plot: picking lint out of your navel is a fine activity, just don't write about it. I consider fake books with fake premises, books like these, a crime. Thankfully they're few and far between. I hope we're not witnessing a McInery-Ellis-coked-out 80s surge in boring novels again. Save your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Threw it across the room.","review":"The only reason I read through this entire book was that it was the only novel I'd brought with me to a place where no books in English were readily available. Yes, the writing is elegant, even beautiful. But the plot and the thoroughly unredeemable character of Harry were depressing and somehow degrading to wade through.It's a shame. It had the set up of everything I'd like--words, publishing, engaging characters, NYC. Instead I swore every time I turned a page and I did actually pitch the ting across the room in disgust when I finished it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A frog","review":"This boy-gets-girl, boy-loses-girl-but-finds-himself story has been told a million times. But here, it's done with overinflated, made up words--think A Clockwork Orange but not as effective--and completely inane characters. This is a bad beach read impersonating as literature, and to say otherwise misleads anyone who might buy it. Please skip..I wish I had."},{"rating":"2","title":"a modern day coming of age story","review":"The Frog King is a fiercely comic tale of a modern day male finding his meaning in a city that can make or break any individual. Harry Driscoll learns the hard way that love requires effort. His many adventures or misadventures are sure to bring laughs, and Davies also may make you feel somewhat sorry for Harry as the story unfolds. This is a great read for anyone who has visited or lived in a metropolitan city."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding book","review":"This book is an easy to read, common sense approach to a problem everyone faces at one time or another in their life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice and fresh","review":"Amazon stopped selling these for awhile.

If you are a casual fan, the material didn't offer anything groundbreaking, so the video might be dry and boring. If you love Larry and want to fill 90 minutes of your life with some funny stuff, then I recommend it.

He tryes to test himself (that he is a God)by doing strange thinks. Than he meets a other surviver and he desides to help her. The end is very original."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real music for real music lovers","review":"Written with pure grit and sung with a voice weathered like Cobain, Farrar, or Dylan, Dead Roses is an album packed with the kind of songs that are so well-written and so true to the heart, they're what should be on the radio but aren't. From the rocking \\"Hard on Me\\" to the heartbreaking \\"Hold on Caroline\\" or the haunting lead track \\"This Old Town,\\" Kasey Anderson delivers truly lyrical music--music so familiar it seems like you've heard it before you ever do, emotions so real you feel like they're your own. At ten tracks, the album is a tad on the short side, particularly considering that it omits the stellar Kasey Anderson track \\"Kentucky Wind,\\" but overall, Dead Roses is the kind of album you want to listen to over and over again. It's country rock Americana at its best."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's OK... Update it works well!","review":"Only works in manual. I use it with the sx20, but a much better flash is the sunpak pz40 that is also affordable and works with canon. So, basically it doesn't know that the camera is there, and you have to adjust all the flash compensation manually. Actually, the only thing it DOES do automatically is fire when the camera takes a shot. Alright, now for the pros. First off, you can obtain any shutter speed you want with the right flash exposer. Let's say that if ASA(ISO) is 800, and the aperture is 4 and the flash is on full, you can get a pic with the flash illuminating to about 50-60 ft with any shutter speed you like. I'd rate it a 3 1/2 if i could.The following link is to the better flash.

These people may make the high end music editing software - or have I just heard advertising? - but this product for amateurs is completely frustrating. First, the manufacturers are paranoid and set up all sorts of protocol for you to input and register your copy so they're satisfied you're not stealing it. Then, I find it has all of the high-end options listed on the pull-downs - but GRAYED OUT! And these are the first things on the lists! It's like they are taunting you that you bought the low end version and they just can't let it go. THEN, you have to download an extra fix in order to make mp3 files - only the most useful compressed music file - with another round of hyperparanoid product registration. AND THEN - after all that the software is buggy! I have had an endless stream of problems where things don't work, or they work one day and not the next.

They are definitely NOT grunge, but they had something to prove. They helped influence many of today's indie punk artists. Lead vocalist Jonathan Bunch is now the vocalist for Further Seems Forever, a great Christian indie punk band. \\"Found You\\" is a great song, especially with the opening drum line and the guitar lines that take you back to 1994, such a great year. \\"Today and Tomorrow\\" is a great opener to this indie punk classic. \\"Killed For Less\\" is an essential to anybody's CD collection, especially the one who like today's indie punk generation of bands like Taking Back Sunday, Further Seems Forever and Senses Fail (both names sound alike). Definitely recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The album which has influenced me most in my entire life.","review":"I won't gabble on too much, but I was introduced to Sense Field by a friend in 1995, and they have been my favourite band ever since.

The composition after which the CD is named is superb: it really takes to the ultimate expresion of sublime Rainer Marie Rilke's poem.

They now think that \\"NFP often lays an unfair burden of guilt on men\\" and \\"it's a theological attack on women to always require that abstinence during the time of the wife's peak sexual desire\\" (a less passive and more honest way of stating this would be to say that \\"Sam and Bethany Torode have laid an unfair burden of guilt...\\" and \\"Sam and Bethany Torode have launched a theological attack on women...\\").

I would have liked a bit more info on the actor's backgrounds and some of the post SCTV collaborations such as C.M.M. of Ed Grimley - but this book is both heartfelt and well-written, espescially in his honest reporting of the rest of the cast's resentment following his and Moranis' success following Strange Brew.

Dirt Bike Racer is about a kid named Ron who finds a mini bike at the bottom of a lake while scuba diving. He wants to replace all the parts, but he doesn't have any money. He gets a job working for Mr. Perkins. He finds out Mr. Perkins use to race. Ron finally makes it to a race, but wrecks. I think the theme of this book is sports. The author of this book is Matt Christopher and he always writes about sports. What inspired him to write books, was a piece, someone wrote in high school wrote. It inspired him because he wished he could write like that some day. Matt Christopher has written many books some of them are Peach Street, The Extreme Team, and Soccer Cats. A quote he has gone by is \\"Good judgment comes from experience, experience comes from bad judgment.\\" I think the quote is good because when you do something bad you learn from it. I recommend this book because it's a good and exciting book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alot of entertainment","review":"I recommend this book to anyone that likes sports and has a tough time reading. They will really enjoy this book. This book is a good book because the words are descriptive and it's easy to comprehend, and the details that the author has given us in the book make us feel that we're the character. \\"The bike bucked and bounced, and a couple of times it skidded to the side to much that I almost lost my balance and fell. But I managed to keep it upright, using my feet to balance it when I felt it leaning over too far.\\" Another great thing about this book is how there are a couple of pictures and that makes me visualize where the character is in the book. One of the pictures shows Ron on his dirt bike and he's in the air after jumping the ramp, Ron said \\" You're not going to stop me, no matter what you do!\\" If you like sports and you have a tough time reading, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great read!","review":"Once Ron finds a dirt bike at the bottom of a lake he can't believe his eyes. So, the next day he goes scuba diving to find it. But the bike will need some fixing. Ron is certain that his motorcross dream will come true. I think that Matt Christopher's style of writing is spectacular. I feel that his writing is very descriptive and detailed. When he writes he doesn't tell, he shows. So when he writes that the back wheel is spinning, he says, \\"It is spitting up dirt and rubble!\\" When Matt Christopher writes a beginning of a story he doesn't start with a dull beginning he starts with action usually destruction. In my book, he starts with a windstorm that blows some belongings away into the lake. I think that is how good writers write."},{"rating":"1","title":"inappropriate for young readers","review":"i bought this book for a third grader. i wanted to preview the book before giving it to the student. upon reading the first two chapters, there were many words and phrases that i though were bad for a young child to read.Example: \\"i wanted to cuss him\\"... \\"darn it\\"...\\"jerk\\"I would not recommend this book for young readers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dirt Bike Racer","review":"I rate this book a four because the author used very good desciption.

That's kind of dissapointing. Look for sections on sparring and bits of self-defense techniques. The small but essential chapter called \\"The Philosophy of TaeKwonDo\\" should be moved to the front of the book, but at least it's here. There are also a couple of fantastic sections relating to Korean terminology. A chapter in TaeKwonDo history should have been included in this book. This is one of the better reference books on WTF TaeKwonDo, with tons of pictures, but nothing replaces real training in a real TaeKwonDo school."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful help for a student at any Level!","review":"This book clearly explains Tae Kwon Do in an easy to follow format from history to present, kicking to punching, blocking to stances, and forms to refereeing.

I don't care what God they want to quote, this is hideous. Please don't ever buy this book. The idea that someone is reading it and heeding its advice is just heartbreaking. What a tragedy that there are sweet babies out there being hit and switched by their parents, whom they trust and adore, until they are 'broken'. To somehow justify this as discipline is inhumane.

The culture today encourages rebellious, worldly children while ministries such as the one who wrote and published this book continue to stand on truth and love. As you read it, you will find yourself relating to many of the examples the Pearls use in their book. The book is a very easy read. I still find myself reading back over the highlighted words from a few years back as we raise our younger children. Great great book! One that I have highly recommended to friends over many many years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please do not buy this book, you will be supporting child abuse","review":"Parents are instructed to whip their infants daily for no reason to teach them submissiveness from the very start of life. They also recommend putting one Rod in each room of the house as a reminder to children of what will happen should they misbehave. They tell you what kind of rod to use and where to buy it.In their book the Pearls advocate pulling an infant's hair, \\"thumping\\" a toddler and a daily routine of whipping infants, toddlers and preschoolers to teach them to be submissive. They encourage parents to whip their children 10 times several times a day starting at 3 months old.This makes me so sad and sick."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Manual for Child Abuse","review":"What kind of craziness is this?

Michael Pearl's response to what was largely thoughtful and concerned criticism, was a blog post where he openly laughed at his critics and posted a photo of the kind of plumbing line Lydia Schatz was killed with (the kind of plumbing line he and his wife recommend as a spanking tool on their website).

My goal is to raise a thinking, functional human being who can make decisions on his own. The very thought of needing to \\"switch\\" my child for evey incident of childish behavior makes me cringe. In all fairness, the Pearls do speak of loving their children and advocate \\"tying heartstrings\\" , i.e. always maintaining loving communication with their children. However, I do not understand how their advocated methods will achieve this. I do not understand how a child can be called a terroristic manipulator and a joy at the same time.

For example, the Pearls recommend switching a 4month old baby on the legs. One should never, ever spank a baby. I was also appalled at the Pearls advice to wives of sexual molesters. The Pearls state that it is better for the wives to stay in the marriage with these men and wait for them to get out of prison (that is, if they are sentenced).

If \\"relationship\\" matters to you with your children you really want to try one of the books I mentioned first. Also, for Christians...it is worth noting that the biblical rod that the ancient shepherds used was never used to strike their sheep. It was actually a rod with a spiked ball on the end which was used to ward off predators. This teaching about hitting our children based on the belief that shepherd's hit their sheep is misguided.

He tells parents that if they don't \\"train\\" their children the way he teaches, the children to grow up to be wild, perverted, and hell-bound. Millions of parents have reared children without the adversarial, punitive, and violent methods taught by Michael Pearl; children who grew up to be happy, well-adjusted, Christian adults.

In my opinion you must read them all to understand how to correctly apply Biblical Chastisement. \\"To Train Up A Child\\" gives you only a glimpse of what the method is so supplement with their articles and other resources so to not get the wrong idea.

Once again a child has died because of the methods taught in this book and by continuing to sell a book advocating physical, emotional and psychological abuse and neglect Amazon is as culpable as the sadist who wrote it and the misled parents who use it.

The Pearls (who have neither religious nor child development credentials) have been twisting Scripture to fit their own sick agenda for years in this and other books. Beating children with foreign objects to make them \\"instantly and unquestioningly\\" obey is not godly discipline; it is abuse.The Pearls' penchant for taking Bible verses out of context is commonplace in this torture manual, which is another weapon in the arsenal of atheists to use against Christians (in an attempt to prove we are all as insane as the authors of this garbage.) This is not about spanking. This is not about the corporal punishment debate.

My boys are well behaved and polite, and I have been blessed with a rich, rewarding relationship with them that has been built on a strong foundation of trust. I can only imagine that using the techniques described in this book would shatter that precious trust. It sickens me to think that some people might even consider doing this to their children. I strongly encourage anyone looking for guidance in their parenting to reject this book and look instead at the principals of attachment parenting.

Her child would have given up with or without the spanking. Telling her Momma \\"I love you.\\" for the first time in the morning is not an indication that this kind of discipline was good for her but an indication that she wanted to know that she was still loved after the violent punishment from the person she loves.If how our children turn out is an indication of how well a discipline method works and we can prove that children disciplined without spanking can turn out just as well as those who are not; Why would you choose a method that physically hurts the child you love?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"It astounds me that someone could preach these things and say they are in the name of Christ.

It's about training, little by little, in baby steps, based on your child's personality. Most of all, after reading much of the Pearl families' material, I see it's about making your children your best friends and training them to be healthy, happy, adults!

Ignore the foolish reviews about child abuse; my father was a principal for 8 years and it's nowhere near abuse.

Michael & Debi Pearl claim the training they advocate creates joyful, happy children if parents follow their instructions correctly. I'm here to tell you that this is not true.

Pull their hair? A BABY?? Coming from an abused child I can tell you, THIS IS ABUSE! I can't believe anyone would be so ignorant to take anything from this book and if your children grow up to hate you, well, you deserve it.A spanking is a delicate situation.

For the under one-year-old child, a small, ten-to twelve-inch-long willowy branch (stripped of any knots that might break the skin) about one-eighth inch in diameter is sufficient. Sometimes alternatives have to be sought. A one-foot ruler, or its equivalent in a paddle, is a suitable substitute.

A parent who seeks first to understand from the child's point of view why the bad behavior was chosen, to show the child the better alternatives and help the child pick one for the future, and to help the child set the situation right rears a responsible human being who knows that parents love unconditionally. Such a child is prepared to believe God loves unconditionally too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, terrible, abusive","review":"Vomit, vomit, vomit....the previous poster who talked about the \\"loving commands\\" makes me sick.

If you truly care about displaying Jesus and love to your child, please do not read this book. Discipline is very important, but there is a huge difference between abuse and discipline.

The control issues that require a need to \\"break a child's will\\" will not only break that child's will, but also break their character and any hope of ever having even a semblance of a good relationship with them once they reach adulthood."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning - a child was killed because her parents were folling the advice in this book!","review":"I edit this to add that a child was killed because her parents whipped her following the advice in this book. [...]This book teaches us to \\"switch\\" our babies, even when they are less than one year old. Switching means to hit their legs with a flexible stick (the rod). They say that this is not punishment, it's training. They teach that we should train tiny babies and children as if they were animals. Actually, few people would be so abusive with animals, the Humane Society would step in. It is impossible to exagerate how abusive this book is. He teaches parents to lovingly apply this training so that kids learn that people can loving hurt them. I just can't believe that this is what Our Loving Father meant by \\"train your child.\\" Especially when the Hebrew word translated \\"train\\" there means \\"to inaugurate, to dedicate, to consecrate\\" as well as \\"to guide, to tutor, and to teach.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"It needs to be on the banned books list...","review":"This book gives Christianity a bad name.

I notice a lot of Christians are backing this book...I guess your perception of what is acceptable is warped when you are raised within a morally bankrupt institution that excuses child abuse (physical,sexual and psychological) by it's figure heads whist simultaneously condemning anyone who doesn't fit into it's scripture's template of normal.Talk to your children people, you'll be amazed what happens when you listen.If you do need help and want to raise a child that won't despise and resent you in later life then I would recommend goggling \\"Love and Logic\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible book.","review":"This seems to speak volumes to those who have no idea of the negative repercussions of corporal punishment. If you are too lazy to try to speak, reason or distract a small child from the undesired behavior they are doing than you will be inspired by this badly written book on parenting.
