As a gay man myself, I can see an uncanny similarity to his attitude towards White people and a reparative therapist's attitude towards gay people. A reparative therapist will say that he doesn't hate gay people, he just has compassion for them and wants to help them to become heterosexual. In exactly the same way, Ignatiev doesn't hate White people, he has compassion for them and wants to help them leave their \\"whiteness.\\" In effect, what he and his ilk are promoting is a sort of reparative therapy for White people, based on the idea that \\"whiteness\\" is a disorder that needs to be cured."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Chosen Speak","review":"This is a great book to read to understand why Hilter is becoming more loved by young Whites then he was just a few years ago.

What does it mean to destroy a people's culture and traditions in toto? It means to destroy them. If Hitler had gone about forcing all Jews to intermarry to the point that there were no Jews left, the result would have been the same as killing them as individuals. The people would be destroyed. What Ignatiev is supporting is nothing short of genocide, and though he may say he doesn't mean he want inidividuals killed (although I doubt his sincerity on this) he certainly does want a whole race or group of people destroyed.

I wish it were illegal for people like this to have children. Not to mention the character is downright ignorant about the female body and pregnancy. How could she think she's having an ectopic pregnancy after she saw the 8 week ultrasound, clearly showing baby INSIDE the uterus? Also, she's 31 and doesn't know how ovulation works??After adjusting to her twisted world, though, I did identify with some of her regular pregancy symptoms, which I guess means that no matter what your walk of life, the 9 month process of pregnancy is the same for all of us. The detailed stories of her \\"coming of age\\" are a funny reminder of all I've been through so far in my own pregnancy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"I WISH this book had been out when I was pregnant.

The heroine isn't a flake like most of Krentz's heroines, but is smart and very feisty. The hero, Nick, is what's special, though: Instead of her usual man of mystery or engineer with frozen emotions, Krentz has created a vibrant hero who's loving, humorous, and strong but not pushy; he's a masterpiece, and the tenderness of the relationship between him and the heroine, Philadelphia, is deeply moving. Among my all-time favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"An okay JAK novel","review":"I bought the unabridged audio version of The Golden Chance which was read by PAtrick Girard Lawlor and Franette Liebow. I liked Patrick's voice, but I was not really fond of Franette's voice. I probably would have preferred Joyce Bean or Laurel Merlington. Although I didn't like all the bickering going on between the families and the main characters, I felt that the storyline was okay and I definitely enjoyed the ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yikes","review":"I completely agree with the reviewers who rated this book a two or below. Philadelphia Fox is one of the most ridiculous heroins I have ever come across. Annoying and unlikeable. Nicodemus Lightfoot, on the other hand, was the only redeeming factor in this book. He was a true Jayne Krentz character, a take charge kind of person. Unlike Philadelphia, he was not so indecisive.Oh, I almost forgot to comment on the \\"relationship\\" between the hero and heroin. I saw very little closeness between Phila and Nick, other than in the bedroom. I can't understand how anyone could mistake that for tenderness.This book is definitely one I would recomend you DON'T read. If you want a good book check out some of Krentz's others. Deep Waters, for example."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst JAK ever","review":"I can't believe this thing is coming around again.

Neither name was used before 1905. The malfieance Longarm was sent to adress was not happening at that time. Such events could have been associated with Fort Whoop Up prior to 1878 or with the American rail lines that terminated in Winnipeg or Moose Jaw. Problems with the CPR focussed around corrupt financing, political scandal and patronage. Some of the corupt fianciers became involved with building American railroads. The history provides lots of material for a Longarm story but this is not it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointing swan song...","review":"As a RAH fan, I was tremendously disappointed with this outing. Long, droning, self-indulgent, this work is devoid of the insightful social commentary and gripping story-telling that marks most of his books.

I love Heinlein, but his final book is disgustingly bad. The unblushing and non-ironic use of the word \\"wetback\\" is enough to turn me off all by itself, but it's symptomatic of the humorless, bitter, prejudiced character of the whole book. If you want a sample of what's good from his later work, try Job: A Comedy of Justice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lazarus Long's Mother","review":"This book mostly consists of Maureen Johnson Smith Long recording her autobiography while imprisoned and likely to be executed, if not rescued in time. The only one who knows of her circumstance is her cat, Pixel, the cat who walks through walls. Her biography was interesting and the end of the book set the reader up for another book about another relative of Lazarus Long (Woodrow Wilson Smith), which was probably never written.If the reader has not read any of this series, he/she might prefer starting with \\"Methuselah's Children\\", \\"Time Enough for Love\\" and \\"The Cat Who Walks Through Walls\\" for background. I have not read the last of the three. Also, a character frequently referred to in this novel is a major character in \\"Stranger in a Strange Land\\" and \\"Number of the Beast\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother.","review":"I gave up.

Going through endless blabbings about sexual fantasies and orgies is just not my thing. I found the book preverted and gave up about 1/3 of the way through it, when it came to incest. They say that this is one of the Master's last works. I find it very painful to see such a miserable ending of a life-long of wonders."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incestuous","review":"Look, I used to love Heinlein. I have read much of his work and found it to be interesting, challenging, and rewarding.But this book was a great, big, self-indulgent dissapointment.First of all, I find no titilation in incest. When it seems to be endorsed every third page or so, it gets more than a bit repugnant.The elitist additudes in this book, such as the idea of a secret society that supports marriages between people from long-lived families, troubled me. Of course that organization has very progressive ideas about incest.Heinlein writes about a woman who's additudes towards sex are a male fantasy (except the incest, most men I know, including me, have no fantasies about). Are we supposed to believe this?Tedious, but even Heinlein's tedium is better than a lots of writer's best effort.Oh, did I mention this book features lots and lots of incest?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for Heinlein fans.

The authors do a good job of presenting the information in an intellectual manner without putting you to sleep. This is actually one \\"text book\\" that I have enjoyed reading. The layout of the book is easy to read and to comprehend. It is divided into three parts and from there, the information is broken down even further. Although the authors have tried to present their case in as easy terms as possible, they never sound unintelligent or underestimate their readers' intelligence. One gets the message and the point without feeling that they are being talked down to. The book includes the latest statistics on audience research and data, which is hard to come by in the ever-changing business of broadcasting.

Unfortunately, that's all I can say about it that's good.I didn't like any of the character designs, and many of them I found extremely annoying. The storyline is nonexistent; it's just a bunch of horny highschool boys chasing after a bunch of girls for 12 episodes. And while this sounds like it should be the setting for a great comedy, it's not. I didn't laugh once during the entire series.Normally I love anything with fanservice no matter how bad the story is, but even with the abundant girls Green Green just wasn't at all entertaining to me. Moreover, while I was watching I just wanted to turn it off and never watch it again, that's how bad it is.I can only recommend Green Green for the most hardcore of anime collectors, anyone else shouldn't waste their money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adolescent Drivel","review":"If you want to watch a subpar plot, lots of breasts jiggling around (\\"boobies!\\" is the key word used throughout) and watching the 3 boys engaging in fantasy with each other then this anime is for you. (yes, it happened while locked in a room together, oh so painful!)I endured pain throughout each episode hoping that it would get better, it didn't :( If they could have just dropped the first 10 episodes and kept the final ones, it would have been a much better series.Seriously, watching three loser boys, looking through knot holes in a fence into the girls bath, and then getting caught, come on? Can't they come up with anything better?If you just want fan service, then yes, by all means, please buy two copies, but there are so many other anime series you'll find entertaining, funny and yes, stimulating without having to endure 325 minutes of this adolescent drivel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This show is a disgrace to the Looney Tunes legacy.

There are a couple articles on the overlander and the Diesel. There also is an article from PV4 magazine of their trip from Mexico to Alaska and back in 10 days in a 1976 CJ7! I have thoroughly enjoyed reading the book and can't seem to put it down. It contains specfication sheats for each model year from 1976-86 and is a gold mine of information for the Jeep CJ fan.

I think we have a need for purpose in our lives, even if we are a gardener, a pizza boy, a cleaning lady, a sweatshop youngster sewing T-shirts in Laos, an office clerk doing standard routine work. It is a pity that we find no such examples in this book. From the book we get the impression that the only way to find a purpose is to quit our present job and to become a trainer, writer, etc... but there are also other jobs to fill, I think. Moreover, if everybody goes into training and/or writing, these jobs will loose their financial attractiveness, I suspect."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing New or Insightful","review":"The book's premise was so promising -- how to find work that fulfills your higher calling. The book just never fulfills that promise. Just a lot of unmemorable writing about how you will be more fulfilled if your work is meaningful. Well, that's not a shocker. But how about some insight into how to find or how to create meaningful work. For such a deep and spiritual topic, the thinking was very superficial. The author merely rewrites what he has read elsewhere. No new thinking. Readers would be better off reading some of the books he recommends in his bibliography such as Flow and the books by Viktor Frankl. I was also left with the icky feeling that the real point of this book was to sell you on his company's feel good workshops. A real disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"Power of Purpose would make a great magazine article, but there is not enough content here to make a good book. \\"Creating Meaning in Your Life...\\" is not what this book is about.

The filmmaker is obviously totally clueless in regard to his subject. In addition to that, his maudlin commentary makes the film even more unbearable. Over 45 minutes Clark is wallowing in clichés and stereotypes about Bangkok, Thai people and Bargirls, tormenting the viewers with his pointless, pathetic opinions on a subject he so obiously does not comprehend in any way.I can only agree with a former review: a complete lack of any understanding or comprehension is all this film shows.

My son's 40 Coleman bag has a better zipper and lining material that does not snag. Also, as a cold-weather bag, you're going to get condensation and frost inside your tent. Any moisture that drips onto the outer shell of the bag soaks in, because the shell is not water-resistant. This bag has to be taken outside and dried out every day of the camping trip.Edit> I came back to revise this review because I realize that outdoor camping and tent camping are not everyone's cup of tea.

I first became aware of it during a trip to southern Arizona. The authors describe a way of life -- on an isolated cattle ranch -- that is almost extinct.

We can well imagine the meditations that Justice O'Conner and her brother experienced during the long rides to places on the ranch. There are many instances told to us that gives readers insight to their thought processes and character building.

It felt as if this was a rough draft or an undeveloped journal of thoughts. Much of the book was skimmed, searching for some human interest.

Roy's writing is clear and direct, and the introductory games are creative and enjoyable. For me, the book is the next step after sit-down-stay. It presents the training in a format that is fun for you and your dog.The first 1/3 of the book provides a series of games that set the groundwork for scenting and scent discrimination. The next 2/3 of the book handle tracking and searching. The book is full of facts and methods, and these methods are all about bonding with your dog. As a bonus to the whole process, your dog will learn a few great parlor tricks.I am giving the book (4) stars because I don't have any other points of reference. Unleash the power of your dog."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book, but not for beginner trackers","review":"This book, by Roy Hunter, is a great resource by for all those interested in tracking--though it isn't necessarily a great book or primer for the beginner tracker, as it assumes skills the beginner (and her dog) might not have.Other than that, Mr. Hunter's book offers interesting exercises for the advanced tracker and for those trackers seeking to expand their tracking dog's skills.Overall, an interesting, informative book. I would have liked it better if Mr. Hunter had offered more explanations with some of the lessons, but I did like his behavioristic, canine psychology oriented perspective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impress your friends!","review":"This is a really fun book with lots of ideas for games to keep your dog interested in learning. I have a hunting dog and she loves these games. We have demonstrated for our friends and they are always delighted. Whenever we have small children come to the house I have them give the dog the commands for sit and stay, the kids go hide a treat somewhere in the house or outside. Then the child comes back gives the dog the scent and commands, \\"go get it\\". Of course this starts a fun race around the house and yard. Kids love it and it communicates to the dog that the child is the boss, win-win. Lots of fun ideas, super inexpensive, an awesome gift for you and your dog!"},{"rating":"2","title":"2nd Time Around","review":"I absolutely loved the first Tamagotchi game, so I figured that this would also be a great game to purchase.

The script was corny and poorly written, the subs and ships looked suspiciously like the ones I used to play with in the bathtub, and the sets depicting the inside of the subs were so roomy that both Glenn Ford and Ernest Borgnine were able to wear their hats almost the entire time. And Ford wore a jacket, despite the fact that real submarines were almost unbearably hot, especially while being depthcharged.The sub skippers also kept their periscopes up so long the entire Japanese navy could have spotted them. And the crew was able to launch three torpedoes from the same tube in rapid succession.Frankly, they should have changed the name of Borgnine's character to \\"McHale\\" and added some jokes and a laugh track. It's hard to believe people would have shelled out good money to see this trash, even in 1958.Movies don't get any worse than this. I give it one yuck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good WWII submarine movie. Excellent action scenes.","review":"This movie may be a bit wrenching on your emotions, due to the difficulty of the command decisions by the captain of the sub. Some people think it is \\"stupid\\", but I think if it were actually them there in his shoes they may have did the same thing. If he did not fire on the carrier using the prison ship screen, his superiors may have considered him unfit for command. This would have made him ashamed of himself in front of his only remaining family: the U.S. Navy. However, I think he could have set the torpedo depth deep enough to shoot under said ship and hit the carrier (I am a hardcore sub-sim gamer). But this was an actual real-life account of what happened in WWII, and as such must be depicted as what really happened.Excellent action. Good acting. Very interesting. Good account of social interaction between crew. Good account of captain's family interaction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used and incorrect parts in \\"NEW\\" packaging","review":"I ordered and received product, automobile timing chain, expecting NEW -as advertised.

In particular, there's light drumming throughout, no banjo, and little material from the standard bluegrass repertoire. The band's originals are heavy on instrumental virtuosity and interplay, venturing into similar jam-band territory as Leftover Salmon, but with concise arrangements and gypsy-jazz swing reminiscent of revivalists like Hot Club of Cowtown. In addition to their originals, the band's hand-picked covers include a tight arrangement of Chick Corea's \\"Amando's Rhumba\\" and a tuba-lined take of Ray Davies' 1972 Kinks' klassic, \\"Motorway.\\" The variety that the band creates with acoustic instruments is interesting, but the seamlessness of their segues from hot jazz to folk-rock to twangy mountain and Celtic sounds is truly impressive.

Although only a few days had passed since the luncheon, Jasmine greeted Thomas with \\"You must be Dr. Baker.\\" Oh please.

Unfortunately this book is for beginners.

Chapters 6 and 7, covering advanced reporting techniques should have been expanded on in detail with a step by step layout - instead we get a dumb comment - \\"you've learnt the details in earlier chapters (not true of the code). There is constant problems in reading the text - so much garbage and no proper highlight of key words - its impossible to race through the book, you only can trod like an old man. Unnecessary information is given that is not required. Chapter 11 - Report server configuration is at the end of the book but should be at the front - these nutters assume you are a dba when it comes to environment configuration.

I see that the main character is self-centered and has a personality dictated by the proverbial winds. But there is no setting whatsoever, and really no character within. You're locked inside the head of an unformed personality that is formed, unformed and reformed over and over again. But the reader gets but the slightest of information, and as a result you feel as if you're only getting a live feed straight from the brain of a person with a personality disorder--without context, a sense of setting or the balance of other characters/voices.

There's authenticity in these stories but I don't feel like I'm looking through a forbidden peephole to get a glimpse of her life. Her writing might even be too good for the erotica genre but I'm glad she's writing because it restores my faith in what *can* be accomplished in sex writing. She reminds me a little of M.

All I have to say now is, I'm stunned. The film succeeds on all levels. I didn't feel robbed at the end, the ending was unexpected and magnificent.The main two leads are stunning in their parts, especially the girl. At the end, the viewer is witness to carnage, but left with no horror, no guilt, nothing but love and happiness towards the doer of the carnage.I wanted the movie to end before this scene, I thought it should because it was so perfect (besides the violent cat scene), but the addition, and the encounter with Oskar's bullies at the end was triumphent.Easily the best horror movie of all time and likely has graced the top 15 list for my best all time live action movies.Del Torro, ever since Pan's Labyrinth, has been a stunningly poignant director, able to match both violence and the deepest emotions of love together in any setting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excllenent vampire film that transcends the genre!","review":"I'm not sure if I agree with the blurb on the DVD cover about this being \\"the best vampire movie ever,\\" but if Terrance Mallick was Swedish and decided to make a vampire/suspense movie starring two tweens it might've come out like this film.

The original film is in Swedish. The disk says there are subtitles, but they don't actually appear, even when the characters are reading Swedish. What's left is the awful dubbing, which is just comically bad and a constant distraction and spell-ruiner.

The pacing of this movie is a bit slow, but not unbearable. There is not much use of special effects, but what is there, is done very well -- to add to the shock value of a few great scenes. Be prepared to feel a bit uneasy with the new/different ideas of classic vampire story pieces, though.

I caught on to what was happening and was surprised at the sensitivity and the excellent acting. It is also a film that I liked so much that I bought it. When I viewed it again, several things became apparent that I missed the first time. Yes, it's much better the second time. If you're a vampire film buff, this one is different, but it's true to the traditional vampire lore. It's also a love story. It has sexual overtones that are complex yet seemingly innocent.

So this was a nice surprise. This movie is much, much better than the American \\"Let Me In,\\" mostly because of the acting, but also because of the setting. I'd read the book, and I didn't like that the American version set the story in the American Southwest. The snowy setting of \\"Let the Right One In\\" was true to the book, so it \\"felt\\" right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull...Dullllll.....Dulllllll!!!!!","review":"I have been a vampire movie junkie since before it was popular again so I have seen nearly of the ones out there, both domestic and foreign, which also include the worst \\"B\\" movies of all time (Jesse James meets Dracula, etc.) and I must say without a doubt this is the worst vampire movie I've ever seen. Ok, I'll give it one or two points for creepiness, but the scenery is ugly, the sets unimaginative and no magnetism from the vampires at all. To me a vampire movie is sucessful if you feel some type of \\"pull\\" from the main character - this one did nothing but push me away. I'm sure some people may like it, but not this one. Such a waste of two hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"no english only subtital","review":"this movie looked good but they don't speak english. Thank God I watched the preview. Now I know not to buy it.

The movie was slow, there was no action. The story didn't go anywhere. I can't understand what people were watching. Save your money and do not buy this one. You will thank me later"},{"rating":"1","title":"not just the subtitles","review":"This film looked entrancing; unfortunately, I couldn't watch it. I waited for the latest Blu-ray release from Magnolia, but that didn't help. The problem wasn't the subtitles because I couldn't see them. There was a time bar across the bottom of the screen that COULD NOT BE REMOVED. It blocked the subtitles. The dubbing track sounded awful and the bar was annoying even without the subtitles. And the authoring errors didn't end there. The menu at the end of the film was frozen - you couldn't watch the special features without restarting the movie, a real pain because there was no direct access to the menu without sitting through the crap that preceded it. All in all, this is another baboon authoring job that seems all too prevalent on Blu-ray discs (but very rare on DVDs). A pity, because this film seemed to be very impressive. Unless Criterion rescues it, I guess I'll never know for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Best.Vampire. Movie. Ever?","review":"Not. Really. Slow and uninteresting more aptly describes this one folks. While I take nothing away from the effort, it reminded me of another movie that came out a few years ago that was overhyped and quite disappointing - The Blair Witch Project. Which is to say, after it ended, I found myself still waiting for something to happen. Very. Disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Watched; Liked it.","review":"The other reviews are stating that you should hold off until you can get a hand on the original theatre dubbing of the movie but I still found the Magnolia release adequate. I've seen my share of badly dubbed movies and this was a decent dub.As for the movie itself, I found it chilling but sweet. I can't find a way to describe those aspects without spoilers so I'll just say this; if you love vampire movies, you'll love this.

I also read the misleading blurbs on the DVD box, and am aware of the subtitle controversy, and that's definitely one-star packaging.So ... what am I supposed to rate here? Five stars for the director, cast, and crew, or one star for the DVD packaging/subtitling?If someone rinky dink outfit releases a poorly prepared DVD of \\"Citizen Kane,\\" and customers object by giving it an average ranking of one star, what does the young movie fan, who has never seen \\"Citizen Kane,\\" make of that one-star rating? He or she decides the movie stinks.Until Amazon fixes this, I would suggest ranking movies on their merits, and then adding packaging gripes as a warning/aside.But \\"Let the Right One In,\\" on its own merits, deserves five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"The origional and the best","review":"The best because of the atmosphere which surronds the characters in the film.Very well put together and very convincing.Why would you try and copy this great movie?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Possibly one of the best vampire films ever made !","review":"Theirs not much to say here just watch the movie and you will be amazed. Its a great love story and very realistic unlike Twilight which the vampires are immune to sunlight. The film is beautifully directed and the cinematography is great, definitely a keeper. Don't wanna go into the movie but you won't be let down its a very emotional and awkward journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Theatrical Subtitles Available","review":"I've seen this movie many times and in several ways. I suggest seeing it in the original Swedish with the theatrical subtitles only. Amazon still hadn't clarified the availability of the version I wanted, so I finally bought it elsewhere. Go to the Target website ([...]), search the title. There will be three results (as of this writing). You can click an icon for more details or just click the \\"Find it at a Target store\\" button. A small window will open and just type your zipcode or city/state. A list of stores near you will appear with the availabilty in each store. It cost me $9.99 for the theatrical subtitle version."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Spellbinding Gothic Tale","review":"This film is an absolutely superb rendering of the classic vampire tale but in a modern way. The story is frightening but in a manner that draws you into it. The characters are in their strange way, appealing. I feel it will become a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"I adore this movie. It's one of those rare, genre-busting films that you want to talk about and recommend to everyone. Is it a vampire movie? Yes, but only superficially. It's about the end of childhood; about loneliness, made more poignant because the adults are just as lost as the children. Sometimes, it's hard to tell who is old and who is young. But, to call it an allegory is to risk turning away those who just want to see a fabulous story. This is that, for sure. A quiet one, with more chills that frights. And lots to think about.I'm not Swedish, and I'm not familiar with many Swedish actors. But wow, what a cast! The children are incredible. I won't forget them in this, for sure. And I guess I got the version with the \\"good\\" subtitles, because they were just fine.I watched this on Amazon Prime on the same day as Triangle, another deep, cerebral allegory on loneliness, love, and duty. Two very different movies in tone, but a heck of a double-feature. I recommend both highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"let the right MOVIE in...","review":"i've seen both...in the theatre and the dvd...do yourself a favor-wait. this one isn't even close.the distributer is waiting to release the theatrical version, not the dumbed down version.i hope directors and producers take notice to how this is being handled and act accordingly. i even heard let the right one in's director is upset, as he should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS FROM AMAZON YET OLD VERSION STILL SENT OUT 12/30/09","review":"This is a FANTASTIC film with a POOR first releaseAfter waiting until people saw the right version being shipped out, I ordered my copy. Well, Amazon is STILL sending out the old version of this Blu-Ray and now I am stuck with the WRONG ONE. The DVD / BLU needs to say THEATRICAL Subtitles, not English.Magnet / Magnolia has decided not to replace the incorrect Blu-Rays because they don't feel this is a mastering issue.Amazon really dropped the ball here. They don't have any information on their site to let you know what version you are getting.

I was absolutely blown away by it. EVERYTHING about this film is amazing..It is simply beautiful. The performances, the story, the cinematography, the scenery. EVERYTHING. Seeing this after Twilight makes me wonder why Twilight deserves all of this big buzz. This should be out in every theatre and causing headlines. It should be Perez Hilton's number one story!

You will NOT be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best films of 2008","review":"Don't read anything about this movie, don't watch the trailers, don't imdb it.

By the way guys, I'm mailing you the shirt off my back also."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT the right one to let in, into your DVD player","review":"I bought this movie based on NPR's (National Public Radio)recommendation. (Usually a good source for intelligent, interesting movies; however, this movie is neither). Now, the movie was very shallow, generic, predictable, and greatly lacking in imagination. All the characters lacked depth and intelligence. This movie was plain and simple a case of \\"what you see is what you get.\\" Often you see a movie and think it will get better; well, this is one is one of those that never gets any better. You see the first five minutes and that is as good as it gets.No mystery, no intrigue, just plain: kid bullied at school befriends vampire girl, vampire girl protects him and, in one of the most anticlimactic endings, kills the bad kids. That is the whole movie, a great, great disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just awful","review":"To begin, I love Vampire movies of all kinds. It is a guilty indulgence of mine. I have found something in almost every one I have seen from old black and white to the current day to enjoy. For me this was just awful, it was sad, it was draining to watch, and it seemed to last for many more hours than listed. I didn't find it touching, disturbing perhaps, for the first time I had to actually force myself to watch it all the way through. Were the people who gave this movie so many stars sure that this was the movie they watched?If you want to see it I would offer you my copy, but, that seems too unkind to do to a stranger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"This was probably one of the most boring movies I have ever seen. To be classified as a horror is a joke.Take my advice and don't waste your time and money on this film. I guarantee you will be as disappointed as I was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not The Right One for Me","review":"I have to go against the majority here as I found this to be boring, slow and also not thought out.I could not waste my time watching all of it so my viewing was limited.I need something to get my attention in the first half hour or I will not watch the rest anymore.I have wasted too much time thinking that they will get better.If this does well maybe I will watch again if I cannot find something else to do.If this little girl vampire has been around for so very long I would think she would be smarter about what she does,also her servant.I would find someone with a little more brains.If this was real she would not of lasted very long,which to me makes this a dumb movie.I just cannot handle anymore movies where the makers think that none of us can use our heads.Now if it does get better (which I doubt)then I apologise for this and I hope you are not offended.Just my opinion.Which I should not have to but some people on here are thin skinned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloooooooooow","review":"I will start by saying I am a total horror/gore fan. I was not impressed with this movie at all. I thought it was too slowly paced and pretty boring at times. I don't see how a few kills make up for minutes upon minutes of boring dialogue. I was not interested in the artsy fartsy scenery or child to child conversation and just found this movie to be painfully dull. My husband thought it was OK, I have to disagree. As a matter of fact, I gave this movie 2 stars and that's being kind."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most believable","review":"A movie on this subject has to either suspend belief or become real and in this case this movie became believable. The ending was what really made this a classic and sold me although all through you could feel that this could have happened."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dubbing Nightmare","review":"First off, I loved this movie. I thought it was haunting and innocent and just really beautiful.My only issue was the dubbing. I expected subtitles, which is fine (I do read, lol!), but this DVD had been dubbed. The voices were TERRIBLE. Didn't match the people and it was just weird.I'll probably re-buy this when they re-release it with the theatrical subtitles.But all in all, a great film!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie, but it won't scare you!!!","review":"This was a well made and well acted movie.However, if you are looking for a movie that will scare you, then this is not it.It is probably 45 percent drama, 45 percent love story and maybe 10 percent horror.If you like movies like Twilight, then this is good for you.If you are looking to get scared, then you need to watch something else, as this will not do the trick!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A good attempt, but a definite rental only.","review":"As a person who has seen this movie, the recent remake, and actually read the book, I can say that this was a good attempt to bring the novel to life, but it falls short. There are so many events and characters that are left out of the movie. It really only focuses on Eli and Oskar ( Abby and Owen ) just like the remake. Most of the disturbing content has been removed (the pedophilia , the flashbacks to Eli's childhood, Virginia's dilemma, the hunt for Harkan (spelling), etc... )However, I must confess that I am not a fan of most foreign films, as the lighting, actors, and all the minor details that make a movie come to life as usually of lesser quality. I found this to be the case once again. If you liked the 2010 remake, which I loved, then this movie is a little closer to the book, but not enough to make me want to watch it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with the movie version","review":"I read the book and was really excited about the DVD coming out, so I pre-ordered it. I will have to say that I wish I wouldn't have wasted my money. The book is hands down much better. It is like all the BEST parts of the book were cut from being in the movie. There are so many areas that the movie strays away from the books original plots that I don't even know where to begin to give examples."},{"rating":"1","title":"wanted to like it","review":"As a fan of vampire movies I wanted to like this movie; I had heard great things about it. I was certainly disappointed. While the story was interesting, and the acting well done (as long as odd and disaffected was what they were going for), the pacing drug (two hours felt like four), and the overall feel made me wonder why Sweden doesn't have a 99% suicide rate."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT FILM!","review":"I saw the trailer for this in either 2006 or 2007 in Manhattan when I was seeing the film \\"Great World of Sound.\\" I had been captivated and waited in suspense for this to come out. I didn't have the chance to see it in theaters. The DVD from Amazon.com comes with the theatrical subtitles. The film isn't your average vampire flick; it's about so much more. It's a foreign film so some parts may seem slow moving, but the film's message was not affected by my cultural differences. I really enjoyed it. The film inspired me to read the book. It's long though so I won't watch it again for a while"},{"rating":"1","title":"Has anyone seen the theatrical version on Blu-Ray?","review":"I have found the theatrical version on regular DVD at Best Buy and Target. However, I have not found a theatrical version on Blu-Ray at any store nor through E-bay. Has anyone out there found a theatrical version on Blu-Ray? For those reading a review for the first time, the movie is great but the first attempt at DVD sucked due to poor subtitles. Look for a version that says \\"Subtitles; English(theatrical)\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"In my opinion, there is no contest between \\"Let The Right One In\\" and \\"Let Me In\\". Hammer Films \\"Let Me In\\" is the better film. It maintains interest throughout. The English script changes are all for the better and the CGI use leaves no doubt that Abby is dangerous. I had absolutely no emotional hook to the children in this Swedish version. After all the hype, I expected much more that the film delivered. The little girl, Eli, looks like an Italian World War II urchin. The type that ran behind American tanks asking, \\"Hey Joe, you got chocolate?\\" Definitely not vampire material. I never once felt that Oskar had the deep feelings for Eli that Owen displayed for Abby. I will say that the scene with Virginia and the cats was a shocking mouth-opener. Also,the main bully in this version is nowhere near as menacing as the one in \\"Let Me In\\". The Matt Reeves film, \\"Let Me In\\" is the one to own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie does NO justice to the book","review":"Having read rave reviews of the movie and the book, I read the book. It's very, very good. Finally watched the movie last night -- very disappointed. The story is chopped up and abbreviated (necessarily so, I guess, to get it into movie length), but for example: the story of Hakan -- absolutely central to the book and running from beginning to end -- is nearly discarded in the movie. And the stories of the gaggle of drunks -- Virginia et al -- is poorly addressed also.The book is wonderful. The movie - not so much. I guess I could say it another way -- if you at all liked the movie, you should DEFINITELY read the book. It's substantially different and will greatly improve on and expand your interest in the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Twelve Forever","review":"I didn't like the casting of this film, I didn't like the amateur acting, and the script had too many holes in it.So why have I watched it four times?Yeah, it's one of those films your brain gets locked into."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the right subtitles","review":"Not happy to receive the older version and not the version shown on page.

They remove most of the subtlety from the tone and characters (see http://iconsoffright.com/news/2009/03/let_the_wrong_subtitles_in_to.html for examples). The movie I saw in theatres was a masterpiece; the movie on this DVD (using subtitles) is a mediocrity. If you are going to buy this DVD, either download and use the theatrical subtitles or use the mediocre dubbing track.

It has been shorting every other day since i bought it. So every other AM I fiddle with it for about 15 minutes to get it signal the proper resolution to the monitor. Shame on me for putting up with it, but from what I read it's a common quality control problem with this cable - so shame on Apple. If the cable cost more than $20 you would see more bad reviews, but at $19 I figure people just suck it up and buy another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loose fit, poor connection = bad product","review":"I'm on my second adapter.

So I got a new one at the Apple store. And now, I'm in the former Soviet Union teaching another political science course. And the adapter is just freaking out. Two days ago, it would send a signal to the projector. But yesterday? No. Today? Nothing. The connection is loose at the usb port - a manufacturing flaw. What am I supposed to do now?

However I find the quality of the conversion from mini-DVI to VGA to be lacking.I expect a certain level of inaccuracies using a VGA cable for an LCD screen (rather than a DVI cable where the signal can be digital all the way from the computer to the monitor), but using the identical monitor plugged into a true VGA port on a different computer, the display is much crisper.On my 1280x1024 resolution 19\\" monitor, the pixels are visibly blurry.

The film has 2 superstars Mithunda & Padmini, a good supporting actor Lt.Vinod Mehra & a conniving villain Shakti Kapoor. The film has memorable songs by Bappida, and good-looking locations.'Hum Intezaar Karenge' is a okay film, where expectations are not even talked-about. This 1989 fare is meant to be seen once, that's it!Coming to the acting department, Mithunda was the no.1 Star when this film was released. He's terrific as always, and steals the show without a doubt. Padmini is good as always. Lt.Vinod Mehra was a very, very fine actor and his work in this film is also commendable.

Most of the women on the contemporary Christian music scene sound like they are cast from the same boring pop mold. If you like that that thing, great. Sarah Brendel has stepped up with a gutsy, moving sound that actually makes you believe that what she is singing comes from the depths of who she is. A faith that is imperfect, seeking, passionate, yet fully enveloped in the security of God's Grace, really the very essence of what it means to be a Christian. Sarah's vocals can be soothing yet edgy, the lyrics are childlike in their beauty, yet deep and haunting. For my own tastes, I would have given this CD five stars, if it were just a bit more alternative or rocky, but still it is well worth the purchase and I look forward to her next work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Microsoft Publisher 2002 creating Electronic Mechanicals","review":"Great book.

This book comes off as clear cut, out-and-out rip- off of the show. It's set in Las Vegas, about the Police Crime Lab (forensics) and features as the protagonist a single mom with a cute six year old daughter...hmmm, sound familar, anybody?Even if Ms. Jaffe honestly came up with this idea BEFORE the TV series was created, some changes should have been made to the book at the editorial state to avoid the obvious comparisons and the overwhelming sense that it's just a \\"rip off\\".Ms. Jaffe is a better writer than this and should be embarrassed! \\"Bad Girl\\" reads like a piece of fan fiction with just the names changed. When the No. 1 TV series in the US is about the Las Vegas Forensics lab, you really have to excercise more judgement than this if you choose to write about the same topic.In short: embarrassing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I bought the book from a radio ad.

I was leary because this is a worn out reference that rarely lives up to its hype. However, I was more than pleasantly surprised, I was downright giddy! It is not a Mats clone, but the lead singer/songwriter Steve Tagliere has a world weary voice like Mr. Westerburg. However, many people have that \\"too many cigs and burbon shots\\" voice.

Some of the movements are fun, but that didn't make up for feeling like you weren't really getting a workout. I'm not into super intense workouts, and even really like the idea of working out in bare feet, but it was way too easy. Also, most of the repetitive movements involve light bending of the knees over and over. I felt like it wasn't very good for my knees because they kept popping and making noise while doing the movements. If you are looking for a fun, very light cardio workout then I would recommend it but not to target the buns or work up a sweat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun workout!","review":"I am a big user of Hemalayaa's video workouts - and I think this one serves as a great warm-up. It helps you change it up when you can select the warm up and then choose which workout you want to do; then pop in another video (now I'm going to try her \\"beautiful belly\\" workout), depending on what you feel like (yoga, weight training). I recommend this as a great warm up video which is fun, and as always Hemalayaa is cool in this video like her others! *The only reason why I wouldnt give it five stars is because she has alot of knee-bending movements in some of the workouts which makes it hard for people like me to do all the moves.

Save you money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better workout than preview, definitely a keeper","review":"On preview, I was not overly enthused with this workout but after finally giving it a try I found it was a lot of fun. Good for light/recovery days, you get about 40 minutes of continuous movement, enough that my headband was soaked when it was through. The pace is doable and the steps are very easy, though if you are uncoordinated like me, it might be a good idea to start with a belly dance basics DVD so that you can learn some of the movements as there are no actual \\"how-to\\" dance instructions. The sections are rather repetitive but for me that's a plus because I really need to work on my figure eights and hip bumps. (To be honest, I need to work on everything!) Hemalayaa has a stunning but approachable beauty and a warm deep voice--a joy to listen to even if her cues are not always where they need to be. She's a pleasant and encouraging instructor who makes the workout inviting, I'll be buying more of her DVDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bollywood Booty and Obliques","review":"I love, love, love this workout.

As always with her material, I am grateful to digest the basic, raw, charming manner in which she conveys some traditional, (quite frankly) sometimes otherwise dry teachings. With her writing and guidance, they are anything but (dry). This book really hits on the necessity of removing our armor, getting out of our comfort zone (no matter what that is), finding out where our personal edge is and lets us to leap from there; to play in the eye of the storm. Even the chapter on tonglen seems more encouraging and compassionate than her other works that I've read, all of which I tremendously enjoyed. This is a tender, bravery-promoting little book that I appreciate rereading whenever I feel a bit numb or scared or too comfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pema Chodron rocks","review":"I have read many of her books, but this one seems to top them all. It is a 30 day retreat where each chapter highlights the topic for the day.I've been a meditator for many years, but Pema reminds me how to do it gently. It seems we all have a need to do it 'right'. She is gentle, humorous and pragmatic. I frequently forget the exact title name and so I call it 'No Way Out'. It sounds harsh but the book actually is encouraging and hopeful."},{"rating":"2","title":"A clear introduction to meditation","review":"The Wisdom of No Escape gives a clear introduction to shamatha-vipashyana meditation (shi-nè and lhatong). Pema Chödrön has a warm and encouraging style with touches of gentle humour. It is an excellent book for those who are new to meditation, or for experienced meditators who would like to experience new vigour in their practice. The book encourages us to make friends with ourselves using the practice of meditation. It is who we are right now that counts. We do not need to purge our neuroses - we simply have to be here and now in order to be fully awake. The practice of meditation helps us to get to know ourselves, without judgements or expectations. Pema Chödrön teaches that the Path of Loving-Kindness begins with ourselves.

I had an inkling before I purchased this, so I didn't mind it, but it is a tricky purchase nonetheless. The video output on the side of our MacBooks (a rectangle with vertical line on each side) are marked the same, but it only means it's video and not necessarily that any Mac video adapter will work. Read the Mac website for the compatibility info before you purchase this item. We used this adapter to connect my MacBook to the EyeClops projector (you can read my review), categorized as toy, but functional for its low price. I wasn't 100% happy with the set-up since the room has to be completely dark for you to see anything well from the projector. With a high-end projector, the possibilities would be endless--I can watch my movies and videos or just browse the web on the living room wall!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, the right adapter","review":"My son and I had tried several sequences of adapters without success.

The zoom function most plasmas and LCD TVs have is 16:9 aspect ratio, whereas Macs are at 16:10 aspect ratio, so you can either cut off the top and bottom of what you're trying to display, or have massive letter-boxing. After three months, I still haven't had any glitches that were this adapter's fault.If you have HDMI or DVI on your TV or projector, don't bother with this. Go straight to DVI with a Mini-dvi to DVI adapter, then get a DVI to DVI cord or a DVI to HDMI cord."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor product and service","review":"Product was not as advertised.

A very well done second book. Not for the squeamish or those annoyed by alliteration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insert Corny Title Here","review":"I'm a huge fan of the TV series, and as such the way I read the book was affected by that. Multiple times I find myself comparing the characters of the show to the ones in the book. That said, the book is good but simply not as good as the television series.I'll spare the plot summary for those who still intend to read the book. But overall, the book is entertaining but repetitive. There's little character development, and for most of the novel you'll feel like you're waiting for it to start. The climax is predictable, but wraps up neatly if it feels rushed.This is a good book to read in parts, or in multiple sessions, something to pass the time idly if you're an avid reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dclever Dtitle Dhere","review":"This was far lighter fare than I expected a book about a serial killer who kills serial killers to be. It reminded me a lot of reading the Fletch books. The result was that I chewed through it far faster than I'd planned. I'm not sure how I ought to feel about a smart ass psychopath as a protagonist, but I enjoyed it.I don't have a degree in psychology, so I couldn't tell you how accurate the portrayal was, but it felt like the author was giving me a credible accounting of the brain of somebody trying to act normal because he instinctively has no idea what normal is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dearly Devoted Dexter","review":"Christmas gift for my son he loves them I love the price and the fact he got them in time for Christmas"},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was a gift.","review":"This book was a gift.

This may not be the case here. While it is not as forehead smacking dimwitted as the first, it is has it's moments of unbeleiveablity. How can Dexter be so attractive that women throw themselves at him, and such a good pretender of being human that he can be oblivous when women like him? The only women who was not attracted to him has been his foster sister, and I kind of think it might be only a matter of time. I also dislike how every person who is his foe ends up dead or out of commission. Are they going to introduce a new character to be \\"on to him\\" every book? This is not only frustrating but it shows that the author is completely incapable of developing any character or relationship longer than a few pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Black Humor for sure!!","review":"I have read both installments of this Dexter series, and they are certainly unusual. I found myself chuckling often during this story, and then I would feel horrified at myself for laughing at such gory stuff. That's just the way the whole book went. It is really so outlandish, that it's hard to take seriously. But then, why was I so eager to see how the plot played out? I'm anxious to see what is in store for Dexter next."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dearly Devoted Dexter","review":"I Love the DEXTER series ...the book comes pretty close to the show.

I hope. Haven't yet moved on to the third book in the series, which may get Mr. Lindsay back on track.Dearly Devoted Dexter requires the reader to suspend belief too, too far. It's as if the LE characters are entirely free agents within their county and federal organizations, and have nothing else to do but work on this case in which one agent knows the killer but for whatever stupid reason, chooses not to share the identity with others. Not to mention all four characters agree for a stupid, unsupported reason not to alert target victims to their upcoming demise.And the little sidebar with young Cody as a possible pre-pubescent psychopath for Dexter to raise up in the Right Harry Path? Too much.There's enough witty prose to earn the two stars, otherwise it's merely Drearily Dismal Dreck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-climatic Dexter","review":"Dexter presented a clever plot that dragged along the way and had several aspects that didn't quite make sense. Like why would they allow a co-worker from the Police Department in effect stalk another employee during non-work hours. Sgt. Doakes did this and Dexter blithely allowed it to happen when he had a simple solution. And the ending was quite anti-climatic with the murderous villian, Dr. Danco - well, I won't spoil it by revealing it except to say, (shrugs)... Good work, but not overwhelmed and in places, bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"cruel and sadistic book","review":"The entire tone of this book is cruel and sadistic: not just in the attitude of Dexter, but in the self-centered and unempathic nature of all of the characters. For example, early on in the book, a man who has been horrible tortured is found, but not one of the people, including the police, go in to help him. He is treated as a vegtable not just by Dexter, but by everyone more absorbed in their own feelings of horror. Although the man is finally reluctantly treated by the paramedics, there is never any mention of anyone treating him as a human being. At every plot point, every character is more absorbed with how events impact them than any empathic response to the victims. It would be acceptable and interesting if this book confined itself to representing the psychopathic personaliy of Dexter, but the tone of the book is much broader and disturbing. Despite some sarcastic observations It is not at all a dark comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dexter: Choose Life","review":"Even more so than \\"Darkly Dreaming Dexter\\", \\"Dearly Devoted Dexter\\" gives the reader more insight into Dexter Morgan's fascinating personality. Pursuing a different \\"killer\\" (this slasher leaves his victims barely alive) than in the first novel, Dexter reluctantly teams up with Doakes to catch the perpetrator before more victims fall prey to his surgical precision. As if Dexter's life isn't complicated enough, he somehow inadvertently ends up engaged to Rita in one of the most delightfully morbid and hilarious scenes in the book (I won't spoil it for you, though). Rife with Dexter's edgy, oft-misunderstood sense of humor, this book is another worthy addition to your Dexter collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Dearly Devoted Dexter.

Zao has influenced the post-hardcore, metalcore, metal, and hardcore scenes more than most and this album was the catalyst. Harsh and high screams, brutal drumming (before it was all about \\"how fast can you play double bass\\"), and lyrics that have put intelligence back into this scene make this album a must for any Zao fan and one to check out to any fan of the scene."},{"rating":"2","title":"wikiiid","review":"Not their best album but by no means abad CD... i could listn o this constantly... just not as much as I could self titled.

Songs like Lies of Serpents, A River Of Tears and To Think of You Is To Treasure An Absent Memory make this album a standout in the metal world, but is by no means Zao's best material. I highly reccomend their self titled, Liberate Te Ex Inferis, or even their newest release on Ferret Records entitled The Funeral of God. These guys are great at what they do and have worked through many member changes and other hazards a band in the underground music world may confront, but have survived. Support this band and buy their albums, don't steal off the internet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pound for Pound the most intense hardcore band ever","review":"I have never seen a more powerful band than these guys and they really blow the lid off of all previous expectations.

Their lead singer has a hardcore screaming style that bands in this genre will be trying to immitate for years to come. The reason(atually there are 2 reasons) I didn't give this album 5 stars is the fact that the guitars aren't turned up enough, and the last track \\"Violet\\" is immensely dry and stupid. Whoever played the piano on this track played the exact same little simplistic tune for over 7 minutes straight. I listened to about 3 minutes of the song and pressed the fast forward on my CD player,not thinking they would actually torture their listeners with this monotonous attempt at a \\"poetic\\" song. I was wrong. All in all it is a worthy attempt. I hope their new album is recorded with more power, maybe they should hook the amp up to their lead singers vocal chords."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't get any better than this!","review":"This is so far my favorite Zao album.

I know we still have many miles to go in the journey of equality and justice, but we can praise God that that we are no longer living under this peculiar institution. This is also a good reminder to be aware of, and in defense of, those still in bondage in one form or another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak and meandering","review":"I wanted to like this book more, but it's not great, even for the Tekumel enthusiast.The story involves the old characters Harsan, Trinesh and Naru, on a diplomatic mission to Salarvya following the death of that country's king. Harsan is written woodenly, and his two companions might as well not be there. The plot doesn't really go anywhere, and the key element that you think the story is going to address peters out unresolved before the book's conclusion.I hope the (eagerly anticipated) new books MARB is planning on writing will be more like the rather fine Man of Gold and Lords of Tsamra, and less like this (though I'll probably read them all anyway.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Family Book","review":"An excellent book and concept that every family with small children will benefit from."},{"rating":"2","title":"Broken Music","review":"It's nice to see someone who is well known also went through issues with his mother's infidelity problem. Sting was felt a loyalty to his father because his mother had cheated on him for several years. Yet he watched his father grow old, and his father still loved his mother. It took Sting a few years to figure out why his father still loved his mother.This book also covers Stings problems with the band the Police. And he comes across his own issue of infidelity when he finds he's no longer in love with his first wife. I really like this book and I read it during the right time in my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crisp Writing and a Highly Engaging Read","review":"The resonance was extrordinary having lived through the same era (roughly the same age as Sting). Sting was able to create a jet stream of his personal drama that I was able to slip into and ride through a life I will never live but felt as if I was. As a come-lately and erstwhile bass player, probably lost in the reality of gigging for pennies the rest of my life, I was transfixed by his incredible, yet wholly believable journey and transformation from a dime-a-dozen super talent to pop-icon/legend. In some small way, I'm sure I have been forever changed by reading his book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Singer Can WRITE....","review":"Having never been much of a fan of Sting's various bands(except for a few tunes from \\"Police\\"), I wasn't quite sure why I picked up this book to read, except that I had read a few reviews which made it clear it was NOT about his superstar exploits, which hold no interest for me. But if you want to learn about Sting, the boy, the man, the singer, AND the writer...it is an absolutely incredible piece of work. He takes you so intimately into his life growing up in a small town in Northern England and gives you an incredible portrait of someone who clearly remembers where he came from, and how that affected who he became...AWESOME reading! I'm going out today to buy one of his CD's too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great musician, lousy book","review":"I am a Sting fan, so I take no delight in saying, \\"Ohmigosh. What a lousy book this is.\\" The way it flows (or doesn't), the point of view (super megalomaniacal), and the very language it uses, just put me off. The writing is pretentious. The stories don't come together as a book. And I found his point of view, three pages describing a gig 30 years ago, two sentences about the birth of his first child, kind of shocking. It would have been more apt if he called this a book about his journey in being a musician, not a memoir. Because unless you're completely OBSESSED with music, as he is, you feel that the \\"life\\" part of this autobiography is eerily missing. I take no joy in writing a negative review, but I admire him less after reading this. Borrow it from the library if you must read it, but don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great musician who needs an editor","review":"I was a rabid Police fan starting back in 1980 and have admired Sting ever since. I knew when I bought this book that it would discuss his life before the Police, and that was fine. I was interested to learn more about Last Exit and Frances and his childhood, so I have no complaints with the content.But his writing style stands in the way of the story. It is pompous and egotistical with pretentious metaphors and a really annoying habit of switching between past and present tense. I could just picture him sitting there with a thesaurus trying to find the most intellectual-sounding way to say each thing he wanted to say.The foreshadowing \\"teasers\\" started getting to me, too: \\"Little did I know then that this person [or moment or event] would change my life forever.\\" Over and over and over. Ugh.He really needed somebody to reign him in on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Used to Like Sting","review":"The story of Sting's life written by Sting. I thought he might elaborate on his teaching career, family life, etc. things the average person might not know about him. Or a biographer might not write as well. The story is basically full of the bands that Sting was in, where they went, what venues they played, etc. Sting never describes what it was like to be a father or what the kids are like.If you want to be private don't write a book. He also seems a little taken with his own looks, intellect, and talent. We all know that, you don't have to tell us and make us pay to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"I got to know him and he is human.","review":"Like a lot of people, I was hesitant to read this book. I had red some bad reviews with statements like 'Sting makes infuriating remarks foreshadowing the significance of events that he never substantiates.' I couldn't disagree more and frankly I think these people missed the boat in a big way. I loved the book and it really surprised me. After reading it I felt as though I could have grown up next door to Gordan and we could have ridden bikes together. I loved his honesty about how he used the punk scene as a ticket to a record deal. I also empathized strongly with his harsh words towards his mother which broke both of their hearts. Gordon & Sting is a man, a human, who has a great love of music (like many of us do) and a level of talent (that most of don't :-). I came away feeling that there was no single distillable factor to his success and that he, like a lot of people we know, is a cool guy who could be working down the hall from any us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extremely well written","review":"It really should come as no surprise -- though for some reason it did for me -- that Sting would be an exceptionally talented writer.

I have read dozens of them. This is by far the best one yet. Not because I am a huge fan of Sting's music. I like it okay, but he is not my favorite artist by a long shot, but despite this I am telling you right now that this is a very interesting, insightful, entertaining and down right hilarious book to read. I highly recommend it! It has all of the elements you are looking for in a book of this genre. I couldn't put it down and I found myself laughing out loud frequently throughout. Also, I have to say that my respect for Sting as an artist and as a man went up tremendously and I found myself downloading lots of his music after reading this delightful book.

I am 38 and grew up with the Police, but they weren't my favorite band. And I never got into his solo stuff. I say that because it probably affected my view of the book.Sting can write. He has a great vocabulary and his writing is lyrical. The problem is that Sting is full of himself with an ego the size of Britain. And the stuff that I wanted him to get into, like his affair, or his time with the Police, were not in the book. I guess the book was o.k., but I can't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great holiday read","review":"Sting's autobiography is an interesting and enjoyable read.

His band back at the time was one of his best bands, and his songwriting was at a peak.When A Tree Falls, Tibetan Side of Town, Understanding Nothing are Bruce at his best in terms of philosophical stream-of-consciousness poetry.Others, like The Gift and Anything Can Happen are straightforward songs with Bruce's unique perspective on life. There are only a couple songs on here that could have been replaced with better songs. But it's all very listenable and if you're a Bruce fan you MUST have this album.If you're not a Bruce fan already, this might not be your best introduction to him.

They lack brain power to even comprehend what is good. All they know is that they can't put anything out better than \\"Right Now\\", which was so bad that they shouldn;t have even put it out on the radio.The biggest mistake of life was not cheating on my wife, stealing $1500 dollars from a cash register or shooting someone at point blank range, it was buying this album.So, if there are any smart people out there, you'll listen to things like Barbra Streisand or Bette Midler."},{"rating":"1","title":"R.I.P","review":"Iam a Korn fan so dam anyone whos gona say im another nu metal bashar.

At all. I am not, nor apparently will ever be, a Korn fan.But it's a fine greatest hits album that presents the requisite tunes, adds a few cuts for the fans, and a nifty little extra DVD for value.That's a four-star CD, whether or not you're a fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is \\"Thoughtless?\\"","review":"How can you have a Korn greatest hits album without their best song: \\"Thoughtless.\\" It certainly should have beaten out an unimaginative retread of an overplayed (and overrated) Pink Floyd song."},{"rating":"1","title":"Censored","review":"I really wish I would have looked more closely before buying this.

For all of you who has bought this album, I feel bad for you.

Save perhaps Nevermind, no album has had a more negative effect on real metal than Korn's self titled. How can any band with equivalent technical skills to a pop-punk band claim to be metal? Angelwitch was metal, Sodom was metal, Carcass was metal, but Korn was never metal. Hell, even Poison was more metallic than Korn. Being metal doesn't stem from how low you can tune your guitar or how loudly you can scream about being molested as a child, but rather from the proficiency you display using your instruments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not Great!!","review":"If you are a korn fan, and you only like their hit songs then this is a CD for you.I am a korn fan and already have all of their CD's with these hit songs, and the the remake song from Pink Floyed and their new song word up don't make it a worthy purchase, however, this CD contains most of the best/heavy songs by korn.If you have all of the previous korn albums, then i do not recomend this CD.It is still a great album..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Korn sucks","review":"Korn has to be the worst band on the face of the planet. Everyone says they invented new metal. Even if that's true, that means that Korn invented the worst genre ever. And yes, that means worse than rap. In their greatest hits pamphlet, they said they got rid of cheesy rock cliches like solos and power chords. What idiots, solos are what show talent. Korn probably just didn't do any solos because they lack what Metallica and Led Zeppelin have: talent. Also, everybody says that Korn's seven string guitars are innovative, but what's the point of having seven strings if you only play three of them.

In my opinion its fairly obvious this is a money making ploy, considering that Take A Look In The Mirror flopped, and nu-metal itself is a sinking ship. The two new songs are awful, honestly. \\"Word Up\\" is definitely a new direction for the band, but is that really a good thing? It was awful in the first place as a techno song so making it into an equally pathetic genre; nu-metal, doesnt help it much.

In fact, I remember hearing Korn's hit being piped over the public address system and thinking that it was just mediocre compared to an act like Fear Factory. Korn has no talent, and they take all their money to the bank just like many of the poser 80s metal bands. My favorite bands at the time were Megadeth, Slayer, and Sepultura, (so it's not l thought they were too heavy!), but my impression of Korn has been that they are some kind of weak rock band gone horribly wrong that got popular in the same way that the New Kids on the Block Did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good God","review":"Wheres good god on this cd?

I wrote them and they better make it right I will even take a used copy JUST NOT EDITED!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good metal CD","review":"I think that Korn is probably one of the best metal bands out there right now, except for System of a Down, who are the best metal band ever! (Go SOAD!!!) This CD has strong points and weak points, but it is overall a solid release. If you can handle the punch-in-the-face metal sound and strong language, then you should definately check this one out."},{"rating":"2","title":"So much missing...","review":"Not a bad set, could have used a few more BETTER songs though. Faget, No place to hide, Good god, Thoughtless, It's on and maybe Balltounge should have made the cut. But they dident, instead they put on alot more of their new material, which ain't to bad, but not as great as their old stuff. As i said, awesome set I totally dig thier new cover songs, especially \\"word up\\", quite a catchy tune. I just hope that they don't go the way as limp bizkit-(bad example)-and forget about rock and start doing rap and hip hop-so glad follow the leader is the only album of its kind). If your a fan of korn, it's worth the money - GET IT, RIGHT NOW."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark-X reveiws (Korn's 2004 album - Greatest Hits)","review":"This album has Korn's past hits, a song remix,two new songs, and has a DVD which is good so far. This album deserves my 5 star rating. Korn fans will NOT be disapointed. You shouldn't liste to the ratings of non-Korn fans because if you are a fan, your opinion of the album may be different. Worthy of the money and the best album I ever purchased.Look for other music reveiws from Dark-X"},{"rating":"2","title":"KoRn Greatest Hits Volume 1 Rocks!","review":"This CD is awesome! With it, you will be rocking all day and all night! It's a great CD to introduce you to the band! Some parents wouldn't be okay with their children listening to it because of the lyrics, but my parents let me! Even my mom likes this CD!!! I went to Holiday Havoc 2004, a rock concert with KoRn, the Used, My Chemical Romance, and a local band called Magna-Fi. They all rocked, but KoRn played for over an hour and a half! The DVD reminds me of this concert!!!My conclusion: Some of KoRn's greatest hits were not put on this CD, but hey, it's only volume 1!!! Go out and buy this CD/DVD combo, you won't regret it!

But what's disappointing is that there's not much revelations on the characters neither."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good novel and a good addition to the B5 canon.","review":"This author has done her homework! The novel fits beautifully into the Babylon five universe, and the characters are consistent and believable. More than that, characters who are secondary or little-explored on-screen are given a life which enhances the entire creation. I now see Anna Sheridan as a person, which I didn't from the TV episodes. But it goes beyond that. This is a novel in its own right - well written, and well structured and paced, with a proper beginning, middle and ending. And what an ending! Viewers familiar with the B5 story know in advance that it is heading inevitably for tragedy, but I wonder how it would be for a naive reader? This sort of story isn't supposed to be so bleak, and the ending would be doubly powerful if it came right out of the blue. An excellent read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pleasing Filler","review":"This was a very well written book that actually surprised me with a story I thought I knew. The only problem is how the book ties to the station itself and John Sheridan at the end - it seemed sloppy, like an afterthought. But, all-in-all a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sheridans' Story","review":"This book was the first one I read of the series. The story alternates between the two Sheridans, elaborating the scenes seen in \\"Revelations\\",adding the background and telling about what went before. We hear about John's command on Agamemnon and Anna's exploration mission on the rim.The signifigance of the snow-globe and Morden's pendant come clear.I read the book in one session, but then again, I kept hoping for more 'action' on Agamemnon, which made me read 'just another' chapter. Some have said that Morder doesn't act like him, but they might not remember that no-one has seen how Morden really acted before he went to Z'ha'dum. The only thing that managed to bother me was that John Sheridan seemed to be all too forgiving for Spano & co. A more fitting punishment would'vebeen in order. Can't really talk about people being in-character or out of it, but I can certainly imagine how these events molded them over time.The events take place before \\"Shadow Dancing\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect way to get more insight into the Shadows","review":"I've started reading this book this morning, and I just couldn't stop. This is the best book I've read in a long time, and the first one that interested me so much that I finished it in one day. This, in my thoughts, pushes \\"Accusations\\" (B5 book #2) to second place.The breath-taking story of how Morden turned into what he is and how Anna disappeared is fascinating. It is interesting to find out that Morden wasn't as bad as he is before he became a Shadow servent.The story of the Agamemnon and John Sheridan is very interesting too. Linking Sheridan to Babylon 5's safety even before the idea of him becoming it's captain came up is very clever and exciting.Also, explaining why Kosh was the last ambassador to come to Babylon 5 in a 'by the way' manner is very good. It has a subtle power and importance to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent list of favorites","review":"This is an excellent book, probably the best of the \\"Burpee Expert Gardener\\" series; it consists of Peter Schneider's favorite 400 or so rose cultivars, with many photographs and some broader cultural tips and information on classes of rose. That said, there are larger and more complete lists of roses, and more comprehensive guides to rose care; if Schneider doesn't like it, or if it wasn't in commerce before 1995, you won't find it here. I don't see that as much of a loss, as keeping the book to a manageable heft, and easing the choice of rose varieties, is worth the tradeoff if the editor's judgements are worthy. (Schneider, who boasts of having personally grown 1,400 rose varieties, mostly in Ohio, co-edits the Combined Rose List.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"3M 2000AG ... fail","review":"Purchased the 3M 2000AG overhead projector and was pleased with its performance and ease of use until the fourth time I used it.

Glen Ford as the hapless officer, is also very convincing. A sit back, relax and escape out your living room movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun movie","review":"The Teahouse Of The August Moon (DVD) Marlon Brando, Glenn FordGlenn Ford and Marlon Brando at their best, in a fun movie with an underlining of early, post war prejudise against the Japanese. The picture quality is great with very good original sound. The only negative comment I have is, this release is in Letter Box format. Even with my Wide Screen TV there is a lot of top and bottom black, unused space."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cricket Cages & Getas","review":"This movie has been a favorite for many years. My family loves it - especially since my Mother was an Okinawan from Okinawa. Marlon Brando is great as the \\"guide\\". He's pretty slick and really runs the whole show. My favorite, of course, is the ending (spoiler alert) - when they unveil the teahouse. It is so beautiful. It really is a story about what can be accomplished when everyone works together and it is also a story about accepting people as they are and recognizing each person has a talent of some sort."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD???","review":"When will we see a DVD??? (in widescreen please) Loved the movie but watching it on fullscreen VHS does ruin things a bit. Hope Warner Brothers will see what a gem theyve got in this movie and release a DVD soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Teahouse of the August Moon","review":"Teahouse is an exceptionally good comedy, especially looking at all the horrible tripe put out the last 20 years as \\"comedy\\". Marlon Brando is a scream in this movie and you are hooked in the first 30 seconds. Unfortunately, the VHS version is a P & S version and the movie suffers greatly. But there is an alternative! The widescreen version is 'available'. Turner Classic Movies shows this movie about twice a year in the letterbox format."},{"rating":"2","title":"May August moon give gentle joy!","review":"This is the film of John Patrick's 1954 Pulitizer-prize winning adaptation of Vern Sneider's 1951 novel. It is a joy from start to finish. Brando turns in one of his most striking performances -- you can see him having a great time in the role of the \\"alchemist\\" Sakini, forever making things turn out right. The Japanese cast members acquit themselves excellently, with special mention due to Machiko Kyo as the geisha Lotus Blossom. The work is beautifully filmed and a real pleasure. Look for Eddie Albert and Harry Morgan (MASH) in supporting roles. The Teahouse of the August Moon gives gentle joy, and, fifty years on, shows very little sign of age. It is a fragile but strong structure, one of the happiest films I know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teahouse","review":"This is really funny. This is an old movie, but you get to see Marlon Brando play a young Japanese interpreter with an accent that you sometimes struggle to understand. You will really enjoy this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"Glenn Ford's whacky portrayal of a misfit captain and Marlon Brando as the Okinawan interpreter present a hilarious satire of U.S. occupation following WWII."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing and Tiresome","review":"The socialist or perhaps Marxist viewpoint is expressed by the kids' teacher early enough to confirm what one already suspects: there's not going to be much light anywhere in this tunnel. Realist cinema of this nature was groundbreaking in the mid-20th century. This contemporary film's writer and director seem to expect audiences to be shocked by the characters' adoption of supposedly American ghetto slang and behavior. Or to be less than wearied by the petty, territorial machinations that are supposedly as close as these characters will come to any real sort of power. The only silver lining comes with the implication that art at least provides an outlet or even hope. But even this is pretty much smashed. So - shall we all buy guns and just end it now? I wish I'd turned the thing off instead of basing my expectations on the good reviews on the film's box - apparently another example of reviewers positively rating a film for its message rather than for any true artistic merit."},{"rating":"1","title":"product OK, but shipping is a disaster","review":"The staples are normal, but the box was blown apart by the poor job of packing this for shipping.

I bought a whole new assembly a few years ago and the weld broke for no good reason. The weld makes it easy to open or close the strainer. I bought a second one and 6 months later the chrome was peeling off the strainer. I thought I had Amazon lined up to provide a refund but instead they sent me another POS. The chrome was peeling off the strainer as it came out of the box. To make matters worst - Amazon actually charged me a restocking fee and sent me to this website in my search to get the restocking fee refunded. So here it is - Lasco defective parts and Amazon poor thinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"RnB ja mmmm ..... next","review":"I suppose if you a fan this DVD would just be too awsome NOT to have in your collection but unfortunately Mr. Legend does NOT do it for me.

The thin rubber that covers the ipod screen tends to create bubbles between the rubber and the ipod. This makes it very difficult to view the screen. To prevent this, I tried to force all the bubbles out by pushing them to the edges of the screen. The bubbles always came back. So, I began to stretch the rubber so that it would hover over the ipod. This worked until the thin rubber got worn, and broke. Also, the rubber used to protect the rest of the ipod attracts foreign material, and gets full of it when you put the ipod in your pocket. A positive aspect of this jacket is that it does allow you easy access to the ipod, and all its features. Also, as advertised, the jacket does fit the ipod like a glove. However, this makes it quit a hassle if you wish to take the ipod out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks!","review":"First of all, it's old, so the of course it's going to be cheesy. I was willing to look past that. But most of the DVD shows guys drawing how they're going to enter a turn and to pick out certain points in the road... they repeat it over.. and over....and over... and over.. I had to stop the DVD before I even made it half way through. I finally decided to start watching it again the next day.. and guess what?.. more drawing! I have learned more watching videos on YouTube than I did from this video - nothing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I needed","review":"I bought this for advice on how to ride with more confidence. It has certainly given me that with just the first viewing. It you are looking for a DVD with great acting and excellent production then get a life!!! (maybe get a copy of Easy Rider!!) This is about how to ride a bike properly and it does that with ease, with great tips on just about every aspect of riding. The only thing that I found was that it is directed more towards racing, picking lines and powering out of corners (great fun) which is not that easy when you are cruising down an unknown road!!! But all in all I have found it extremely helpful and my riding confidence and skills have increased massively. I also bought the book and it makes a great companion to reference back to certain points.For riding tips I give it 4 stars"},{"rating":"1","title":"Time to update...","review":"I love the series of books but this DVD falls down. The material and footage is dated. The shots do not nearly go far enough to take advantage of really letting us see what is being discussed.

This medium could be the icing on the cake for the series but it's really more the box you throw away to get to the books..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Of Very Little Use and Incredibly Tough to Watch","review":"I'll go further than most and say this is pretty useless, even for beginners. Showing racing lines in overhead shots is better done watching Speed Channel. The concentration needed to ride is discussed, and worthy of about 2 minutes explanation. You would expect more about techniques, and maybe some stuff taught at the schools. This DVD, rightly or wrongly, made me decide NOT to go to Keith Code school."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money","review":"This dvd is terrible. I bought it in the hopes that it would be presented differently than his books, but it is just the same. Keith uses ten-cent euphmisms like \\"products\\" and \\"points of timing\\" and whatnot, when all he is talking about is negotiating a turn. Pick your braking point, your turn in, and go. Simple. Faster the better.Keith has a promising career in middle management ahead of him.Also, the \\"humorous\\" bits and the pauses between them account for WAY too much of this vid."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for beginers alike","review":"picked up this dvd because ive heard a decent amount about it on a forumn im on. a bit outdated( made in 1990 or something) but the information is great. helps for those looking to get started into track riding, but some very valuable information for beginner riders as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"For Freaks only","review":"I love the residents.

It's very difficult finding good electronic music without hearing it first (especially if you only like a small amount of what's out there), but you probably know that, so I'll spare you the trouble and tell you what it's like. This CD is like old video game music, but not even as good as say, the Mario theme. It's repetitive, boring bleeping noises accompionied by thin beats and robot voices. The high point of the album is when they attempt some drum & bass and come off sounding like Fat Boy Slim in his sleep.

They also give you history around it, so for me.. .this becomes great learning opportunities for my kids (and myself) especially when you see it affect a battle.My only wish is that the expansion price reflected what you get... but hey, I still pay it :-) and it's getting good raiting, so I guess you could argue it's worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive Disappointment","review":"I have owned many Panasonic cordless phones so I didn't blink when I forked over $400 for this 4 line beauty.You need to know 3 things about this phone.1 My customers tell me my voice fades in and out from the corded base.2 The range on the hand set varies from acceptable to pathetic from the same location.3 The hand set stopped functioning after 13 months."},{"rating":"1","title":"AVOID THIS SYSTEM AT ALL COSTS","review":"We bought this system when it was released.

After using the previous generation 4000 for about five years and experiencing the (apparently typical) problems with #1 and general quality, I decided to spring for the new version.I was excited about new features like mute (surprisingly absent from the 4000) and speaker phone on the handsets, and figured the newer version would fix some of the general quality issues I had with the 4000.All I can say is that this phone is a piece of junk. It is cheap, poorly constructed, and doesn't feel at all like a commercial-grade or even high-quality consumer product. Speaker phone is horrible, range is poor, call quality is bad from the base unit or handsets. Almost every conversation I have, at some point the other party asks me to speak up, or couldn't hear me or whatever.I'm returning this phone immediately and trying the RCA product, which has gotten some bad reviews also.

The most important qualities are durability and range. One handset is used by the warehouse manager and looks like it has been dragged by a rope on the ground for 2 years. Still works great. Our office is concrete block with a steel door leading to the 11,000s.f. metal warehouse. The signal fades at the very end of the 200' warehouse, but is clear within that range.

When I saw this collection I thought it would be a great way to introduce Miss Temple to my daughter while also watching some of the fun stories she's familiar with acted out. I was very wrong.First of all, Shirley Temple is in her mid-thirties and only narrates the stories. There are some pieces where she does play a small part but the show mostly focuses on other child actors and guest stars such as Jonathan Winters, Agnes Moorehead, etc. It was like watching cheap plays done at an elementary school. The acting and writing are very poor and the production and set quality are also poor.There is a reason this TV show was cancelled after only one season. My daughter lost interest after only three mintues and I did after five. I am giving this away to our local library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful collection for children; excellent price","review":"Anyone thinking they are getting a collection of Shirley Temple the Child Star movies will be disappointed.

I think he made the right decision, and he describes the action very well. I was not distracted by being familiar with the story, and I think that the unique individual who has not seen the film would obtain a good grasp of the tale by reading this book.

There she must provide story material for the famed heroine Shahrazade, who is desperately trying to stay alive and thus save the lives of other young women by providing continual entertainment for the Sultan. Marjan is smuggled out of the palace in a variety of disguises and sets out through the bazaar of the city in search of an old blind storyteller, whom she remembers to be a rich source of tales.

First of all, what has she DONE to the fabulous story of Shahrazad? Practically torn it apart and sewed it back together with very rough stitches. I read this book trying to get away from the stereotype some writers have of typical \\"weak\\" women (I am partial to strong heroines with wit) and therefore thought another retelling of Shahrazad would be just the thing.Well, it turned out I was wrong and this book just had the stereotype I was looking to get away from.If you want a strong heroine, if you've been disappointed by this book and how it portrays Shahrazad, go read Cameron Dokey's version (called \\"The Storyteller's Daughter). In all, that is a much more satisfying read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time Waster","review":"I rarely write negative reviews. Im just trying to help fellow movie junkies.

It was a colossal disappointment to say the least. Whereas the other two were light and witty and the hero was charming, this book was dark and depressing and the hero was an egoistic, jealous, and above all--STUPID bore. It was obvious from the word go who had abducted his boyfriend. So for nine tenths of the book, in spite of the school of red herrings that were constantly thrown at us, we were left to agonize at his ineptitude. And then there's the ending! Believe me it was all for nothing. Stick with the two books I've mentioned.

The movie was perfect, and the soundtrack is also. There are a wide variety of songs including solos, duets, and a song with a larger ensemble.

All in all, it is a very well-rounded album, and one of the best soundtracks ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"How refreshing and beautiful. A story of love that isn't cheapened by sex. The music is moving and I can't wait to get the soundtrack. The film has a certain amatuer feel to it, that was entirely appropriate and didn't distract from the story. Two people who fall in love but can't do anything about it. They sadly move on with their lives, and with the audiences best wishes and hopes."},{"rating":"1","title":"a little disappointed","review":"I loved the music in the movie and expected to love the soundtrack, too. But for some reason, I don't enjoy listening to these songs on their own. It seems that I need to SEE these songs being sung. Without the video component, the intensity of the singing doesn't work for me. Instead of being moved by it, I'm made to feel uncomfortable. In its defense, I should mention that I may be older than the target age group. I thoroughly enjoyed the movie, and the music in that context."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loses a little something","review":"After seeing Once I was interested in buying the soundtrack since I liked the movie and the songs.

The film is a little jewel, an utterly convincing and moving story of two struggling Dublin musicians, played by Glen Hansard and Marketa Irglova.

A good friend with discriminating taste referred me to the soundtrack and movie. Absolutely amazing! It accomplishes what few soundtracks/albums ever have in that it not only blows you away the first time you hear it, but it also grows on you over time/repeated listening. (The genius in the depth and continuity became strikingly apparent over time.)The soundtrack, like the movie, is the epitamy of bittersweet. It makes you cry, but doesn't make you sad. It says everything (really a global message) without saying anything in particular. Meaning is especially enhanced after viewing the movie.If you love music, I strongly recommend the purchase of both.

They create magical melodies on the soundtrack. Hansard is the lead singer of the Irish band the Frames, whose recent releaseThe Costis a must buy, and Irglova is a classically trained pianist.

Anyway, I've become a new fan of both the Frames and Glen Hansard. The music he and Merketa make together is exceptional. Everyone I've turned on to them has loved it.

To my dismay I heard a loud gush of air as the roll went nearly flat. I'm absolutely disappointed with this product. I also ordered Original Roll in standard firmness and it isn't much better. And to answer the burning question, no, I'm not 300 pounds or a big guy in any capacity. I weigh about 170 and neither product does much of anything in terms of lower back support.

The games are typical of Lasker - all fighting games ( there are losses) and all show his grim determination to win. But the best part is the biography. Lasker was a highly intelligent man, who only played chess out of necessity. We are treated to a description of his youth, his relationship with his brother, Berthold, who became a famous Doctor. But the real story is his romancing of Martha his wife. Great human interest, great chess, and we also get the crosstables for the events that Lasker played in.

Yes, in the line of literature judging on sentence structure, vocabulary, and others it was a great book I just wished they would have added a little something more.

To have Maestro Domingo talk about the role and explain in detail his perceptions of the character is priceless! He goes into detail about his roles in Il Trovatore andErnani in which he is an extraordinary performer of these characters as well. His presence on the stage in these roles andhis golden tenor voice result in outstanding experiences for the audience. At no time does he take the performancesfor granted or give less then his all when performing them.

It would be the hip thing to do. Unfortunately I don't see their recorded output in the same rose-tinted light as most of the reviewers here. Richard's huge ego got in the way of everything they did and poor Mimi, even with her knockout beauty, is a background player throughout. Their \\"harmony\\" singing is mediocre. Richard's singing is weak at best. His endless noodling on the dulcimer gets tiresome after one track and becomes unbearable. There's a reason the folk boom went bust: this kind of thing is incredibly tedious especially when compared with what someone like Bob Dylan was doing at the same time, same general scene. There's also a reason why \\"Reflections in a Golden Wind\\" has been readily available in bargain bins--got mine for 50 cents--for 35 years: it's not very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful and functional book.","review":"This is one of the most beautiful books on minerals and fossils that I've ever seen.

We Three Kings are appropriately Eddie Nichols (Royal Crown Revue), Broccoli Rob (Dem Brooklyn Bums)and Swingerhead's Michael Andrew. They create an instant classic for lovers of punk influenced swing.One of my favorites is a Swingerhead original called Mistletoe Mambo. It's saucy and infused with bongo and Babaloo beats. It makes you want to siddle up to a swanky muchacha and lead her right to the mistle toe.

Low and behold here's the audio proof. While some people may complain that \\"Testament hasn't written anything new\\" in this CD, well take a look at other band's new stuff…it really sucks!!!! The law of a good metal fan is that the oldest stuff is the best stuff. The new crap never holds the same intensity of the old stuff. The Testament/Legacy members haven't lost a step at all, and all the guitar work is top notch. And plus after seeing the original Legacy members at Thrash of the Titans in August, Steve Souza's appearance is a welcome one on this CD. Totally surprised me. So a job well done to the Testament/Legacy bandmates!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Testament continues to amaze","review":"This album is worth the purchase. If there is one band you have to support, it's Testament. Don't cheap out and download the MP3's.The songs Testament decided to re-record are unique - each one showing the new sound and brutal riffage Peterson continues to make. Skolnick is in good form, though his tone is considerably docile compared to the original recordings. He makes a caveat of that on his website though. The leads are almost the same as the original, but Skolnick puts his creative license in use and changes them here and there - I liked it, as it made these recordings even more unique. The vocals are brutal - Billy forsakes the higher-end notes in the original songs for growls, which just adds to the brutality. Souza makes a cameo on two songs - Alone in the Dark and Reign of Terror - his vocals aren't anything to write home about, but it's nice to see The Guys wax nostalgic.Buy this album and enjoy the past come to the present!Testament continues to rule..."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Testament","review":"This is a great disc. Testament is an awesome group and their sound (no matter who's playing) is unlike any other band. When you hear a track you know its Testament. Unfortunately some of their discs have been robbed of the production they deserve, especially their older discs. This is a great addition to any Testament fans collection or for someone that's new to their music. I think adding Steve Souza to a couple of the tracks was a good addition as well.

Then it's pretty easy to use. First time set your timer for the full 5 minutes, start it after you have placed all the product quickly on your hair. When re-treating I usually set the timer for 3 minutes and start it, again, after all the product is on the roots of my hair. At end of 3 minutes make all your hair wet with product, then count another minute, then quickly wash. My only complaint - I wish they would make the color more permanent, it fades in 2 weeks when washed with even warm water, much more so with hot water, and when exposed to the sun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just for Men: lots of problems","review":"I usually use Clairol's Men's Choice but it's becoming hard to find and when I do find, it's very expensive. So I decided to give Just for Men a try since it's much cheaper and easier to find. Well, now I know why it's cheaper. It only lasts 2-3 weeks TOPS as opposed to 5-6 weeks of Men's Choice. Not only that, I use dark brown but Just for Men dark brown makes my hair look more like black than dark brown (leaving it on for 5 minutes as specified). Lastly, every time I shower the towel goes brown when I dry my hair (the wife is not happy about it!). So, if you manage to find Men's Choice, go with it. Even though you'll pay more, the fact that it lasts almost double the period will put you ahead in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"great and it works","review":"My hubby started using JFM and it makes a difference! its not like hair dye where it turns all the hair a fake jet black color...it just makes the grey not stand out and be so shiney.

The author really knows his stuff!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair Family Drama","review":"Better than mediocre, but not exciting or spell-binding as others have made it sound. The book felt more like acts in a play than a continuous storyline. Character development is very good in some, lacking in others. For half the book, I kept having to go back to earlier pages and see who was who; I should have made a family tree to start with. The plot is drama between members of a family, basically each had some deep dark secret that had to be revealed and dealt with. Not a suspense/mystery novel.Spoiler Alert: one of the issues dealt with in detail is homophobia, or rather a family's efforts at coming to grips with homosexuality. Mostly I felt it was handled quite well, but some people may appreciate being warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drama after Drama","review":"In every family gathering described in the book drama happens and secrets are revealed. The character development is mostly poor. The emotional and psychological impact the secret or drama has on the rest of the family is dealt with relatively superficial. From my perspective nothing is really dealt with in depth. This together with quite a number of editorial oversights make it feel like the book was written in a rush."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD PAL format!!!","review":"After reading other reviews regarding not being able to play DVD in USA on a DVD player because of PAL format, I did my own research ala Google. THEY WERE RIGHT!! Turns out in the 1960s videotaping (in Europe) used the PAL standard as opposed to the NTSC standard. So what...right? Wrong! Anything originally recorded in PAL format (converted to DVD) will most likely NOT play on USA modern DVD player. USA Region 1 modern DVD players are compatible with DVDs of original recorded NTSC format. So what that does mean? IT WON\\"T PLAY ON USA DVD PLAYER!!! But it will play on your computer.

Dame Joan, whom I admired in her repertory and even sometimes outside it, was miserably miscast in this leaden reading of an opera that can soar when in the hand of singers with the temperament and musical idiom called for. It will please neither fans of the opera nor fans of the stupendous superstar in the title role, and I cannot imagine why it was dredged up out of a back catalog with so many worthier out of print recordings to choose from. Even the noble talents of Christa Ludwig were thrown away on this project - she could not save it from the dull hand on the baton and the tuneless wailing of the lead soprano, floundering in a score that had nothing in common with her gifts. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Miscast","review":"Unlike her extremely successful \\"Turandot\\" recording, here I thought she sounded wobbly and the mushy vowels completely wrong for a verismo opera. Actually her poor enunciation is wrong for all her roles. She's understandable when her husband is not conducting.One of my favorite singers of all time, Christa Ludwig, cannot save this recording.I gave it one star or A for effort but this particular opera is all wrong for her. I'm glad I never purchased it but listened to a copy belonging to a friend. There are many other recordings of this opera with singers who understood the style. I would take a pass on this one. Even her fans should look elsewhere for her true calling as a dramatic coloratura. Her \\"Beatrice di Tenda\\" comes to mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rechargeable battery not sold in US","review":"One reason I chose this player is because it claims to be rechargeable through USB.

Techincally very well done as well. The mixes with the orchestrations are really incredible. And fun!Even the original Star Trek theme has a soprano vocalist that sounds exactly like it did in 1966.

Good gaffers tape sticks to just about anything, but doesn't take much effort to remove, and doesn't leave residue. This tape actually doesn't leave residue because it doesn't stick.I took a chance on this tape instead of the tape I know is good, but more expensive.

When I removed it it left the stickiest glue on the surface and luckily the material allowed the use of warm water and a cloth to patiently remove it.

It's a great gaffers tape at a great price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Stuff, much better than Duct-Tape","review":"I am using this Gaffers Tape to cover all the light-emitting power display lights in my home, e.g. the backup battery, monitor power indicators, really anything that is bright or blinks. I have also applied it to the auto flash on my point and shoot camera, because I sometimes forget to turn it off before I snap photos. The tape completely blocks light, is easy to work with, and doesn't leave a sticky residue when I remove it.I can't really give it higher praise than that, since that is precisely what I was looking for when I purchased the tape."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get what you pay for","review":"Not sure what tape the other reviewers received, but I won't be buying this again.Bought to supplement my 'usual brand,' for a low budget event, that was going to need a couple of rolls, and maybe could become my preferred supplier and save my clients money.4 rolls purchased - two different colors/kinds of tape received. One was the color and texture that I expected, the other three were more 'cloth like,' than any gaffers tape I've seen or used since I started using gaffers tape in 1983.The four rolls are all different diameters and as promised they didn't leave tape residue. The residue problem is that they don't really stick to anything either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the gaffers tape I'm used to","review":"I just received this in the mail. I've been using gaffers tape for years. With my stash running out it was time to get some new stuff. This tape does do the most important functions of gaffers tape, it does not leave residue and you can tear it by hand. The fabric inside the tape, however, is far weaker than what I'm used to and the tape does not stick as much as I had hoped. Overall, this tape is not of the high quality that I expected from gaffers tape and I certainly do not think it deserves the rating it has gotten from other reviewers. In my experience gaffers tape should outperform ordinary duct tape in all aspects. These aren't the gaffers I was looking for, I'll go about my business and order some elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff","review":"Like so many people I have used and liked duct tape for years, but in many situations I need something that doesn't leave a sticky mess. This is surprisingly strong, sticks better than I had hoped and comes away clean. I used it on my split tractor seat and its held up fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pay more for better quality","review":"I ended up buying Apollo tape because this stuff...sucks. It barely sticks to surfaces and is really easy to get off the roll, which gaff tape normally isn't. Also, gaff tape normally doesn't come apart if it sticks to itself and this one does. If the adhesive was better, it would be a good deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the g-tape tape I am used to.","review":"Being a video professional I have used gaffer's tape for over 25 years. This ain't the stuff I used to buy. Its half as thick as the old Permacel tape. Also, and this is the part that really cheeses me off, hidden in the description is that the actual width of the tape is 48mm. Well my ruler says it's more like 45mm or 1 3/4\\".In fairness, the adhesive layer seems to perform OK in short term testing. It does stick well and release cleanly, even sticking to itself and releasing. Still, its too thin and too narrow (for 2\\" tape).I guess I shouldn't have been so cheap and spent the extra five bucks for a higher quality product. Live and learn."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk. Too thin and adhesive too strong. Stay away.","review":"What a mistake I made buying this. The tape is flimsy, very thin, but the adhesive is way too strong. It will pull paint from the wall, something a gaffer tape should not do. With a brand I bought before at a major photo brick-and-mortar and online retailer in NYC, I had none of such issues. Stay away."},{"rating":"2","title":"good Tape","review":"Very good tape, seems to work like the more expensive version. I use gaffers tape a lot and will reorder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too plasticky","review":"I am disappointed in the difficulty tearing this gaffers tape.

It's unavailable (as of this review)","review":"I'm hoping this becomes available again soon.Everyone can agree that duct tape is phenomenal. There are books, songs, poems dedicated to this fantastic stuff.But did you know there's a tape that's nearly as strong, but leaves no stick residue behind?Yes, it's called gaffer's tape. TV and movie sets have been using this for decades!It's time the rest of us got on board. I use this to tape my Rubbermaid bins shut because the lids are notoriously bad! I use it on exposed metal that produces too much glare. I use it to temporarily tape things in place while I secure them with screws, nails, or epoxy. I tape parts on my cars that like to fall off. I use it on just about everything I used to use duct tape for, except ducts (still use duct tape for that).BOTTOM LINE: If you thought duct tape was great, wait 'til you try Gaffer's Tape."},{"rating":"1","title":"The absolute worst","review":"This is not a production of the Petipa version of COPPELIA or even that by St.-Leon. It's not even a truly classical ballet. The score and libretto are tampered with almost beyond recognition and what little classical choreography there is borders on the grotesquely surreal. The dancers seem fine but there is not much they can do with the material given. I have not seen the Australian Ballet videotape (I cannot imagine that the dancers are as strong as they are at the Kirov) but this version is based upon the Cechetti staging of Petipa's production and said to be quite good. It could not possibly be any worse than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as you remember it.","review":"When I heard that 2 Unlimited was getting back together, I thought to myself: That's outstanding, but can they be as awesome as they were in the past. I think that depends on what you liked the most about 2 Unlimited. I just remember the old euro-beats that each track had in the past, and thankfully, that feeling is back, especially with \\"The Edge of Heaven\\", \\"Never Surrender\\", \\"Someone to Get There\\", and \\"Be Free Tonight\\". There is also some great drum & bass in \\"Closer 2U\\". Everything you had hoped a new 2 Unlimited would be and more is here. A word of advise, though, to 2 U: Don't make your releases too simple and top 40ish like \\"Wanna Get Up\\" and \\"Move On Up\\". Very annoying. Those are just CD fillers in my opinion.

So I bought a large size because my hand size is medium. The glove fits me great, but since it's not insulated my fingers got cold easily. This glove let me handle small electronics like digital cameras and flip phones at an ease. Unfortunately, after two weeks of using it one of the edge ripped because the thread didn't hold it well. But I got it threaded back and it works new. So If you are going to buy this product, try to have a thread kit ready just in case.

My mind drifted a lot during the DVD. And if you are drifting you are not concentrating on the muscles being used, so it kind of becomes pointless. Also, the narration didnt match the exercises.

The time passed fast though...and I was not bored. My legs were literally shaking, just as they do when I go to a much more expensive ballet barre class! And yes, there is something to be said to build up strength at home before going to a fast pace class.

I bought body sculpt, arms&abs and thighs&glutes. I am SO disspointed with these dvds!! They are so incredibly boring...and the way they are filmed with the voiceover is just so awkward and annoying. Really unhappy with this purchase...very unmotivating and unexciting."},{"rating":"2","title":"FABULOUS!","review":"This is a great DVD, even though it would be nice to have a little more direction from the instructors. Still, it gives you a great workout and makes you feel great when you are finished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be Careful!","review":"Granted, I had some VERY slight knee issues when starting this series, but had practiced Pilates for years so I wasn't too concerned. However, after using this video I ended up with a torn meniscus. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sculpting without weights","review":"Weights are used in the arm/upper body segment, but not in any of the others-it's just your own body weight. Really good workout, makes me sweat hard but very good instruction and reminders of form."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty basic","review":"I like that the workout is broken up into 5 sections, but each section has one basic exercise with a few variations. While it did give me a workout, it wasn't any more interesting or challenging than one I could have created my self by spending a few minutes search the internet for basic toning exercises."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the Tonic of Youth!","review":"I am a 45 year old man who has taken class with Fred and Elisabeth but do not have the time to attend their Exhale studio classes regularly...I found these DVDs to be awesome. The DVD's have allowed me to develop a daily at home routine using Core Fusion stretching and strengthening exercises on my own while getting instructions and reminders on how to perform them properly. The end result has been that I rarely suffer from back aches and sciatica that had plagued me before. Thank you exhale's Fred & Elisabeth for sharing this amazing routine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mix of isometrics and stretching","review":"I think how you perceive a workout depends on your fitness level. So, I'll start by saying I consider myself fit and do a lot of long distance running. I bought this video as a way to mix up my workouts on days that I don't run. This video does not make me sweat and really doesn't increase my heart rate. I'd say there is probably an equal amount of isometrics to stretching. I do start to feel a burn during the isometrics which is great. They do stretching after working each part of the body which keeps things moving at a slow pace. I'll do this video on days where I'm feeling a little lazy but want a good stretch and to feel a little burn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great video for price","review":"The video seemed easy for my fitness level but the next day i was sore all over so I knew it worked. I like to use the video for days when I don't feel like attending the gym or when I'm not up to a high intensity work out. It is challenging yet simple. The video was received in excellent condition. I would recommend this video if you want to try something different than your normal routine."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE the Core Fusion Series...","review":"I love this series, and the body sculpt video is probably my favorite. In short bursts, it tones your entire body, with no need for tools (just a couple of hand weights, or empty wine bottles filled with water, as I use)...It's doable for anyone, but also difficult enough to challenge everyone. Completely adaptable, perfect at-home workout. (Pair it with their boot camp video to get your cardio in.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great DVD","review":"Great, you get a very good workout with this DVD it's very well explained and the exercises are easy to follow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible, slow, boring DVD","review":"I bought this DVD based on reviews and was very disappointed! I think the title is misleading as it's not a body sculpting DVD, it's more of a stretching DVD with very few toning exercises. The pace was really slow and boring. I could not even make it through the entire DVD. I am going to give it to my Mother who is 71."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"This is just too slow!

I wound up doing yoga on my own because I was so bored and used their music and pace as background cadence. If you want to sweat, don't rent this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, but difficult to master","review":"This is one of the best strategy games that I have ever played. It combines political, economic, diplomatic and of course military affairs in a fantastic manner. I love the fact that the player can choose just about any nation to play, just don't expect to win with Haiti. Things that prevent this game from achieving a full five stars: an incomprehensible manual, go to the forums for answers; no tutorial scenarios, how hard would it be to create a simple five year scenario; the economic and diplomatic models need to be tweaked, there are too many non-historic ways to work the system. This game is not for the faint of heart, but it is fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"frustratingly unplayable","review":"the concept of the game is great! half the stuff you can let the AI do for you concerning econimics, trade, manpwer, military leaders, et al. but some basic stuff like changing from army to navy management cant be done! or seeing and possibly retreating from certain territories under atack! to heck with diplomacy if you cant do these basics forget it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Historical Simulation and Strategy Game","review":"This game is an extraordinary historical simulation, you can pick any nation and guide it from the beggining of the 19th century to 1920 managing trade, taxes, production, diplomacy and last but not least the army. The manual contains the basic information necessary to play, but it takes a first game, I suggest with a small nation, to practice and get a hold on the rules to fully enjoy the simulation. Reading the reviews I was afraid of bugs but although sometimes the game crashed it was tolerable, I suggest to set the autosave feature every few turns. Finally, for those who played Europa Universalis, I think Victoria, being more realistic especially because of the trade feature, is a consistent improvment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Potential","review":"I was intrigued by the fact that one could play virtually any country in existence in the year the game begins - 1830. The play is fairly complex and detailed so it is best described as a simulation. The biggest problem is that the instructions are very poor so the learning curve is very steep. Overall I think this game could be quite interesting once (or if) one learns all the elements required for sucessful play. Not for the casual player, this is a basically a more detailed alternative to Civilizations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crashed on me twice, won't play again","review":"The game crashed on me when I hit the spacebar to skip the Paradox Interactive opening credit, not a good sign. Tried to find any patch information on the game on the Paradox Forum site, all patch information leads to Victoria 2, could not find one word on whether my Victoria 1.0 needed a patch at all. Plunging on ahead, I spent 6 minutes happily telling various territories to build factories or expand production, when Victoria experienced an error and crashed.I will be generous and give this game an extra star, as I am uninstalling it before braving another crash. I have no idea if the crash was because I was running XP, or because Victoria 1.0 needed a patch that I couldn't find. A specific link to a game-specific patch webpage would have been helpful. As a final insult, the game requires a complete computer reboot after uninstalling. Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"i was surpised how fast the game came actually very glad about that i have alot of fun with it and i would recommend it too all history buffs but the two bad things is it crashes about every time i play it over a hour and a half and it creates too many saved files and doesnt let you overide them but i still like the game"},{"rating":"1","title":"Easily Lost Interest!!","review":"I was looking for a good strategy/builder game like Majesty 2 or 1701 A.D. This was definitely not it. I now see why there are no extra photos on Amazon. This game was very old school in my opinion, frustrating and boring. Instead of walking you through a tutorial, the game simply had pop-up windows that told you what to do, like my memory is that long! All you do is drive your troops from one location to the next on top of a geographical map...literally! If you are looking for a interactive game, do not get this one. I am surprised the same folks that created Majesty created this game too. I wish they would come out with more economic strategy games like Majesty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far less realism than one expects from Paradox","review":"As other reviewers have remarked, the emphasis here is on economic development, not military conflict. But neither the economic nor the military aspects of this game have anything like the historically realistic details that one finds in Europa Universalis or Hearts of Iron. As a result, this feels less like an historical simulation game than a game in which history is caricatured. I lost interest in it quickly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like Work, Not Play","review":"I love Paradox' Europa Universalis series, but Victoria requires far too much micromanagement to be fun. The lack of any tutorial or halfway decent manual makes the learning curve far too steep for such a small payoff.Great concept, poor execution.

But alas my hopes were dashed by the poor production of this recording. The orchestral sound is produced over the vocals so at times it sounds as if Dmitri Hvorostovsky is running for lead in a race he is destined to lose. What can be heard of his vocals is their usual brilliant quality, lovely tone, and perfect Italian pronunciation and diction. You would swear he hails from Naples, but with the Orchestra so overwhelming it seems a tepid effort at best.I would only recommend this to a die-hard Hvorostovsky lover, of which there are legion, or to completest CD collector, otherwise save your money for his forthcoming efforts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Iceberg floating near Naples","review":"I agree with the first reviewer. I read the critic in an opera magazine (who is probably in love with Dimitri) and immediately bought this one. The orchestra is rich, the voice is so nice and deep but the energy is not there.

Putting it together took a little figuring out, but nothing I haven't seen before in assembling furniture. Don't tighten the bolts fully until your'e sure everything is right. The basic style suits me fine, but isn't fancy or decorative if thats what you want. All parts, including the allen wrench needed for assembly arrived and in good condition. My 8 inch thick mattress feels fine lying directly on the support slats, negating the need for a box spring. As a bonus, this bed is made in my home state of Pennsylvania, so I helped keep my neighbors off the unemployment rolls."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the money you can do better","review":"While this looks pretty nice, there are just too many problems, initally the company sent the wrong legs, which they corrected after a few days, but once assembled, the slats turned out to be cut wrong, the finish leaves a lot to be desired.

I don't mean pull the plug or flip the switch on your surge protector.

Though there are a few poems celebrating the cigar and the cigarette, most of this collection is about the smoking of the pipe, and those who smoke it. The style is somewhat antique: that is, these poems rhyme. Many are very well written, others not quite up to that mark. Nevertheless almost all are characterized by an honest zeal usually found only in love poems, and this passion carries the day, despite any warts. To be sure, any anti-smoking advocate would find much to fault here, but it was not for them this collection was assembled.

Richard Laymon doesn't draw out of the reader the level of fear and anger that his bad guy's usually do.The interweaving of the plot and how it meets up at the end is clever as usual but with this one you sense it coming and you are able to guess before even reaching mid-way through the book who will dispatch the bad guy.There is a plot error as well which is a first with a Laymon tale for me. One of the character's has to fly by plane to reach her daughter, however, the bad guy, in the reverse trip from daughter to mother just happens to be able to pop in his car and drive over in a matter of minutes.The character's and personalities of the anchoring character's are not strong enough or detailed enough to hook the reader into feeling sympathy or suspense for them.Overall, very weak I thought.Cuts"},{"rating":"1","title":"cuts richard laymon","review":"This is probably the worst book I have ever read.

No need to delve into the plot (other reviewers have already done this). I know that it is fiction, but people just don't behave like the characters in this book. I would have liked it more if the characters weren't all extremes (completely pathetic, completely hopeless, completely heartless, completely crazy, etc). There isn't one character in this book that is even remotely believable. I don't think I have ever rolled my eyes so much reading a book.

I expected better from Babies R Us. Someone could get seriously hurt. I was lucky I noticed the tear in the lap belt (it was under the harness buckle). There were other problems as well, it never did keep air in the tires, it didn't track well, and it was quite rickety.

I do put a blanket under my three month old for comfort and added stability. The seats rests area little flimsy but hey for the price they work and my three year old has not complained. The sun protector work pretty well although I will buy a UVA blocker that goes over the entire stroller. I recommend this stroller. Not top of the line but for the money it's great.

For the price it was a great value. The others that I really liked were over 300.00 and they were basically the same thing. I like how the canopy is adjustable and the parent tray. I don't use mine just for walking, it's my main stroller. My 2 are 9 months and 2 1/2 yrs and yes they do sit uneven, but so far that hasn't driven me too crazy. It pushes very easily, my older 2 love to push this one. My only complaint is that the material on the seat has ripped out 2 x/s now, under normal wear and use.

The moveable canopy is a plus as is the parent tray, so I decided to give it a try.This stroller is so hard to turn. I was used to a stationary wheel jogger with my other stroller, but this stroller is just not set up right. The weight isn't distributed properly to allow for an easy push down on the handle bar to lift the front wheel.I used it once, then packaged it up and returned it. I just wanted others to know that not all joggers with stationary wheels are this hard to use.I decided to go with the Dreamer Design. A little more than double the price of this stroller, but definitely well worth it if you use your jogger frequently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this!!!","review":"I purchased this stroller for my 4 month old and my 24 month old. I am not a jogger so I thought it would be good for me when I was walking. I do have a great single one and I didn't want to spend the money on the double, I really regret it now.Pros: There is an adjustable sun shade. The seats can recline individually. The price.Cons: The stroller does not turn easily. The seats are tilted back, so even if they are sitting up they are still somewhat reclined. It is a workout in itself to push them for a daily walk,(that might be a pro.) It doesn't push straight, it pulls to one side. This is the second one that is like this, I returned the first one because it was pulling to one side.

If was fine, a bit big. When it was time for a new one, I didn't want to spend a lot of money as I really only use this to go around our neighborhood and the occasional outing. For every day use, I use a MacLaren stroller. I used this one for about a week. At first is seemed heavier to push and navigate, but I liked the cup holder/snack holder. This one reclined better than my old one so I kept at it. I tried inflating the tires more thinking that would help. I think the problem is the handle bar is lower than my old one so the leverage to lug around a 4 year old and 20 month old was just too much for this stroller. I found it heavy though, even with just the baby riding alone. So, I dismantled it and returned it. Thankfully I had the recipt and Babies r us has a good return policy.

I had to keep it in \\"wheelie\\" mode in order to turn it on a bend. I did get a workout, my arms! Don't frustrate yourself and buy it. It's only one more obstacle to add into a mom's busy day. I am on my third child and this is my fourth stroller. I was looking for something to keep my autistic one contained (he's a runner) and free up my arms with the baby. I am on the wait list for the sit n stand. That was my first choice and now I will be patient. I'll have to live without an adult cup holder, but my sanity will be worth it.

I have the three rail gate and the brackets to put the wood pieces in were terribly bent. I managed to straighten them up so they worked just fine.

Also helps hold the front of the shade onto the stroller, otherwise the shade doesn't provide shade if babies are in a flat position in the stroller, with the front of the shade flying up constantly. Sewing on the velcro strap has helped make the shade useable, otherwise I don't think it would be useable due to it flying up constantly, and the babies like to pull it down as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Nuisance","review":"We got this cover for our double stroller because the visor is short.

But it did. i used a standard side by side umbrella stroller for my twin 3 year old girls and it worked easly although i would say it was a little confusing to put to the stroller but once i sat and looked at the picture and the stroller it was a breeze. I was a little disappointed how ever that it says on the package it could adjust as far as pull down further or pull back dependong on the amount of protection you wanted for you child(ren) and maybe it was the stroller i was using but there wasn't much give on to pull it down further.

I use it for my twin stroller (Graco duorider) and it works great! We live where it is windy and unless your walking directly into the wind it works just fine. I use a clothespin to clip it down if I happen to be walking into the wind and that helps. This is rarely a problem though. It covers my twins and keeps the sun off of them and that's the important thing. Without it my Graco Duorider shade is not nearly enough to cover them."},{"rating":"1","title":"It works, sorta","review":"We have the single but had to make adjustments for it not to flip backward and also to keep it low enough.

The EVO also increases the overall size, but a little less than others.In addition, it's nice to see a rubberized case that doesn't REALLY collect lint/dust so rapidly. Truthfully, all of these rubbery/silicone cases are going to pick up dirt/hair/dust eventually, but so far, this one has picked it up a little less.My only gripes are 1) it's a bit of a production to put it on/take it off (so you may want to leave it on for a while). 2) This product--as with many iPod products--is a bit overpriced. Other than that, not a bad little purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very pleased with the eVo3","review":"After reading other reviews and the manufacturer's information, I purchased my first ipod case.

There's really not much to it. If you love hardcore with a metal tinge, this is for you. Do not buy this expecting to hear musical boundaries being broken. There is nothing really that original here. Just straightforward hard music. If you're looking for a very hard, danceable mix of hardcore and metal, then you want this. The solos thrown into many of the songs are perfect. Not overdone in any respect. They fit the songs perfectly. Overall, a solid release. See these guys live. They're on tour with Agnostic Front and Hatebreed right now.

Much of Billie's greatness was her rapport with musicians, and on this CD, Billie is on one world and the musicians on another. Aside from the atrocious arrangements, Billie can be heard rushing through her tunes, clipping her phrases, not having any musical space to breathe life into these songs. This CD is a total rip-off.

The directions on the package recommend 2 tablespoons of coffee for every 6 ounces of filtered water. The result is likely to disintegrate your ceramic mug before you can drink it, but it doesn't taste too bad...that is until the bitter aftertaste kicks in and makes your throat burn. If you weaken it by adding some hot water, as the package suggests, the bitter taste becomes more pronounced, like coffee that's been left heating in the pot too long. The only way to drink this coffee is with plenty of cream and sugar. With enough cream and sugar, French Roast is pretty good; but I wouldn't recommend this particular Starbucks variety if you like your coffee black...unless you wanna stay awake for a week."},{"rating":"2","title":"Es un juego Excelente","review":"La verdad este juego aunque es un poco similar al ISS'98 tiene muchas mejoras muy importantes que hacen a los amantes del soccer, que lo quieran aun mas, este titulo lo recomiendo, para mi en lo particular me parece el mejor juego de soccer que hay en cualquier consola."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a rip off!","review":"The ad states 128/roll, 20/carton, therefore it appears you are buying 20 rolls, this is NOT TRUE my shipment came today and it was ONE roll!

The author writes in a down to earth manner, but for some reason, spends page after page describing and/or introducting yet another character.This book is deep in characters and very little on plot and action. Although I get the impression the author was trying to flesh out the characters, the end results is that we get bogged down in the number of characters and we get bored by the little activity there is.While this is not a horrible read, there just isn't much action in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"Organizes your tea, smells good what more can I ask for.

First of all the ball is hard and dangerous! you cant drop it or throw it and if you toss it back in forth to a partner you have to be very careful not to knock their teeth out! The outside should be made of squishy rubber that can be dropped on the ground. Rather the whole process consisted of us rolling the ball back and fourth on the floor and then taking turns shaking it. It took about 20 min and the ice cream was pretty good, but hard to scoop out of the container.

The teachers had to finish shaking the ball for about 45 minutes total (one break to stir ice cream contents, empty water, refill ice and salt) the children watched as we scooped the ice cream out into cones.

I bought it after reading all the reviews and they were spot on. It makes good ice cream but there are a few cons - the mixing in the middle is a little awkward and I have yet to find the right tool to do it with. It would be good if they included the right tool to scrape the sides with without scratching the interior. We found that the cream/sugar recipe melts incredibly fast - almost as soon as you take it out of the ball so it's like eating a milkshake. We experimented with commercially available ice cream mixes and they seem to have some sort of stabilizer in them that makes them stay frozen longer so we've been using them. If you're buying this for children I recommend the pint size because fully loaded, the quart size was too heavy for my toddler grandchildren to pick up. We have yet to try any of the frozen margarita drinks but we're looking forward to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"O.K.","review":"Heavy, Heavy, Heavy.

Now I can't get enough. The ingredients are simple and there's no hand-cranking as was the case when I was a kid. Just roll it back and forth while having a pleasant conversation. This size is just perfect for two people. I've read other reviews and must say that ours does not leak. Also, the spiderweb design on the outside is what keeps the surface comfortable to touch. Yes, the lids get tight, which is why the manufacturers included a handy tool to remove them. This rates a four out of five because the sides do get difficult to scrape down and we're advised to not use metal objects. I scrape as much as I can with a wooden spoon, then empty all the ice out and let it sit for ten minutes. At that point, the same wooden spoon handily gets the rest. We made mint chocolate chip tonight and were very happy with it. I'm already thinking of new recipes."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mason jar and a marble work better!","review":"You don't need this questionable product to make ice cream. Just put your pre-chilled ingredients into a clean mason jar, add a clean marble or two and alternate between shaking and rolling the jar around on the floor and putting it into the freezer for a few minutes to keep it cold. Or you can use a gallon plastic ziplock bag and the marbles and squish and squeeze the bag. My kids make ice cream this way all the time. If you are camping just put it into a cooler of ice occasionally to chill it instead of the freezer. It works, it's cheap and easy and it's much easier to clean than this thing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems overpriced","review":"Sure, it's fun to make ice cream this way once in a while as a novelty, but I've been making ice cream in a similar fashion just using a pair of emptied out coffee cans (nest the little one inside the big one, with the salt and ice packed between them) for years.

The only thing I wish was different about it is I wish you could unscrew the inner canister to place that in the freezer without having to place the entire ball in the freezer- if you have leftover ice cream that is.

Adding more ice, stirring the contents, adding more salt. Shake -a-shake-a-shake. I bought it for my little girls 4th birthday party. IT WAS GREAT!!!!! All the little children sat at safe distances from eachother and cooperatively played the game of roll the ice-cream balll... They loved the idea of making it themselves. When they lost attention with it I gave it to the group of adults left in the room and I beleive it worked even better for them. They were laughing and giggling in childish play.I love it, but if you want to use it more often with only a couple people then I would have to recommend the smaller version. Less time involved and less adding and stirring necessary."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish it was bigger :)","review":"Worked great for the kids. The only problem we had was that is wasnt enough. All three of my kids fought over the ice cream. Of course we made more but it just wasnt fast enough.

We really do like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ice cream ball","review":"The ice cream was great! Now for the down side of it...The seal on the side the cylinder opened to would leak during use, it took what seemed forever to make the ice cream (thirty minutes for the mega size; if you have dogs that like to chase things that might make it more enjoyable between two people), and it took lots of ice. It would be good for someone to do at home, however, not my idea of a good item to take camping unless you're in a motorhome with an ice maker and space to store it...would be good for kids if you could come up with different ways of moving the ball around besides throwing/tossing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible piece of crude","review":"Like others said, it doesn't fit normal icecubes easily. I had to let them melt some first and jam them in there.And then even though they advertised it by having kids kicking it around, they say not to kick it around, which is why I got the darn thing.So you have to stand there shaking this heavy cold ball around for a 27 minutes, because the kids get bored with it after 3.Then to get the ice cream out of there....Afterwards I found a thing on-line saying to use a large ziplock for the ice and rocksalt, then use a small ziplock for the icecream stuff. Put the little in the big, shake and it should be ready in 5-10 minutes.Horrible horrible products. Concept was awesome though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to use","review":"We haven't even used this yet, but can already see the difficulties. The ball is very heavy even without the liquid, and so it cannot be thrown. The directions say, \\"Do not bounce, throw, kick or drop.\\" That leaves only rolling and shaking. I didn't buy this to have something that I have to shake until ice cream is done, so I guess we'll try rolling. But rolling a heavy ball back and forth isn't exactly getting to play ball while you make ice cream. If you have an event planned where people are going to be just sitting in a circle rolling a ball back and forth, then this is your ball. Otherwise, stick to a traditional ice cream maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"making ice cream","review":"takes a while to make. the ingredients are easy to have on hand. hard to clean up. the ice cream is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Therapeutic Activity Device in the Nursing Home","review":"This works great! My only complaint - I ordered a quart size one and the private seller screwed us with a pint size one instead - may she rot in hell for ripping off old folks! - anyhoo we used the basic recipe and made sure to you double heavy cream to cut the total time required...we even added peach preserves...it turned out very smooth, creamy and really tasted as good as or even better than the stuff you get at restaurants..only bad, the preserves sank to the bottom...next time we will add it later after the first 10 minute roll and shack...actually, by using the double heavy cream, we had ready to eat ice cream is less than 15 minutes total."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alternate Method of Shaking for the Play and Freeze IC Maker Ball","review":"I'm exploring an alternate method of shaking by putting the whole thing in the clothes dryer with no heat and wrapped-it in towels.

Everyone loved them! The only complaint I have is that the sides of the inner tube (where the ice cream is made) are very hard to scrape once the ice cream is made. The instructions ask you to stir up the ice cream about 10 minutes after starting the making process. Again, this is very hard to do. Especially since they tell you no to use a anything metal to do this. Maybe if the manufacturer included some type of scraper tool...? Other than that, this is a great product and totally beats coffee can ice cream!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BEYOND THE BEST!","review":"We had a family camp out with our church family with many kids this ball was the absolute hit of the entire camping trip. We have the large one that make enough for about 6 small bowls (two scoops) of ice-cream per each \\"session\\". We got to the camp site with all the hills, the kids rolled it up and down the hills while we set up camp. When we were done we had ice-cream! We added in coffee creamers for the variety of ice-creams...all in all we had 6 different kinds of ice-cream that everyone old andyoung enjoyed....PLUS the kids were passed out early from being tired from making ice cream.. The anticpation as to when the ice cream would be done was AMAZING.. We use the very simple recipe: 1 pint 1/2 and 1/2 with 3/4 sugar, then added power coffee creamer..then they were off.

We used heavy cream and it took 20 minutes to make (we might have been able to stop at 15 minutes as the ice cream was very hard along the cylinder). We just rolled the ball around the living room floor and it was done before we knew it. This is definitely going on camping trips with us!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keep the kids busy","review":"The Play and Freeze Ice Cream Maker was actually a lot of fun. It doesn't make the best ice cream in the world--I'll keep my Cuisinart for that. But for being out camping, and keeping the kids occupied for about 35 minutes, plus the time eating the ice cream, this product can't be beat. I was able to conveniently pack all of the ingredients in the cooler, and pull them out on the second day. All of the kids around us wanted to get in on the fun of \\"roll the ball\\" with the mere promise of ice cream at the end. Yes, you can accomplish the same thing with a couple of coffee cans, but who has coffee cans these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to make ice cream","review":"This ice cream maker sounds like a good idea in theory, but it was very labor intensive to use. The idea is that its supposed to be fun to roll it around but its not because of the design of the ball. The ball is plastic and has a raised design all around it, probably to keep it from breaking, but this design makes it hard to roll. You would have a faster and easier and funner time just using two coffee cans to make ice cream, a smaller one to hold the cream and sugar and vanilla and a bigger one to place the smaller one into. Then you put ice and rock salt between the cans. Cover each can and roll it back and forth. I did this often as a kid and I thought this would be a step up from that, but its a step down.We have only used it once and that one time we ended up pouring out the middle because it never fully turned into ice cream (and we used HEAVY whipping cream.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I have a better idea!","review":"I have a much better idea.

Very tastey!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Let Down","review":"While the idea behind this product is fun and creative, the execution is awful and thats what really matters to those who buy this. The ball is extremely heavy when filled (7 pounds!) The drum inside does not hold much liquid (only 2 cups total) and the ball is made from a heavy plastic with thick ridges on the outside. Unfortunately you have to shake or roll the ball and after the first 10 minutes our hands were red and hurting! They really should have made the outside smooth. The seal on ours did not hold the liquid from the melting ice so water was flying everywhere as we shook the ball even after pouring out the melted ice! All in all we were not satisfied after trying two batches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok Ice Cream but not much fun!","review":"This was a Christmas gift and we used it on Christmas day, following the instructions carefully, after over 30 mins the ice cream was still not fully set although did taste nice anyway. the ball was a little leaky during the shaking process and needed to be held in a tea towel, and was very noisy so made discussion difficult.

So, we rolled some more BUT the results were not what we wanted.

I was worried about them dropping the ball and it shattering-or worse, landing on a toe.It made ok soft icecream after 2 adult men tossed it short distances. it was a pain to fill and a pain to clean."},{"rating":"2","title":"an original little gift idea","review":"this is a perfect gift for those on the go who love ice cream. i can see it used frequently while on a camping trip sitting around the fire at night or during a backyard barbque. it's easy to pack and requires only a few ingredients. a great ice breaker for a group of people getting to know each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good fun for kids - and good ice cream!","review":"My daughters, nieces, and nephews, ages 2-12, all LOVED this! They had a blast rolling it around. The directions/recipes clearly state that the ice cream will be like soft serve, so don't be expecting a miraculous ice-creamery ice cream in 20 minutes! But it was good - we made the vanilla -and the entertainment itself was worth it!

We suddenly became VERY popular along our camping group, for being able to have ice cream in a 'no electricity' area. After using several times, we have discovered the following:1. Use a stiff, curved silicone spatula to mix and scrape the inner container.2. Stir every 3-4 minutes, to get an overall even consistency.3. Keep the ball rolling in all directions, don't just spin it.4. The more people involved, the less like work it becomes. Also the more people involved, get the quart size!5. Pick up the little mini brownies from Costco. Those with chocolate sauce make great sundaes!"},{"rating":"1","title":"awful ice cream maker","review":"took longer than directions said it would.

Be careful for jammed fingers due to the texture of the outer shell. When washing use caution as water will splatter everywhere due to the honey comb type shell. Also, this will not fit into the dishwasher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easier and cheaper to do this with two coffee cans","review":"I do not have this product but when I saw it I thought, \\"What a gyp!\\" I learned how to make ice cream in college by placing the ingredients in a smaller coffee can, then placing that container into a larger coffee can. You put rock salt and ice in the space surround the smaller can, put the lid on the bigger can, than roll it back and forth.

Yes, it's only 20 bucks, but it will end up on your yard sale this summer for sure.

I didn't see them on Christmas, but my niece was getting married on New Year's Day. I thought it may be interesting to bring the presents to the wedding (so they could finally get their gifts) and bring ingredients to make ice cream. Sounds like a crazy idea, I know. But, I have to tell you what a hit it was with the kids. I put the ingredients into the ball, along with ice, and the kids rolled the ball around on the carpeted floor for about 45 minutes and made pretty good ice cream. It started out with my 2 nephews and the circle grew to 10 kids before it was done! They had a great time and enjoyed some home made ice cream. The videographer and photographer came over to see what was drawing the crowd; and, the bride came over as well. She thought it was a super idea - one that was fun and kept the kids busy for a while.

Fun to use, really works."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't try this at home!","review":"This is a review of a 10-year-old. If your looking for a fun way to make ice cream for your kids, do it the old fashioned way. Me and my 3-year-old sister and my 5-year-old brother were gonna go get ice cream but then we remembered this (I wish we hadn't!). We poured the stuff in, following the recipe, and started to roll it around. When it didn't work in the 10-20 minutes we went to roll it up and down the slide. But here's the catch, when you fill the thing up, it's like 10 pounds so my bro at the bottom of the slide missed it one time and it hit him in the shins REALLY hard so he couldn't help. Then we decided to check on it again and we found - after an hour and a half* - sweet milky stuff. So we dumped it in a bowl and put it in the freezer. But doing that was hard enough. The stuff that actually froze, froze hard. It took us another hour to scrape it off. Don't get the thing.*not including the time we spent draining it and pouring more ice and rock salt in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for a chemistry class","review":"I ordered this for a demonstration of freezing point depression for my chemistry class. The timing is perfect for a 53 minute period with time enough to serve the ice cream and the students getting to eat it before the time is up. The one quart capacity works well for for up to 30 students. The ice cream was smooth and creamy. I suppose it will work well for family picnics and keep the kids busy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a very fun investment","review":"the item is not that easy to manipulate..you really need lots of ice n salt for this coz the melting is fast but the freezing process is slow.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for me and the CATS","review":"I purchased this for me and my cats to play with and I get ice cream for our efforts. So much fun. I just sit on the floor and roll it to one of the cats who push it back to me..All 4 cats join in to create some ice cream for me and my friends. Only odd thing is that different colors vary in price up to a $10 difference. Fortunately I love pink which was at the lower price point..but it makes no sense to have such a wide variance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Relatively Easy!","review":"My friends and I had been joking about getting one of these for a while, and I finally bought the bullet.I wasn't sure if I'd actually use it, if it would make enough ice cream, or what the deal was. The instructions are pretty straightforward, so I got to mixing my ingredients, dumping in the ice and salt and was ready to party. I didn't think it would be a good idea to physically throw the ball around, since it was heavy and I didn't want someone to drop and break it. Instead, I rolled it around on the living room floor while watching tv. Pretty wonderful lazy way to make ice cream! My only complaint was at the end, it was nearly impossible to get the lid ends off. I ended up using a small hammer to get the thing open.Other than that, it's a pretty cool gadget. Added bonus - it looks like a hamster wheel, but instead of little pellets of hamster poo inside, you have delicious ice cream."},{"rating":"2","title":"works but can take a while","review":"Yes, it does really work, but it took about 40 minutes to make ice cream(quart). The ice cream was delicious. Then we tried frozen yogurt and that took about an hour to freeze. We had to reseal the lid b/c it wasn't on just right and it was very difficult to get the frozen yogurt off the metal sides. You do better to buy frozen yogurt. I think it's ideal for camping when your options are limited on things to do, though we passed it while watching tv."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea if it would work","review":"Absolute bust. I thought this to be great for a kids party, but it just did not work. The kids gave up after 5 minutes. The ball is to heavy to be kicked, and rolling otherwise was only fun for a few minutes - not enough for ice cream to form.

Try 48 minutes for ice milk.Hurts when you roll it back and forth. This has sharp plastic edges that souround ball and hurts your hands.LEAKS. Yes this leaks. We tightened this up as much as we could and it leaked.Regular ice cubes will not work. You need more of a crushed ice.After 48 minutes you get board and well give up.After your hands are red and sore you give up.The to find out that you only get less then 2 cups of ice milk there was a waist of 48 minutes. $2.05 for half and half. $.30 cents for sugar. $.o5 cents for vanilla. $35.00 for the ball itself. pain. and because of the leaks IT IS NOT WORTH IT I could have went to Kings Soopers for $1.88 and picked up a half galon carton for less pain and money.DO NOT BUY!!!!!Ok pros.

The ball leaked from the get go so we could not roll it on the floor. It is extremely heavy, and shaking it for 15 minutes, followed by another 10-15 is a very long time, especially for kids! You need A LOT of ice and have to keep refilling the ice portion. The ice cream never got really firm, it is more like a milk shake. Tasted great, though.

Most songs are a mixture of rap/rock, with a lot of heavy guitar, while a few are on the softer side.I think it is a shame that dc talk doesn't get more secular exposure.

Rap (HIP HOP) - J Train, Wondering Why, and Somebody's Watching. Urban (R&B) - Do You Know. So, that pretty much explains why everyone would like this CD. Really, there actually isn't very many strong gospel words in Momentum. There might be Lord, God, prayer, etc. So overall, anyone would like this CD, even if they don't like gospel music.

This was when we called amazon specifically to ask if it was kerbside delivery or not. They assured us that someone would call us and arrange a delivery time, which obviously did not happen. No one called us regarding the delivery.We just returned the bike for a full refund. We were very disappointed at this service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy it somewhere else","review":"Amazon delivers this item using a company called Eagle transportation.

Additionally, the back clamp that should go into the back stabilizer bar was welded improperly, so it would not fit.

It was just a pain to have it shipped back for a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, quiet. Works for me.","review":"I use this. It is whisper quiet. Wouldn't wake a baby. I assembled it late at night when I was very tired and had no problems. (The seat squeaked a little when first assembled but is quiet, now.) I rely on the electronic display which works well -- even though \\"Calories\\" burned (the manufacture warns) is an approximation and does not seem to vary with resistance levels. As others have noted, the seat is a tad tough -- but I throw a chair pad on it and I'm good to go, now. A slightly different model, #15-4800, ASIN: B000JC2ZGQ, available through Amazon from \\"Joe Muscle\\" for the same price (today, anyway) seems to have the tough seat problem licked and had a more comfortable looking slant to the backrest.

After receiving it and completing the required assembly the pedal wouldnt move, I couldnt pedal even on the lowest setting. I called the manufacturer only to be told that this was a known problem and that magnetic brake inside the casing was too close and needed to readjusted. They started to give me instructions on how to fix the product myself. I pointed out that according to thier warranty info, if I open up the encasement my warranty would be invalid, and the service representative argued with me and said its either that or send it back to them for a replacement. I sent it back the next day. I didnt buy a new exercise bike to do repair work on... it should work already!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stamina 15-4600A Recumbent bike","review":"Very good product for the money.

So I picked this one up after not seeing her work for a couple years with a certain anticipation. Unfortunately, it's terrible. The mystery isn't very interesting, but Lena and her relationsihp are what really get in the way. She is so incredibly narcissistic and self-involved that the book loses focus on the case and becomes a sort of adolescent exploration of Lena and her relationship.Skip this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of Hightower's best novels!","review":"I was turned on to Hightower by my mother. The first novel I read was Flashpoint (which is one of her best). This is the second Hightower book I have read. It is at a much lower standard than Flashpoint. During the first few chapters, the author skips from several different characters that have no link. I had to keep looking back to see how they fit into the plot. It is not apparent until the last fifty pages how they fit together. Even at that point, I still am confused! The novel was slow going and confusing. I recommend Flashpoint over this novel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rubbish","review":"At times the singer - who is a sixteen year-old girl - sounds very much like well, a sixteen year old girl fronting a half-decent metal outfit. Her singing is terrible, off-key and clearly been overproduced to hide just how out of tune she is.When she starts screaming - which is actually an improvement on the singing, she sounds exactly like Kittie, that other all-girl metal band who actually released a couple of good metal tunes.There is little on here that actually deserves spending money on. As a warm-up live band they could be okay (after you had a couple of beers), but don't waste your money on this half-arsed, heavy metal copycats."},{"rating":"2","title":"Refreshing","review":"The first thing you think of when you hear about a woman singer in a metal band is hearing a person trying to scream and sounding like they're puking. Fortunately, when I first heard this album, it was refreshing. It's different than everything else out there. The songs are rather hypnotic after a while, but you can really get into it. You can also tell throughout the album that there is a lot of emotion behind it; it was nothing written by someone else and just given to the band to perform. All in all, I thought it was an excellent album and a great band. I think that they do not receive the recognition they deserve."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"This printer is not bad.

The ink cartridges do not last very long though, and they typically cost between $25 to $35 U.S. Dollars. Forget about cartridge refill kits, because the chip has to be reset, which for all intents and purposes impossible. Generic ink cartridges do not work dependably, and often don't work at all.

The printer, for whatever reason, stops printing in black after about two to three months of use. Up to that time, the print quality is excellent, almost laser quality, then it just stops printing in black. And changing the cartridge and cleaning the print nozzles doesn't help. The color component of the printer isn't much better, for it shows signs of deterioration after about three months of use. Initially, when I bought my first Z22 printer thru an auction web site, I thought I was swindled with a worn out printer. Later, when I bought my second Z22, brand new at a local discount store, the same problems occurred. In all my experiences with Lexmark printers, which overall is a good brand, the Z22 is the worst printer they ever made. It doesn't even deserve a \\"1 star\\" rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"My recent purchase of a Lexmark Z22 InkJet Printer","review":"When I received my Lexmark Z22 I installed and uninstalled the software several times before giving up and calling technical support.

And finally, as a person simply curious about the body, every time I look through this book I learn something new.

This decision made for good reading and one should end up understanding that it was Hemingway's earlier years, as is the case for most of us, which ended up shaping his life and death. The book also provides an interesting look at prewar American society, in particular, the growing and changing middle class.

I rank it as highly as I would \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\" or \\"The Counte of Monte Cristo\\" or any other highly acclaimed movie. Personally I doubt Bruce Timm and his crew get much credit for the kind of work they do. This movie was stellar.Everyone can't stop raving about how awesome Nolan's adaptations are but they're clearly garbage in comparison to movies like this one, or Mask of the Phantasm, Under the Red Hood or Return of the Joker.

Ben McKenzie did an amazing job as Bruce Wayne.This movie is not just amazing because it's darker than the usual movie, it's also very clever and beyond well written. What an achievement!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed opportunity","review":"The best part is the end credits where you get to see David Mazzuchelli's artwork. You can glimpse how cool this movie could've looked instead of the watered down lifelessness of the final animated artwork. If they had used the black lines around the characters, and the great use of black in Mazzuchelli's backgrounds this would've been so much better. Geez, they could've used his nice limited color palette instead of this standardized blahness. They missed a huge opportunity to make this look great and they had the comic as a starting point!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"I almost fell a sleep watching this.

People who grew up reading comics and wanted their heroes to grow up too. When the likes of Alan Moore, Neil Gaiman and Frank Miller started writing, comics grew up. Year one is wonderful, it gives a new beginning to an old story. This is where the Dark Knight was born and where comics became more than cheap thrills.

It really does a good job letting you in his head, you get just how much he hates criminals but as he puts it \\"Even scum have families\\"Gordon is also done great, he's just a total bad-ass, he comes off as the classic Noir Anti-hero, which for me would have been a selling point even if i wasn't a bat-fan. All in all Batman Year-one is just the prefect origin tale for everyone's darkest knight!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bad Batvoice","review":"So, basically the movie follows the comic almost exactly. The voice acting was pretty darn great other than the guy they chose to voice Batman. He did fine for ONE SCENE in the entire movie (for those of you who have read the comic, when he meets Gordon and his wife) and then the rest of the time he spoke in an incredibly flat boring monotone that detracted a lot from the storyline. The art was good -I'm still not a huge fan of a lot of the anime influences in more recent DC movies, but they did give it a lot of the feel the comic book had. Maybe a little too bright. Either way I would watch it again, and I'm glad I own it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excelent adaptation and one of the best animation-movies of DC comics!","review":"This is one of the best adaptations that I have ever seen. Although I still miss the beautiful art of David Mazzucchelli, the animation is excellent. Bryan Cranston of Breaking Bad was the perfect choice for the voice of Gordon. Frank Miller's narrative of Batman Year One is pretty much present in the cartoon. This is an adult animation and makes me wonder if some day they will do an adaptation of Miller's Dark Knight!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Action and art.","review":"Great story, Warner Bros continues to put out a great product in the direct to home comic book character movies. This one is no exception. The artwork alone looks like a living comic book. The story, action and attention to the details we comic nerd enjoy is very high. Great movie, and great voice actors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rent, Dont buy","review":"Please keep in mind that my review comes without having read the graphic novel.I am not sure what DC is doing, but their Batman only animated movies fall short of their other releases. With all the amazing plotlines for these characters, I just feel that the wrong choices are being made.This movie felt very choppy and the plot fell short. I feel they could have extended the movie (its only 64 minutes) and expanded on the plot. This is the first DC animated release to have Catwoman, for which I was very excited, and her part in the movie felt like an after thought. She had such a small part that was not relevant to the strory at all. Even the animated short \\"Catwoman\\" could not make up for it (however the animation was much better). She is one of the top fan favorites, probably right below Joker, and they did not do her any justice.I did enjoy the gritty feel of the film, and that it was aimed to adults more so that kids."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lifeless... listless... unengaging... boring.","review":"Okay, so here we have Commissioner Gordon: Year One... errr, I mean Batman: Year One.It saddens me to say, but this is not very good. I'm sure most people are familiar with original comic. All the best elements of the story have already been appropriated into two VASTLY superior movies:Batman - Mask of the PhantasmandBatman Begins [Blu-ray]The horrible, wooden actor from The O.C. is a horrible, wooden Bruce Wayne/Batman here. This whole movie is pretty lifeless. Batman is a barely a subplot and side character here. This is Lt. Gordon's movie. Really... Mask of the Phantasm is so much better than this. You actually care about the characters in that movie, and they are fully drawn out.

It had Batman in it, and Catwoman, and Jim Gordon (the one with the mustache from the movies). Two-Face was there, but he was still One-Face, which I thought added suspense. At any point I suspected someone to **spoilers** throw acid at his face **end spoilers**. I thought this added real tension to every scene with him in it. Keeps the audience on it's toes.The animation is very good. As good or better than Under the Red Hood.

Like Batman Begins. I thought this was better than batman begins. In this movie he didnt have a armor like Batman Begins. This was all Cloth suit. Love it. When he got shot,he was bleeding a lot on his leg. In batman Begins He had armor and tools. I thought they did a Great job on his first year.Gordon was great.Showed him how he got into office and what he had to go through in the police force. I loved how they put him as a normal cop. He got his A$$ kicked by crooked cops and got payback. Didn't care for catwomen. i love this better than Batman Begins.

The charters do not come together that would answer any questions in any story line. if the title was going to start a new series it could work. As a stand alone it was waste. I think I hate it more because the material was not good enough for a stand alone story and there is no continuation. It could have set up a good 13 episode series, as a standalone, it needs work. If you are collecting all the DC animated movies. I will say buy this. Other wise. This was not one of their better titles.

Batman: Year one needs work or longer story arch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Batman:Year One Review","review":"I also bought this Batman animated movie as a Christmas present for my husband too. He has been eyeing it in the store and has always enjoyed the animated Batman movies. I got it for a good price on Amazon and he was very happy with recieving this item. We haven't watched it yet so I cannot comment on the picture or sound quality but this story does follow the comic book version of how Batman became the vigilantia with a darker flavor to it. At lease that is what the other reviewers described this animated Batman tale. The packaging is really nice and it's really cool that it does include a short film of Catwomen too. The price is such a good deal and it is defiently worth adding to your Batman animated collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just...just read the comic.","review":"This film is a far-too-faithful adaptation of the classic Frank Miller four-part comic. Not so much a translation between mediums as a drag-and-drop into animated form that leaves the work flat and lifeless. This is barely half a step above motion comics.Comics are a completely different beast from movies. Just because your film has the same images (though less stylized in the animation) and dialogue (which gets really bad in the first half with all the inner monologues), doesn't mean it's going to have the same feel as the still images did. If you want great Batman animated films, try Gotham Knight or Under the Red Hood. Those make excellent use of the medium.On the technical size, on bluray the audio and video are, of course, top-notch. There are plenty of extras, including commentary, conversation with DC employees about Batman, and a Catwoman short that does a far better job of being animated than the feature film."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Messianic Jewish\\"= Christian!","review":"There is nothing Jewish about this book- it is but another attempt by \\"Messianic Jews\\" to misrepresent themselves as jews and try to insert Christianity into Judaism!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for Trash","review":"I am a non-jew learning about judaism and planning to convert soon(BH).

The Sketckbook pages are wonderful and really give readers a fantastic peak inside the creative process."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clower/Country Ham","review":"Same good old country humor as one would expect from Jerry Clower. As usal spoken from experience that so well fits the times of the past. As with any humorist there are some repeats from the past albums mixed in with the new ones, but this is to be expected and it will make you go and hunt the old ones you have put away. It is surprising to some of the new listeners that this type of comedy exists in the first place, and all of the stories are new to them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"Once in a while he goes for a ride but most of the time my husband is the one who really listens to music a lot, most of the time while he excersizes.

Lots of nostagia - especially like the segment with Bing and David Bowie and the year that just had Bing and Frank Sinatra singing nothing but Christmas songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memories","review":"A great trip down memory lane; some of the specials were before my time so I'd never seen them. The final Christmas special shot just prior to Bing Crosby's death features an icon and now famous rendition of 'Little Drummer Boy' with pop artist David Bowie. Up until the last Bing Crosby was an entertainer, a legend. This is a great, well edited collection and hope to see more in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bing Crosby Christmas Shows Can't Be Beat","review":"These are great variety shows which I loved.Very clear and a nice booklet enclosed.Probably can be seen better than when first broadcast.A particular treat for me was seeing Shirley Bassey in 1961 from London.Shirley sings This Is My Lucky Day and As I Love You.She is fabulous ! Fans of Shirley Bassey will love this ! Probably one of the earliest Shirley Bassey appearances available on DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too much uninteresting, boring footage!!!","review":"Are you kidding? Bing Crosby must have done better stuff than this!!!! The first DVD was incredibly boring...took place in England...black & white...2nd DVD finally had some rather entertaining Christmas footage in color...but slow moving & not up to the par that I remember from the old days!!! I'm a senior citizen...loves the old performers & movies...but this definitely was not worth my money!!! The cover of this DVD promises more than it delivers!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated and Boring","review":"We were really looking forward to watching this Christmas eve but what a bore. We did not finish watching either disc. The first black and white disc had no stage presence just Bing standing there singing and he was no spring chicken at the time. Then he had his London apppearance and that wasn't any better. He traveled around London with skits that were frankly stupid. Then we tried to watch the second disc in color with Mary Martin and that was a little better. You would not know that this was a Christmas special until about 45 min. into the disc when there was finally a Christmas song. No pretty stage sets, nothing! What a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH","review":"The sound is good the picture quality is good. Guess the idea of old Bing was better than listening to him and his family. They sing ok, but this was pretty boring. The one gem here is a short about 20 film that was a Christmas special Frank Sinatra produced and did with Bing. The two of them together singing was great. Also Frank's set was much better. The show Bing did from London was the best of the Bing bunch, the best \\"show\\" on here though was Frank Sinatra's. BUT if YOU really like Bing you will enjoy this. Oh and there is a film Bing did for the British tourism office so if you like to travel to and in Jolly Old England, you will find this nice too. We enjoyed this part, but it was not a Christmas show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bing Crosby DVD","review":"It was a gift and I felt lucky to find the right volume for my son.

Her choice for surroundings, hair, style really bring the beauty of nature and fairydom into the world. I have seen the finished pattern peices used for suncatchers, mosaic stepping stones and full scale window peices which were breathtaking. With the use of dichroaic glass the iridesence of wings, scales and nature come to life...from easy to advanced this is a great pattern book for the lovers of nature and myth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical, useful","review":"This is a straight forward self help book that avoids most of the traps offered by other books of the genre. Its basic premise uses the cowboy as a metaphor for getting real. The cowboy cannot engage in the metaphysical nonsense of many self help books so must look to reality to inform him how to navigate through the world. For example a cowboy cannot depend on the law of attraction to find his lost calves.Overall I liked the practical if occasionally brutal advise. There was also an occasionally odd attitude toward women that I found a bit disquieting, but it might just be that the book was written in 1981. We take a lot for granted these days.But if you need a self help book that cuts through the bologna of most self help books this may do the trick."},{"rating":"2","title":"possible Pulitzer Prize winner?","review":"what a fantastic read, i believe some kind of recognition is in order for Ben-Mier.

However, in flipping through it before I gave it to her, I read some very morally corupt and even illegal ideas on how to get free food. The author advocates stealing food from the grocery store by eating donuts from the donut case while you walk around the store shopping! This attitude, even in a joking manner, I believe erodes the morals of our society and ultimately creates the ethical issues we are facing today, sich as Enron.Do not support the author by buying this book.

You may find it anticlimactic, or you may look back at the trilogy and try to come to terms with its conclusion. Perhaps Tol is not the altruist we misconstrued him as being, but rather motivated by honor and strong personal loyalties.I like the role that Thompson and Cook assign to Fate; it's reminiscent of Greek or Roman mythology, in which one man is destined by the Gods to become a hero. Here, however, the authors give our hero free choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is okay, but not world's best.","review":"I tried this brittle and it was okay and then I ordered some from MMS Brittles where they have Auntie Muriel's Premium Peanut Brittle.

But labor history studies have changed a great deal since that time. The entire orientation of this book is patronizing to the amazing works of the IWW.For example:1) It completely ignores the IWW's international aspects, for example that the IWW had more influence in Chile and Australia than in the US and Canada.2) It glosses over the IWWs activities during the 1920s, the Marine Transport Workers' control of the Wetsern Hemisphere's shipping, longshore workers in North America, the 1927 Colorado Miners' Strike, etc. etc.3) It has no coherent understanding of why the IWW declined. How FDR worked with Lewis and the CIO to force unionization, the principled stands the IWW took to stop the rise of business unionism, and some buttheadedess by the IWW's membership.It contains many good stories and is an OK overview.

This book has a few good tips, but you can get those from another study guide that also provides practice tests.In short, this book will NOT prepare you for the GRE. Spend your money elsewhere!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This is the most elaborate stage show I have ever seen. It's more than just a concert. It's a full on show.The show has a full band, dancers, and Justin Timberlake in Madison Square Garden and was nothing less than incredible.An awesome track list presented in PCM stereo, PCM 5.1 Surround, and 5.1 Dolby. In my opinion with the exception of 1 or 2 songs the sound was absolutely crystal clear and very well balanced.I'm not the hugest Timberlake fan but I am a fan of music DVD's and this did not dissappoint. Picture, sound, and entertainment value are all really high for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Talent!!","review":"Justin Timberlake is truely talented. I was a fan of NSYNC but I also gained all new respect for Justin Timberlake when he went solo and then even ventured out into the acting side of hollywood. So often many people try making a transition like that and it kills their career. Just goes to show that he has pure talent and I am happy to see that. Also happy that you don't see him in the negative light, as you so often see when young people become so famous, so fast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!!","review":"I received the DVD today and the copy was all messed up and when I opened it;it was completely empty!!!

The NYC venue is high energy, having the stage at the center of the auditorium gives an interesting feel, Timberlake's singing and dancing are decent, his dancers are good, and his band is excellent (especially the drummer, though I found the lead guitarist to be weak, and I play both instruments).At the same time, it's also evident that Timberlake isn't in the same league as people like Beyonce, Madonna, Prince, Janet Jackson, etc., so I consider this performance to be second tier, and there were certainly moments during this concert when I felt bored and wanted to hit fast forward.In short, definitely watch this DVD if you're a Timberlake fan, consider it if you like pop music in general, and skip it if you don't like pop music."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not Pilates.","review":"I borrowed this from the library.The two instructors have over 50 years of experience in exercise doing Pilates, Lotte Berk, yoga, dance and tai chi, and it shows. This is FUSION, so much so that it makes me confused. I wanted a Pilates workout. The large words on the DVD cover say \\"pilates plus\\", but really it should be \\"FUSION with a little bit of pilates\\".I had to stop playing it after 20 minutes. Besides the confusion of what this workout is, the instructors voiceovers were bad and the music was irritating.Winsor Pilates DVDs are my favorite for mat pilates so far, but sometimes I want variety. I will keep looking..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I have never done core fusion before, only Pilates. This workout really works the core in a different way than Pilates. I have two different Pilates workout DVD's and I find this workout challenging. I would consider myself somewhere between a beginner and an intermediate level in Pilates."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK workout","review":"This might be a good beginner's workout. I've been doing pilates for only 3 months and get a better workout from Winsor Pilates Bun and Thigh Sculpting and Abs Sculpting. Also, a few exercises require an empty wall to lean against. If you don't have that, the modifies exercise isn't very effective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pilates?","review":"I purchaed this for pilates and didnt find to much of that. Disappointing. I also found it very boring. The voice on the DVD bored me and made me sleepy. I dont know how pilates can be in the title and not have much of it in the video."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too complicated","review":"I have done pilates before and was excited to buy this to do at home. Once I put it on, the instructors a male and female, seemed to work well together but even for me these moves were confusing and didnt feel like pilates at all...it may be another form of pilates, but wasnt for me. I shut it off after 15 minutes because I really tried to give it a chance....dont buy this unless you are very experienced in pilates and looking for something different"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick and Effective Workout","review":"I have been very pleased with the Core Fusion Pilates Plus DVD. I can pick and choose which routines I want to do, giving me variety and flexibility with my time. The instructors are easy to understand and follow. The pace, intensity, and difficulty of the routines can accommodate beginning to advanced fitness levels. Compared to the Winsor Pilates 20-minute Workout I had been using, the Core Fusion Pilates Plus gives me a better workout and is a better use of time. I would recommend this DVD for those who are short on time or want to add variety to their Pilates fitness routine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent but not pilates","review":"I was excited to give this a shot after reading all the glowing reviews on here but I was disappointed. Yes, some of the segments were challenging but the 10 minute segments seemed to drag on. Only a small section of it is similar traditional mat pilates, which is not what I was expecting (and perhaps that's why I was so displeased). I guess bottom line is I was expecting one thing based on the reviews here and I got another thing that I didn't find to be very exciting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good cross-training for athletes","review":"I am athletic but have little experience with Pilates, so I ordered this DVD for cross-training. If I'd watched the exercises before I made my purchase, my first thought probably would have been \\"These look too easy - it can't be accomplishing anything.\\" Looks are deceiving - this was a very challenging workout! Some of the stuff that looks the easiest is actually the hardest. The core work is very good. For reference, I am doing the P90X \\"Ab Ripper\\" twice a week and still found the core work in this to be really tough. Another added bonus is that fact the workout comes in 10-minute segments, that can be done together or separately if you are pinched for time or want to hit a particular body part. If you are involved in sports or other activities, and would like another way to hit those muscles to reduce chances of injury and improve your overall fitness, this DVD would be a great place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Mind-Body Exercises","review":"This is a really relaxing exercise dvd and yet it's also a good workout. The pure core section is very challenging. I reserve one day a week for stretching exercises and this is the dvd that I use for that, although it is not technically a stretching dvd. The voice-over instruction is very good and it is easy to follow. Overall I'm glad I bought it and I look forward to it every Saturday."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring.","review":"For someone who thinks they may have ADHD, this video may not keep your interest, unless you do it with a partner or two. I prefer workouts (like dance workouts)that stimulates your cardio system while challenging your body to different forms and movements. This one may help maintain your muscle tone but it definitely does not provide the cardio or the interest factor.Another disappointment was that after doing it twice through, my muscles didn't feel a thing. I've done other pilates and yoga workouts that really made me sore, but this one just wasn't giving me that nice feeling. Perhaps I'll give it another try later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really challenging, really fun","review":"I ordered this DVD along with the other Exhale fitness DVD (Body Sculpt) when they were on sale, and I love them both. I'm really disappointed that there are only two so far. I have been doing Pilates for 18 months now and I thought that this one wouldn't be -too- challenging...but I worked my muscles to exhaustion. There are five or six 10-minute sets; I do the video all the way through, but I still really like that setup, because just as I hit the point where I can't work a muscle group any more, they move into exercises aimed at stretching and flexibility in that muscle group before they move on. Also, these exercises can easily be done in a relatively small space--this is a completely apartment-friendly routine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strength in Stillness","review":"This video is one of the best workout videos I have ever used. First of all it keeps my attention. Secondly, it is actually possible to follow what the trainers are doing and recreate it myself. That said, I can only do the beginner positions and I'm still sore the next day. I know I will work out with this video for a long time to come as I grow in strength. It's unbelievable how simple a move will look but how it is difficult to execute. I have dropped a dress size in a month and 10% of my body weight with this video as one of my secret weapons."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome and challenging.","review":"I am pretty weak as only one year ago I couldn't exercise at all and was totally exhausted. So I have just started and this dvd is awesome. its very challenging but therapeutic. So far so good I really like this dvd. On the other hand - I can't do the whole dvd at once in one day, maybe in 2 days or doing parts of it in one day.But besides that its very awesome in the genre of pilates/lotte berke/barre workouts available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film worth hunting down","review":"This was a great one, but I liked the original Hot Rods, Rat Rods: Back from the Dead better. For some reason the original can be purchased even cheaper than this (insanely cheap) documentary. If you've seen the original, get this one without hesitation. If you haven't, see that one first.

This person has no business counseling parents of homosexuals, as it is clear she has no understanding of them. She describes them as something that formed wrong, flowers that didn't open. I have news for you, Ms. Johnson. God doesn't make mistakes. Each person is made that way for a reason, just because you can't get out of a stone age interpretation of the Bible, don't infect other parents and friends of gay people with your poisonous fake christian \\"love\\".

As a gay Christian (yes, a GAY Christian), I find Mrs. Johnson's writings decidedly disturbing and un-Christian. The Bible does NOT clearly condemn gay people (if one researches historical and language origins of Biblical writings) and to base her reaction to her gay son on Christian beliefs is just wrong. So yes, I think that makes this a bad book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrid book by a heartless woman","review":"I was given this book to read shortly after coming out to a relative, back in the early nineties. What a cruel joke that was. Luckily, my relative has since learned how terrible that move was.

There's nothing funny, sweet, or even mildly loving about that."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"I purchased the book because the optimistic tone of the title appealed to me.

Readers might benefit by skimming over those long and often repeated portions on 'gayness' and pick up instead on her light-hearted and insightful encouragement. I enjoy her humor - she's like an Erma Bombeck with the Christian piece added right up-front. For those seeking other Christian authors with a humorous slant, pick up one (or more!) of John Ortberg's books."},{"rating":"1","title":"A worrisome approach...","review":"I greatly admire Ms. Johnson's ability to maintain a positive attiude in the face of so much adversity. I was extremely disappointed however by her moral condemation of homosexuality, despite her having a son who is gay. Ms. Johnson believes that homosexuals \\"opt for the gay lifestyle\\" and concludes that if they are Christians, they should repress their sexual desires and not act upon them. It frightens me that this woman is leading a support group for parents of homosexuals. Also, in general the book is poorly structured and almost infantile in tone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disbelief","review":"Well, I am sorry to say that for me, was really frustrating to open my package and find out that the book sent to me was a miniature of it. I could not believe it. I was shocked!! When I bought it, had nothing saying that what this person was selling, was only a miniature of the real book with only the highlights of it. This is my first time in a book club and now I am reading my second book and I let somebody else buy for me. I am afraid to buy anything that has a lower price now. In mean while, all my friends keep telling me that they bought a book for a good price, but I do not have courage anymore, or for a while to try to do it again on my own. That was a real shame.I bought this book with \\"Savings4U\\" on Feb.09, 2011"},{"rating":"1","title":"How dare you be a homosexual!","review":"I read so much about her down to earth humor and wit that I picked her up. You have to be really right wing, and realy christian to truly enjoy her book. And if you are, you will enjoy her breezy depictions of her marriage, identify with her horror at discovering her son has succumbed to the \`homosexual lifestyle' (as the blurb puts it.) and egg her on all the way, upbeat despite all her travails. If you are slightly more iiberal, you will question the very basis of this book, think her humor extremely offensive (he cannot be gay, he is a christian) and believe there are many people who have lead much more difficult lives than her, who do not try and make a book out of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would not recommend","review":"Bought this shed last year, thought it was a great deal but it was too good to be true.

It is a serious ink guzzler---reminds me of my LandCruiser going through gas. The black ink cartridge lasted less than 500 pages of wordprocessing, which is extremely expensive. The black snd white printing is quite good; the color in my view is unsatisfactory. The clarity is nowhere near the sample in the store machine---grainy and unclear even from my 2.1 pixel digital camera at the highest setting. There are clearly visible lines and grain. Black and white is extremely fast; akin to a laser; the color is painfully slow; I cannot take as credible the reviews that claim that color printing takes less than 1 minnute; color averages 5 minutes and longer for photos. REcommended only for word processing; otherwise, this printer is slow, expensive and low resolution."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Printer Stinks!","review":"Don't waste your money on this printer!

This printer prints quality papers, will last long, and is just great for any computer user to have. So there you have it.

It is not a total waste since Bullet train is a 2 disk set and Golgo 13 are both not dubbed. But i got the set for the body gaurd and karate warriors.

He does an excellent job of deflating the pretenses of both left- and right-leaning SF authors, not to mention his direct hits on wack jobs and elitists both in and outside the genre. Disch sometimes tries a little too hard to show you how clever he is, but, as I indicated earlier, his irreverent sense of humor saves the day. Most imporantly, perhaps, he reminds us that \\"[a]rt is a kind of play, and those who forget how to be playful are likely to produce art that is ever more mature and responsible and ponderous\\".\\"Must\\" reading for anyone interested in science fiction and its influence on our culture."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovin' Me Tender","review":"I heard this first in 1983, a year after it was realised, and it made me sit up and listen to music production a little more than I had done.

It was introduced to me by a Guy from Kerry who told me to listen to \\"You've always got the Blues\\" after a girl had dumped me and Man was he right.If anyone can get a coopy of this on CD I'd pay any amount for it.

I have the apex toddler seat that is quite wide, and you can't leave the pillows in place, they stand up at a 45 degree angle. I attached elastic to the bottom in order to fix them to the plastic that holds the seat pad in place. This works, but obviously only if you're sitting next to them when they fall asleep! Other than that you'd have to stop the car, get out and attach them, then go again, by which time the child is probably awake anyway! To be honest, I haven't seen a better alternative yet though.

However, she's willing to work for the wife, out of female solidarity. She still refuses to find out why the clinic says her client is a murderer.The story crawls. Every time the author introduces a new character, we get ten pages of dull, irrelevant backstory. The snail-paced narrative grinds to a dead halt.

However, the movie is listed elsewhere as having a running time of 96 minutes while the print used here is only about 74 minutes. From reviews of the uncut version, it appears much violence and nudity (!) have been excised. Also, there are no opening credits and the end credits aren't enough to identify the actors or title. There isn't enough here to justify purchase of the DVD for this movie alone. \\"Moon of the Wolf\\" is/was available on the same label coupled with another title.

In terms of its musical artistry of the performer alone it rates as nothing short of draw dropping, but I'd rate its compositional values right up there with Bach's 24 prelude and fugues and Chopin's. In fact one could argue that the Chopin C minor prelude is very smiliar to this in ters of emotional gravity. These tunes get in your head and you'll want to hear them again and again. Particuarly the opening, the Dracula Reinfield track and Dracula in the theatre track. The emotional depth and the dramatic power of this recording is incredible.

Maybe six months will go by that I don't listen to it, but I always come back. Tracks from this album wind up on mix tapes, both for myself and others.The songwriting can be shaky at times (Skin and Serenity are the only tracks I skip, and both on account of the lyrics), but the vast majority of the album is a tight (super-tight) mix of facinating lyrics, sterling vocals, and sick instrumentation.

It doesn't even cover many of the biggest threats to computer security today, and the few that it does mention don't get any in-depth discussion."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book suitable for 1980's","review":"Security concepts dealt in this book are of early 1980's computer issues- it doesn't put much emphasis on the recent security technologies. Hard to read, hard to follow what the writer wants to imply. Had to buy this book for Security info systems engineering class at Polytechnic University, Brooklyn, NY- but didn't find any use. It's a total junk for the price. Doesn't include any security tool in a cd, nor does it talks about practical usage of such software. Try buying Hacking Exposed book for a lot cheaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a gift to the security profession!","review":"This book is simply superb - a comprehensive, beautifully written text for information security students and practitioners. Matt Bishop has decades of security-related contributions to his credit and his book reflects his accumulated wisdom on all things security. I believe that those colleges and universities that offer information security degree programs will certainly use this book as text for those programs, and in doing so, will serve their students extremely well. And for those of us who are laboring in the security vineyard, this book represents a rare opportunity to refine our understanding of the fundamentals by tuning in to the thoughts of a master teacher and practitioner. Well done!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best inspirational CD ever made!!","review":"\\"Returning the Gift\\" is my all-time favorite. I have been a fan of Di Scherling since she first began recording her music. Di definitely has \\"a gift\\" with her musical talents and this CD certainly demonstrates her musical ability.

You'll be glad you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Di Scherling truly returns her spiritual musical gift for all to enjoy","review":"Di Scherling's CD \\"Returning the Gift\\" is truly a masterpiece. Every composition provides the listener with a gentle and soft, heart felt spiritual expression that warms the heart. The mastery and intricacy of her pianistic talents are showcased by the full rich sounds and tones of each note. I enjoy listening to her music because it stirs my soul and relaxes my mind. Even the title of her CD reveals her sense of thoughtful consideration. It is akin to the saying, \\"Yesterday is history, tomorrow is a mystery, but today is a GIFT, that is why we call it the PRESENT. I suggest you receive this present."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for first 7 months","review":"I purchased this monitor in August 2007. It was great out of the box. No dead pixels, awesome color, and I was very pleased. I never used the speakers so I don't have an opinion of them.After having the monitor for 7 months is images on the screen began to have a ghost duplicate to the right, causing everything to look blurry, and unfocused. I contacted customer service who suggested that I needed to update my computer. Instead I tried the monitor with 3 other laptops, all with the same problem.

There is nothing more frustrating than paying 200+ bucks for a pair of headphones, only to have them not hold up over time.I have encountered the exact same thing as other reviewers - namely, the connection between the earpiece and the cable is shoddy and loses connection, causing complete loss of sound.I am a musician and was relying on these things for my sound mix in my ears. I find myself all to often having to wiggle the wire while playing live, hoping that somehow I will find that tiny spot where the connection seems to work.There aren't replacements readily available on UE's website.

Well, for now it looks that this is indeed the situation. My cable just broke and I cannot locate a replacement cable anywhere (well, found one in London for something like $65). The company doesn't even have email support to ask the question, the link goes to a non-functional Logitech page as of 10-13-09.

If you have an excellent source, these headphones offer you a lot of sounds that you've never heard before. They are definetly flatter than the Shures. That means less treble and more bass than the Shure's, as my interpretation goes. I'm not an audiophile but the sound is very good, very clear, and the stable over all volumes. Comfort is lacking compared to the Shures in my opinion so I took a star away for that. The headphones are larger than the Shures and are more rigid around the ear, which is nice actually since putting them on quickly is easier. If a smaller foam insert was included with the larger insert that would've been nice.N."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love 'em!","review":"I found the sound fantastic. Just got these after usinf Shure E3s for about a year. I liked those but find these even better. When I first tried them I found the base so much stronger than the E3s as many have alluded to. Now I run my iPod at normal equalizer settings. I find the balance of the set dead on. The fit is great, of course your milage may vary. In fact they are so good at excluding air conduction that bone conduction becomes very noticable. This means when I walk with them I can hear my footsteps. This would be a real problem if I jogged (low impact workouts such as elipticals and bicycles are not affected)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound but poor build quality","review":"These earbuds sound really nice, probably the best sounding pair I have owned.Hopever, I found them to be quite uncomfortable and hard to fit compared to the humble koss plug or the more expensive Entymotic.The cable seems tough, but it has a strong PVC smell for the first few months which eventually fades, however it is stiff and prone to cracking.The build quality is quite poor, the bass driver on my right earpiece broke after 10 months, the cable covering broke around the same time.Despite the advertised 2 year warranty, I was unable to get a response to my RMA request from the ultimate ears website after two separate attempts over a 1 month period.And they do not sell spare earbuds for their products either. Cusotmer support leaves a lot to be desired.Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb sound, but slightly uncomfort","review":"The sound is superb! You'll hear what you've never hear with these earphones. I'm not sure if my problem has anything to do with the earphone, but I think it causes me a little headache. Maybe because it was too tight when I plugged it into my ears. Yes, it helps blocking the noise outside, but at the same time it causes a pressure in the ears.And don't buy the white ones.

Where all the others seemed either too basey or too Tinny, these are a nice balance. I was concerned with the noise isolation, as I really enjoy using my Sony noise cancelling when Im flying or on the subway, but I can already tell that it wont matter anymore as these Super.Fi's are top notch. The volume on my Ipod wasnt even at 50% yet and the sound was already superior and I couldnt hear anything else going on around me.

After experimenting and finding the right sized buds to use to get a good \\"seal\\" in the ear, these earphones delivered superb sound. The best part is because they're compact, you can sleep with them on, walk around without looking \\"geeky,\\" and easily just chill. The downside of in ear earphones is that you can't chew, hum, and sometimes breath without hearing yourself - loudly. (It's just like putting your fingers in your ears and humming.)Haven't tried in a noisy environment like an airplane, but they definitely seal out the sound! If you have the extra change, I'd definitely recommend these if you're serious about music."},{"rating":"2","title":"The very best earphones I've ever used (until superfi.10 came out!).","review":"These are really quite surprising phones.

Even when playing tracks transferred in a lossy format they sound pretty good and not as tinny as the etymotics. But when I play cuts recorded in Apple Lossless format they really shine. Why?

The customer service is poor and they refuse to take ownership of the fact that the cable on these earphones breaks very easily.

Any movement or touch caused the sound to transfer through the cables to the ear buds. You can hear (rather loudly) even the lightest brush of the cables over a shirt.

If that was the only issue, I would recommend these SuperFi 5 Pro earphones. But the deal killer here is the cord. To allow the user to shape the cord over the top and behind the ear, there is a flexible wire in the cord. It's a good idea, but poorly executed. I've had to replace the cord twice in 18 months (they run $20 plus tax/shipping). If you plan on using the small aluminum carrying case to carry it around while traveling, those wires will be bending all the time. And don't look for any sympathy from Ultimate Ears (now Logitech) if they break right after the end of the one year warranty. If you buy these earphones, plan on spending money on periodic cord replacement.For these reasons I can't recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Um","review":"I got some of these bad boys a couple of months back and let me tell you they are amazing :).. really i have the bose A 2 headphones and they dont come close to these puppies not only are they cheaper, they have better sound, and they are much more portabale..Only problem is :) and this is a minor one if you lose the little plastic thingys your kinda out of luck..But if you take good care of your items :) then you should be fine.but iv been really look for a good pair of headphone for a while now, and yeah there really awesome :)cant fault themHope this helps you guysRegards"},{"rating":"2","title":"The sound is outstanding","review":"Fantastic sound.

I definitely do not regret it. It is well worth the money. Grant it, as others have said, getting the right earpiece cover to fit perfectly is a chore. However, once you find the perfect fit, it is wonderful. You have to be careful because the noise-isolation works so well that even on a low volume setting, it's hard to hear what's going on around you. You can still hear, but it is not the same as wearing the usual headphones that come with most mp3 players, walkmans, etc.I couldn't decide between these and the ones with the bass boost, but I listen to such a variety of music that I need the highs as well as the bass. The range is well covered, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"great sound, poor quality","review":"Have owned these earphones for 3 years.

These earphones were treated with kid gloves .If you don't mind replacing expensive earphones every couple years go for these, the sound is great.The company Ultimate Ears uses for its first line of defense from customers is worthless.

Thank you UE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Durability","review":"I'm going to keep it simple:+Great sound quality and noise isolation+Decent transportability-BREAKS VERY EASILY with normal use (as of now both sides of mine are covered in epoxy due to the plastic breaking and I even had to take a soldering pen to one side) If not for this my review would be a 5/5."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable and broke after only 14 months","review":"Purchased May 2008 and used approximately 3x / week for 1 hour or less. Always uncomfortable as the only way to get them to stay on was to loop the stiff wire over ears. Surprisingly, the stiff, heavy, bulky wires failed at the Y connection after only 14 months of occasional use. Don't waste your money on these overpriced earphones."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sound ... tricky to get in the ear right!","review":"I have used these earphones for a little under 2 years. I have small ear canals so getting a good seal has been tricky. However, with some practice I managed to get a pretty good sound. These are great sounding phones for the audio savy. I can really hear my music come to life on my Ipod and Zune HD. Most people think I am crazy for paying a lot for earphones but I am an audiophile at heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"music to my ears","review":"this product is worth every penny. my zune or any previous portable player I've owned never sounded this fantastic!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor build quality","review":"Great sound, but the build quality is just not there. On a recent trip to Europe, the left bud completely fell apart and the leads became disconnected from the bass driver. They are only two months old and I always keep them in the case! I had to solder it back together and then super glue the bud back together. Since then I've also had to superglue the right bud as well. Also, the cable sheath is fraying over one bud lead, revealing the fine speaker wire underneath. I don't expect these phones to last much longer which is too bad. They are great sounding and comfortable, but unfortunately they seem to have cut some important corners. Be warned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"do not believe the good reviews","review":"i bought these for myself as a christmas present and it was more like the nightmare after christmas. these do not fit in your ear, there is a stiff wire that you can bend behind your ear to hold them in, you will bend and bend and bend then shake your head and they fall out. you cant see the little left and right marker its a teeny tiny raised letter in a spot difficult to find. but after one month of trying to use these the plastic cracked and the bud broke off. this is truly a case where paying more is less. TRUST ME!!!! there are better ones out there much cheaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't truly review this yet.","review":"I purchased these after reading all the other reviews. I am certain that these are quality in ears but my ear canals are so small, none of the tips will work. I am going to have them fitted with custom moldings soon and that should make a big difference. Other than that, the packaging, overall sound from what I can gather and the case is all very cool."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star is too much for this product - DON'T BUY THESE","review":"I purchased these earphones on the basis of the many positive reviews. Worst earphones I've ever experienced. I asked two friends to try them just to get their feedback - worst earphones they ever used. After having the Bose headphones I didn't expect that quality but they are awful. I purchased these to have a set of earbud style in addition to the Bose. Returned them two days later and purchased some high-end Sony earbuds that are great. Even the construction of these with the ridiculous wiring looks like someone made them in their garage. Buy Bose or Sony but avoid these and don't buy into the reviews... something is wrong here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clarity isn't always a great thing","review":"I bought these buds primarily for my Ipod based on other reviews. It took a few weeks to break in since I don't use my Ipod much, but once they were broken in, the sound was nice and crisp, which was bad for some of my lowly sampled mp3s. That said, they are not very forgiving towards poorly encoded mp3s and forced me to go back and encode lossless audio files. The reason being was because these buds are so detailed that they clearly presented any flaws in the audio.Other than that, I had some difficulty getting comfortable to them being inserted so deeply into my ear canals. I eventually got used to it though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cord Problems","review":"I have been very happy with the audio quality, although I do frequently wish for some more bass. HOWEVER, the cables are shoddily soldered and I have had two give out on me. Each time costs me $20 plus shipping - a tax that I hadn't planned on paying to Logitech. Customer support does not answer the phone in a reasonable time and I no longer have the serial number so I can't even request by internet.My advice is to keep shopping. My next pair will be from a smaller company that cares enough to answer the phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a piece of junk","review":"Bought this to replace my 10-year-old Leatherman PST II, which is worn but still functional after daily use all these years.Right out of the box, one of the SOG's tool covers fell right off. The other followed a couple of days later. I didn't really mind that because they're useless and in the way, and the tool is better off without them. But the VERY FIRST TIME I used the phillips screwdriver, on the third screw the driver head snapped right in half. $65 down the toilet - I've rarely been so cheated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Photo is wrong","review":"Sog S63 is pictured, not the S-62. I ordered this item and received a tool with uncovered gears. I called Sog and was told that the Sog S-62 does not have covered gears,SOG Specialty Knives & Tools S63-N EOD PowerLock with V-Cutterdoes have covered gears. This photo needs to be changed to show the S-62, Sog makes great multi-tools, but this is an issue they need to clarify. I wanted covered gears for comfort while using the 1/4 inch drive and screwdrivers, and because I have heard the uncovered gears will wear a hole in pockets. I had to return this item and order the S-63. Other than that, the tool is great. Nice big powerful wire-cutters and pliers, and if I chose to I can change some of the items on the tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as pictured.","review":"I THOUGHT I was ordering the tool pictured but \\"Sold by: Amazon.com LLC \\" sent me an older model. It does not have the covers over the gears. I like to carry my multi-tools in my pocket and these gears tear holes in pockets. I'd be returning it on principle alone (not sending what they claim to be selling). But it's also much larger and heavier than the Leatherman Wave. Add to this the fact that I was hesitant to purchase from Amazon anyway given the deplorable working conditions of their warehouse employees and this seals the deal. My money goes elsewhere from now on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely the best I've ever owned!","review":"Amazing tool! Found many more use's for this than what I used to get from my assorted leathermen tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"B quality","review":"I recieved a b quality item not good enough to be sold by any official sog source, I still love the tool and have used it without problems, I took the covers off they seemed extra. Badly dented the plier cutters cutting romax cable, very soft metal used here.All the laser etching was very bad.The tool was very stiff can barely open with one hand but this is fine it doesn't open on accident"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Multi-Tool","review":"I generally carry a multi-tool when I'm carrying a backpack. It lets me have access to a lot of small tools in a compact package. I like the SOG for the ratcheting plier mechanism (more leverage) and the tool quality, plus the ease of replacing individual tools. The SOG also doesn't have edges on the grip that bite into your hands and it doesn't have plastic parts that can crack or soften when exposed to chemicals and the outdoors. I picked the SOG specifically because it appeared more substantial and rugged than other tools.Of course, there are lots of other manufacturers making tools that in many cases are just as nice, so pick one that meets your needs. I broke the knife blade off so that it doesn't attract unwanted attention going through metal scanners. You probably can't take this on a plane even without the knife blade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome tool","review":"This tool dose every thing and more but using the scissors is uncomfortable due to the small somewhat sharp handle but other than that this tool is great"},{"rating":"2","title":"B61-N EOD","review":"Great tool for the money with a good case. No weaknesses easy to clean and no glare. good tool for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent large multitool with strongest grip","review":"This is an excellent large multitool. I own seven of them (Gerber Legend, Leatherman Wave and Juice XE6, custom Gerber 600, Shrade Tough Tool and Bucktool) and this is the largest.With the compound leverage on this size tool it has outstanding gripping power. The handle covers make this a great feeling tool with none of the pain one might feel while clamping down on a traditional Leatherman.All of the tools lock well with the exception that the drive socket and bottle opener can come loose. This is the only reason I gave this tool four stars and I am not sure that it is not particular to just my tool. If someone wants a large tool with the best gripping ability than this is the one to get. This tool also has a great price for the size."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great multi tool","review":"I purchased this tool on the brand alone. Sog makes great kit and this was a welcome addition to mine.Its bigger than my leatherman with a better set of pliers. When closed, the teeth on the pliers fit together so well you could use it like a pair of tweezers. The power grip works. Know your own strength and don't use this on plastic parts or markable surfaces.My leatherman was a disappointing in the blade department. This tool is razor sharp, but the blade was thinner than expected. Don't expect to be prying anything open with this blade. (Not that you should anyway)SOG didn't skimp on the case either. No flimsy nylon case here. This tool comes with a heavy(1/8 inch thick) treated leather case.If you were worried about getting what you paid for, worry not, this is a great tool and well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Last Multi-tool I'll ever buy","review":"SOG makes the best multi-tools ever....great product, great design. I love the ability to replace individual tools as they become worn without having to buy another multi-tool. These multi-tools by far, beat the competition like Gerber and Letherman.The ability to open, close and operate one handed is an absolute must and SOG makes this happen. I can do this with both my right and left hand (I'm right handed). Also SOG's Compound Leverage system allows me to cut wire of various gauge with ease.I highly recommend this SOG multi-tool to anyone serious about using great tools and only want to buy them once."},{"rating":"2","title":"best multi tool I have found","review":"After shopping around for a good multi tool and reading reviews,I decided on the SOG B61-N EOD.I couldn't be more pleased.I was looking for a heavy duty tool and I found a HEAVY DUTY tool.This multi tool will stand up to anything you need it for.Although I don't own a Leatherman or gerber(but I know people who own both),the only tool that could compare to the SOG is the Victorinox Swisstool RS,which I might get just to have one,but my main multi tool would be the SOG B61-N EOD.If you are looking for a well made heavy duty multi tool,get this one or the Swisstool RS ONLY."},{"rating":"2","title":"Emergency EDC tool.","review":"Everything operates smoothly. Very well constructed and should last a lifetime.This has almost everything I would need for a quick fix."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but for one peeve...","review":"This is a great multitool. Folks that complain about size or bulk are picking at strings, it's not any noticeable difference from it's competition. I have one real issue, the metal safety flaps are easy to accidentally unclip. That makes for some fumbling around, because I don't want to lose that thing, and it clips right back on, but it's a little frustrating. The finish could be a little tougher too, but that's nitpicking a great tool otherwise.Considering the quality of the tool, the options, the truly excellent compound squish factor, and reasonable cost I can't see opting for another model unless it was something really special."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old model not as good as updated version","review":"I purchased and promptly returned this particular product. Pliers and overall construction are good; however, there is a distinct difference between the old and new model variants. This difference lies in the locking mechanism used to lock all of the tools in place. The one I purchased came with a single button. My understanding is that the newer models have a \\"piano hinge\\" style locking mechanism which locks each tool independently. I have the powerassist version which has that mechanism and it is far superior to the singular button. In short, great tool, but make sure you get the updated version."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOG S62","review":"This is a poor excuse for a multitool. While the compound gears are impressive at opening and closing the main pliers, the so called power lock mechanism is terrible. You have to line each tool up perfectly in order to lock each component. When you swing out a blade or driver, multiple tools swing out with it, necessitating pushing them back in. Then you need to align them perfectly for the tool you wanted to lock in place. Even if you think its locked, it tends to come loose, putting you at injury risk.I had always wanted a sog, but i'm going to have to return this(not bought on amazon, clearance at a sporting goods store, but even for $50 its not worth it.) This one also had no V-cutter, and had a second serrated knife. Maybe its defective or maybe not, but there are much better multitool options out there.Leatherman, and Victorinox have far supperior locking mechanisms. The Wave and Swisstools blow this out of the water."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awasome Service","review":"I had an older model SOG multi-tool (10 years old) an airport TSA agent relieved me of it.

I comes in handy SOG has continued to improve there product line and I would recommend this tool to others along with this seller. They provided quick services and fast processing. {8-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"There must be something better","review":"Bought the black oxide coated model with power lock and the spike for breaking out windows. Hate it.The so called pivoting handles snap off nearly everytime I try to open any blade and I have to put them back on again...terrible design.The file doesn't even file fingernails but will leave a nice strip of the black oxide coating on whatever you try to file. Black oxide coating comes off easily.Blade is sharp but it is hard to just open one blade or screwdriver as they open together and then you have to unlock them one at a time to put them back before using the blade.The additional torque offered by the SOG cam system is great but probably for the average joe's use not that big of a deal.My friends have other brands and I wish I had gotten theirs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the powerlock 2","review":"After my original powerlock shattered i bought a powerlock 2. what arrived was a original powerlock with a c-4 spike.

The same voice could be heard on a few re-runs of Grey's Anatomy. The GM website was very accomodating in providing a web jump to \\"The Story\\". The music written and performed by Brandi Carlile brings an appreciation for her range and skills as a singer. A type of CD that you'll play over and over again, because so many of the tracks are wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"a rich powerful voice","review":"I love the story. I just found out about Brandi a few weeks ago. She fills that \\"closer to fine\\" void in todays music.

She can burn like Melissa at times, fall back on senstive sounds like Kathleen Edwards when she wants. There are influences from 60s rock (Elton, Beatles, Mott), yet her distinct warble blossoms as a wildwood flower. I'm gonna find her debut CD.If you gravitate toward other female singer-songwriter greats in league with Sarah Harmer, Alice Peacock or Jessica Sykes, this should work for you.Indigo Girls guest on \\"Cannonball\\"As far as great CDs of the last couple of years go, this one ranks right up there with Allison Moorer's Neil Young inspired \\"The Duel\\" (hey if the Crazy Horse-shoe fits, wear it) and Patty Griffin's homage to the good ol' days,\\"Impossible Dream\\". Lofty company to be sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Story is told!","review":"What can I say? The Story is an amazing cd. When a voice like Janis Joplin meets Natalie Merchant is sung with the sound like James Taylor and the Indigo Girls combined, you have nothing but a winner. She's real, she's raw, she's Brandi. From songs like The Story, whose lyrics rip across your heart with love and friendship, to songs that make you miss your old friends even more, like Turpentine, this cd is amazing.

Why?","review":"This cd is particularly disheartening. What we have here is the most beautiful voice to come along in years, but why all the gloom and depression? What we don't need is another \\"angst\\" singer. There are tons of 'em out there. I can't help thinking that this girl is wasting her talent. Looking for some uplifting, catchy and fun songs? You won't find any here."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a voice!","review":"This CD immediately became my new favorite after just a couple of listens. Her voice is incredible. She combines the best vocal qualities of Patsy Cline's, Gwen Stefani's, and Jewel's voices with her own gutsy, emotionally powerful style. On the title track, The Story, she lets loose with her voice and it \\"shreds\\" at one point(I don't know how else to describe it). It is amazing. Her music is essentially rock with a flair for vocals, which at times give it a more folk rock, or alternative country appeal, depending on the song. There are no songs that are \\"duds\\" on the album, so you can play it straight through with no skipping. There are some songs that are mellow or sad, and some that are very energetic and upbeat. I love them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW! AMAZING!!!","review":"Brandi Carlile is an amazing artists! I reccomend this CD and if you get the chance go see her in concert, she is absolutely amazing live! I honestly wasn't that big a fan of hers until I saw her in concert and since then I haven't been able to listen to anything else.

Of course, you also have to enjoy country and folk-style music, but I will say the twang and \\"country-esque\\" licks are understated in the album.

The candor of the lyrics and the raw honesty of her voice are like nothing I've heard in a long while. The title track brings tears to my eyes - the passion of it and the way her voice breaks when she's belting it out - as if conveying the emotion is more important to her than the appropriate delivery. The song is weighty and profound. Her music has a versatility that blurs the lines of genre, with a vocal sound reminiscent of country legend Patsy Cline. \\"The Story\\" hit my best seller list. I look forward to future works from this talented young lady."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love her unique, passionate voice!","review":"Another great CD! Brandi is one of my favorite singers and has been for years, long before she was signed with her record label.

But the book reads like it is written by someone whose entire literary education centered on cheap romance novels.

Remarkable and unfortunate on the author's part."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oona?","review":"This supposed biography of Oona O'Neill Chaplin spends much of its time discussing Eugene O'Neill and Charlie Chaplin. Certainly Oona lived in the shadow of Charlie, but she doesn't emerge as a person in this biography. The book is poorly written. Too much repetition of points made, some really silly sentences of superficial statement. And no depth. Nonetheless, it's an interesting read because of the people and the lives narrated."},{"rating":"2","title":"A glowingportrait of a woman who defined grace and dignity","review":"Abandoned by her father, Eugene O'Neill, Oona transformed this hurt into love and care for her much older husband, Charlie Chaplin. This book details her life, and gives us great insight into what family, fame,love and loyalty mean in this century. While not known for any traditional arts, such as acting or writing (though, it is clear from this biography that she may have been successful in either form), Oona's art was her life itself; her ability to deal with a father who rejected her, a sibling she looked up to but could not help, and a husband to whom she devoted herself to as he lived out his life in a time when the world was rapidly changing.The writing is clear and without pretension. Ms. Scovell realizes that Oona was a complex person and conveys that to the reader.

But once the speakers worked I was happy - for 10 weeks. Now the ethernet port no longer lights up so I have to connect the ethernet cable to the laptop - a 3rd cable across my desk.

If you try to hook up sound to the dock directly it will fail all the time and cause you headache.2. When unplugging the dock, many times the sound from the computer will fail since it tries to send sound to the dock. When this happens, you must restart your computer to get sound working properly.

To say that one would want to go see a movie based on that one song is preposterous.For the music itself, it is wonderful. It portrays the mood and feeling of the movie it represents. 4 out of 5 stars is not bad but there is a reason. The music is representative of it's source material and not entirely enjoyable unless one has seen the movie. In other words, it doesn't stand entirely on it's own two feet.

There's one really interesting thing about the special powers that any pyrmid shape can have and the results of experiments used with these.If you wanna know about the pyramids shafts and Egypt history, then get this book. If you wanna know about aliens building the pyramids like this book says it will explain, don't get this book.

Von Daniken seems to have a grudge against archaeologists, who he repreatedly tries to bash. Unfortunately Von Daniken is the one who ends up looking like a fool. On Von Daniken's behalf, I will say this much for him- even though he has no proof, no validity, and no scientific background, he does seem to have his finger firmly on the pulse of the lunatic fringe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Pseudoscience","review":"This book is completely misleading. I had to read it for a class on myths in Archaeology, where we discussed the factual basis for aliens in ancient Egypt and other claims. However, Von Daniken has no factual basis for this book. He twists the truth, misquotes other authors, leaves out pertinent evidence, and outright lies to his readers, all because he thinks that ancient extraterrestrials visited the earth. His \\"research\\" is solely based on what he wants to believe, not facts. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Eyes of The Sphinx","review":"Great book that goes against the grain of the scientific community.

Quite honestly the designers of the show aren't the draw. It is the wacky, drastic, and sometimes disasterous exchange of change that occurs between two consenting neighbors. The draw of the show is the concept of someone giving up a room in their home, reluctant but oddly excited at the same time, in order for a neighbor and \\"some pal\\" they've chosen to come in and totally redesign it. This DVD however, is more of a tribute to the designers themselves. We see some bloopers, select designer interviews, favorite moments, and basically none of the good stuff that really attracts viewers to the show. Don't bother adding this one to your library. Stick to watching episodes on BBC!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work!","review":"My dvd player had problems with regional blocking and pc drive could not read it either."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun Read","review":"A really fun read.

Tambien se ve que quiere meterse un poco a la critica soscial con \\"por bandera\\" pero es un intento fallido, aunque no se lo toma en serio y lo toma como una cancion mas y no como una postura falasa.

I didn't have time to peruse the Math section, but the Verbal and Analytical Writing Sections were very helpful. It was the only book I used to prepare for the test, so I cannot compare this with Barrons, Kaplan, or others. I will say that the reading comprehension part of the Verbal section was not sufficiently developed, which is a minus point. On balance, however, an extremely useful tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Software is buggy","review":"The book is great for tips and tricks. However, if you wish to use the practice CD -- this is not the one to buy. I found many many bugs in the program. I was not even able to score a test after spending 45 min taking it -- the program simply failed out on the last few questions, and I had no idea how I did! Furthermore, the program gave me the same reading comprehension section 3 times during the same test. Finally, many of the questions from the test come from the practice sections in the book. Thus, if you want to see diffent questions -- don't waste your money on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good test review","review":"As long as you have the self dicipline to put in the study hours, this book is a great guide for GRE prep. I have previously taken a Princeton Review class (for the LSAT, not the GRE) and found this book to be similarly structured with many of the same helpful tricks (plus it saves you $1000, ouch). The disc that comes with this book has simulated GREs which were good for my first few practices of the test, but the disc had some operational errors that were sort of annoying. (I would recommend an additional purchase of the ETS Powerprep Software which has ACTUAL previously administered GREs.) Overall, I would say that this was a good purchase and it definitely raised my score."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only aid you need (and something candy to chew on)","review":"This book did wonders for me.

I was horrible at figuring out those stupid games. Why would I take so much consideration in the fact that Beth doesn't want to sit next to Sue? Have her sit on the floor if she doesn't like it.

Bravo to the designers.My only gripe with this case is, however, that there are few pockets for accessories, like the Manfrotto camera stand, or the extra battery, or even a Gary Fong flash diffuser.

One, 95% of the people listed aren't well known, or have such little to say that I got the feeling this was a slap together book that was produced simply to produce monies for his cardiac foundation.

Sure cannot be the under fifty crowd since there are so few people aside from Bill Gates, Joe Perry of Aerosmith for boomers to read.

As several other reviewers pointed out, this book can be summarized as \\"Genetic manipulation of the human race will happen, it's a good thing, we'll all be better off, and although there are moral considerations, we won't bother mentioning any of them here\\". The book is essentially this arguement, repeated over and over. There is very little concerning the science behind genetic manipulation and absolutely nothing on the ethics of undertaking the redesigning our species. This book could easily be compressed into a three page article without significant loss of content. As one who has spent the last twelve years in medical research (including gene therapy), I found the book to contain almost no science, nothing pertaining to the ethics of what is propossed, and to really have almost no content.

The impulse towards eugenics comes hand-in-hand with a culture obsessed with the material. Equally so, the impulse to protect one's child from cancer and heart disease will play a role. Regardless of the source of new genetic practices, the practices themselves will change our society.If you'd like to understand just what that society might look like, take a look at this excellent work."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Extremely Basic Overview","review":"This book claims to be a basic simple overview of Judaism and that is in fact what it is.

If it were not for the fact that neither Waite's version in his Book of Ceremonial Magic and Shah's version in Secret Lore of Magic were incomplete they are actually closer to the original the Mather's and Crowley's version is.The big problem with all the versions that have Mather's and or Crowley's name on them are that they are edited and not in original. The seals for example are changed from its original form and redone with 2 protective circles around them. This is not the case in the originals they used. The circle of the art is also changed and do not contain a snake with the names within it. They do not mention these changes so you can not actually trust anything in their translation.If you want a good translation of the Goetia and the Lemegeton buy Petersons edition or Skinner and Rankines version or Dr Rudds Goetia."},{"rating":"2","title":"An important reference for any serious Occult library","review":"\\"The Goetia, the Lesser Key of Solomen the King\\" is instrumental in the practice of High Magick.

Then you read, waiting for the big ah-ha -- which never comes.The information is this book is OK, but the author has too much filler. And she takes too long to get to the point. Lastly, the price is way to high. Almost any book on credit has a lower price, is shorter, and gets to the point.Save your money and your time, buy something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"From Credit Repair to Credit Millionaire","review":"This book opened many doors for me. I did not realize that company credit cards were not listed on your credit report. My credit score was 570 when I first read the book. My credit report was 16 pages. according to the credit report I had a judgement from a tax lien on a property I did not own. I had a new Ford Truck that I did not own. Loans on two Mobile Homes I have never seen. Compromised settlements on credit cards I did not have. I had been trying to get these cleared for two years. With guidance from the book I was able to get most of it cleared. I had over a million dollars in assets but I could get a Real estate loan. I am in the process of shifting all of my credit cards to business cards. Now that I have cleared my credit report I have a fico score of 711 and going up when I clear everthing. I have $100,000 of available credit on business credit cards.

The Book is about the life of Laura Bruce and her visits to the families of the eastern Tennessee mountains. While her husband is away as a minister for the army in the Gulf War, Laura counsels people of the town durring times of need. Many tragic things happen to the families and characters in this book, but they only bring you closer to them. My favorite characters are the Underhill children for thier strength and courage and Nora Bonesteel for her wisdom and kindness. I think this is a really good book and would recommend it because of the closeness you feel to the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A MYSTERY!!!!!!","review":"I really don't see how this can be called a mystery. It started off well enough but then went down hill the rest of the way. The book was fair but not what advertized to be. Please read the above statments by the publisher to see what book is about. If you want a book that will leave you sad, depressed and need a good cry, then this is the book for you. If you want a good mystery, then go somewhere else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Exquisite!","review":"This is one of my favorite books of all time. Sharyn McCrumb is so right in calling her series The Ballad Series, and this is the best that I've read...so far. It's half a step away from being a poem, with every word chosen so that it flows seamlessly into the next. When I finished this book, I was left in awe of the story, the characters, and the storyteller's perfection of her craft."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the mystery","review":"I read this book expecting a mystery and wound up with a slew of Tennessee backwoods tales. None of the characters were that interesting and all were the product of things happening previously in their life. While a fast read, there was no depth. The mystery part of the book could have been written in less than 100 pages. There is too much of clutter of words that do not help the plot or the book. I hope the other books she's written are better, though I don't plan to find out."},{"rating":"1","title":"A cookie cutter mystery novel","review":"This novel actually represents two books for me: the first Sharyn McCrumb novel I've ever read, and the last. As a lifelong resident of East Tennessee, I bought the book out of a newfound interest in regional fiction. But I was very disappointed to find that the author instead seems to have simply pasted local place names onto cookie-cutter \\"mountain situations.\\" Also, I'm not very familiar with the mystery genre, but it's probably not a good sign that I had figured out the latter half of the entire storyline when I was barely halfway through with the book. The book is probably fine for die-hard mystery fans, but don't stumble in looking for great regional literature or an artful rendering of local color. And disregard any comparisons between the work of McCrumb and that of Charles Frazier (author of Cold Mountain). They're simply not on the same level of expertise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be accurate in your condition","review":"\\"Very good\\" condition does NOT mean a broken spine and pages coming loose.I realize used books will have some wear and tear, but pages about to fall out doesn't come anywhere close to \\"very good\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"SHARYN McCRUMB, YOU'VE DONE IT AGAIN! THANK YOU!","review":"There is no doubt about it. Sharyn McCrumb is a highly gifted author and this book proves that yet again. She has an incredible sense of voice and feeling. In relating the issues of poverty and environmental concerns, her lyrical (for lack of a better word) descriptions of the settings ring strong and clear. In reading this work, as with her other \\"Ballad\\" books, one feels almost transported to the places she describes. Sharyn McCrumb does an exceptional job of intwining the social horrors of poverty and pollution with the gentle beauty of the mountains. It is her voice, as clear as a bell, as soothing as a bird song that makes this book so darn good.Her characters are all richly drawn and given fresh, literary life. Her sense of dialog is outstanding and there is nothing extraneous in her work. Sharyn McCrumb is here to stay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"Pick up a Sharon McCrumb novel and fall in love with the characters - that's what I did. I have read all of the ballad novels and won't miss one. I think I'm a bit in love with Spencer Arrowwood, and Nora Bonesteel is a lady after my own heart. I have read them all and loved them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eerily Compelling!","review":"This book is quite different from most mysteries in that the perpetrator of the crime is known right from the beginning. But what the book is about is about a family in trouble, and we watch the steady decline throughout the book. All of the major occurences (and believe me there are a lot of them) are connected with an old lady soothsayer's visions. There is plenty of suspense throughout the whole book, and it led me on and kept me engrossed until the catastrophic ending. Ms. McCrumb is a formidable author, and this book (the second in her Appalachian series) is complex, absorbing and quite magical."},{"rating":"2","title":"PHENOMENAL!","review":"This was the first book I read of the Ballad Mysteries by Sharyn McCrumb - I was a little out of order. I could not put it down the entire time I read it - even on vacation. I then quickly read the other four books. I read the first and fifth book last, which was, I think, appropriate since they were the weakest of the bunch. Those two did not hold on to the eery spirituality the other three did. However, I look forward to more Ballad mysteries. They are astoundingly wonderful! They remind me so much of both the ballads I listened to as a child and the family stories I've heard of my own backwoods ancestors. Great stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Black ash vinyl","review":"I built a pair of speakers that measured 20x46x15 using maple plywood.

If I never contacted him, I think I would have never gotten that CD.Secondly this is one of my favorite albums by Manson. Commemoration and The Way of the Wolf are the best albums in my opinion. The tracks are catchy and much better quality than his other prison recordings (Live at San Quentin).I totally reccomend this CD for those actually willing to look past the name Manson. I could elaborate on how I think Manson is innocent, but thats another story for another time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not meant to be J.D. Salinger","review":"I thought Clay's Way was an interesting read in that it represents an authentic voice we don't often hear in contemporary fiction - that of a new generation of young gay men (or boys in this case). Many of the reviews here are critical of the writing and comparisons to Catcher in the Rye, etc., etc. but I think that's really missing the point. I would have killed to get my hands on a book like this when I was in high school or college even.I liked that the book portrayed all the angst, horniness, insecurity, elation, etc. that comes with being a gay teen. In that sense, I could see it being an empowering read for young guys, a sort of \\"boi power\\" book that they can relate to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clay's Way...the definitive review...","review":"Dear blair mastbaum...Going through you're first novel was amazing. Reading \\"Clay's Way\\" made me feel excited and hypnotized; sad and jealous; tragic and lonely; drunk and real; scared and wondering; inspired and absolute.The obsessions, the mind trips, the emotions, the raw lust, the potentials, all that \\"Sam\\" feels and does, I, felt and (wish)I did as a teenager, all here in this intense and hot pot we all call home...O'ahu.thank you...keoni.ps; is that you on the top of the cover??!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't enjoy, but can appreciate","review":"This novel was very frustrating for me because I just could not connect with the main character, Sam. I found him attention starved and annoying. Although the author did an excellent job at portraying the character of Sam, I have a hard time getting engaged in a novel if I can't connect to the characters.Also, if you are looking for a happy, complete novel I would not recommend this one. It will leave you lost and dissatisfied."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clay's Way","review":"This was probably the most unenjoyable book I have ever read. Inasmuch as the premise of the story was good, it was not developed at all. I do not understand the purpose of decompensating a young person from drugs, alcohol and sex.I think it would have been much better to develop the characters in a rehabilitative state, getting together.Very poor writing. Would not recommend the book to anyone"},{"rating":"1","title":"not cool","review":"Sam, the narrator, is consumed with being \\"cool.\\" This indicates he clearly is not, and we have to assume the same about the author. A self-absorbed child who stalks his prey is about as interesting as a mashed potato sandwich. What crap! I didn't waste my time finishing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Higher expectations","review":"A book that I had very high expectations for turned out to be a dud. The story starts off as interesting and engaging, but by part two it takes an annoying and painful turn for the worse. The story present a view not of reality but of hyper reality, the things the characters say and do are things people tend to think but would hardly, if ever, say or do out loud. Further more as you watch Clay's continued lack of acceptance of himself continuously escalates to a point where you can't help but to be angry at him, and Sam's bright eyed insistence on a happy ending in-spite of all evidence to the contrary is equally aggravating. The fact that the book ends in the matter that it does certainly doesn't help matters. All in all it starts off strong, but if you stop reading at the end of part one, you'll really be doing yourself a favor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much Better Than It Needs To Be","review":"I expected \\"Clay's Way\\" to be a fun, slightly sexy read with a quick lesson learned in the end. It could have been that, and still be worth the money, but Blair Mastbaum gives far more than comedic teen angst with a Hawaiian background. The book is a wild ride through the interior life of a boy learning an adult's lessons, for which he at first appears to be painfully ill-equipped to handle. It is hilarious and heart wrenching, and a lot of readers will go through recognition shock. You will probably even love the heartbreaker, in the end. But, it's not for the faint hearted. I've read it twice, and now I just hope Mr. Mastbaum is busy writing more."},{"rating":"1","title":"READER ABUSE","review":"The characters were uniformly unlikeable and I didn't find any of them to be credible---either in what they said or did (which was one stupid thing after another). Even descriptions of the physical world many times rang false. For example, back to back sentences had low moans echoing off valley walls and scared birds slapping their wings together. The novel was a pointless stream of juvenile fantasy. Younger teens (the intended market?) deserve something much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"what a trip","review":"Sweet, funny, sexy, painful, swift, confusing and achingly honest, just like adolescence was/is ... a beautifully realized effort worthy of a sequel"},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing","review":"Very well-written, although sometimes the narrative seems too adult to be coming from a 16-year-old. The tale is very disturbing; the main character is often out of control. Still, the events, however stark, are within the realm of believability. A good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Must Have Read Another Book","review":"I really can't find anything worth recommending about this book at all. I mean, we start with a main character who's totally unlikeable, then pair him up with the even-more-unlikeable, titular Clay. And they progress, but if anything, they move backward, and not forward. I missed the descriptions of the dazzling backdrops of Oahu and Kauai that were mentioned on the back cover. And I really can't see how anyone could compare this to Catcher In The Rye, another novel about a self-absorbed, unlikeable teen, but at least that young man wised up and realized that he was in fact, self-absorbed and unlikeable.And I must confess my general distaste for fiction that doesn't end so much as stop. There are authors who make this work as a literary device, but I got a much stronger sense here that the author had just run out of things to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intense, chaotic, unresolved","review":"I had to stop reading several times because the narrator (Sam) causes too much chaos and drama around himself and his love interests. But then I remembered Sam's just a kid, thrashing skateboards and his punked-out body, and writing haiku to center his feelings. It's non-stop lust with little release. He believes he is 110% focused on what he wants (Clay) but then he can't close the deal. He's so out there it screws the pooch everytime. But he's fighting what's cool - Hawaii, surfing, laidback style. Maybe he whould move to Tasmania."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Novel of greatness","review":"I read Clay's Way a year or two ago and I just recently re read it with my boyfriend; this is one of the best books I've ever read. I lent it to a friend (straight) who loved it and passed it on to another friend and just like me in high school, it got around.I think this book has many ideals and realities that all likes of people can identify with. The obsession, the love, the awkwardness, the fimialrness, and the passion. This is a great book and I would reccomend this one to anyone who likes to read and grow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Took my breath away and made me cry","review":"This exquisite book took me by surprise. It also took me back in time, eyes filled with tears, to my 16th year when by turns I played the part of Clay and sometimes Sam in my own story of love and loss. No book of fiction Gay or otherwise has so accurately portrayed what actually goes on in the mind and with the body of a 16 year old boy. By turns funny and desperately sad, uplifting and bittersweet, Clay's Way left me lying awake on my bed remembering, not just with my mind, but with my whole being what it was like to be in love with another boy at 16.Clay's Way is also a welcome departure from the \\"Gay-Boy-moves-to Big-City-Confronts-Aids\\" formulaic pulp so often peddled as \\"Gay Literature\\" This book is well written, suspenseful and very satisfying I recommend it heartily to ANYONE who was ever in love at any age."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was not impressed","review":"When I first read a summary of this book, It sounded interesting. However, it didn't take long before I became frustrated with it. Part of that comes from thinking that the book would be more about the characters and less about the sexual acts they involve themselves in. Regardless of the amount of sexual tension which floods the pages however, my biggest complain was that the main character never evolves or grows throughout the story. He stays the same self centered character throughout and despite several places where it looks like he might learn something and grow up a bit, moments later such thoughts are dashed and he goes back to his neurotic self. Despite a half hearted attempt at the end to show some sort of change within him, I came away feeling like there was no progression and that despite all that he went through, he never learned anything from it."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the Point?","review":"The writing in this book is raw and honest. However, I have a hard time following the motivation behind Sam's action. He'll do something completely random or lie or just say something strange and doesn't say why he does it. There's no insight into it, despite the fact that you're inside his head while reading the story. I didn't think he was that easy to relate to, either. He was just a really crappy person. He never did anything nice for anyone, and by the end, his actions were pretty outrageous and unbelievable. The ending was disappointing. Also, there were many spelling mistakes, gramatical errors, and lots of missing punctuation. The formatting was messed up a lot, too. I thought that detracted from the readability of the book by a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smart and insightful","review":"A smart, witty and completely honest look at the inside of a boy's brain.

I don't even need other products like leave-in conditioners, shine serums, etc. After using the new stuff once I got out of the shower and my hair was a tangled mess, I combed it out and dried it but it felt a bit greasy and filmy. I thought maybe I hadn't rinsed it out thoroughly so I tossed it in a pony tail and called it a day. The next day I made sure to rinse my hair well and again it had a greasy film on it after blow drying. Not only is there a heavy film but it's not shiny, definitely not silky and I can't even run my fingers through it! I am so disappointed because I wanted to love it as much as I loved the old stuff.

And the girl goes home and tells her doll so she can remember.Until Miz Berlin doesn't show up, and doesn't finish her story. We're told that she broke her hip, and eventually she dies.

Literally every page of this book spoke to me where I said - yes, that's how I feel or yes, that's what I experienced from my trauma/abuse. It's an incredible book that is highly scientific but is written in layman terms so you can understand it. Dr. Scaer also covers treatment methods. I believe his theories will be talked about for many years to come that's how good this book is. Thank you Dr. Scaer for this book and your contributions to the field of trauma."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why didn't I read the reviews?","review":"I only have myself to blame for buying this book.I showed it to an Iranian friend and asked his opinion.

For example, today I was trying to look up \\"groceries\\" and all it has in it is \\"grocer\\". From that I can't tell how to say my original query and I'm left wondering if \\"grocer\\" refers to the place/store or the guy that works there. Flip through these pages and see how much white space there is. In comparison, my Mandarin-English dictionary is about the same sized book but jam packed containing idiomatic expressions and example usages. When I bought this I didn't have other options. All I could find were unidirectional dictionaries at the time so I got this one. In retrospect, I'd rather have half a good dictionary than a poor full one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont get the book","review":"This book is garbage, total oshkhal, dont get it if you wantto make sncse to any one"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK for a word list","review":"I would not recommend buying this as a dictionary; especially, not if it is to be a desk reference or a primary source. If you are looking for a handy word list (8400 entries split about evenly; I'd give it an extra star as a word list.) that will fit in your briefcase or book bag, then it is serviceable. I am 6 months into studying Farsi and have found a couple of errors, have been bothered by some of the usage and feel that getting the alphabet out of order (nan, he, vav, ye) is really bad form in a dictionary. I still use it because of the handy size and it was cheap, after all. Also, this - and the other review of disappointment - speak to why publishers should use Amazon's 'see inside this book' feature. I now need a good dictionary but I am reluctant to buy without at least knowing number of entries - if not style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this","review":"This is an abysmal work. There are many redundancies, and multiple entries of the same word. Also it appears that the author has often used Arabic words when the most common word used by Iranians would be a Farsi word. I have the impression that the author must be more comfortable in Arabic than he is in either Farsi or certainly English. The \\"Small Planet\\" Farsi phrasebook has a better dictionary by far in its 60-odd page dictionary section than this whole book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Poor","review":"This dictionary not only has horrible editing, it has instances of using the wrong words!

No, this is a poor dictionary in which to invest."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good starting point, but not the end","review":"This dictionary isn't perfect, but it's a good start. Its advantages are that it has each Persian word written in both a Roman transliteration as well as the original Arabic script, its layout is fairly straightforward, and according to a Persian friend of mine, the words included are fairly typical. He also said that it's well suited for what I needed it for, but stressed that it's for beginners. The only thing I could see as an improvement to this book is that it include a cue to the meaning of the translations for words with one-to-many translations. For example, the English word lie has two meanings (synonyms with recline and deceive), but if you look up lie in this book, you will get two entries, with no indication as to which one means which.If I had known what was in this book before I bought it, I would still have bought it. It was affordable and is worth its price, but it's not going to be my last dictionary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Concise to be Useful","review":"This book is never much use to me, because half the time, the word I want isn't in it, and when the word is present, you get no clues as to the particular usage. For example if you looked up the word \\"store\\" you wouldn't know which entry meant \\"shop..a noun\\" or which entry meant \\"to put something away.. a verb\\" both meanings would just appear side by side with no clues whatsoever. Its basically worthless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it.","review":"This dictionary is not valuable to the beginner of Persian/Farsi because it merely gives quick glosses rather than full definitions. Because of the scant glosses, the student will not be able to find correct or appropriate definitions for a large number of words listed in the dictionary. It also fails to give the learner enough grammatical information for it to be a useful dictionary.I have studied about 9 different languages over the past 10 years, and I've found that a good dictionary is the most essential tool for any language learner. Don't begin your study of Persian/Farsi with a tool that, in my opinon, is not worth the paper it's printed on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quite worthless","review":"I have never seen so useless a pocket dictionary. During my visit in Iran, I almost never fond any of the day-to-day words I was looking for, instead I got \\"perspiration\\", \\"indigenious\\", and \\"chahaarnal raftan\\".

Taken from Volume 8 of the Manga, this 3-part mystery involves a mysterious tour at a seaside hotel, where the mysterious Knight Baron appears and attempts to assassinate Conan - but before Conan can figure out which tour member tried to kill him, the Knight Baron himself turns up dead - and Conan must again prove that what seems like accidental death is actually a murder.One of the best mysteries of the series by far - don't miss this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Recycled Celtic New Age","review":"I love Celtic music and I am a fan of Clannad but this album does not do much for me.

Before you say, well, maybe you're just too old for the books now, I'd just like to say that I still read Frindle and the School Story and others, and they're still as good as when I first read them, if not better.There's almost no character interaction or character development. It's simply boring.The cultural references also threw me off, they're supposed to be timeless stories, not stories with iPods and Gameboys and wars in Iraq. They should be happening to anyone, anywhere.I just didn't like the tone. It's nothing like his old works.

The main advantage over other knives is the adjustable clip (a roller wheel can tighten the clip quickly for a different set of pants, rather than removing and bending the clip on other knives). If you are browsing for a knife on Amazon, your other option for a low-weight folder with a clip is the Gerber EZ-Out series. The Gerbers have a rough finish that makes even stainless steel develope rust spots within days, even in dry areas.There is a larger model Autoclip, but this one is just big enough for an average hand and quick everyday tasks. If you have larger hands or need the knife for extended use, I would get the larger Autoclip or the Magna-DOT (best handle for heavy work, but no clip)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seguridad Social, or the art orf repeating itself","review":"I listened to Seguridad Social during my last days of High School.

I am always skeptical of old material being re-released by an artist, however with REPRISE this is certainly not the case.

There also wasn't as much music in it as I would have thought. My daughter quickly lost interest. Also, I thought Paula Abdul just wasn't a good choice as hostess. Preschool dance teacher, she just isn't!!The best part of the whole video (in my toddler's opinion) was the cartoon where the animated birds were dancing either fast or slow, depending on the rhythm.

It is the smaller version of the one he has carried for years. It fits well in my small hands, has grips and grooves to give you a more secure grip when it gets slimey or wet. The tip is extremely sharp to make starting cuts easy and the serrations toward the hilt give that extra umpf when you need it. The clip is VERY secure and there is a screw to adjust the blade tension when opening or closing it. The ArcLock is awesome. It's easy to use one handed and feels solid while open and in use. No accidental closing here. It is also ambidextrous. You can move the clip to the other side for Left-handed use. I don't really have any complaints.

I have yet to perform harsh tasks or try to abuse it but the steel eats everything I throw at it. In comparison the Cold Steel Hold Out III started to dull after opening 15-20 envelopes where as the Pentagon Elite didn't start to loose its edge until 45 envelopes and breaking down three boxes. The edge only lost its super fine edge and it only took a few minutes on a leather strap to get it back.The steel used in this knife has me sold and I will never purchase a knife with anything less AUS8 is terrible compared to this."},{"rating":"2","title":"SOG's best Folder!","review":"Absolutely the best folder I have owned. I have used and collected knives for 30 years and the SOG Pentagon Elite I is my favorite. Multiple features combine to make this the top of the line. (1) The blade steel is tough and holds an edge even with hard use. (2) The half straight / half serration edge allows good normal slicing cuts and positive cutting for fibrous material such as rope. (3) The shape of the point is unique in that it is a short inverted \\"V\\" design.

So while the exploration and interpretation of Mark Tansey as an artist and such may be fun to know and learn about, it is completely useless without any sort of immediate visual reference in the book. And so this book is truly useless unless you go and catalogue/hunt down all of the pieces Taylor is refering to...and good luck there. If you are to buy or read this book, make sure you have other visual aids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Raving in my car","review":"Once this CD hit the Stereo, I had to fight with the CD player to get it out.

I read some of the reviews, and I thought this was going to be one of the defining books about Bruce Lee's art. It is not!The book started off in a fantastic way. It was no nonsense, and chock full of great information. The first few chapters were what a JKD book should be, then it took a huge nose dive!I was amazed and extremly disapointed to see that over HALF THE BOOK was nothing more then Sifu Davis going through a bunch of Trapping Progressions and Kick-boxing Movements. This has nothing to do with what would happen on the street.Sifu Davis could have done much better. This book is 'ok', but that's about it. It is nothing to get excited about and I would not waste my money on it.If you are very new to Jeet Kune Do, then I guess you would get something out of it, but if you are anything past an absolute beginner....move on to an another book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad I picked this up!","review":"Five stars without a doubt.

Check it out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Macho, macho man...","review":"Aweful book on a great subject. Has 100 pages of meathead Lamar punching and kicking some guy who isn't fighting very well. Gives very little info on technique and philosophy, and does not address groundfighting, which is where 90% of the fights i've had have ended up. The author seems to be self-righteous in his approach to Lee's art, and claims his methods are exactly the same as taught by Lee. If you want to explore Lee's art, get the books authored by Lee, some wing chun books, and maybe some books by Lee's personal students. This guy is just a beefy, angry person trying to make a buck, and capitalize on Lee's art. He should capitalize on his own art and stop giving Lee a bad name."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad book","review":"Please do you a favour and do not buy this book.

The first 80 pages or so stand up to the title and explain the scientific fundamentals of JKD. But then when you're hungry for advanced principles and concepts applicable to streetfighting you're left alone. The rest is simply a picture collection of fighting scenes you've seen in at least a hundred other books. If you're at a beginner's level this might be a nice book, but if your advanced (in any fighting art)and interested more in principles than techniques look for a better one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for beginers or advanced practicioners","review":"Very informative book on the street application of Bruce Lee's Jeet Kune Do.

Keith always delivers a great performance but this is even better. Now there's Neil who is the newest member of the singing group but has been their guitarist for all the shows and he's a great addition to the vocal group.The band members always deliver the greatest background and each one has their won personality. All in all the show is just fantastic and you can't listen or watch without listening and watching the show over and over. One last hing, This is Paul's last DVD and CD with the group so you may want grab your copy to save .

Together they mesh well and sound good and put on a great show. Their programs are always fun to watch, and all the performers seem to be having a great time entertaining their audience. I was sorry to hear that Paul Byrom has left the group, but I'm sure they'll go on successfully without him. Their music is eclectic, with something for everyone. It's fun to listen to them and watch them perform. I have to laugh at some of the choreography and little skits they perform! Just plain fun, and good music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent DVD","review":"This is the fifth DVD that Celtic Thunder has released.

The show has a very entertaining atmosphere, not over produced and very sincere, and they seem to really be enjoying themselves. If you like celtic music give these guys a try, everyone I've lent it to really enjoyed it. The only negative is that the the audio quality isn't very good (on a high end home theater, not noticeable when watching through 50\\" plasma tv). The video isn't great but not bad.

I like how they moved around the stage so that the entire audience got a great show. I am Irish so I absolutely love the songs and I think that the songs are true to the Irish heritage but I also think it is for anyone who enjoys GREAT music.

It has a very poor connection between the hot water unit and the dispenser. The nylon nut that secures the 1/4 copper tube to the hot water unit does not work. Or should I say it does not work when you are lying on your back under a sink with limited mobility! I called 1-800-558-5700 and asked them what to do and they said to keep tightening it until it stops leaking. The directions however say tighten it finger tight and then turn it with a wrench no more than 3 turns or it may crack the unit. And by the looks of the water jacket it will crack.This is a new design the older models sealed this connection. I guess in the efforts to save 12 cents on a brass fitting quality has gone out the window."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good thing for warranties!","review":"I own this unit. In fact I've owned about 4 of these units. Unfortunatly they've all been on the same sink in about a 2 year period. When they work, they work great. No waiting for water to heat up on the stove for instant coffee, cocoa, tea, oatmeal etc. The first two units just stopped heating after about 3 or 4 months. The third unit was just very noisy. The 4th is still workinig great after 2 whole months. Luckily they failed within the warranty period so they were replaced. I'm not sure if the problem is from being on well water or not. My water is filtered but not softened because it's not that hard. Instant hot water is nice to have, I'm just not sure this is the right brand to buy.

It worked fine while I had it. But the last few months, it was spitting out water inbetween uses. Apparently this is a sign that the tank is overheating. Today I noticed water under the sink, and the tank is leaking around the edges as well as along the power cord!

I spent some time searching for complaints and found quite a few customers having leak problems. I will be calling insinkerator tomorrow to complain, but I am beyond the warrantee period and don't expect much sympathy from Insinkerator based on what I have read from others experiences with Insinkerator customer service.

You guessed it. My $280 unit was leaking water. I stopped the water line and remove the units in the hope of a possible repair. Guess what, the unit is sandwiched between layers of foam. Any attempts to remove it will break the foam and there goes your heat retaining capability. I guess repair is out of the question and I must replace the unit. I will NOT buy another Insinkerator Instahot unit. I am sorry I pick the most expensive unit to be faced with this.

And the only disposal I've ever owned that wasn't still doing at least a passable job of grinding up food after 10 years. In reading online reviews from various sources, 2-4 years is about typical for the Badger now. It's cheap, but which really costs more in the long run--a $70 disposal every 2-5 years, or $100 disposal every 8-10 years?I didn't get that one from Amazon...but I did buy a KitchenAid from Amazon this morning that's only a little more money and gets much higher reviews.

Then while searching for the source of water under the sink and odd bits of crust on the disposer, I discovered several cracks in the grind chamber housing. When I filled the sink with water and cranked up the disposer, it became something very like a feature at a kids' waterpark -- but much less fun.ISE responded to my complaint with an offer of a discount on a new Badger but would not provide any assurance that its design or manufacture had been changed to address this apparently common problem. I'm used to disposers lasting for decades, not months, and don't enjoy spending time off under my kitchen sink, so I'm going to try a Waste King this time around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Cracked Housing","review":"Here's another one for the list of cracked housings on the Badger 5 model.

The replacement model for the Badger 5 is the Badger 5 XP if anyone is interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor for grinding food.","review":"Installation is straight forward and the quality of the materials is very good. The problem is their idea of impellers or blades. There are just 2 moving parts that grind things up and they more or less bash the food into smaller pieces. If you put anything small such as the ends of a carrot or an apple core, the initial bashing works, but very shortly the remains of the food spin to the outer edged beyond the reach of the impellers and it just stays there. Turning the unit on and off and on and off 5-6 times will eventually work but this is not even close to the quality of grinding I saw on much older models. They could have solved this problem with the simple addition of another impeller (cost about 78 cents) but as it is you will be cleaning out bits of food a lot.UPDATE: They seem to have cut the warranty in half since mine was purchased just a few months ago. Not a good sign."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clogs all the time with Potato or Carrot peels","review":"Stay away from this brand.

That takes time and effort. So I just attach the new badger in the old slot.My other experience is they run very well until the warranty ends. It doesn't fine chop the particles going into the disposer and the pipe gets clogged up, and the sink gets stopped up!I gave it a two star because again I keep having to replace the unit just after the warranty expires.

The installation was easy swap out, but the quality is not the same. This unit just jams, and we free it up with the wrench. It does this every day. Just jams with no visible objects inside that would cause this. We have septic, and use a disposer very lightly for food particles. No bones, sand or heavy duty uses.

It was easy enough to clear and reset (with a 1/4\\" Allen wrench or hex key), until one morning, it just stopped.

Apparently the design is to create interior rust-prone spots all around the top part of the unit. These spots eventually rust out and create a split all around, and if you wait long enough the whole unit would fall off. Meanwhile the rusted-out holes would leak water everywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Cracked Badger 5","review":"I installed this Badger 5 Disposer in a rental condo about 5 years ago. I now had to replace it because it developed a 4\\" vertical crack in the upper enclosure (housing). The enclosures used to be made of metal (and eventually rust through), but I now discovered that they are made of cheap plastic. This one was manufactured in Oct. 2006. The value of my time - making 2 trips - was worth more than the cost of the disposer. A leak like this can also cause substantial damage to to the kitchen cabinet and floor. It is sad that the company cannot engineer a better product. From reading the reviews, it is obvious that this is a design defect, not the result of improper use. The other brand I use is Waste King, and I have not had any such problems with their disposers."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK","review":"Basic product lasting very long.

It physically matched exactly the size dimensions of the old one and all plumbing parts matched up perfectly with no problems. It was rather easy to install and works perfectly in our sink.

The display looked like an old film with vertical lines and no color.The inability to share phone books also was a BIG drawback. I think I would have tolerated that, if the display did not fail. For the price, I expect quality and features. Not getting quality, is unacceptable at this price range. I learned that AT&T; really don't make these phones, VTech does.The Handset on this and the base unit E5965C do not fit the face well.Consumer Reports rated these phones high, but after using them for a week, I was really disappointed and returned the set for a refund.I am now considering the Panasonic KX-TG5776S."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst phone I have purchased","review":"Purchased this phone in August, base and one extra phone. It is now November 16th and I have calls cut out with no notice repeatedly. Calls to customer service are not helpful. I was once even told to make sure the cord from wall to phone was straight or that would cause the cordless to cut out and the customer service goes down from there.

Apparently the batteries were faulty. I did read this in other reviews as a problem, but wrongly I assumed it was just a fluke. AT&T seems to have a quality control problem. I sent them back and purchased a Motorola product which has worked wonderfully from the start. I do not recommend the AT& T handsets nor the base phone that goes with it. The base phone I ordered had a different model number on the phone itself than was on the outside box. The inside model number was not the one I ordered. Again, quality control problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"AT&T 580-2 Handsets SUCK","review":"I have three of these in my house - all bought in September of 2006. One of these was replaced within the first year and the replacement doesn't work at all now. I swapped out batteries from a phone that does work so I know that it is not a problem with the batteries. Another phone now has so much static when in use that it is untolerable to listen or talk using that phone. The third phone works great for a minute or two and then it just goes dead. Initially I was very positive about these phones, but now I have nothing but a bunch of crappy phones that cost me several hundred of dollars. It's ironic that they all seemed to have problems shortly after the one-year manufacturer's warranty expired. If you risk buying any of these handsets, the extended warranty might actually make sense since the product has such poor quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"I must be missing something ...","review":"While the storyline is commendable, the story itself is boring and tedious.

I thought the graphics were good, the gameplay was good, and well, I couldn't really find many problems with the game.

I don't know who chose the songs, but you are better of with any one of his A&M releases than this soulless and disjointed production.

The last song by Creed is cool, too. I could stand those tracks. 'Spiders' by System Of A Down was so annoying that it drove me crazy! The rest of the tracks did not cut it for me.

As for the other bands on here, they all sound like some record producer put a microphone in the bathroom stall of some record exec and recorded it for a movie and out came this album. The dude on the cover is hiding his face not because he kills people but because he doesn't want to be seen on a piece of poop. Creed bites, Godsmack stinks, Staind bores , Powerbutt 5000 used to be OK, and Sevendust, well, they just don't know any better. Good thing I only listened to someone elses because I wouldn't spend 15 bucks on this doo-doo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great soundtrack, but one problem","review":"I thought that this CD was great except for one thing. Why the hell did they put such a weak version of Slipknot's \\"Wait and Bleed\\" on this album. It almost is totally different. People who like Slipknot will really be disapointed after finding out that such a tone-downed, weak version of \\"Wait and Bleed\\" is on here. As for the rest of the album. BRAVO!"},{"rating":"2","title":"number 16","review":"I listened to this album and I especially like \\"Crawl\\" performed by Staind just as much as \\"So Real\\" by Static-X. Usually, songs by Static-X are much more lively when they start out. \\"So Real\\" starts out quiet and gets a little louder. Although I've never heard of Staind, it's an alright song. Also, most of the other songs are good...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something short of the previous two soundtracks","review":"Although the Scream 3 soundtrack included a few good songs, many of them seemed irrelevant to the movie.

It was quite different from the other two."},{"rating":"1","title":"This tripe doesn't deserve even one star.","review":"A friend of mine loaned me this cd because he'd noticed I have the first one. He assured me that it was 'even doper than the original'. The hideous slang should have been my first warning.This is a compilation of the boring, faux-angst garbage that today's teenagers seem obsessed with. Insipid nu-metal garbage packaged and re-packaged by bands that sound exactly the same. A thriller movie's soundtrack should not inspire retching. It does, in fact, manage to be even worse than the second soundtrack, a feat that in 1997 I thought impossible.I would recommend the original Scream soundtrack. It contains wonderful songs by Julee Cruise, Moby (yes, even Moby has a few good songs), Marco Beltrami, and the classic 'Red Right Hand' by Nick Cave And The Bad Seeds. Or for some music with a REAL edge, check out Nick Cave's earlier work in The Birthday Party. Leave this banal offering for the bargain bins and children."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORSE THAN 1 STAR","review":"it is worse than no stars. it is a 17 car pile up consisting of americas most uninspiring bands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best soundtrack ever!","review":"This awesome nu metal sountrack is probably the best soundtrack of all time.I am very satisfied with it,and you will be too if you buy it.Just about every song is good,and you will probably listein to this album thousands(or even millions)of times like I have.My personal favorite songs on this soundtrack?I can't decide!Too many of them are awesome.Don't overlook this soundtrack because its a must own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Third Time's The Charm","review":"I rate a lot of CD's high I know. But SCREAM 3 deserves it. First and foremost, \\"Suffocate\\" by Finger Eleven. That sells the CD right there, amazing hard rock song. Incubus \\"Crowded Elevator\\", Sevendust \\"Fall\\", Creed \\"Is This The End\\" and \\"What If\\", System \\"Spiders\\", Fuel \\"Sunburn\\", Orgy \\"Dissention\\" (one of the original reasons I bought the album), Staind \\"Crawl\\", all essential tracks that just plain already make this a great rock album. That's not the only good stuff on here. American Pearl \\"Automatic\\" is a surprisingly good song, Slipknot \\"Wait And Bleed\\", even Static X \\"So Real\\" isn't that bad. Dope \\"Debonaire\\" is on the edge, but still leans toward being a pretty good song. \\"Tyler's Song\\" by Coal Chamber's not bad, although I am not a CC fan. The rest is eh, but that's not many \\"eh\\" songs. Good stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unless you were into college radio, you probably missed this one altogether.... in that case, your loss.","review":"Scott Stapp's Wind-Up label got full rights to show off its talent on this album and easily created the best movie soundtrack since The Crow (the original one with Brandon Lee). What you have are rarities by veteran alt-rockers Sevendust, Incubus, and Staind, combined with energetic introductions to newcomers Full Devil Jacket, Dope and Orgy. While two Creed songs seem a little much, \\"Is This the End\\" is Creed at its most melodic, with Tremonti showing off his crisp note-picking style. \\"Click Click\\" by Ear2000 is a goof-off piece but somehow catchy once you get past David Arquette's attempt to scream like a rap-metaller (and leaves you wondering about shampoo... I mean, shaaaaaammmmmpooooooooo). I was fortunate enough to be a college DJ on KTRM (in the booming metropolis of Kirksville, Mo) when this hit our playlists, and man it was fun to send out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW","review":"That's all I can really say. I mean if you love rock then this cd has it all I mean it's a big variety of Bands. Creed has to be one of the best bands to come up in the 90's and now into 2000. They are gonna keep going. Two thumbs up on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"When I heard who all was on the soundtrack for Scream 3 I flipped, I thought it would be so awesome. Man was I wrong, this is by far the most disappointing soundtrack ever made. First off I am no fan of Creed so I wasn't in a hurry to hear their two songs, second I'm no fan of Slipknot, but they tuned down Corey's vocals on \\"Wait and Bleed\\" making him sound like a wimp. And they edited Godsmack's \\"Time Bomb\\" which would have been the best song on the soundtrack (thanks Creed, in case you didn't know they were the executive producers), and that song by Ear2000 absolutely sucks (David Arquette from the Scream movies lends his vocals, and even thats edited too). The only good songs are by System of a Down and Full Devil Jacket, and they're on their albums, everything else just sounds like filler to me (the PM5K track is the most disappointing to me). If your a hard rock/metal fan, avoid this, it's a waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scream3 sndtrk","review":"I'd have to say that this was better than Scream2, but sorta ties w/ Scream1. It is definitely worth buying just for the new Creed song (\\"Is This The End?\\") and Ear2000's new song (which for some reason isn't included on this track listing). One problem: Where the hell is Nick Cave's newest remix of \\"Red Right Hand\\"? It is a Scream standard."},{"rating":"2","title":"ITS A SCREAM BABY!","review":"I am in love with all the \\"scream\\"films and I own both of them.The soundtracks for them are always filled with heavy matal and it's fun to listen to.The freshyoung stars of the Scream films,such as Neve Campbell and Sarah Michelle Gellar (from Buffy the vampire Slayer)are new to the scene and with that comes new fresh music.definitly buy this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SIMPLEY GREAT","review":"I knew going into it that this cd was good because one of my friends has it but i had noidea this cd was so good it s like a sampler for great rock and thats all its is ,is rock its well worth what ever you pay for it. The fact that it is over an hour and 10 minutes long is good but also 16 out of 18 songs are great and the finger eleven song\\"suffocate\\" is awsome, and incubus ,creed and staind are awsome you have to go out and buy this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Introduced me to alot of new bands","review":"This soundtrack really set the poace for the music I love today.

For the last three months or so, the HOT-1 had been acting up (held the handle down for 20-30 seconds before any water would come out). Over the Christmas holidays, I noticed water under the sink and traced it the HOT-1. I am not sure how long these should last, but for the price, I would expect them to last longer than three years.

Our plumber confirmed this and said to call him when we obtained a replacement part. HOWEVER... Insinkerator does not offer parts for this model. You have to buy the entire model again. Purchasing a new unit when all that's needed is a $25 tank (guesstimate on my part) is, in my personal opinion, equivalent to holding me (the consumer) hostage.

Also it was noisy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy!","review":"Bought about 2.5 years ago. Factory setting about 140 degrees, way too cold for tea, so must be turned up to maximum. At higher temp the tank slowly fills with vapor. If the unit is not used hourly, the tank will first need to be vented, then allow 10-15 mins to reheat, to be able to dispense about 8 ounces of very hot water. This is quickly followed by cooler water. Not exactly instant and not very practical for two or more simultaneous servings. Perhaps due to higher setting, tank corroded and ruptured in less than 2 years. No warranty service. We're using the Waste King offering. It also had to be adjusted up from a cold factory setting, but it does provide instant delivery of 12-16 oz of very hot water."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot1 is a winner","review":"I am ordering a new Hot1 to replace the one I have been using daily (usually about 10 uses per day) since we installed it 9 years ago. I have to laugh when people complain that the plastic handle breaks. Mine did after five years, and Insinkerator just mailed me a new one which just snaps on. About a two second repair, and some people on here act like its the end of the world. Hey people, it's a hundred dollars cheaper than everyone else's. Not fair to expect they build it to be a Cadillac and still want the Chevy price. Do you want your little instant hot water heater to last forever? Sorry, nothing lasts forever.

They hiss, sputter and leak (and the drips from the extremely hot water will do wonders for a composite sink!) We have also had the plastic handles break, as well as the buildup of corrosion that others have reported. While these last, they are okay, and the compact design is convenient; however, do NOT expect them to last.

The first mistake was understandable, as I didn't know this is the \\"disposable\\" model offered by Insinkerator. The second mistake ... well, I should have known better, but I thought that I'd have to replace it with the identical model. You don't, as the hole in the countertop is standard for many hot water dispensers. But the third one? That was only because number two died while I was in the process of selling the house. So, I was not about to replace it with a high-end model at higher price ... the buyers were not nice people.But don't make my mistake. Avoid this, pay twice or three times as much for a different manufacturer's product, and save yourself grief and the plumber's labor costs, because you'll be replacing this piece of garbage in a few years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk won't last","review":"I have had two of these and both were junk.

For that kind of money it's a rip-off considering the few parts required, and the poor, flimsy quality with inappropriate choice of materials. (All seals of the hot water path should be silicone - they're NOT, they fail first.) They last (in my case) about 3-4 years (tops) but we're not heavy users. (Compare to that a Pfister kitchen sink faucet's quality for $150 or thereabouts; in that comparison InSinkErator HOT-1 is pure JUNK).I wish there was a rip-off copy from China, for half the price; InSinkErator people deserve to be copied and bankrupted.

This company appears to make decent upper-end products, but this is trash and should never have been put on the market.

Stricly XP, that is. Adobe doesn't support your Win2K anymore, whatever SP you have, period. Knowing that only about 30% of the Windows market was XP at last count, that looks to me like a dispising move to the rest of us. My dual CPU, 1 Go machine would be largely good enough to support PE 4.0, but Adobe decided not to let me do it. Reading from the other reviews, it looks like I souldn't have too much to regret, though. I'm going to look for an \\"old\\" (or used) PE 3.0 instead, and I'll stick there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Important Omission","review":"Elemets 4.0 has eliminated the very useful \\"File Browser\\" function from its \\"Edit\\" program. It forces the user to use its \\"Organizer\\" to gain access to folders containing collections of individual photo files. If the user doesn't like \\"Organizer\\", it becomes somewhat difficult access folders in the Edit program. In this respect 4.0 is a giant step backward from 3.0. The latter gave users the option of using \\"File Browser\\" in the Edit program to find and access files -- if the user doesn't wish to use the \\"Browser\\" program. For me this is reason enough to resist 4.0 and stick with 3.0."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adobe Elements 4.0","review":"JUNK!

Laura"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor -- don't bother","review":"I am in agreement with others here who indicate that 4.0 is a downgrade from 3.0. Performance is very poor, especially the organizer. It's depressing to see how fast alternative programs are, such as Mac iPhoto and even the Canon software that came with my camera, compared to Elements. Recently, I've been getting lots of crashes, though everything else on my system is completely stable. The only reason I gave it more than 1 star is it does have some nice functionality, when it works correctly."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment","review":"I recently purchases Elements 3.0 and I used it very often. I read the upgrade benefits in Elements 4.0 on the Adobe website and went for the upgrade. Very disappointing.

I have 2 and 3 and I've been very happy that I have them. But this time I think Adobe wants to just make more money. The only new tool that seems to work is the skintone tool. I wanted it for the new extraction tool, but I found out it's no better than using the magic wand or lasso tool. It is also very sluggish compared to Elements 3! I won't pick on everything, It is just VERY, VERY, DISAPPOINTING. BOOOOOOOOO TO ADOBE. SHAME ON YOU!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Adobe Photoshop Elements 4.0 - Is it Better than its Predecessors?","review":"I have owned and used Adobe Photoshop Elements in its original issue, and Adobe Photoshop Album in its original issue, the two programs which are melded together for the current Elements 4.0.Is 4.0 better, and worth its price? Only marginally. The new version is considerably more complex, with little improvement in actual photo editing capabilities. About the only improvement is the linking of the two programs, Elements and Album, although that could be done manually with the earlier versions. Although I am running Windows XP Pro, with plenty of memory and storage, the 4.0 seems sluggish, and slow to respond.The photo editing aspect is, to me, not as satisfying as that with my original version of Elements. Compared to Google's Picasa, 2nd edition, however, Elements really is over-priced.Picasa is free, while Elements costs approximately $90!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the File Browser","review":"New selection and extraction tools are nice, but my copy of this release (4.0) will go in the trash. Without the File Browser window, I will continue to use Elements 3.0. Or maybe give Paint Shop Pro 10 a shot, especially if this is how Adobe treats loyal customers.

I see features in the Album that Picasa does not have. I really like the side by side photo comparison. I also like the way Adobe allows you to scroll around on a picture if zoomed in. It's zoom feature allows you to pan similar to a CAD package and being a CAD Guru, I like that alot. I would only like Adobe to add dual screen support. That would be extremely nice. Also, compared to Elements 3.0, this one is quite a bit slower. I would wait for this product to come down around the 30 dollar mark before a purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elements 4.0 a step backward","review":"I just 'upgraded' from Elements 3.0 to 4.0. For some reason, Adobe removed the File Browser feature from the Editor screen. Apparently they wanted to force users to use the Organizer feature. But the Organizer is painfully slow to both load and equally slow to transfer selected pictures to the Editor screen.I'd like to find out what nimrod at Adobe decided that this was an improvement. Don't waste your time and money with 4.0, maybe Adobe will fix the problem in a future release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are they joking","review":"I have been using version 2.0 and loved it - downloaded a trail of 4.0 and was disappointed in the quality of the product.

It worked wonderfully on my 5 year old system but it was a little on the slow side. I decided to buy a new computer. An incredibly fast AMD X2 processor with 2 GB of RAM and a great nVidia 3d graphics card. I loaded PSE4 and it would crash on me. In the Adobe user forums an Adobe representative confirmed that the problem was the AMD X2 processor. Now I'm waiting for a patch or a new version to fix the errors. I REALLY like this program when it works correctly.I would not hesitate to recommend this program to anyone who wants to catalog and edit pictures but does not want to step up to Photoshop CS2.

I had to uninstall other programs *and* uninstall Elements 4. When I put my old Elements 3 on the computer, everything worked again (once I reinstalled it, bah!).Adobe has the most inaccessible customer service on earth, even when you're trying to provide a bug report. It amazes me that they don't go out of business, with such lousy customer service. You won't get any free help with this product, no matter what the problem. If you buy this, you'd better prepare to buy several books just to figure out the changes. Better yet, pick up Elements 2 or 3 and skip this entirely.It makes no sense why Adobe keeps changing the Elements interface. I thought nothing could be more annoying than the Elements 3 interface, but Adobe has outdone itself. I've bought every upgrade since Elements 1, and this is the last one for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good except if you have relocated pictures","review":"I upgraded from Photoshop album 2 and elements 2 . Everything works fine in the program. My only complaint is the process it uses to find pictures that are not in the location that its catalog says they are. There is no way to tell the program not to look in certain directories, and it does not remember the last directory it found pictures in. If you make the mistake of manually moving some picture files, it can take a long time for the program to reconnect these files."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly conprehensive, but little instruction.","review":"Kit Summers' book is perhaps the most comprehensive juggling book out there. However, while it contains photos and brief explanations of tricks, it lacks detailed, step-by-step instruction. A beginner or accomplished juggler can read about what can be attained with practice, but how to get there, he must leave up to his own devices. I am a seven ball, five club juggler and use the book as a wonderful reference tool; however, for instuction and guidence, books such as Charles Dancey's Encylopedia of Ball Juggling, Dick Franco's Three Ball Digest or Martin Probert's Four Ball Juggling as essential."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste","review":"Don't be fooled, this book is not rational, mystic, nor will it do anything to enlighten the reader.

The personal love that discriminates between one's loved ones and others is self-centered and quite different from the liberating loving-kindness that has no boundary. It is this kind of universal love that Jesus and Buddha taught.Despite his self-professed scientific background, Mr. Horgan's book betrays his limited and incorrect understanding of the spiritual paths, science methods, and the differences between the two."},{"rating":"1","title":"A book to titillate skeptics who pretend to openmindedness","review":"In his first chapter Mr. Horgan writes, apparently sincerely, of \\"the perilous waters of mysticism.\\" This is the first certain indication that the author literally does not know what he is talking about. If you are about to read this book in the belief that you will learn something about mysticism, be advised that you are mistaken."},{"rating":"2","title":"Science versus Buddha","review":"I found this book intriguing and well worth reading, especially if you're inclined toward the rational rather than the mystical. It does, however, seem like somewhat of a flawed idea to approach spiritual ideas with a scientific lens. Nonetheless, science does have at least something to contribute to evaluating the spiritual, but it is up to the discerning reader to say what and how much. A very interesting read. Avery Z. Conner, author of \\"Fevers of the Mind\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"A relative disappointment","review":"My impetus for reading this book largely came largely from my fondness for the author's superior The End of Science. The title of this book is a bit odd, since it doesn't make any particular case for the rationality of mysticism. The book is an easy read, but some of the gurus it discusses are not even interesting in their oddness. The author seems as fascinated by psychedelics as he does by spirituality, and the reader will likely come away having learned as much about the former as the latter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential tension between faith and reason","review":"This is an important and compulsively readable book. I was challenged and exhilirated. This book spoke to me because I long ago left organized religion, but periodically return out of a sense of longing, then leave again in exasperation. This book showed me how I need to change the lens. Through all the explanations of mysticism and science, the recurring theme is that all beyond this life is mystery and always will be. We have to focus on the life we have.While reading this book, I laughed, cried, argued with the author and was constantly challenged. Read this book, I promise it will make you think and will challenge your assumptions whether you are a person of faith or a rationalist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't use for applique","review":"The one good thing about this shirt is that it is very soft.

The double laminate does a terrible job at sealing around even the flattest of paper and if you cut anywhere close to the edge-it WILL come apart so expect a few centimeters of dead space around your final project. It absolutely does not work if you use any types of layers- it will bubble and warp and not have a smooth lamination.

I've done that with a Leatherman Micra and while the injury was minor, it still took several stitches to close the wound and a better design would have prevented the accident. The pliers on the SOG really work and have proven quite durable. With the exception of the tweezers, every tool on this miniature \\"all-in-one\\" is excellent. The tweezers could certainly be better, but they do work and are no worse than those found on other multi-tools (Leatherman, etc.).

As a Cuban American my greatest interest was chapter 20 on Fidel Castro and the Caribbean Crisis. From Khrushchev writings it is obvious that he is a devout communist and this strong bias obviously comes thru in his writings (e.g. when describing initial contacts with Cuba thru Raul and Che and when poorly apologizing for anti-Castro dissent), however there are a few moments of interesting and candid honesty throughout the book, such as his assessment acknowledging that Stalin's collectivization efforts halving the agricultural production of the Soviet Union and when recollecting that the idea to install missiles in Cuba was his, not Castro's. For those hungry to get to know about Khrushchev's life, surviving Stalin's rule, World War II and his side of the story during the Cold War, this is your book."},{"rating":"1","title":"pain to use with newer computers","review":"I thought I could just copy the existing hard drive onto a 250GB drive and use it that way, turns out, this is not compatible with anything newer then windows 98.

The side-by-side wire running up to form the hanging-hook helps keep the rack from tipping if the weight is not completely even. Works well for any sort of tie as well as belts (I keep those in the middle four hooks, because they are much heavier).The only downside I would consider, however negligible it may be, is that the stainless surface is much slicker than wood racks and this can cause ties to slide off if they're not hung so that the weight is even."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"I love this.

The picture made it seem the product was much bigger than it truly is--it is not big at all. The belts also did not stay on the hooks. Don't even think about using wide belts on the rack--they do not even stay put for a minute. I thought using smaller belts would be better, but they were still falling off the rack. I was very disappointed with my purchase. I really do not understand its purpose if the belts do no stay put. The manufacturer needs to go back to the drawing board on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nifty belt and tie organizer","review":"This is a great little belt and tie organizer. The belt hooks are little too close together and so some of my larger buckles are overlapping each other, so that is a little annoying. Other than that it's a great product and I am satisfied with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Design","review":"The picture describes the unit well. It's a well built device and is quite solid in nature. It is exactly as described; my only concerns:- For hanging ties, specifically wider ties, the angle for the ties and the fact that it is purely metal (no sponge for \\"grip\\"), the ties seem to compress a bit which over time may lead to wrinkles.- Some belts, those with a smaller clasp or hook, don't fit on the hooks. If you have belts just like the ones pictures with wide open buckles it is fine but otherwise you'll likely end up draping your belts over the whole thing.These are minor nits that are \\"functioning as intended\\" ... something to consider when looking at this versus other types of tie racks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice organizer for belts and ties","review":"I've had my eye on a couple of different kinds of belt/tie closet organizers for a little while, but I finally chose this one. And I'm very happy with my choice!I read a review about this product stating that the picture was misleading and that the top hook did not face the same way as the length of the hooks for the belts and ties. **That review is wrong** They do face the same way, making it a space saver in the closet as well.One of the reasons that I bought this particular organizer is because our closet just has a metal rod to put hangers on, it's not a fancy closet with a bunch of different shelves. So an organizer that hooks into shelves and bolts to the wall like some organizers I have seen would not help me at all.And my husband is in the military, so we may move at least a couple of times in the future. So I'm also glad I got this one because of it's versatility from closet to closet.Overall I am very happy with my purchase!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Being at home with Claude","review":"I have ordered this film and it was written French original version with english subtitles on the description and on the case.

Not for the faint of heart or for those who are turned off by gays. But it is a wonderful story, well-acted (Dupuis turns in a magnificent performance) and filled with suspense that is relieved only at the end -- it keeps your attention riveted. It certainly made me wish my French were good enough to follow the dialogue, which is swift and complex. The subtitles follow reasonably well, so you do get the gist of the experience. Well worth the price, as it is the sort of movie one watches more than once, finding new elements of meaning each time it is viewed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-see for those who really know something about pain","review":"This is the movie that once you see it, you will never forget. It will change the way you look at life forever. I wathsed it three times the first day I rent it. The film wan't very comfortable to watch because of subject matters, but the story was so compelling that I still remember how I felt that day even now. Maybe it was just like the story itself, the character spoke out the deep desperation I had in real live, something we usually have to hide beneath ourselves otherwise we cann't hang on to our lives. It is a beautiful movie, in many ways. I cann't imagine what the actors must go through to portait the charactors that provocative but so deep at the same time. The is the best performance of Roy Dupuis I'd ever seen. And one story I'll never forget in my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"It will push your boundaries - which is an added plus!","review":"The film is in French-Canadian patois, so you'll have to be willing to deal with subtitles. Do so please. It's a terribly European film in style (no bad thing). It relies primarily on dialogue and even more on extended monologue, not action, to tell its story. The story might seem sordid - but is it? Its glory is that it lays bare the yearning at the core of human existence. Its tragedy is that the two people most concerned don't believe, having found in each other a solace for that yearning, that their solace has a hope in the world they live in. The film itself makes very little comment on its content, nor will it provide you any ready-made moral \\"answers\\". It won't do a bit of your thinking for you. But watch it - and reflect. It may stretch your heart - and God knows, the world needs that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Performer","review":"Though fairly easy for a diy installer, this disposal won't grind lemons, chicken bones, or many other food items.

However, I wasn't impressed by the orchestration of these pieces on this CD. Only a string orchestra and some percussion are used, which, rather than give the pieces a fuller sound, make them sound thin. There were moments that begged for some woodwinds or brass to jump in, and without them the pieces lacked the amount of emotional impact that they could have had. Furthermore, the lack of contrast in timbre between the virtuoso and the string orchestra sometimes made the pieces feel dull. I'm hoping that someone out there will take these great pieces and orchestrate them for a full orchestra."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRAVO !!

At least that's what Brander thought when he laid this tale to paper. This is the type of work you would expect from a college student.

I would have been cooler if it came with attached cords or cables to lock it into place in my hatchback."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great trunk organizer!","review":"We keep all of our miscellaneous car accessories in here as well as some emergency items. Tons of pockets around the outside make it easy to grab what you need. We keep sunscreen, bug spray, and paper towels in some of the outer pockets. I wish that the 4 outer panels were a little more stiff as the organizer kind of collapses in on itself without much in it, but it's still a great bin. The handles on the ends make it easy to pick up to take it out of the car. I noticed that some people use this to load and unload groceries. I'm not sure that would work too well as there is no stiff support in the bottom of the organizer. Unless you have really light groceries, I think the center of the bin would sag and you'd end up with a mess. As a trunk organizer, it's a winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is organization?","review":"I'm tired of using this product. While the picture shows an expanded bag full of items, the actual product collapses on itself and has no real rectangular shape unless it's filled at maximum capacity.

Still, this unit began leaking last year and absolutely needs replacing now. (Its motor kept running until now, but now it's just humming like it's stuck or jammed up - despite nothing visible blocking the blades.) As others have said, the inside looks all rust-covered including the blades, too.Obviously, the 1 year warranty was supposed to indicate you're expected to replace this thing pretty regularly.
