As far as functionality, it is a little too heavy for flipping crepes, but the low walls make it easy to use a spatula. It distributes heat evenly, which is what you'd want. The outer coating scratches easily, but the biggest problem is that the nonstick coating melted. My husband just used it to grill some peppers and did so at the highest heat setting on the stove. The Teflon coating turned white and literally melted to goo, hence the 1 star rating. It held up well on medium heat for crepe making but the first time on high heat and it became garbage. Somehow I think this should not have happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for crepes?","review":"I use this pan to cook sausage and eggs about five mornings a week.

Much to my surprise and disbelief, it was nothing like I remember. I thought that I would be able to play all the different versions seperately (much like Tekken 5 has the first three installments)however I was not aware that I would be playing Street Fighter II Super Turbo and I could choose my player from all the different Street Fighter games. It is not what I expected and I think that I have wasted money buying this item, the only redeeming quality of this is Street Fighter III (which I never playing prior) and Street Fighter II:The Animated Movie but still drops the ball in terms of editing and dubbing.If you're a Street Fighter fan, use extreme caution before buying, if not then pass this by."},{"rating":"2","title":"15 years of perfection (this game is awsome)","review":"i got a chun li playstation skin from game crazy x and i also seen a street fighter aniversery edition controler they have all kinds of characters on them so i got the one with chun li on it because it mached my playstation 2 skin when i read the instructions it says its made for this game it looks like a sega controler with the six button configuration but has a street fighter character in the center the whole controler in character themed but if you buy this game i sugest buying the controler tooit feels like im playing street fighter on my sega again trust me its worth geting both items and a skin might be cool toosearch for street fighter skins on yahoo or google and u will find them if u search the web"},{"rating":"2","title":"Street Fighter Anniversary Collection","review":"Is a mixture of the Original Street Fighter mixed with Street Fighter Alpha and Marvel Vs Capcom.

This game was recommended to me by Street Fighter IV tournament players. They told me that in order to learn the basics of SF4, SSF2 Turbo is the game to play. It includes 3rd Strike as well, for those interested in recreating the EVO match of the century.2 games in 1 with a cheesy Street Fighter anime movie. Can't beat that with a bat. So to prepare for SF4 - play SSF2T, get a HRAP2 SA (Hori Real Arcade Pro 2 SA - Sanwa Stick and Buttons), and rock out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best!","review":"I love Street Fighter 3: Third Strike.

I never had the experience of living on a farm, having lived in the city while I was growing up, so this was a real eye opener for me. These gay coming of age stories told by the individuals are spell-binding. You not only learn about their first gay experiences, what their families were like, and their everyday life on the farms, but what happened to these individuals after leaving, which most of them did, their farming lives.This is an excellent look into the lives of these rural gay men and their isolated struggles. It should be required reading for any gay history course. It is fascinating and so well-researched. There are many books out there covering gay life in the cities. This is a wonderful and enlightening study of the rural gay man. HIGHLY RECOMMEND!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bitter/Sweet","review":"This book was very well-written, and very biographical eliciting a bitter-sweet and depthful authentic quality.

I did add a couple things like good tweezers, more knuckle bandages and glow sticks but all in all it's great right out of the box. We've used the kit at little league games, a barbecue party, while getting cut doing yard work and even just visiting family when the kids get hurt running around. It's amazing how unprepared people are to perform simple first aid even in their own home! I have recommended this kit to everyone I know and my wife, who's an RN, also shares our find with others when she's promoting emergency preparedness. It's compact and reasonably priced, you can't go wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seem's pretty extensive for the money","review":"I got this for my truck, and I was surprised at the amount of stuff you get.

For Sony's top-of-the-line home VCR I expected S-Video output and a much better picture, but only the conveniences were superior to those of the Sony SLV679 I tried a few months ago.

Each of the quadrants has props that pop up and represent four different scenes from the movie. The set comes with an audiocassette with actual voices and effects from the film in stereo. Included are fully painted characters of Pocahontas and John Smith that you can reenact different scenes in accompaniment to the sound.This set is very similar to the one issued for Disney's \\"Beauty and the Beast.\\" My daughter and I both loved this.

There are some brief snapshots of the Ramones in their heyday, rocking out at CBGB's (now defunct), some of their music... but other than that, it's a rambling interview with uber-stoner Dee Dee. It's a sad sight. Dee Dee was once wild&rambunctious; with Johnny Thunders,Billy Idol,Sid Vicious&Richard; Hell--now he's so mellow, he's not there (I'm Not There (Two-Disc Collector's Edition)) As a biopic, it's sadly disappointing. Dee Dee recounts living with Debbie Harry ofBlondie - Greatest Hits, but most of the time, it's about scoring dope. The music gets a cameo role. We don't see his family, his friends. He's oddly isolated. Dee Dee was part of a beloved group;he passed away in 2002 (RIP, Dee Dee).

I have greatly enjoyed his other books but this one seemed very shallow. Normally he writes extremely well thought characters - on both sides. But with this book you couldn't understand anyone except maybe the little boy. Don't read this as a first time Koontz. He states he wanted to show the reality of the carnival life - he does that okay but fails with the people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Third-rate book from a first-rate author","review":"Dean Koontz was hired to write this book from the screenplay of the teen horror flick of the same name. Shallow boring movie = shallow boring book. This is not typical of Koontz at all, and we can only hope he has learned not to translate screenplays for a quick buck (and put his name to it)!"},{"rating":"1","title":"yuck","review":"Sadly this is Koontz's worst novel to date. Of the five or so books I have read of his, this is the only one I could not finish. I ended up hating the characters more than the villians did. One thing I absolutely could not tolerate was the above average level of cuss words in this novel. Take it easy Mr. Koontz, I can understand using cursewords to exclaim fear and greif, but please do not use to fill up space in pointless coversations, because this was clearly done in Funhouse"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Dean Koontz let RL Stein write this?","review":"Koontz's books are one of my big guilty pleasures. \\"The Funhouse\\" was as well-written as a \\"Goosebumps\\" tale, and as scary as R.L. Stein's most gentle paperback. The author readily admits that it is not his strongest piece, which I think is all more the reason to skip this one.The characters are characatures, the dialogue is laughably ridiculous, the descriptions... the book was terrible. You never once care about a single character, and Koontz typically has a gift for making you care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I didn't like this book at all.

The first half was boring for the most part and well, what happened to the second half? It just ended.

Would give it 0 if I could."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Carnivals back in town!","review":"This is the type of book that makes you jump at dark shadows. It makes you look at people a bit longer. That means it's GOOD.Yes, the plot is a bit unrealistic, but it's a fun read nonetheless. Again- another example about carnivals being a bit unsafe.The reason I gave it 4 stars was that it did leave some unanswered questions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been a lot better...","review":"First of all I did not find The Funhouse even slightly scary. The closest it came was a few moments that were a tad creepy. The story itself, could have been intriguing, but it was messed up with focus on teenage hormones, turning it into one of those trashy horror movies. The worst thing was that the ending had no substance and was shoved into ten short pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Scary One!","review":"This book was weird!

But overall, not one of his better pieces"},{"rating":"1","title":"Koontz's only novelization is a poor example of his work.","review":"In interviews Dean Koontz has stated that as a child he fantasized about running away with the carnival/circus and his obsession with it led to one of his best books, The Funhouse isn't it (I was actually referencing Twilight Eyes). What The Funhouse is is an excellent example of why Koontz makes a poor sell out. Written before his megabestsellers, The Funhouse is a novelization of the Tobe Hooper horror movie. Anyone who has seen the movie knows that the screenplay isn't exactly the strongest of material to build a book with, so Koontz added some background details and the result reads like an entirely different story. Originally published under his Owen West pseudonym, The Funhouse is one best left on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGH!","review":"Dean Koontz seems rather obsessed with sex, and all of his books have VERY similar topics.The characters were very phony, to me, I don't think he's especially good at writing a credible female character. The plot was interesting, however, which is why it deserved 2 stars rather than 1.If you're a die-hard Koontz fan, obviously you are going to read it no matter what, but if you're not, and you are just looking for a good read, I suggest you look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Very Weak","review":"This novel was alright through the first 100 pages or so, but after that this became abrasively boring and tedious. I had next 254 pages already played out in my head. Very predictable. I'm glad this is just an early novel by Dean Koontz writing as Owen West."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best","review":"Though I have just started readinng Koontz's books I think he is one of the best writers out there, The Funhouse was a one of a kind thriller that will keep you at the edge of your seat, Koontz's imaginative characters and detailed plot wll have you reading it over and over again. Even though the book was good the ending seemed out of proportion for the rest of the book. Definately a first-read for new fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good points but mostly worth passing by","review":"When I first started reading this book, I was unaware that there had been a movie released as well. I remember thinking ,when I was reading it, that if it was a movie, it would be REALLY bad. I feel that the plot carried itself and it did have some \\"on the edge of your seat\\" sequences but over all it left me feeling a little cheated. All but one charecter (Amy Harper) were very one dimensional. The gruesome horror descriptions were out of context for the rest of the book. I couldn't decide if this was a horror story, a religious awakening or an after school special. Overall, the book keeps you interested enough to keep you reading (it is a very easy reading book) but it also leaves you looking for more. I'll wait a while before reading another Koontz book after this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Koontz??","review":"A B-grade effort from Dean. His afterword does excuse the thrown-togetherness of this book. It's very predictable and rather boring actually."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst books I've read this year!","review":"My first Koontz novel was a big let down.

Hopefully, his other novels are a big improvement over \\"The Funhouse.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time!!","review":"This is the first Dean Koontz book I have ever read. I could almost picture him sitting and saying \\"just let me get something down and meet my deadline\\". The dialog was so juvenile! Horrible and don't waste your money or your time on this book. I understand that some of his work is better. I sure HOPE SO!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I remember reading some koontz's older novels and really enjoyed the time he put into them. But just like Stephen king, once koontz became popular, the fast factory assembly line quality of books were mass produced and the quality of his writing went downhill. The concept of horror involving a carnival or funhouse is a good start to set the mood for fear or suspense. But this version is chopped up, quick to finish, and the ending was disappointing. No warm up, no explanations, just gore, gore and stupidity. Sorry, not his best work. Glad I only paid a couple of dollars for the old paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"The funhouse","review":"i ordered this book in hardcover, they sent me a paperback. not worth the hassel of returning it since i got free shipping with a minimum order.

I can't remember who wrote it, I think it was Owen Wilson, Owen West, something like that. Anyway it was very different from the film, and was about a woman who flees her husband and this grotesque, evil child she gave birth to with him. Years later she has a new husband and two children, and her eldest daugther spends the night in the funhouse with her friends and is hunted down. I can't remember the names of the characters, and I can't remember all of the events from that point on, but it sounds to me like the SAME EXACT plot??? Is this for real? What I know of Koontz has been very good, but this sounds like nothing short of copyright infringement to me!

I enjoyed very much reading about TR's life as a writer, rancher, soldier, naturalist and - of course - politician & president. But above all, Miller's description of the private Teddy Roosevelt, with all the joy and tragedy within the family is fascinating. A brillantly narrated biography, painting an exceptional and complete picture of this vigorous man. Includes a nice selection of photographs."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well written, compelling and sympathetic view","review":"Having read 26 presidential biographies I place this one among the top five. We get a good view of Roosevelt including details from daily life that often are not found in 1 volume biographies. The prose is smooth. The author has no axe to grind but presents a picture of the man and his times in a sympathetic way, not, however, ignoring some of Roosevelt's strange thoughts, writings and behavior. A very pleasant and informative read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Biography of a great man","review":"This book is the best, most readable biography I've ever read.

READ THIS BOOK AT ALL COSTS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Bully Bio!","review":"I am reading all the presential bios in order.This was by FAR one of the greatest bios I have read thus far. The author does a magnificent job in showing us what TR was like. I got very close to the subject and really *felt* this book.He provides LOTS of detail and anecdotes, but in such a readable way. I would find myself reading 75 to 100 pages in one sitting without even realizing it.If you are reading all the presidential bios like I am, THIS is the book to read for TR. After you are done, you can go back and read the series currently out (Theodore Rex, When the Trumpets Call, etc) to fill in the rest.This book does TR great justice. A great book for a great person!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Theodore Roosevelt","review":"After visiting Medora, North Dakota, I wanted to know more about Theodore Roosevelt. This was an excellent biography of this truly amazing visionary. This country would have benefited having him as president for another term. It's too bad he made the decision not to run during his first full term but as a man of integrity (something considerably lacking in politics back then) he kept his word. This was a perfect portrait of this man who has left a lasting legacy in this country."},{"rating":"2","title":"An inspiring look into the life of our 26th President.","review":"A very inspiring and thoughtful book of Theodore Roosevelt, the tradgedies and triumphs. Dealing with asthma as a boy, the care of a devoted father which he would try to measure up to all his life, the deaths of his wife and mother on the same day. This book is about Theodore's life and rise to power as the most powerful and beloved man on the Earth at that time, the building of the Navy, the Panama Canal, the National Parks saving millions of acres of woodlands and marshes and animals. Just the type of leader we need now, truly a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific book conveying the remarkable vitality.","review":"Having read _The Rise of Theodore Roosevelt_ by Edmund Morris,I came under the spell of this amazing American and true hero.Unfortunately, Mr. Morris' book stopped at the point of TR enteringthe White House. I wanted the all the goods.The book certainly delivers. While Mr. Morris' book proved moreriveting during TR's early years of overachievement (early 20's),Mr. Miller's book gave a balanced account of the full life. TRhad an akward out-of-office second life; this book captures it, thusapplying the counter to the pure hero accounted for during hispre-retirement.A great read on a fascinating subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality of book","review":"I was very pleased with the condition that the book was in.

The fog gets pretty thick at times and within it a few people are killed, some are terrified and some love weaves though it, both beautiful and sick. I would not have thought I would like such a book, but at the end, it left me with such strong feelings that I had to say it was pretty good - at least a 3.5. It is not so much a mystery, nor a thriller, as it is just a psychological study through which, if we hang in there, we may learn a few things about ourselves"},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Slice of History","review":"I absolutely loved reading the words of these two political competitors. Both men were extremely intelligent and articulate. The then Senator John Kennedy clearly demonstrates how well grounded he was in questions and issues of the day.

It is to the credit of the candiates to remain focused on issues instead of mudslinging. This gentlemens' campaign certainly remains a landmark in clean politics.

Namely Blues Brothers, The Commitments and probably several more. But this is one rockin' soul filled honky band with an urban attitude. What else can I say, gospel laden, rootsy, rockin' with a sassy strut! Plus the chops to match. Randall Hobbs on bass, Edgar Winters, Rick Derringer and an appearance by Johnny Winters really lit off this \\"double album.\\" I wore the grooves off of this one when it first came out and I purchased the CD because it has staying power. You gotta' love it. It's the real deal!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Historic Rock Album, yet few know about it.","review":"I won't bore you readers with my Rock and Roll credentials. But I am a (semi retired) professional Rock musician, have been since 1976, and I heard this when it first came out. Goes down in history as one of the 10 best Rock Albums ever recorded. Period. I'm astonished how rarely it is mentioned. Show me a Rock and Roll Band today that can do this."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this album back then and it is still so good today","review":"I had this one when it first came out, a couple of years ago I was in my favorite local record shop just looking at stuff saw this and picked it up on cd and I put it on for the ride home. It hit me like it did the first time I heard it, this is a great album these guys do work. This album smokes from begining to end it just keeps on building. I think a lot of times groups need a live audience to add to their greatness I think that is one reason I just love live albums so much. There is so much to love here Still Alive and Well, Can't Turn You Loose, a killer version of Tobacco Road one wholr side of the album but the last three songs recorded at the Apollo take the whole thing over the top. When play the Apollo you better bring your aplus game and these guys do just that. Just like the song this album is Still Alive and very Well."},{"rating":"2","title":"save our planet is finger thumpin toe tapping and butt kickn","review":"white trash is a almost unheard of band from the 60,s-80's band that became notorious for hard rock and in the lead was one of two brothers who were, shall we say a little different,the other brother being, johnny, both with white hair, actually both with white everything, but the real stopper was they both would sing blues with a twist They both could reach octaves you and I could only wish for if you know anything about hard to reach places.But Edgar was the best in my estimation between the two.If you get a chance to here \\"save our planet\\", you'll hum it or bounce the beat through your head the rest of the day/night,guarrannteee!"},{"rating":"1","title":"lip sync","review":"I have never seen one of these \\"movie versions\\" of opera satisfactory. To me only live opera is worth watching. The filmed lip sync versions appear absurd and essentially boring. THE SINGERS ARE NOT SINGING!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Only movie-opera of Rigoletto available.","review":"This is the only version I've ever seen of a movie version of Rigoletto and certainly one for Pavarotti fans. Since I'm a Domingo fan, I rarely appreciate Pav in an opera performance because he just stands and mugs and is incapable of acting and signing at the same time! However, that being said, this is one of the best performances of Pav on video, the production is traditional (which I like), costumes fine and the rest of the cast is credible. More importantly, if you want a Rigoletto, this is probably the best video version available. I can't stand Italian opera in English! It's the only one in my collection as I haven't found a better one yet. I've seen it on stage many times, like it, and enjoy watching this version at least once a year. I recommend buying as there are few available and this movie is certainly is worth the asking price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it before it goes out of print!","review":"This is a magnificent opera-movie version of Verdi's Rigoletto filmed on location. With Pavarotti as the lecherous Duke, Wixell as the hump-backed jester, and Gruberova as his pure and innocent daughter, this Rigoletto packs a punch. The singing is a delight throughout, as are the costumes, sets, and playing of the Wiener Philharmonker. If you're \\"opera curious\\" this would be an ideal place to start exploring this fascinating genre. While Pavarotti is known for his magnificent singing but stiff acting, in this production, he gives a terrific portrayal of the Duke. The ending with Rigoletto and his dying daughter is magnificent and beautifully and poignantly done. No matter how familiar you may be with this opera, it will seize your heart strings. The DVD visual and sound quality are superb. I hope more operatic works such as this will again see the light of day on DVD--this is the perfect medium for opera, the next best thing to being at the opera!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Best for newbies","review":"I showed this at my opera club, and only the newbie was happy with it. Yes, the sets are gorgeous and evocative, and the singing was very good. But this DVD suffers from the choice of the director to do so many closeups. Pavarotti's voice can still make you want to close your eyes in ecstasy -- but he plays a blustery, overbearing Duke, making it hard to see why Gilda falls for him. (There's already precious little in the libretto to make the Duke sympathetic, and Pavarotti doesn't use what's there.) He has a disconcerting way of opening his eyes VERY wide and not blinking. It would be easier for the viewer to maintain an illusion of young lovers if the camera were moved back a bit from *both* romantic leads... Gruberova's voice is accurate, but after hearing the rich, plush young tone of Desiree Rancatore in the recent San Francisco Opera production, it's just not the same. Overall, well sung and well set, but ultimately unsatisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sound quality","review":"By quickly going through the reviews, none seems to have pointed out an apparent problem of this DVD.

Since I have never had a disappointment, I didn't save the packaging before I tried to play the cd, so could not return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"in a word - terrible!","review":"This one will appeal to neophytes who uncritically swoon over Pavarotti's mannerisms and don't know any better. To call this poor \\"performance\\" of one of Verdi's great operas even \\"adequate\\" (except for Gruberova), much less \\"great\\", is a sign to go back and do more listening. Avoid this turkey. Pavarotti is his post-70's below-par, trying-to-compensate-by-mugging worst. Wixell tries hard but is just not up to the role that was so superbly performed by Warren or Gobbi. Ponnelle's direction is bizarre (as usual). For a better sung and more honest performance, I recommend the English National Opera video. Ok, it's sung in English and updated BUT the singing is superior on all counts, the translation is workable, and the updating doesn't violate the spirit of Verdi's drama."},{"rating":"2","title":"so impressed. . .","review":"Loved the imaginative interpretation from the foreboding dream-sequence introduction all way to the stark reality of watching Gilda's body be bundled by her murderers. Pavarotti is excellent as an impatient, eye-rolling self-centered duke and Ingvar Wixell was tremendous as the depressed and enraged buffone. The overdubbing slightly off from time to time, but that would be my ONLY complaint. I wish they were all this good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rigoletto-Pavarotti-Wixell","review":"This is a strong production filled with beautiful and dramatic singing, and Wixell's playing a dual role tightens the story.

One can sense Beck's slight turn toward the jazz leanings that would soon become his forte,although he is still hanging on to his rock/blues roots on this set. There is some interesting diversity on \\"Rough & Ready\\", everything from the heavy riff rock of \\"Train Train\\", the jazz-rock leanings on \\"Situation\\" and \\"Got The Feeling\\", to the beautiful and ethereal \\"Max's Tune\\".The album features fine drumming from the late Cozy Powell and outstanding playing overall from the musicians involved. I hope this CD is next in line for a proper remastering, a la \\"Truth\\" & \\"Beck-Ola\\" (July 2000 reissue versions)--it sorely needs it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loud and Ready","review":"This album sounds best played loud! Cozy Powell is excellent here and Beck is off the wall and at his wildest (he was deliriously suffering from headaches due to a recent car accident) yet his tone and playing is accurate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jeff Goin Thru Changes","review":"This album show Jeff's migration from Rock to Jazz Rock/Fusion. Max Middleton works so beautifully with Jeff. Too bad Jeff let him go after Wired. You can hear Jeff's influence by Jan Hammer in the song \\"New Ways/Train Train\\". Word is Jeff changed his direction when he heard Jan on John Ambercrombie's \\"Timeless\\" album, specifically the cut \\"Red and Orange\\". Give it a listen and have bandaids ready for your ears. Jeff Beck...there is no substitute!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Return of Jeff Beck Group","review":"While this is not as good as the Orange album (the follow up to this album), Rough and Ready is a wonderful album from the Beck Group. Jody is perhaps one of the best tunes on the album-it's a great rock song that still remains timeless.The musicianship on this album is marvelous. Of course, Jeff is the best player on the album, however Max Middleton and Cozy Powell are good partners for Jeff. They are excellent musicians in their own right. Overall, this is a good buy. If you're looking to save money, though, get the orange album instead, or if you want a better album from this incarnation of the Jeff Beck Group."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lackluster","review":"I love several Jeff Beck albums but this one is lackluster. The material is not very strong. The vocals are mediocre. The music is just not that compelling, and there are not very many magical moments by Jeff, as there are on many of his other albums. I cannot identify with the other reviewers who like this album so much--to me, it is a real low point in Jeff Beck's career, a dud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cyclic delights","review":"Of all Arvo Pärt's more recent releases, \\"Litany\\" probably provides the best illustration to contemporary composers (\\"serious\\" and \\"pop\\", for want of better delimitations) that music can be intensely cyclic without being compromisingly repetitive or monotonous. The title track is a lengthy religious work that evokes one of the Hilliard Ensemble's most passionate vocal deliveries and progressively animates a fairly simple melody into a stirring crescendo. \\"Psalom\\" is a quietly dignified and meditative piece that confirms Pärt's mastery of musical concepts that contemporary pretenders would conveniently call \\"ambient\\". But the album's highlight is undoubtedly \\"Trisagion\\", where the composer conjours an entirely new range of timbres and textures from a string section and occasionally fools our ears into believing that they are wind instruments."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine example of Arvo Part music","review":"Starting from the perfomances, of the three pieces, they are completely satisfactory. These are not technically demanding pieces, by conventional standards, but the difficulty lies in the atmosphere that has to be created. And that is being achieved. Therefore there is a meaning in these pieces, which follow the general formulas of Arvo Part's latest output. Sometimes music becomes extremely simple, but it is always engaging in each own way. I reccomend this recording, it is a different \\"note\\" that can move, a total antithesis to our manic rythms in everyday life."},{"rating":"2","title":"It will Shake your bones","review":"I just got this and it is great.

He obviously is extremely comfortable on the stage. Maybe too comfortable- some of the monologues between songs are a bit outdated. But the music! Sound quality on this CD is magnificent! Obviously re-mastered by the best of the best, from superb quality original tapes. Frank's singing exhibits every quality on this CD that he is justly famous for. Emotion, phrasing, tonal quality all masterful. Song choices are just great, a really representative range of Sinatra standards. And Basie's backup is of course lively and just beautiful.

The film is relentlessly daft, spoofing numerous popular culture references (especially KILL BILL) and sending itself up with comments directly to (or about) the audience. The tone is cheerfully low brow - it's great to see foreign cinema get released in the US that doesn't pander to the \\"arthouse\\" crowd (and isn't a martial arts film) for a change.

Like the other Hunter CDs, this one has a performance quality so it holds together well end-to-end. I highly recommend it.

I highly recommend this book for anyone who hates networking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring","review":"I was inspired by the Ripple Effect.

To my count he has written more than 10 scores. The score for Titanic is as exciting as it is relaxing. This soundtrack is so well made, that I bought the second one! Like the movie, each peice on the soundtrack builds up to the climax. If I had it in front of me, I would be sure to give specific examples, but unfortunetly, I don't. However, I will say that the peice, Rose, which I believe is #4, captures the true meanig of this outstanding movie, and therefore proves how well a composer James Horner has proven to be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never get tired of it.","review":"This is a gem.

I popped the CD in my car stereo as soon as I hopped in and before I even got home, I had to turn it off.The plot itself seems interesting enough, but the writing is so juvenile. Characters speak in completely unrealistic sentences, the narrative is sloppy vague, and the events are rushed.For good faith, I plan on keeping with it a little longer, on the off-chance that it does actually pick up.

The plot was promising, the subject matter of twins communicating telepathically was unique and potentially interesting.I instead got a story about a bunch of FBI hacks chasing kidnappers through New York and Cape Cod. The story had a dizzying array of characters, gaping holes, and no character development whatsoever.It is a shame that someone with a name like Mary Higgins Clark can pen her name to such rubbish and have it be an instant blockbuster, while there are so many truly gifted writers out there going virtually unnoticed by the masses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"Half of the novel consists of the moronic characters \\"thinking\\" to themselves in complete sentences.

I pick it up about once a week and only read about two or three pages before I give up.At this point, I have completely forgotten who the characters are but I'm definitely not going to start over and read the book from the beginning.

Stupid me did not listen to other's complains about new Sony products nowadays and bought another Sony DVD player which did the same thing. All I can say is SOny is no longer what they once were. The quality is definitely gone! After all, their products are made in China now instead of Japan.

First, there were the horror stories from the S560D owners. I'd bet money that every one of those failed eventually.Now, Sony launches another piece of dung, the S530D. Did this company change ownership or what?? When I spend several hundred dollars on an item, I expect it to last more than 1.5 years! Plus, I got absolutely nowhere with Sony Tech Support/ Customer Service. They tried to tell me I dirtied the lens with dirty/dusty DVD's. Funny, I've not heard of such a problem with owners of other MFR's equipment.Well, I have a rack full of Sony electronics, and I hereby swear I will NEVER replace any one of them with a Sony product.Do not buy Sony, or you will be like me, writing a nasty Sony review, VERY soon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this at any price","review":"As other reviewers have testified, this player, after a few months of use, will start skipping (entire tracks) and stopping.

I checked out the Panasonic and Toshiba lines and looked around on and off-line. Having reached the point of having to make a decision, I checked out this area for other consumer comments. It was interesting to see that although there is lots said about the audio sync problem in this model, the clear majority of those who purchased it gave it a five star rating. Well, I am here to say that I can understand why! I purchased the 530D recently and experienced the audio sync situation once already. But, I realized that because of all the talk about it, I was looking for it and it turned out not to be as noticeable as I expected and it didn't interfere with my enjoyment of the film I was viewing.

They don't assess the problem and then give you an estimate, permitting you to decide whether or not you want to go through with a repair. Third, when I noted that the cost to repair closely approaches the cost of a new machine, their customer service representative told me I should have purchased the extended warranty.My suggestion is, buy a more reliable product, not a Sony.

The only other competition at the time was BOSE (Yamaha now has a similar unit, as does Harmon-Kardon which is JBL anyway). Although there was a very slight difference in sound quality between JBL and BOSE, it wasn't worth the price difference. The unit is easy and intuitive and it gives great big theater quality sound. I will sometimes switch between the pretty good stereo sound on the TV and the JBL unit just to reassure myself that my money was well spent. It is very user friendly. Installation was a snap. The \\"source\\" is pretty light and plastic and can feel a bit flimsy, but it has held up admirably so far. The only downsides are the remote which is credit-card size and has a habit of getting easily lost in the couch, and that a power interruption loses the radio pre-sets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great item","review":"We got this for our master bedroom.

It seems to be a jumble of lecture notes that was cut and pasted together by a foreign press in a rush to meet a deadline. Few ideas were linked and claims were generally unsupported.

Tip and Beau are such dull characters--almost as if they'd been cut out of a generic book. Tip's nsudden love interest, Beau's constant \\"Oh My\\" just gets more grating as the story goes on. I'm afraid this is another forgettable fantasy novel. What happened to the good old days of Shannara, Jennifer Roberson and Raymond Feist? Even the Iron Tower Trilogy seemed to have elements of deep thought rather than simple rehashing.

They are told to bring it to Agron and \\"warn\\" others. So are intrepid adventurers just pack up and leave...that's it, no motive, no reason. They just want to do it! Like Nike, just without the sneakers. The story from there grows stagnant and uninteresting. I was not eager to finish this book, I forced myself to read it. The characters are shallow, the evil guys are unknown and their motives for WORLD DOMINATION are questionable. The elves kept calling the main characters \\"wee ones\\", they did it so much it drove my NUTS.

Along the way they are aided by elves, dwarves, and sorcerers, and threatened by various magical monsters, not to mention clumsy prose.McKiernan has an ugly habit of switching between a sort of bastardized faux-Middle English and normal modern English, as well as stealing all his plot ideas from Tolkien. The charcters are pretty good and their adventures at times exciting, but there just isn't enough here to recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"An amazingly bad book.","review":"I've read a lot of fantasy and science fiction in the last 20 years. This is, without a doubt, the worst piece in either genre I've read in that entire time.Anachronisms abound. The characters are paper thin. The plot is predictable. The battles are not stirring.The very best things about this book (and the sequel, which I read for this very reason) was the chance to laugh at the bad writing, and the chance to guess which other story some particularly awful bit had been borrowed from.I don't think that Dennis McKiernan is deliberately writing this badly, or trying to be this derivative. It's not that derivative is always bad (the Belgariad series by David Eddings is both derivative and delightful). I think Dennis must have been in a hurry, or a had a contract he was forced to honor.

Ijust wanted anyone considering buying this toy box to know that this toy box works ok for light toys, but the minute baby gets to be 6 months to one year the toys are too big and heavy for this box and cause the box to bow out and look terrible. This should be an easy fix considering all the velcro used in making this toy box, but I've tried everything and nothing fixes this problem, the toys are just to heavy... and I am not over stuffing the box either...it's about half full. Very disapointed and looking for a new toy box. My suggestion is dont buy this one take the money you would be waisting here and put it into a little tikes toy box.

It's not exactly my style (bright blue!) and doesn't fit in with my decor, but it's very obvious that it's for toys and it works just fine for that purpose. It assembles in seconds and the compartments are handy for separating big toys from little toys that my son chews on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly what I was looking for","review":"I read the reviews before buying this and was concerned about the odor everyone had mentioned. I must disagree with everyone else. There was no odor that came from the toy box when I opened it. It was extremely easy to assemble and exactly what I needed. The removable basket is great for transporting toys from room to room and then easily putting back where they belong. My son likes the fold down front, which even has loops to attach toys to. The soft edges make it safer for him to be around because he is just learning to walk, and are sturdy enough that he doesn't \\"fall into\\" the sides when holding onto the toy box. I admit after reading all the other reviews I was nervous to purchase this product and prepared to return it. But I am 100% satisfied with this toy box and thought it was affordable too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sassy soft sided toy organizer","review":"I picked this storage box up after exhausting myself trying to find an easy to maneuver and safe toy box for my toddler's toys without spending a fortune (canvas bins, baskets with liners, etc.). It is not an heirloom wooden toy box, but really serves the purpose and looks better in our living room than a rubbermaid bin or a series of open top baskets. It is roomy, has a soft lid that you can either use closed or tuck behind. The sides have mesh pockets for books and the tote bag fits into one side (after putting in divider). The sides and divider that velcros inside to divide into 2 sections would probably bend if the baby smashed into them, stood on them, etc., but the plus side for me is that she cannot turn it into a stepladder because it is somewhat pliable. For the price, it cannot be beat and provides good temporary toy storage."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect","review":"This product is even better than it appears in the description or in the picture. It is absolutely perfect with features I wasn't even anticipating (e.g., hooks, a separate, smaller, compartment inside that has handles for grabbing a few toys to go - or having a place to put a small number of things for a different zone of the house).

I aired it out for 2 weeks (!) in another room. Then taking drastic measures (realizing that it ruins the chance of return but hoping to keep this oh so cute box) i dunked it into a cold bath.

Sadly the chest went to the curb..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would have been okay if it didn't smell so bad...","review":"I ended up returning it.

Ugh... what the heck was that smell?? Made me sick to my stomach and almost dizzy when I first opened it. If it wasn't for the smell, it would have been okay. I didn't like the way the lid fit, but that was a minor detail."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great organzier","review":"This toy organizer has worked out perfectly for us.

The latter is the last recording of the most popular Weather Report lineup -- Zawinul, Shorter, Pastorius and Erskine. Much like its predecessor, Night Passage, this one sounds like a very competent, professional band that's out of fresh ideas and rehashes old ones. There are the same tight, third-world grooves with layered synthesizers and floating saxophone, but you've heard it all before and the tunes aren't especially memorable. (\\"Volcano for Hire\\" is pretty cool nonetheless.) It's safe to skip this one unless you're a completist or raging Night Passage fan; and even if you are, you should probably jump ahead to 1983's superior Procession."},{"rating":"1","title":"No buy, is a steal.","review":"If you said that is made in Argentina, I not buy this.

It's got a real '70's spin on it but one can listen to this all the time and all the way through.I really love the fact that LaBelle is on here as well.

Now my smartphone is my phone, mp3 player, digital camera, oraganizer, hand held map. Also the good thing about streets & trips is that you can save any map to your smartphone from your pc using the software, you are not just limited to the major metro cities on microsoft's dowload site. just make sure you have a large storage card and you can pretty much save a whole state map, just save a new state map whenever you are going to go out of state. i like it because i dont have to subscribe to a data plan or internet service with my phone provider to use the maps.

Published as a children's book as i understand it, the story concerns the fate of a man and the life he builds around horses--and Snowman himself, a non-descript, heavy, forgotten horse, by odd chance rescued right out of the slaughterer's trailer. This is a true story--the unlikely horse given a second chance by a man of mercy, and ending up a national and global jumping champion. The meaning here is so important, especially in our times: our gifts are sometimes well hidden, but with courage, mercy, hope - we may find the great things we were born to do. I'm not saying this well. The book is about hope and follow-through, and its virtue is in its meaning rather than its art. The heart of the story is a statement seldom made in our media, and we need it. Oh, we need it.

This is ok, though - you can simply pause the video and do a few more reps before continuing on.I had been hoping that this would be an equal mix of pilates and sculpting, but the focus was definitely on weights, with a few pilates moves, and adjustments that focus mainly on improving balance. Importantly, I was sweating like crazy and my muscles were fatigued when I was done - I looked like I'd just stepped out of the shower! Good enough to recommend and use often, but I'll be buying a simple pilates video to give me the core strength exercises I was hoping for. I'll also be keeping my remote control handy to pause and do additional repetitions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Beginner Workout - awesome for stregenthing your core.","review":"I had back pain for 4 years before I found this video and the pain has compeleteley dissappared. I think this is a great total body workout. The nice thing is all you need is some light weights-even soup cans will work at first and a mat or towel. The stretching and weights is really relaxing. It has no complicated steps and they move from exercise to exercise often enough that you don't exhaust yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great all in one workout","review":"This is a great workout in that in combines weights with Pilates moves. I really feel that I'm getting a full body workout in an efficient amount of time. The moves are challenging and the instructors are very pleasant and informative.

My coach told me to purchase this book as part of our work together. I find the story amazing and the exercises extremely useful. Its only been 7 weeks into my own personal program and I have had so many positive changes and awarenesses as a result of following this guidance as its laid out in the book. The fearbuster exercises can be a bit time consuming, but its well worth it if you want to make positive changes in your life and live fearlessly. I never realized myself how full of fear I was and how it inhibited my life. The author explains things very easily so you can follow the exercises on your own to make the changes. She isn't just spewing this guidance, she shares her personal story and relates it to each exercise and how she has used them herself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I am not finished with the book yet, but I immediately got into it as soon as I started reading!

Life has become exceptionally unpredictable and the world complex. You cannot tell me that someone who gets cancer got cancer because of a hidden fear or that a person who lost his job through layoff, had a fear of success.I think it is time for the coaching world to examine the UN principles of exercising precaution and sustainability to get real about the complexity of approach it takes these days to earn a living, sustain and protect and care for one's health.Motivational speaking or lectures on how to overcome fear are simply not sufficient anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do We Really Need Another Self Help Book?","review":"The whole Fearless Living adventure that Britten is capitalizing on is nothing new and will undoubtedly hit the deep discounted books shelves along with the rest of this type of material. There is absolutely nothing in this book that is original as far as inspirational and life lasting advice. That Ms. Britten has experienced such a violent past and has used it to sell books, frankly, disgusts me. But victims of such horrific experiences seem to get a pass nowadays, don't they?But I would point out that James Frey embellished his story so perhaps these types of tales will no longer be marketable. One can hope."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quit spinning your Wheel of Fear!!!","review":"I love Rhonda Britten. She's a real person who created her own life after testing other waters of insignificance and realizing she was the only one who could make herself swim to shore and start living a life without fear. We should all read this book to help us identify for ourselves what holds us in our patterns and keeps us from taking charge over our own lives. We all have fears. Imagine a world.. imagine the possibilities if we could each dissolve, if even in part, one or many of those fears....step into our purpose and let creative process rule our lives instead of the fear.

Buck Dharma's guitar work is excellent, Bloom's lyrics haunting and powerful, and the cohesion of the band may be topped only by a selection or two from \\"Secret Treaties\\" and \\"Tyranny & Mutation\\". No top 40 sellout songs here...a masterful collage of fear, intrigue,extraterrestial thought, and anti Nazi sentiment.

With some killer tunes like the bluesy, emotionally-charged \\"Then Came the Last Days of May\\" and just plain bizarre \\"She's as Beautiful as a Foot,\\" an apparent carry-over from their Soft White Underbelly days. With this record, the band recorded an album for the ages that any weird rock fan can appreciate. Other standouts that are also weird beyond belief are \\"Workshop of the Telescopes\\" and \\"I'm on the Lamb But I Ain't No Sheep,\\" which would re-surface on the next record, TYRANNY AND MUTATION, in a faster, more streamlined form.

The CD is a most excellent recording of the two bands. Highlights include the Coldstream Guards playing period band music from the 18th century. The pipe and drums of the Queens Own Highlanders perform several excellent pipe medleys. With the regiment amalgamated with the Gordons in 1994 this is one of the last recordinsg they made before that date. The Coldstream Guards perform a lot of great marches here. The bands combine for some truly great music. \\"Magnificient Seven\\" gets a great treatment, as does \\"Caisson Song\\" All in all a great momento from the 1991 Tour. This tour saluted the Gulf War in 1991. Wonder if they will do the same again?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for CR and RC, too!","review":"I took my first GMAT and scored 670 (Q44 V38).

I think its very very good..if ur a fan of them and havent heard it yet go buy it, u shouldnt be dissapointed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Come Clarity - In Flames","review":"I have every album of In Flames so far and this is by far their best album. The singer definetly demonstrates his singing skills."},{"rating":"1","title":"Time to give up","review":"I dont see this as any kind of return to form; the statement which convinced me to pick this up. These guys lost it back in 2000. Far too streamlined, a lack of any real guitar prowess, and weakened songwriting. There are so many more bands breaking through at the moment (metalcore aside) many of which surpass the current material these old timers are producing.Unless anything from Clayman onwards was your sort of thing, you'd do well to avoid this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where Have In Flames Gone?","review":"I really don't understand why this album is getting such good ratings. When I listened to this album, I thought of the worst two words a band could hear: SELL OUT.In Flames seemingly forgot about their past and, for lack of better words, good musical side, and conformed to today's thrash metal characteristics. Their loved harmonized guitar solos and riffs have been tossed away for a more steady form of rhythmic guitar, and the vocals just suck. I appreciated Soundtrack to Your Escape because In Flames nearly found the perfect combination between electronics and their good sound, but on Come Clarity I don't hear In Flames at all. The only reason I gave this album any stars at all is because I love In Flames and what they did for music.I don't recommend buying this. Even the Jester is upset and emo in the foldout cover of this album, and now I can understand why."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums I've ever heard.","review":"From start to finish this is another solid album from Death Metal Band In Flames. These guys can still play 10x better then bands like Mudvayne or Korn. Come Clarity is better (In my opinion)then a few of the previous albums. It feels Faster, Deeper, Different and the transition between songs was done very well. I was impressed with them at Ozzfest and I look forward to seeing them again at Sounds of the Underground.If IN FLAMES is new to you I would suggest their Colony album for a place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Solid Comeback","review":"The past two In Flames albums weren't bad, I mean they were far better than anything mainstream rock/metal had to offer at the time, but as a follow up to the album Clayman, they just weren't up to snuff. Luckily theyre back and prooving too us all that they havn't lost their edge. This CD sounds far closer to Clayman or Whoracle than their last few efforts do (which is a good thing).Also, anyone calling this music 'hardcore' needs to go back to retake 'metal genres 101' because it sounds nothing like hardcore music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Return to Form.","review":"Come Clarity is their last good album and a return to form. I enjoyed everything up to here. Reroute to Remain and Soundtrack to Your Escape were good albums but Come Clarity's a step up. The nu-metal and metalcore is almost gone and In Flames are themselves again. Synthesizer is toned down and there's way more guitar. It's also a lot heavier than their last 2. Come Clarity mixes everything including old and new to make a great album. If you didn't like their last 2 album that you probably won't like it but you might like it better. I can't believe after perfecting their new sound, they had to change direction to appeal to more audience and go mainstream."},{"rating":"2","title":"inflames best album since clayman","review":"I'm a fan of INFLAMES since clayman ,since then I loved In flames.

They haven't released a good album since 2000's \\"Clayman\\" and they seemed like they were forever going to abandon their melodic death metal past and make bad nu-metal albums forever. But lo and behold! In 2006 In Flames return with their best album since \\"Clayman\\" and a return to their classic sound! \\"Come Clarity\\" is everything an old-school In Flames fan was hoping for! This very splendid return to the classic sound is awesome and so far this is the best album of 2006! Vocalist Anders Fridén still has a lot of staying power and guitarist Jesper Strömblad returns the solos and memorable riffs that were dreadfully missing from their last two cr a p-fests! This isn't In Flames' best though, that honour would have to go to \\"Jester Race\\" but still buy this album and witness the return of this classic Swedish group!"},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"Every song is trash and emo.

THe last cd I picked up till this one was Reroute to Remain. I saw the sticker on the cd saying that it was In Flames most creative and metal influenced cd to date. Well whoever wrote that must be from mainstream radio listeners. None of it is as heavy as Whoracle or any of their earlier works, the only song that comes close to reaching the early days sound is \\"pacing deaths trail\\", the rest do sound kind of mainstreamed, and sometimes the guy is singing and not screaming, one of the songs I actually thought was by Coheed and Cambria cause it was some slow ass rift and it sounded like a girl singing,not the same, and dont believe the sticker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicely Done","review":"My In Flames experience kind of went in reverse I guess you could say. The first disc I bought was \\"Soundtrack to Your Escape,\\" then I purchased \\"Reroute to Remain,\\" and so on. I was so impressed with \\"STYE\\" that I had to hear more and the further back in their discography I got the more I fell in love with the band. This album, \\"Come Clarity,\\" definitely has a sound similar to \\"Soundtrack to Your Escape,\\" and is just a great mix of melodic death \\"Gothenburg\\" and speedy, post-thrash Swedish metal. Kudos to the production team responsible for this record. The sound is head and shoulders above many out there with sharp sounding guitars and full-bodied bass. The drum work by Daniel Svensson is dead nuts and completes the package. All in all a very nicely done, well-rounded release that is sure not going to dissapoint any long time fans. By all means... Check it out!Personal favorites:\\"Take This Life\\"\\"Dead End\\"\\"Come Clarity\\"\\"Crawl Through Knives\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"In Flames is back with attack!!!","review":"While I did enjoy soundtrack to your escape, it was pretty much obvious it WAS their worst album yet. Truth be told, I've always been more of an old school In Flames fan. Their first few records (lunar strain, subterenean, the jester race) were always my favorites. I also fancied reroute to remain quite a bit. However, with this album In Flames take a 360 degree turn around from soundtrack and gives us back the melodic metal they are famous for. Songs like Vacuum, Pacing Death's Trail, Versus Terminus, Our Infinite Struggle, and Vanishing Light are quite simply some of the best songs they have written. And tracks like Dead End and Crawl hrough Knives are just so catchy that it's hard to hate them. All in all I'd say this is a pretty good record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different, but in a good way.","review":"Come Clarity isn't In flames' best album but, it is more consistent and overall much better than both Soundtrack To Your Escape and Reroute To Remain. Their sound has now almost completely changed. Fans of their older work may not like this one as much.As stated before Come Clarity is Their best work in a while, probably going back to Colony. Most of the songs on the album aren't bad but unlike most of their earlier work there isn't a track that is a whole lot better than the rest. I guess the best would have to be Vanishing Light. Overall this album is a good buy but, you will probably like this album more if you are not a die-hard fan of their first few albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"good cd - 3.5 stars","review":"After the last 2 In Flames albums (Reroute and Soundtrack) coupled with in flames' signing to a terrible (in my opinion) record label, Ferret (which i really don't understand because In Flames is not hardcore), i thought the new cd would be even worse. It was a pleasant surprise when i first heard it though. There are some good songs and some okay songs and 1 just song that is just terrible (Scream). Still, this cd does not really compete with any of the cds from clayman and back but is clearly better than reroute and soundtrack. My personal favorites are Crawl Through Knives, Versus Terminus, and Vanishing Light."},{"rating":"2","title":"Calm as can be","review":"Amazing Album. Better then the first album IMHO and I thought that album was solid as well.

This album along with the after hours series are the two best things Global Underground has done in ages (compare to some of their rather weak relases for their main titles). Very mood dirven and well put together. The Forth is amazing as always and the placing and cutting of tracks makes the album seamless (as a matter of fact many of these tracks were edited specificly for this album. you can't find some Like \\"Glitter Love\\" any where but here.)I believe vol .3 should be out in Europe already and in the states in April. can't wait!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best work","review":"This is the only Shannara series that I did not like.

This part of the author's message is not difficult to believe, though the science and climatology is complex. The alarming assertion, also extrodinarily well documented, is that British (and other European nations\\") colonial rule in these areas disrupted the ways in which these cultures traditionally handled famine conditions by focusing the local economies on profit making enterprises benefitting the British, and responded with incredible callousness to the utter misery that resulted. Those who generally think of the British as a civilized, Christian people will be shaken by their deliberate actions which caused millions of deaths.

It is very sturdy, well manufactured, and built for years of service, yet during use it feels like half the weight of a traditional cotton head mop. When other reviewers say it does a great job of cleaning your floors they are not exaggerating. To top it all, it couldn't be easier to keep clean; just toss the easily removable mop head into the washing machine. I can't imagine anyone being disappointed or regretting the purchase of this fine product. Don't let the cost scare you away.

I think it is easier two have two that you can rinse at a time, so it goes quicker. I am impressed with how much dirt it pulls from linoleum. It glides easily, and rubs off hard spots. I highly recommend it, as well as the dust mop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Giving up on it","review":"I wanted to like this mop after reading all the reviews and ordering it. I have had it for a few months now. My husband hates it. I have come to hate it. The bottom part CONSTANTLY flips over and the metal scrapes the floors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"After reading the favorable reviews on this product I bought it. Not disappointed at all, it is very easy to use, does a great job on hard surface floors and is not another disposable. The removable dust mop section is easy to clean and reuse, big plus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great at cleaning but...","review":"This mop is great and fast at cleaning. I have just one negative comment. You cannot wring out this mop while it is on the handle. You have to take it off first, then rinse it, wring it out and put it back on the applicator. I didn't realize this at first and I ended up with a floor that was too wet and dried spotted. If there was a way to wring it out while it is on the applicator it would be the perfect mop!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money! DO NOT BUY THIS","review":"I am Mystified anyone reviewed this mop favoribly. It is flimsy. You can't fit it in any bucket so you have to keep walking back to the sink. It does not pick up ANYTHING not even dog hair. So plan on vaccuming the whole floor first. I get more done with a swifter if i want to do a quick clean up. Total rip off!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mystic Mop Handle","review":"Talk about easy to use! The velcro pads attach easily, and the handle length adjusts to the job I'm doing. Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not great","review":"It's an ok protuct but maybe my expectations were too high. It's not magic, still takes some work to clean well."},{"rating":"2","title":"My husband now LIKES to clean the floors","review":"Whenever it was time to clean the house, my husband would use every trick in the book to procrastinate. Now, after using the Mystic Mop just once, he's actually suggesting that we clean more often. He loves this mop! Our floors have never looked cleaner, and he only used water. The swivel head makes it easy to reach corners, and under cabinets. It's fast & easy to use, and you just throw the pads in the washer when you're done. Highly recommended! (I also hesitated to buy this mop after one reviewer suggested the other reviews were fake. I'm glad I made the purchase. This mop is awesome!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"my own","review":"This mop is expensive for a mop and mop head replacements. That is why I can't give it 5 stars - just too high a price. The mop does have a long head which covers the floor more quickly and swivels easily to go between furniture and against walls, but a lot of mops have that now. It is the design of the mop head itself that is unique and made me put the money out for it for a try. It can go a good distance before it is saturated with dirt. I vacuum first, of course, but my stained concrete floors are still covered with dog and kid tracks. This mop head polishes it to a shine with just water.I wonder if the mop head fits another cheaper mop?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mop to help save the environment!","review":"I love that I don't need a cleaner with this mop, just water! Add to that no disposable items to go into a landfill like with the Swiffer or Clorox ReadyMop. This mop gets 5 big stars from me and I'm recommending it to everyone I know. Seriously, just water and my floors are clean. I'm amazed how much dirt and dust it picked up...everything my old mop would've just pushed around and everything the broom missed. I had to rinse it twice for my kitchen floor it was cleaning so well. I love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best mop ever made!","review":"This mop is the best I have purchased. We have ceramic tiles and they are a little difficult to get into the grout areas. This mop works great and turns into every nook and cranny. My daughter told me of this mop.... she loves hers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Light duty only","review":"What can a mop that doesn't get rinsed really clean up? Unless your floor is almost spotless to begin with this is not effective at anything other than spreading the dirt around.The other item to consider is washing the pads. I threw one of these in with a load of lights (cold wash) and it didn't come out clean when I pulled it out of the dryer and had a not so good smell. So now I am a bit reluctant to throw these things in with clothes/sheets especially with an HE washer. They really need hot water and bleach and a load that you feel comfortable washing them with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware of flim flammers","review":"Beware of the five reviews for the mysticmop. Although microfiber mops are relatively new, major department stores have approximately a dozen different mops with different mechanical designs. In order to standout from all the competition, five reviews were concocted for mysticmops in order to deceive buyers about the quality of their mops. Google mysticmop and you will find that all the sites with reviews have the same five identical reviews. Fortunately the \\"reviews\\" were fabricated about a month ago so, hopefully, not too many customers have been deceived. My experience has been that most reviewers give, helpful honest reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you like da BLUES you'll LOVE Restless Street","review":"When I first heard this album I knew that I would listen to it over and over again. Brian Butler has capture a nice blend of blues & swing with a touch of jazz that really works well. His mellow vocals and hip lyrics create a great effect! I searched and searched for other recordings by this artist and have been unable to find any. This leaves me hoping that lots more is in the pipeline. Get Restless Street.

This set contains all episodes from season 4, as well as all the minis and bonus features from season 4. Not only that but on the bonus feature disk they included all the features from season 3.

I decided to look into her at amazon and read these raving reviews, so i decided to go out to my local Barnes and Noble and give it a try. It is excellent. I wasnt completely blown away like what these people say in the reviews, but it is great. Her voice is deep for a girl, she sounds like Fiona Apple but more complex. It is a haunting album, with all of the communications with her father, you can tell this was clearly her main influence of the album. Some of the songs are catchy, while some are quite forgettable (e.g. Not A Virgin) I dont know if i like this cd or not-i think it will grow on me. Yet this album shows true musicianship and thats what counts. She has a great voice, and should be an artist to watch out for in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Haunted\\" is a very fitting name.","review":"This CD is Very disturbing. It is dedicated to her father, and she takes her him (yes he is dead) as a child all through the CD. Though the dialog is unnerving, the music is wonderful. I just wouldn't reccomend listening to it when you are prone to being spooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"STUNNING","review":"I spent the entire six hour drive home for Thanksgiving listening to Poe's Haunted. This is excellcent, and even better than Hello. When I first heard that Poe's CD was coming out I was praying that it was going to be good, since my cousin, Olle Romo helped produce it, but it's more than great - it's stunning. It is so beautiful on the surface, and as you listen to the words and find out the background to how the music developed, you find new levels that make each time you listen to Haunted a different experience. BUY THIS CD! YOU WILL NOT RERET IT!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Work of Breathtaking Passion","review":"I'm glad that I read the liner notes before actually listening to this album, because it helps to understand that the man's voice in the background of many of these songs is Poe's father, remixed from cassette tapes years after his death. This is the most passionate, most honest, most original exploration of parental relationships and death that I have heard in a long time. The songs flow from one to the next with such smooth transitions that it could be considered one hour-long song. The more I listen, the more I love the truly haunting segues. Poe takes all her personal ghosts out to play."},{"rating":"2","title":"Left me haunted","review":"This is the most haunting and tragically magical album I have heard in a long time. It becomes infectious after the second or third spin on the player. It is a wonderful disc full of pain, hope, and rebirth. I can't stop listening to it. I guess you could say it left me haunted"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best albums I've bought in a long while.","review":"Going from dark and melancholy moodmusic to upbeat hip-hop this record seems to go on seamlessly as one song. I opened the case stuck the cd in the cd player and pressed play quite a few weeks ago and it has yet to come out. You'll be able to listen to this one for a long time to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cd!","review":"This cd is so much better then Hello. It's a whole different type of music. In this cd Poe is telling her father who is dead goodbye instead of trying to kill people and screaming that she hates everyone. My favorite songs are Haunted, Control, Walk the Walk, Wild, and Amazed. All of these songs are eery and kind of wierd excpet Walk the Walk which is kind of hip-hopish and it has a lot of energy. Actaully all of these songs have different styles to them. My advice is that if you loved Hello, you probably won't like this cd...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Turn off the lights, enjoy the ride...","review":"Rarely does an album come out that demands so much attention from its listeners, and boy is it worth it. On her sophmore effort, Poe weaves a tale unlike any other. She begins from a place of fear and of the unknown, and what we end up with is peace and understanding, but only after a tumultuous aural adventure through the many rooms in her \\"house of leaves\\".Triphop, balladry, pop rock...its all in here, as well as a deep message to take with you when your done. All that we fear, is the unknown, and through understanding we can conquer all fears...Haunted will leave you feeling exactly that."},{"rating":"1","title":"About the Book House of Leaves","review":"Thought anyone interested in this album would like to know that most if not all the songs are about the book her father wrote called \\"House of Leaves\\". Its a terribly interesting book and if you like Poe it might give you a little more insight into her music on this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"POE'S TOO \\"POPPY\\"","review":"I was so disappointed by this CD. I loved \\"Hello\\" so much and was expecting the same great melodies. However, in \\"Haunted\\" Poe has COMPLETELY sold out to main stream! It's way too \\"poppy\\" and the melodies are too catchy if you ask me. I would not recommend this CD. If you like the music of PJ Harvey or Liz Phair, you would not like this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very engrossing disc","review":"I've liked Poe since her first album and the follow-up delivers 100%. This disc flows gracefully from start to finish and feels like a \\"concept\\" album(I think it was intended to be?). Poe has a very unique voice which can be very haunting. The cd has some lighter songs and some rockers, just as the first one did. Highly recommended.Highlights:Walk The WalkNot A VirginHey Pretty (especially the Drive-By mix)Could've Gone MadLemon MaringueAmazed"},{"rating":"2","title":"DON'T MISS THIS ONE!!!","review":"\\"Hello\\" was okay, but didn't really excite me too much.Then came \\"Haunted\\". I actually bought the CD because I was intrigued by the cover art, and the store had it on sale. The title track snagged my interest first. I listened to it over and over, then set the CD aside for a while. Then I started listening to the CD again, and was captivated by tracks 3-8 as well. Again I set it aside for a while, then I \\"discovered\\" tracks 12 and 16 \\"Could've Gone Mad\\" and \\"Amazed\\". Now I can't stop listening to the CD. There is so much feeling, so much pain. This album has made me a big fan of Poe. It's gonna be hard to follow this one up, though - good luck, Poe ... I'm rootin' for you! You go, girl!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful & Creepy","review":"This release is a very impressive follow up to \\"Hello\\". The sound of Poe's voice [even without the lyrics], reaches into the depths of one's soul and pulls out a multitude of emotions. I find \\"Haunted\\" to be extremely creative like its predecessor and I already use it a lot when working on pictures both at work and at home; it's truly inspirational.It covers a vast range of musical genres, reminding me a lot of musicians like PJ Harvey and Nine Inch Nails. Those who might think that Poe does not fit their choice in music might be pleasantly suprised. I personally enjoy things from classical pianists like Naida Cole to the extremely original sounds of Rob Zombie. If any CD is atleast worth a listen from you it's the two from Poe [\\"Hello\\" and \\"Haunted\\"]. I can honestly say the biggest downfall to this release is the years the earth had to wait for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly Enjoyable","review":"This album by Poe is one of the treasures in my extensive CD collection. Each song has a unique style; from sultry ballads like AMAZED, to hard rocking heart pounders like WALK THE WALK and NOT A VIRGIN, great dance tunes like HEY PRETTY, to a lovely Spanish ballad aptly titled SPANISH DOLL. The songs are laced with recordings made by her late father, who serves as a spiritual pressence throughout the album. These brief sound bites serve as a touching, introspective and loving tribute to him. Each song is captivating and memorable - there is not a bad tune on the album, which is a pretty amazing feat in itself.The remix version of HEY PRETTY at the end of the album will melt the fillings in your teeth, and is worth the price of the album alone. For my money, this album is every bit as good - or better than the latest Sheyrl Crow, Sarah Mclachlan or Alanis Morissette offerings. I highly recommend HAUNTED to any fan of the aforementioned artists. A great, great CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful and touching tribute","review":"This album is beautiful from a purely musical standpoint, but it also stands out as a touching tribute from daughter to father. It isn't often that we're able to see the inspiration behind an artist as clearly as we can see it here. This album is well worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"As the title suggests, this album will haunt you.","review":"When I heard Poe was going to be releasing a new CD, I was both surprised and delighted. I thought she was one of those \\"one album\\" artists that got really big after their debut, but then never put out a sophomore album. I got the CD and after my initial listening session of it, was absolutely hooked.Haunted is about a journey. You probably know the story about how Poe wrote the songs after finding a box of her deceased father's, containing tapes of his voice- letters on tape, speeches, etc. She was so haunted, if you will, by this, that she decided to incorporate it into her next CD.Her father plays an MC of sorts on the album, acting as the bridge between tracks, all of which carry on to the next, creating an incredible cohesion and flow to the album. The songs are strong and beautiful, with lyrics that are provocative and deep.I do prefer her debut album more, but this is a wonderful sophomore album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Follow-Up Album That Doesn't [Stink] at All","review":"If you like Poe's freshman cd, you'll like this one even more. Each song has a different style and each has a different message. Some, like \\"Not a Virgin\\" are fun and others, like \\"5 1'2 Minute Hallway\\" are deeper songs that make you think. The songs are all really great, especially \\"Control\\". Pick this cd up, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!!!","review":"I first heard Poe back in 2000 and, although I have a pretty eclectic taste in music, initially had some reservations. But give it a chance....So, you listen to it once and you hear all the creepy dialogue, etc. between songs and you may think \\"This is weird and scaring me a bit\\" and give it up. But....I urge you to listen to each of the tracks again like I did. I was not disappointed. This music will truly floor you with it's amazing lyrics. Listen to Amazed, Haunted, and Fly Away (among others!) and you will not be sorry you have added this album to your collection.Also, Poe's other works are just as good and have the same beautiful and meaningful lyrics as you would expect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soundtrack for House of Leaves","review":"Poe's album shares many things with Mark Danielewski's book, House of Leaves (a 5 1/2 minute hallway, an Expedition B, a Johnny, a haunting, and that's just for starters). Poe and Mr. Danielewski may have shared a father as well: the late documentary filmmaker Tad Danielewski.If you loved the book House of Leaves as much as I did, pick up Poe's Haunted as a soundtrack for when you decide to read it again! If you love this album, be sure to try out the book. It's not like any other you've read before, I promise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let me count the ways.","review":"If you are unfamiliar with a book called \\"House of Leaves\\" you must read it before owning this CD. They definately compliment each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poe is undoubtly a genius","review":"One of the most haunting and riviting and personal albums that have came out in a long time....her samples of her past gives you chill with a mix of beautiful poetry in her music and words....actually it is in conjunction of the book the House of Leaves.....earily great in itself....each song is different in its meaning and sound which makes it enjoyable for anyone to listen to........"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Different from Hello","review":"I've been a fan of Poe since I heard Angry Johnny for the first time and I loved her last CD. The song Fly Away got me through a pretty hard time and I love every song. Haunted is sort of similar to Hello in a few ways, but its darker for the most part. Each song has pretty much the same tone in the music, I miss the variety. I liked Hello better, but Haunted is still a good peice of work, so I give it four stars. I think the idea of incorporating voices from her life was very original, and her dad sounds like a good guy. It got me thinking about my dad."},{"rating":"2","title":"A slight step down from the first album","review":"I enjoy the album quite a bit, even though I was hoping for a little better the second time around.After a 5 year wait, Poe debuts her second album... bringing with it the same unique voice that made me love Hello. The music, varied as it is, and her adaptive singing style compliment each other with every track. I'm always in a good mood while listening to her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Interesting Album","review":"Great concept and tie-in to her brother's book, House Of Leaves, based on tales they were told by their father when they were younger. Intriguing melodies and Poe's voice definitely stays with you. My local radio station interviewed her about this album which is why I wanted to get it and I was not dissapointed. Keep up the good work Poe!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting Genius!","review":"Plain and simple, \\"Haunted\\" is haunting genius! Too bad we don't get more from her."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like Poe!!","review":"This is a good album.About somthing she want to say,and I can understand it.There are a lot of power in her voice. I like Poe and her music very much!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I had my first listen of the album about 3 weeks ago, and was utterly amazed. Poe's voice is much stronger in Haunted than in Hello, and you can tell she has grown a lot since them. The songs on Haunted are very diverse in style, though more or less pretty much deal with the same thematic element in dealing with her personal relationship with her departed father. I haven't been able to stop listening to the album, and imagine my delighted surprise when I found out she was opening for Depeche Mode in concert. For the reviewer who wasn't able to confirm Mark was her brother, indeed he is. He even joined Poe on stage with his narrative during Hey Pretty. I intend to check out House of Leaves (his novel) to supplement the Poe's album -- but definitely get this album if you want to listen to a great female ARTIST."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album of the 21st Century?","review":"I'm not being melodramatic here. I was already a huge fan after Hello, but Haunted took a long time to get here. But when it did, I was literally awe-struck. No one makes albums like this anymore. This a deeply profound work of art springing from deep inside a true artist who took the time to bring it to life.And unlike many \\"concept albums\\", the songs are simply brilliant and stand alone as just great music, but when you add them together with the incredible sound design connectors and understand the emotional truth brought to this work, it's overwhelming.This album resonates with anyone who listens to it. I have empirical evidence of that. I'm an indie filmmaker and constantly amazed how many indie films steal little parts and bits of \\"Haunted\\", not realizing even a few seconds are totally recognizable.\\"Haunted\\" creates a whole world that will move you, fill you and you won't ever be able or want to leave it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reaching out to her Father and Mother","review":"I got this at a very vulnerable time in my life. My marriage was falling apart, she being bipolar. Me being messed up too. Poe's lyrics were and still are razor sharp. I feel her pain and longing in these too close to home songs. The music is strange and comforting, like a ride in a BMW roadster with someone you want to seduce. In the featured clips of her father and mothers voice, Poe is reaching out to them, for forgiveness, for answers, to shout at them. I guess I feel like this is bigger than a cd but a piece of her soul. I listen to it only at night and fantasize about love and longing."},{"rating":"2","title":"POE at her usual self.... Dynamic & Talented!","review":"I can't praise her work enough... I've replaced this album 4 times for myself personally, and bought another 3 for friends. It's a must have! It's touching, it's whitty, it's romantic, it's all over the map! All I can say, listen to her words carefully.... Once you listen carefully you'll be hooked! I wish she would hurry up with the next cd =) BTW: Hello is a great introduction, but Haunted really shines her talents, neither you will regret having..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poe--Meaningful, finally!","review":"I, of everyone, do love pop. From Britney Spears to Mandy Moore, from NSync to the Backstreet Boys. I've got it all. But I heard \\"Hey Pretty,\\" the single, and I fell in love. I quickly downloaded the rest of the CD and continued to love. It's haunting and beautiful! It can't be categorized as anything because the music differs from track to track, and they lyrics are so meaningful and beautiful. Poe is the best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Catchy and Addictive","review":"A great listen, can't get it out of my head! Love all the songs especially Haunted , absolutely beautiful. Do not hesitate buying this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exquisite!","review":"An incredible tribute to the human spirit and what a voice! I loved it! This album is so tantilizing and entrancing. Get it, you'll love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"creepy but FANTASTIC!!!!!","review":"I was introduced to Poe thru amazon.... i heard the snippet of the 1st track & i was immediately hooked....honest... not only is this album creative, it's catchy & intriguing too... my fave tracks include haunted, wild & amazed... so if u wanna buy something worth ur money, this is definitely the album u should get.... can't wait till the next album!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Poe: Haunted","review":"Poe: Haunted is as haunting as it is beautiful. Intriguing, and fascinating, she offers you a look into who she is and her life on this plane. It's amazing. Let her music take you on a journey, you won't soon regret it. Poe fans will really hear her on this one. Also buzzworthy are Sheila Nichols, Corinna Fugate, and Portishead."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of My Favorite Albums","review":"I found this album from a listening booth in a local record store. I was stunned. Of all the new CDs I've purchased in the last couple of years, this is by far my favorite. I have always liked concept albums, but hardly anyone does them anymore. This album covers an amazing range of musical styles and has a passion that much music lacks these days. Add to that an outstanding and versatile singing voice, and it adds up to an exceptional ablum. Sad that it got very little airplay except for the \\"drive by\\" version of Hey Pretty, which in my opinion ruined an otherwise great song. If you like music outside the mainstream give it a try."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing Follow Up!","review":"\\"Haunted\\" is what few second albums are: better than the first! This one is an amazing departure from her first effort, which, in my opinion, is not all that remarkable. However, she pulls through with \\"Haunted\\" and manages to blow a mind or two on her way to \\"really great album\\" history.The title track has been called creepy by many reviewers here. I don't find it creepy at all. My take on Haunted (the song) is this: a woman finally coming to terms with everything she's hidden away. She's haunted by herself, the ghost of her father, the past. It's a great song!The rest of the album is just as good. \\"Wild\\" is my favorite. When she sings, \\"You're not the only one who runs on instincts, no I got instincts of my own. You gotta lot of nerve to come back here...\\" it will call to mind every bad breakup you've ever had.Plainly stated, this album is a damn good time. Just play it. Don't think a lot, don't examine it. It's not an intellectual album, it's all visceral. It's all good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Talent, Fabulous Music, Something for Every Mood!","review":"This chick as \\"got it.\\"Doing most if not all the album entirely by herself, Poe brings about both the complexity of a huge production as well as a (all too often unused) simplicity of songs that are gut-wrenching in their beauty--all in one tidy package. The album of driving industrial beats (like on Haunted and Control) and lovely guitar refrains (Spanish Doll) flows wonderfully from beginning to end, with wisps of an ethereal story being woven in, no doubt influences from the novel \\"House of Leaves\\" by Poe's brother, Mark Danielewki.You will leave this album feeling like there's something more to music than overused pop anthems and emo ballads--Poe raises the bar for everyone else. This is truly a masterful work from an extremely talented and seemingly genuine woman.Though she has only released 2 full albums to date, Poe is in my list of top musical artists of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bait and Switch, in a good way!","review":"I took a chance and bought this album after hearing the Hey Pretty remix. Boy, was I lucky!Poe has said that that song was mearly an attempt to bypass the anti-female bias of rock radio by putting a male voice on it. It worked. But what I found was that everything else on the album is as good or better.After listening to the cd over and over, I just find more and more that I like about it. I look at the song listings to pick out the good songs, but I just think they are all good.She is able to move from sweet to angry to sexy to sad seamlessly. And the music is a blend of Grrl rock, balladry, Hip Hop, and sonic wizardry. Just a masterpiece of an Album.The song that strikes me the most in Terrible Thought. She truly comes off as a student of new thought. The song is her telling a thought to get out of her mind. It is poignant and emotional (angry).I have a ticket to her upcoming concert, and am buying her previous cd to get up to speed. I'm so excited!"},{"rating":"2","title":"weird, but great","review":"at first i didnt really like it but this is one of those cd's that you have to listen to a lot before you really get into it. now it is one of my favorites. i especially like \\"haunted\\" (the name says it all, a haunting melody) \\"5 1/2 minute hallway\\" (a really pretty song) and \\"im not a virgin annymore\\" (pretty funny, but still a good song.)

Just saw Poe at MSG in New York City last night 6/28/01 - she opened for Depeche Mode! Not knowing anything about her until last night, I can honestly say if the CD is any where close to her live performance, I can feel safe in giving it a huge thumbs up!!!

Even though all of the songs are fairly good with Poe's lyrics about growing up in a bad environment (abusive father, reclusive mother). She even provides inspirational lyrics for women, and information about raising a child such as \\"don't mess with a girl's dreams, or she will grow up mean.\\" The music on the album is upbeat, so it is hampered by the interludes between each of the tracks. The name of the album is also the theme of the album, because the interludes sound like your listening to a haunted house, with spooky sounds, and a little girl's scary memories (those being Poe's). These interludes last anywhere between 30 seconds and two minutes, which is probably why I have not heard any songs from this album on the radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"those 30 second previes are misleading...","review":"okay, I looooved poe's first album.

Every page is filled with color photos of maps, statuary, wall paintings, and everyday objects - children's toys, soldiers gear, bath implements, coins, rings, etc. It is written for the casual reader with vivid, easy to read text. Some of the subjects briefly touched upon: the lives/reigns of Julius Caesar, Augustus and Hadrian; the lives and daily routines of everyday people; soldiers and war; gladiators and games; artisans, and tradespeople, etc. Also recommended: WLWL On the Banks of the Nile (Egypt 3050-30BC)."},{"rating":"2","title":"cool woodcuts","review":"if you like woodcuts (I do) you will love this excellent collection of black and white woodcuts.

I personally don't know how to make a bechamel sauce yet, or garam masala, or ras el hanout (the recipes for these are not in the book, but you need them to make some of the dishes)...to name a few things...but other than that (and the fact that some of the ingredients aren't so easy to find) the book is great!

I returned the unit to the Compaq service facility, who replaced it free of charge. In May this year, the hinge on the second unit fractured in exactly the same place.

The mouse responds very well on a variety of surfaces. Then, on the other hand, there are the connectivity issues. The keyboard will randomly shut off while you are typing so you have to hit keys for 30 seconds until it recognizes that it is being used. Other times, it loses the connection with the bluetooth receiver before it sends the \\"end\\" command to the computer. It endlessly types the last letter you pressed until it resets, and there's no way to stop it.As was stated before, you'll have to have a hardwired keyboard if you need to access the BIOS during startup.

They keyboard is fine, except if you ever boot up and need to hit F6 or verify hardware changes, it will not work - you need to use a USB keyboard as this model doesn't start up until Windows has booted.

It still works great hooked up to the TV, but we purchased it because of it's portability, and it no longer has that capability. Even though we only used the portable unit for a couple of days before it broke, we had purchased it long before we opened it, and now the return/warranty doesn't allow us to return it.

Columbus, a genius? This book isn't about genius; it's about making money for the author. The history is often flawed, and the thinking exercises are a joke. For example, contemplating and then writing about your ten favorite architectural structures is supposed to bring out your architectural genius. It may teach you to be more observant, but it certainly doesn't bring you closer to becoming a genius. The book is filled with twisted history and similarly vapid exercises.Do a little research to find a good book on performance improvement. Don't waste your time or money on junk like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring and Educational","review":"Michael Gelb provides readers with insightful glimpses of ten of history's most important thinkers. Each person offers a particular characteristic that Gelb emphasizes to teach the reader how he/she can imitate the great ones.His profiles of each person also give the reader brief biographies covering the highlights of their lives and contributions. These were enlightening for the people I was not familar with before and even for the ones I am very familar with like Shakespeare. Gelb brings out details that are new to me about the famous Bard that I thought I knew inside and out.He also discusses their weaknesses, such as Einstein's undisciplined personal life that contrasted greatly with his ideas of an orderly universe.This book prompted me to do some creative thinking of my own and I hope it gave me some long-lasting ideas about how to develop and utilize my own abilities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is The Real You A Genius?","review":"There is no doubt that all of us have capabilities that are never given full reign.The world is filled with people who are quick to offer negative, suffocating advice. No doubt,many of us has been the recipient of nay-saying disservice that derailed our personal development.Although his intentions may have been otherwise,Gelb's book, in its way, helps to overcome such negativity. By focusing on ten brilliant individuals ranging from Plato to Einstein, we are able to see what the make-up and environment was in the lives of these nine men and one woman who changed world thinking. It is enlightening to see what they overcame with their thinking and more importantly, how they came to think the way they did.

It shows once again that a small group of dedicated individuals can compete successfully against much larger competitors.Fuel cells have long been successful in space craft. Soon you will be able to use them in your vehicles and buildings. Utility power plants typically discard about 60% of the heat energy from fuel. A fuel cell in your home would provide electricity efficiently. Instead of discarding the heat, you could use the fuel cell to heat your water everyday and provide some winter space heating.A fuel cell in your vehicle will increase fuel efficiency and eliminate the need for oil changes.About 40 cubic miles of crude oil remain available for more than six billion people, and we are consuming more than one cubic mile each year.

With careful character development, you were on the roller coaster of emotions of the company's three founders. Essential reading for any environmentalists, technologists and of course Ballard investors.The most important trait of the book is that the author really addresses why and how fuelcell technology has enormous potential in large scale applications - and how it is not the freakish, niche market technology that oil companies have labeled it as.I found myself engrossed for the bulk majority of the book, but as the climax approached the level of intensity and excitement waned slightly.

The story is poorly conceived, written and executed, and overall the film brings nothing new or fresh to the table for this type of film. Trust me, you've seen it all before in much better films of the period. This dull and dated dud isn't worth your time -- avoid it at all costs!

He didn't give up though and has picked up the ball and continued his career match and hasn't just written a book that is good with his second literary serve but is in fact an ace. For those of us who have also read his third book Shelf Life we know that he now knows how to hit the writing ball properly and that Fifteen Love wasn't just a fluke.Fifteen Love is the story of two fifteen year olds who have noticed each other at school but have either been too afraid to approach the other or don't want to upset their social standing. It is cleverly written in a style that jumps between the narrative of Mia and Will for each paragraph in the same style spectators near the net in a tennis match have to keep switching their vision back and forth between the two ends of the court to where the action is. A very entertaining light read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blessedly Brief","review":"I suppose that The Klingon Gambit isn't the worst Trek book out there. After all, I managed to finish it very quickly and, despite some eye-rolling, I didn't mind it while I was reading it. Ultimately, the book is inane and the solution is both obvious and trite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful&#65533;","review":"The good news is that it's very short. The bad news is that it is very bad. Clearly, the author does not have a good grasp of the characters or even the Star Trek universe (e.g. they're called \\"phasers\\" not \\"laser guns\\"). The story has holes in it you could drive a starship through with room to spare. Bearing in mind that all the characters (with the inexplicable exception of Kirk) are supposed to be acting differently due to an alien influence, the story just doesn't track well at all and the ending... well, read it and see for yourself. Unfortunately, some things have to be experienced to be fully understood."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is what it is.","review":"This is a typical ST novel.

The premise of the story, Enterprise protecting archeologists and previously undiscovered ancient civilization against hostile forces, is good. It has certainly been used elsewhere in the Star Trek universe to much better effect. The characterizations of the main characters is 'off', even allowing for the fact that they are under the influence of an outside force. The execution of the novel is just plan sloppy, there are huge gaps in the action that left this reader wondering just what the heck was going on.Unless you are oppessive-compulsive and just HAVE to read them all give this one a miss, there are plenty of other, much better, entries in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"A weaker Classic Trek novel effort.","review":"In my reviews of Classic Star Trek novels, it must be understood that I adhere to the original canonas invisioned by Gene Roddenberry, and not the \\"Star Trek\\" universe accepted by Rick Berman and company.I generally rate a classic novel thus:Adherence to Canon -- does this novel adhere to the vision of the original Star Trek?3 starsBelievability (within the confines of 23rd century Star Trek viability) -- is this novel well-plotted and wellwritten? Can I picture this novel or imagine myself in it?2 starsCoherence and Consistency -- does this novel internally consistent? Is it consistent with other Star Treknovels by the same author? Is it consistent with what is known of the CLASSIC Star Trek universe?4 stars -- consistent with the author's \\"Mutiny on the Enterprise\\"Mitigating Factors -- pluses or minuses which dramatically affect the enjoyment of this bookMinus one star for very poor ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"To Trekkies it's important to be orthodox","review":"Trekkies demand orthodoxy. New intpretations or ignoring the generally held view of how characters are supposed to act is really bad. Spock is real, McCoy is real. Therefore you have to stick to what is \\"normal\\" for them. Also Klingons are more complex than this book presents. They are warlike but they don't go solely on bloodlust. Give more of a reason for Klingons to act. This author did a better job in his other book, Mutiny on the Enterprise.Sinners repent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Maybe I've read too many racy thrillers but I found the story totally pedestrian and unexciting. A simple tale of revenge was dressed up with a lot of mystical elements and historical bits thrown in to complicate the plot.

The sound was great, and this very full-featured system was both compact and elegant in looks - a prefect fit for the condo in which it was being used. All of that merely adds to our disappointment that the system can't be made to work at all.Upon delivery, one channel played intermittently and then not at all. A replacement base unit arrived very quickly courtesy of Amazon.com, who helped us diagnose the problem. The replacement worked for a few months, but began to fail piece by piece and was entirely out of service in just a few months.Harmon Kardon factory service has had the unit for at least two full months, yet they say that they still don't \\"have the parts\\" to fix it.

If you liked EBA, you'll love this game as well. The selection of songs are just as varied and will suit most people's tastes.

There are numerous annotations with cultural and linguistic references that the serious Bible student wants to know about, and that (in my case) led to a greater spiritual and historical understanding of Scripture, and of the socioreligious environment of the ancient Middle East. The New Oxford Annotated is another good option, but the commentary is often less detailed than in the HCSB. If you're looking for a Bible with serious in-depth explanations, rather than the simplistic behavioral dictates that pass for \\"study notes\\" in many other student Bibles, this one's for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best","review":"The HarperCollins Study Bible is the best vehicle for understanding and using the Bible in daily devotion, personal study or formal classes. I found it to be much more detailed and usable than the similar Oxford Study Bible. As with any good study Bible the HarperCollins Bible gives detailed cross-references to other passages in the Bible. The introductory material for each book of the Bible as well as the running commentary explain in depth the cultural, historical and theological context of events, passages and people. This Bible also has many detailed maps within the text as well as at the back. I found this particularly helpful because you do not have to flip back and forth while reading a particluar passage. Perhaps the most valuable guide for students of the New Testament is the Table of Parallel passages in the Four Gospels found at the beginning of the New Testament."},{"rating":"1","title":"NRSV Review","review":"The cover is too floppy and the pages too thin. This makes it difficult to flip between pages. Also, in the middle of the book, the pages were cut incorrectly (they are folded over).

The notes seem to be well balanced, though I lean toward a more orthodox understanding of scripture, I can still get a lot out of this Bible. The notes are concise and numerous. It has great maps.

Oh yeah, the NRSV is perhaps one of the best translations available."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacking","review":"Any study Bible must have four things: a good translation of the text, Bible maps, a Bible dictionary, and a concordance.

This book offers introductions to most of the books which is helpful in setting the historical context. Must have for any historian or person looking seeking to understand the bible."},{"rating":"1","title":"For liberal theologians","review":"Buyers beware, the Bible commentaries are written by liberal theologians. They tend to disbelieve miracles and try explaining away Divine prophecy by assigning late dates for the books. When I was reading the commentaries, I couldn't help but get the feeling that the writers were trying to destroy my faith. Also, while it is not a bad translation, the NRSV does have some gender-neutrality inserted into it. All in all, I cannot recommend this study Bible. It reads like skeptics and non-believers wrote it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only One Real Complaint","review":"This is, overall, a very good Bible. It's always nice to have an ecumenical Bible; I'm just getting around to reading all the Apocryphal books. My only complaint is that this translation goes overboard on \\"non-sexist\\" language. The only people who make a big deal about masculine pronouns are academic feminists who don't read the Bible anyway. Isn't it funny how early Christians let the Romans feed them to lions rather than deny their faith, while today's liberal Christians worry about offending people who hate men no matter how accommodating they are?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Harper Collins also publishes the Satanic Bible","review":"No matter how good or how poor this Bible Study Guide is - it's moot!

The characters are interesting. The story is so depressing I could hardly make myself finish it. It is a testament to the author's skillful writing that I kept going until the end. It was a big disappointment, after I had read The Two Hearts of Kwasi Boachi, which was not exactly a happy story, but it ended on a note of hope and and calm. (Maybe it helps that I have lived for many years in Ghana, the birthplace of the title character of that book.)Anyway, In Lucia's Eyes is not a book that I would hand to a friend, not a book that I want very much to remember, because it was actually painful to read. But then Christmas Coke commercials with lovely singing chidren from around the world make me cry, so maybe you want to discount my comments. Obviously the book made an impression, and that's what great writing is supposed to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Al-Kindi recording!!!","review":"This is one of the most beautiful recordings of classical arabic music, recorded live at the Institut du Monde Arabe in Paris.

Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"This album is brilliant","review":"I have never heard such gorgeous songs and arrangements from a present day artist. Any fans of Burt Bacharach, the Eric Carmen, or the Bee Gees would be well advised to get their hands on this. Kelley's songwriting would be strong enough on its own, but with orchestral flourishes, it's really something special. How Many Times and I'd Fall in Love with Anyone are heartbreaking. Though Kelley's voice is very young sounding, the emotion she exudes makes her able to pull off singing at a very high impact. Get this CD.

The songs are boring and the plot is not really understood (in the music or the liner notes.) The voices are... well, old. Its not really an engaging listen, with no great lyrics or message. Maybe an older person enjoys this, but there is little that I find enjoyable here. \\"Coffee in a Cardboard Cup\\" and \\"Say Yes\\" are not bad messages, and could probably be incorporated in a cabaret that would be enjoyable, but this CD is a pass.

I had purchased the vinyl version as a teenager and subsequently wore it out and it was relegated to a yard sale decades ago.

In both cases the movie is in Spanish with subtitles, I found it interesting that the translations were different between the two versions. In either case it is a very entertaining dark comedy with a twist in the middle that covers all the events twice from different perspectives. From my American perspective it is also interesting to see life in Chile, peopled with the same useless louts, emasculating girlfriends and closet psychopaths we have up here.

As I listened, I heard John McLaughlin overpowering his bandmates, over and over again. It was quite frustrating to only catch a glimpse of what his backing band could do. His guitar solos were overwhelming, and overdone, and I felt as if he were crying out, \\"look at me, look at me!\\" The entire album struck me as an attempt to show the world just how great John McLaughlin was, and not to show how wonderful the group worked as a band. It seemed to me that John McLaughlin did not want to be part of this band, but rather he wanted to be the entire band. This was not a group effort, but one man looking for attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tim Aden","review":"McLaughlin went a little too far with this album. Although McLaughlin's guitar playing sounds sensational, it also sounds like a big show in his honor.

Often sounds like McGhlaughlin is unable to do anything but \\"blow\\" everything he has right away...which is common in youthful virtuosos, and both a pro and con of young talent. Lacks the ebb and flow more mature musicians have. Still good, historically influential."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Artistic Landmark","review":"Whew, this album still kicks a** 30 years later! Raw, intense and gritty, its power lies in the boldness and imagination of these amazing players and the innovative and challenging compositions. McLaughlin & company carved out a permanent place in music history with this album. Although MO went on to great things, (\\"Birds of Fire\\" and \\"Between Nothingness and Eternity\\") this album is suffused with the the white hot forge of creativity. There is a crackle and spark that leaps out from the speakers. The uncanny rapport between McLaughlin and Cobham, the fiery solos from Goodman and Hammer's fresh East European tinged improvisations combine in a kind of alchemy that will make the hair on the back of your neck stand up. Not be missed by any serious music lover.Highest recommendation!"},{"rating":"2","title":"5 more stars","review":"Others have done a great job analyzing and describing this album.

Those who complain that it is too fast or has too many guitar solos miss the point--that's what the music aimed to do, and did so as brilliantly as could be. With regard to those who have said that McLaughlin dominated his bandmates, as soon as he did not, the results were much worse (The Lost Trident Sessions and their subsequent solo careers). This is an intense blast of brilliance, the type of mindblowing inspiration captured on tape that doesn't seem to happen much any more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"I ahev never read this book because it is courently out of print so i think thqat it wood be a good book"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy it.","review":"I had constant battery problems.

The unit was broken last year and I started to look for a replacement, I have tried Nino P/PC and a HP H/PC, but none of P or H PC would do as good as the 200LX (I almost switch back to 200LX). They are either battery life too-short or too slow, just too slow to start another application which make you wait, wait and wait. But psion does just do the right thing, it keeps it in B&W, thr' not as good as colour ones, but the battery does last longer, say a month. Cann't it be done by a WinCE stuff? No. The draw backs of psion are: a bit expensive, the calculator is not as good as HP's (both WinCE and 200LX), phone book's fields can't be moved around...those are the minor ones, it's time to switch to a newer machine, think of psion, I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a wonderful book for a beginner to have......","review":"Although it is dated from the 1960's nothing about this forgotten craft has changed.

The cap where the filter goes is impossible to screw down tight enough so that water doesn't leak out, but after a few days the rubber seals apparently swelled up enough to make a good seal. The first filter clogged after two months, and the second filter has been in there two months and is starting to show signs that it is clogging up.

Risky.","review":"Same problem with the loose metal connector. Two items in a row. Culligan customer service has confirmed these are defects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs better QA","review":"Good concept, but the quality of the product is not consistent with the usual good quality I would expect from a name like Culligan.First, the gasket that sits inside where the shower pipe attaches was set inside backwards, which caused a small leak, which I only realized was a problem after fussing with it for about 30 minutes. This much was easily solved.Once installed, I decided to check how difficult it would be to change the filter. Once I removed the cap, removed/replaced the filter, and put it back on, I could not do anything to stop the cap from leaking. I didn't do anything unusual - didn't over or under-tighten it... it is just poorly designed with an o-ring that is just a little bit too thin to adequately seal the compartment. I've packed up the whole thing and am sending it back to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks and does not stay in place","review":"I had this model before with success but the ones I just purchased show the same problem as the other folks here have reported. It leaks at the between the filter body and the fitting that screws onto the shower pipe (that is, the leak is not at a threaded fitting where I could use an O-ring or teflon tape, but rather at the factory installed fitting). Also, the device does not stay in one place but rather spins freely and does not provide a stable support for the shower head. This is a very bad choice -- the ones I purchased are being returned to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the old shower filter","review":"The fault in this devise is where it attaches to the shower arm that comes out of the wall. You can only tighten this by hand , as per the directions, so the devise is able to pivot around the shower arm. Fortunately I was able to tighten it enough to stop it from leaking, but I couldn't stop it from pivoting. I have a hand held shower head that attaches to this devise and I had to fully tighten all if its adjustments to prevent them from pivoting too. Maybe if you have just a simple shower head attached to this filter it will work okay for you. I am disappointed because they discontinued the old Culligan shower filter and it did not have this tendency. I used it for many years and with many types of shower heads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Filtering???","review":"Easy enough to install but I have had the unit for 4 weeks and honestly can't tell the difference in my water when I shower.Skin dryness and hair have not improved and white scale and lime build up still occur on the shower head.

I probably will not replace the filter when needed as I see no difference in my water."},{"rating":"1","title":"You can find better filtered shower heads.","review":"This shower head leaked water from multiple locations.

We loved it, as the water did not feel as harsh and even smelled better. Unfortunately the neck of the adapter that screws in to the piping, developed a leak. Not more than 2 weeks after, the shower head simply broke off at the adapter connection. The plastic is simply not made to last for very long. Oh well, will be purchasing the hand held filtered shower head from Culigan to replace the plastic one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great filter....Surprisingly no loss of pressure!","review":"What can I say, I have a culligan faucet filter, which is fantastic, and now I picked this shower filter up, as our city water has lots of chlorine in it. Guess what....Not any More, and the walls of the shower have no mildew buildup since I've had it on either! This thing is great, no loss of pressure, easy to install on existing shower head, and it looks nice n' clean too. I highly recommend this to anyone who wants cleaner water and doesn't wanna spend a fortune on whole house filters and the such. Great product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soft skin after showering","review":"Easy to install (less than 10 minutes) and great results from it.

I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"New, but not improved","review":"It may be psychological, but I think the older version that this filter replaced works better. If I had a choice, I'd stick with the old longer filters.

I have noticed that my skin isn't as tight or as itchy after washing. I am going to get another one for our other bathroom. The filter is a little hard to change, though. The cartridge cover is hard to unscrew, but that is probably a good thing due to the water pressure that goes through it.I have not noticed a reduced water pressure through the showerhead as I've read reviews from others using other filters. I do have a 1.75 gpm showerhead as opposed to most that are 2.2 gpm, so that might have something to do with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Product","review":"This was the best $17.00 I've ever spent. Due to hard water issues, my hair had become dry and tangled, and I was constantly getting small rashes because my skin had lost all its moisture. I didn't know why, until a friend told me it was probably because of chlorine in my water. When I ordered the filter I was a bit skeptical. I'd been spending a lot of money on expensive conditioners and lotions with no results. Therefore, I didn't see how such an affordable product could make a difference. Well, it did. Immediately, my hair regained its luster and shine. My skin has become as soft as it was when I was sixteen. I don't even need lotion anymore. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"I prefer carbon block, not KDF in this, for shower filter","review":"Culligan's display packaging is deceptive. Instruction (5) says \\"Flush the cartridge for 5 minutes to remove all carbon fines.\\"The cartridge WHR-140 included contains gold-color KDF like Sprite filters, not carbon.I like the DuPont shower filter (WSSS1050) cartridge WFSSC0501 much better. It uses a block of activated carbon with micron -sized pores which remove suspended solid impurities and chemicals better. My skin feels cleaner. Carbon block makes no sound when shaken. It is used by Brita, Pur, GE etc to produce drinking water, but KDF is not. KDF is mainly used to remove chlorine.The Culligan cartridge is filled with loose KDF. It sounds like sand when shaken. I do not notice any difference when taking shower with Culligan filter except for the lack of chlorine smell.Both Culligan and DuPont cartridges look exactly the same,same diameter, same hexagonal metal mesh, butdifferent filler.

I was happy with the performance and also happy my local big box carried the filters. However, the filter changes were a nightmare.

I finally picked this up.Was easy to install, I believe I will be able to unscrew filter housing with the unit in place. I am not sure it is as good as removing chlorine as the sprite.

That seems to be code words for made of cheap flimsy parts!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Design flaws fatal to product","review":"No reason to explain what I needed this product for, that much, just given the product description, is obvious. The major fault is a construction/design flaw in the joint between the metal swivel that attaches to the shower pipe and the plastic assembly of the filter system. In short, it does not seal and cannot be tightened, thus sending spray in outward (ceiling, sides, etc.). If that would be adressed, this would be a decent product I could use. As it stands now, however, it is a $20 piece of trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Filtered fine, but the contraption is badly constructed","review":"Filtered okay, no chlorine noticeable in the shower. However, this is one chincy filter. Didn't fit the showerhead nipple well at all. A pile of teflon tape helped a little, but still leaked.

But as long as you are carefull to line up the shower head's threaded part correctly with the plastic threaded part you should be ok to install it.

They were opening for Alice Cooper and the ticket was three dollars general admission. Somehow, we managed to survive the rush when they opened the doors and got with in 10 feet of the stage, right in the center. We were there early enough to watch Dust play \\"Loose Goose\\" for their sound check and pretty much knew that we were in for a good night. There were not many bands that would steal away a show from Alice, but this three piece band brought that place to its knees. They really cooked. Everybody in this town knows this band and the songs from the first album and Hard Attack are still played on FM radio K-SHE-94.7.

I do say that it's not for those with only a small knowledge of the music.There are 5 triva questions to go through and they get harder as you go on. Some are hard. Some aren't as hard. The first 3 are multiple choice so a little easier. The video part is so much fun. It's just fun to play and watch parts of these videos.One of the best games I have ever played. So much fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of Sucks","review":"I purchased this game this weekend at Target for a dinner get together I was having. This game, for lack of a better word, sucks. The questions are way too easy, and all the clips on the DVD were either INXS, David Bowe, Queen or Wham. Like another reviewer said, it seemed like the DVD was on a loop of the same 10 videos. Also, it seemed to focus mostly on the very early 80's. The low point of the game is when there was a \\"name that group\\" category question on the DVD , and the video clip they showed actually had a banner that said Wham! behind George Michael dancing! It was really sad. This game is a waste of time for it's $34.00 price tag.

Somehow, the makers of Name That Tune manage it.The speed of the game is painfully slow. There is no reason that a DVD game can't be fun and well-paced (see: \\"Scene It!\\" collection of games). But this isn't. The music selections go from obscure to just plain bad (and not in a good way). They don't make good use of the DVD/video format. We have a whole decade of MTV Videos (when MTV played videos) that they could show and yet you won't find them here.Save yourself some money and skip this game."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game sucks!!","review":"I grew up in the 80s and love the music of those years, however unless you are from the UK or Australia you will not do well with this game.

You have to be a fan of New Wave to be truly successful at the game--it contains many New Wave bands from the UK--but if you at all followed that genre you'll be fine. Fans of \\"pop\\" music will probably not like this game. Don't know what people mean about the game getting stuck in a loop of the same videos; I've played 4 times in a row and not gotten duplicated clips. There has also been some mainstream bands shown--we had Run-DMC's \\"Mary, Mary\\" for example. I definitely enjoy this game and we will definitely play it again.

Competing hypotheses are well discussed and research well designed to test the hypotheses.Besides the empirical part of the work, Prof. Mutz is one of the fewer scholars who have an eye on larger social theories.

The brushes seized up for a short time (but started working)when I tried to resume shampooing carpets after letting it sit overnight.According to the serviceman (it is still under warranty) he said this is a bad redesign and happens frequently. He told me this may keep reoccurring and it will cost $40.00 for the part (not under warranty) and $50.00 to install it. There is nothing you can do to eliminate the rusting of the sealed bearings. He also mentioned throwing it out. This is just what I wanted to hear after spending over $225.00. I also wrote Hoover asking for my money back, we'll see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look elsewhere, this thing leaks like a sieve....","review":"Used it twice before it started leaking all over the place.

I went to use it tonight and the motor smells like it is burning up. From the first day I used it, I noticed the parts are flimsy on it and suction is poor. I never thought I would consider a Bissell but Hoover's standards have gone down. It would cost too much to replace the motor and the tank--which will probably leak again.

I'm not sure if it was just poor writing or just too many characters and craziness going on.In the end, I paid a steep price for a film with little substance, absolutely NO extras on the entire DVD, and I felt mostly like I just wanted the 2 hours of my life back I spent on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boot Camp","review":"This is a story about a group of wayward kids who are sent to a boot camp...in order to reform their lives.

I purchased this product in December and it has failed already. While I understand that drives sometimes fail, one would expect a product to last more than a few months. To me this speaks to a distinct lack of quality. Coupled with the fact that admin rights are required to use the secure section of the drive partition (potentially limiting use), this product has done nothing to warrant my repeat business. I will be searching for a new USB drive. One more note - the larger (read: awkward) size of this thing also makes it nearly impossible to use it near any other occupied USB port).

It ended up getting washed (in hot water) with my pants in my washer and then dried on high heat for more than an hour in my dryer.

Not so many people know about him because he has not been recorded so much, unfortunately. He played in Wagner's performance of Beethoven's 9th! and then he worked with Liszt and Bulow. His performance of Beethoven's 5th is legendary despite the noise and the bad quality of original recording (1913), but it is so powerful and sounding... Karajan once told he would have given everything to hear Nikisch conducting! If you are not familiar with historical recordings, just forget about this cd. Two other pieces by Liszt and Berlioz seem to sound better (recorded in 1920). I think this cd is more affordable, compared to the DG set of historical recordings of Beethoven's music, for whoever likes to hear Nikisch conducting Beethoven's 5th."},{"rating":"2","title":"I lost 25 pounds using the Blance method","review":"I love the Balance.

I think the author put together a lot of evidences and facts already published. He does not know his subject. He writes as an example that a person who drinks eight Diet Cokes a day and eats nothing can't be healthy. Well, doesn't everybody know that? Mr Garcia's definition of slow, fast and mixed metabolism is unclear, and leads to nothing, simply because Mr Garcia is not a specialist, nor an expert.

The health/nutritional information offers nothing new, the questionaire is ridiculous and the diet suggestions require you to remember vast amounts of information as to what you can and can't eat. If you can afford to give up your day job in order to apply yourself to this diet, or of you have a chef in residence at your home, then go for it. But, if the questionaire indicates you are a mixed burner - then use the book as a door stop as it has no other use.

And the, er... round, er... item there is, er...). Some parts are narrated by native Japanese tour guides giving a typical tour-guide description of the attactions which to me are not good enough for a documentary video.

This video is challenging but appropriate for anyone. You choose your level of weights and you can set it down when it gets to be too much. The exercises move quickly so you won't sit around feeling left out if you choose not to do 6 or 7 reps. You'll get right back into it! I love this video. I was dying to find a way to increase my strength training, and this is it! I even have my boyfriend who is a PE teacher do the arms with me and he loves it.

But I guess as in pretty much all cookbooks for colits that I read so far everybody has to adjust the recipes so they won't cause too much trouble.

Some people didnt understand why back in black was included here (myself included), but listen to it again and you'll realize its a bon scott album being sung by another person.Bon scott will always be my favorite singer/showman of all time.

What a fantastic choice I made. The booklet alone worths the box. The \\"LEt There Be Rock\\" show is there, crude, rough, raw. The CD \\"VOLTS\\" is mesmerizing, featuring some initial versions of tunes of \\"HIGHWAY TO HELL\\". The compilation \\"LIVE FROM THE ATLANTIC STUDIOS\\" is a gem, because it really has only great songs. The presence of \\"BACK IN BLACK\\", the best selling record ever of AC/DC, I think it was to show the transition from Bom to Brian ( Brian is great, but he's not a shadow from Bon ).

But unless you're an AC/DC completist, you don't want to pay for what you've probably already got, since the albums in question - the live \\"If You Want Blood...You've Got It\\" and, of course, the masterwork produced in Scott's memory, \\"Back In Black\\" - are selling as well in their current remastered editions as when they were first issued."},{"rating":"1","title":"overhyped Bon again....","review":"Bon bon bon.....boring!!!

They are the most underrated band ever, and have never gotten any credit. Everyone alway's bring's up about their 3 or 4 chord song's. So what they still rock. Who say's you have to have more chord's to be successful? I think a lot of people forgot that \\"Highway to Hell\\" is a classic. That and \\"Back in Black\\" are two of the best album's ever. I hope to hear more out of AC DC."},{"rating":"2","title":"14 Years of Fantastic Sound","review":"I got this stereo for free after it was given to me. For over 8 years, it sat in a basement, unused and unloved. When I finally cracked the box open, I set it up-easily. It was awesome! Great sound quality, although without Harman/Kardon speakers, it doesn't perform as well. Can handle many additions such as CD players, iPods, cassette decks, and more. I use it on a daily basis just about every day. It was made in 1998, and it still is one of the best receivers out there. The power transformer only buzzes when it is hooked up to an extension cord, or non 120V outlet. It may be old, but it still is one of my favorite possessions. If you are looking for a good receiver with a lot of life left, this one is a better option, as opposed to a mini-system, or third party company."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could rate this zero, I would...","review":"First of all, how could they use \\"My Girl\\" in one of their songs?

Otis legally owns the moniker, but not being an identifiable voice of the golden era Tempts he can do nothing to evoke the sound of the famous quintet.

I applaud each and every member for not only stepping in the shoes of the 'gone but never forgotton' original members, but also for stepping it up and bringing to the world the new era of Temptations for this new generation. Each man has a sound of his own; each discovered and directed by the 'one and only, Mr. Otis Williams'. Mr. Williams has and will forever etch a place in my heart and the hearts of those who love to listen to and hear real music - Phoenix Rising. This is the dawn of a new day and with it comes the soulful, sexy sounds of this magnificent group and talented men who sing what they have lived each and every day of their lives. This is a group that has lost most of its members and through strength and perserverance has regained the definition of what is means to be a Temptation - It's from the Heart. No other group has or will ever do this. Hats off to you, Mr. Williams. You know I love you! Teresa & Marjuan."},{"rating":"1","title":"not remotely like the classic lineup","review":"I was very, very disappointed with this album. There is nothing remotely similar to the classic Temptations lineups of the 60s and 70s that I loved so much to be found on this album. These new guys in the group are talented singers, no question about that, but vocal gymnastics does not equal great music in my mind. No matter how well they harmonize, it can't lift this very weak material from mediocrity. They shouldn't even be using the name Temptations. Not only does this album not have songs with the quality of their past recordings, the spirit does not seem the same either. Basically, this is generic 90s R&B with no soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"IT'S ALL GOOD!","review":"From first to last track, I found this CD to be one of their best. \\"Stay\\", \\"Promise\\", take you back.

I have yet to try a recipe from it that hasn't worked, and there has only been one that we weren't very keen on (roasted garlic as it happens). All of the recipes are simple to follow, and I find it really useful to have a nutritional breakdown of each recipe, as I can plan my meals accordingly. Love making large batches e.g. sweet potato soup and freezing, perfect for cold winter days. This book is now the only one I refer to if I am looking for soup, and her kneidals are also yummy. Highly recommended for anyone looking for kosher soup recipes, so useful to have it separated by milk, meat, and fish, and dessert, and the fruit soups were great on many hot summer Shabbat meals!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money and Time","review":"While the book is 119 pages, there are only a few pages that have 'real' information on them.

The text makes the author appear semi-literate, and reads as though it was transcribed verbatum, without editing. The book is filled with generalities, but very few specifics.

The writer's intent is not to educate the reader on how to pick up foreclosures. Rather, the purpose of the book is to get you to buy Cook's other products.

If you were to look at the table of contents, as I did, you would assume that there is a large amount to be learned...not so. The book is so generic and so simple that it really tells you absolutely nothing.

But most importantly, it works."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ron Popiel of real estate books...","review":"This book is very poorly written. The author gives extremely vague descriptions of the foreclosure process. The \\"method\\" that he presents is little more than \\"hand waving\\" generalities, and buzzwords. He uses jargon freely without defining it, and compounds the confusion with grammatical and spelling errors.The author proposes one solution to relieve the reader's confusion - buy more books and tapes!

The guitar riffs courtesy of Kelly McLauchlin and Jerry Mortellaro are impressive. Both are great guitarists, and no talk about Aantar Coates, drummer with great double pedals and extremely tempo changes. The vocals/bass by Paul Oullette fitts the genre really good.

The lyrics have little variation in themes (pain, killing, being better than the rest) and I can only hope they were written after and secondary to the music.Unfortunately, there's nothing fantastic about any of the guitar work, either. Martin Maurais is the only reason I give this album any sort of credit. I saw Kataklysm open for Cannibal Corpse and Napalm Death, and Martin played flawlessly, including when he did a lengthy and faster-than-light drum solo. The man is amazing, and I can only hope Kataklysm is some sort of temporary gig until he gets to where he belongs.If you're looking for sick guitar solos and technical playing, Kataklysm and \\"Serenity in Fire\\" probably aren't the way to go. This album might be good if you just want some constant growling in the background while you're doing other things."},{"rating":"2","title":"Early Wonder","review":"This greatest hits album collects Stevie Wonder's first hits from 1963 to 1967. The only song that really standouts from when he was known as Little Stevie Wonder is the explosive live performance of \\"Fingertips\\" which went to number one. The other songs from that time like \\"Workout Stevie, Workout\\" try to capture that explosiveness, but don't manage to find it. As he got older and matured, so did his music and the songs started to show off his immense talents. \\"Uptight\\" is a pure classic as is \\"I Was Made To Love Her\\". He also started to develop and show a social conscious side with the brilliant \\"A Place In The Sun\\" and he takes Bob Dylan's folk anthem \\"Blowin' In The Wind\\" and turns it into a call and response, gospel flavored number."},{"rating":"1","title":"His Early Hits Obviously Aren't What Made Him Great","review":"I just purchased this CD at the local Border's outlet....and I still think I spent too much.

If you need proof, listen to his incredible solo on \\"Cherokee\\" on this album. Yes, the sound is a little muffled, but it is NOT unlistenable.

I used them in a recent weekend trip only to discover that the snow is pushed upward and inside between the gaiter and the side of the boots.

If you think \\"it will keep the covered body part dry\\" you are wrong, at least in the case of this product. There is no gasket around the ankle or sock for the foot portion, so water has absolutely no barrier between you and your legs and ankles.I imagine the paper thin material of these gaiters has some water resistant properties, but the scenarios in which one wishes to keep his shins dry but doesn't care about his feet are quite limited. The list below should be helpful.Use these gaiters for: Avoiding urine splatter on one's shins. Watergun fights with a midget.

Modjo, as well, has \\"Chillin'\\" transformed into something more than simply a cash-in on the whole French house craze. But with excellent originals, the challenge becomes how to emphasize what makes it good without obliterating the piece. He, thankfully, mostly leaves The Human League's \\"Don't You Want Me\\" alone, while emphasizing the beat on Karen Ramirez' \\"Troubled Girl.\\" Some of the tracks seem abruptly edited, however, which interferes with the flow of the album.

I have started learning violin again after a 24 year break! This book is aesthetic, has very clear instructions and diagrams and is designed beautifully. The progression of the exercises is completely logical, allowing you to perfect each technique before moving on. Every symbol is explained clearly, no new note or technique is found in exercises that come before their explanation. There are numerous scale and arpeggio exercises that are marked with a different background color, making it easier to find them. There are many orchestra arrangements (mostly duets), and even a duet with piano accompaniment. The accompanying discs are an added attraction. I don't particularly make very much use of them, but they can make practicing more interesting for children who generally have less discipline.

At least these films prove Jess Franco could point a camera in the right direction. If you are reading this, you are probably aware Jess Franco is a much reviled director. And some have even gone as far as claiming he could not focus a camera. But these two fairly early efforts, released before 1970, prove at least he could.Admittedly there is some silliness in these films, but they are watchable. And again, there is good lighting, good sets, and some good out-door photography. The locations, or geography, of the films is a little ambiguous, albeit appropriately exotic. Was some of Kiss me Monster filmed on an island off spain somewhere?Moreover, after watching them a couple of times a few gaffes appear. One funny one is there is little blood.

And, they also seem like ABSOLUTELY FABULOUS episodes!If you're a jess franco or eurotrash fan you'll probably like these movies, with franco even making a cameo in both movies.

The book is really a collection of short stories. Just when you think you are getting to know a character there is a sudden switch to a new chapter and a new character, then that one disappears and the cycle goes on. A village has atmosphere - it has seasons, it has a community spirit, it has survived for a long time with a blend of the environment and people's responses to it. None of this comes through in the book. It is rather bland and the people have no depth. Is it set in Canada? One would hardly know as there is no empathy for the village, the landscape or the people. It is almost written to a formula and that is very sad. There are plenty of books on villages that bring the place and its people to life - this does neither."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's an excellent consultation book.","review":"The book is about the latest treatment in oncology.

Reading this book is like nothing I have ever experienced in my life.When you read it you realize you are really reading the dream of the author and like the dream it seems to be difficult to recover or remember that dream, but in real life when something gets triggered inside me by my environment the information in the book appears and has replaced my old internal dialogue with fragments of the book.Life for me is still confronting but now I seem to speedily shift from situation to situation with a fluid ease that I have not experienced before in my life.

However there are bits that are trully beautiful, that entice one to a level of honesty not normally encountered. A lot of merit in that. There is no doubt Lujan Matus is a clever man.

I almost quit after a few chapters, Diane's inablity to write complete sentances made it slow going. But her dialog was good and there seemed to be a mystery developing so I perservered. But the mystery was discared somewhere along the way, the situations were unbelieveable and none of the characters developed into anyone I would ever have to spend more than five minutes with.

If you're bored by subtle insights into French manners and mores, turned off by dead-on descriptions of how desire (Claire Holly's for the man who becomes her lover) is born and grows, or wearied by an intricate plot that builds to a satisfying climax in which a gun goes off, go read a Twilight novel.

However, despite the adult themes, this book is really more on the reading level of children. The story has little depth that we get to see and the characters aren't developed at all. I realize that the pictures are supposed to do most of the talking but they aren't even that good. In fact, I found them pretty unappealing. This was an enormous letdown after The Time Traveler's Wife.

This book is basically a grown-up version of a child's picture book. The illustrations look like something that my neighbor's 3-year-old could put out and the story is just as bad. It took me approximately 90 seconds to read the story, which is mostly about one of the sisters' jealousy over another's relationship with a new beau, and the whole time I was just trying to figure out what the heck was going on. Plus, the book itself is cumbersome, very large and awkward to hold. Definitely not something that looks like it took 13 years, or however long it was, to put together: in fact, it looks like something that was slapped together a week before it was sent to the publisher.

Niffenegger writes at the end of the book that she wrote \\"The Time Traveler's Wife\\" when she should have been working on \\"Sisters.\\" All I can say is that I hope she decides to write a sequel to \\"Sisters\\" and then interrupts that project to write another incandescent novel like \\"The Time Traveler's Wife.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"human branding starts here","review":"In the face of a great deal of \\"No Logo\\" brand hostility, it's good to see a response which paves the way for brands with more sensitivity and imagination.

Gad shares an enthusiasm and coherent approach to this stuff with Jesper Junde, who wrote Corporate Religion (the orange book!)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Stiff","review":"Loved the look of this boot. Needed something new when riding motorcyle. Looked good on but, unfortunately, this boot failed to deliver on function. This boot is extremely stiff. Could not flex foot at all. Felt like wearing ice skates or snow board shoes. Furthermore, there was room in toe box so I know the boot fit but I could not lace them up properly without the boot itself hurting my foot and I have a thin to average size foot. Would not recommend at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Angelics 40 years","review":"I bought this cd as a gift for myself and I am glad that I did. I have had to lear to enjoy the contemporary gospel because we have really moved tword the contemporary at my church over the last couple of years. I love being able to get in my car after a sevice, put thid cd in and get some good ol time gospel just for me. This cd has been a great blessing and I enjoy it all the time. I love hearing some of the songs on this cd and hearing how different they sound on some of the newer cds the angelics have done. The angelics really encourage my soul and remind me of what true faith sounds like."},{"rating":"2","title":"FEVER TREE/ANOTHER TIME ANOTHER PLACE","review":"A worthwhile collection to own if you like 60s psychedelic music.As the title says their first 2 lps on one cd,plus their singles they released.The cd comes with a booklet telling the history of the group.The only thing I found dissapointing was, they have included only the radio edit of Sanfransisco girls which has not been mastered very well and lacks something compared the the full version and you can tell this when you listen to this paticular track on this cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"way overpriced","review":"Now that Collector's Choice has rereleased these 2 albums for $16.98, who's going to pay $99? Should have taken $25 while you still could."},{"rating":"1","title":"one good song and then nada","review":"\\"San Francisco Girls\\" is the song they're known for, and it still sounds good -- the sustaining guitar hits an incredible note and holds it almost like something you might hear by My Bloody Valentine. But thereafter, the lead guitar disappears, and we get awful, almost Spinal Tap level attempts at being \\"deep,\\" with way too much production, nary a beat or a riff in sight. Maybe smoking a little too much Maui Wowee made them try to be Kalil Ghibran. And their cover medley of the Beatles is unredeemed -- they leave out the hooks! Of historical interest only, I'm sad to say."},{"rating":"2","title":"My hat's off to Neil","review":"I've always found a good way to find new music is to find out who the bands you listen to enjoy. So when I came across a reference to this band in Neil Peart's book Roadshow I decided to look them up and wound up buying the album. All I can say is \\"Thanks Neil!\\" This is a solid and thoroughly enjoyable band. While they may have not been at the forefront of the psychedelia movement they are certainly worth a listen. The material runs from bluesy guitar driven tracks to laid back piano pieces, with horns, strings,and organ adding jazz and classical touches. At his heaviest the vocalist could have fronted Deep Purple, while in his softer moments I hear a touch of Neil Diamond. Most of the material is original, but they cover the likes of Wilson Pickett and the Beatles. The end result is an album that doesn't quite make the A list, but certainly shouldn't be forgotten."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Unlock My Door...\\"","review":"This review is based on Fever Tree's 1968 self titled debut. To begin with, this is a very underrated album (and group), but it's one of my favorites (original vinyl LP). With touches of classical influence here and there, the material on Fever Tree's self titled debut ranges from psychedelic rock to orchestrated ballads, and while I enjoy the entire album, I think the best song is 'Unlock My Door', best described as an acid acoustic tune complete with phased out trippy acoustic guitar break...as well as a fine string arrangement by Gene Page. Four Stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Get the \\"Fever\\" !!! The first two Fever Tree albums are now on one little CD!!!","review":"Time to get the \\"Fever\\"!!! Fever Tree that is!!!

Like many movies that are based off books; SO much was left out of the movie. But the book was excellent still; i love to reread this many times!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brutal","review":"I was arrested with the first line from this novel. Although it was a simple line, it immediately revealed all was not well. The author's brutal descriptions painted a realistic picture of the conflicting emotions any young person without the honest and nurturing input of caretakers will feel. Add a few abusers in the mix and it is no wonder that the protagonist holds on to her immaturity and fleeting innocence. She simply shows the result of the lack of developmental guidance: A desperate attempt to be loved, no matter the cost to self. A good read though not for the lighthearted. The voice of the protagonist is barely influenced by the maturity of the author. Yet, in what is not said, great volumes are spoken."},{"rating":"1","title":"All around bad","review":"This book is about offering facile stereotypes to a specific type of reader. The book lacks literary intellect and is very hard to complete. The author would have been better served by writing a two page short about a coming of age story. There simply is not enough in here for a full length novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"average","review":"This book was a missed opportunity. I would have loved to see less standard villains and more real characters. Some of the writing was not bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not in any way about Arab-American culture","review":"I thought this book would address cultural tensions for a girl caught between Arab and American parents. It is a sexually graphic novel that had no need for an Arab-American ribbon to run through the narrative. I feel the false 'Arab' inclusion was a marketing ploy to increase interest in what is basically an American story with no extra culture involved. Really disappointing. The main character could have been named 'Jessica' rather than 'Jasira' and there would have been no impact on the story line with regards to her background or upbringing. Also, Lebanese do not identify themselves as North Africans, so the Arab authenticity of the father immediately lost credibility with this reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tell me more, show me less","review":"Erian's teenage protagonist, Jasira, manages 300 pages of first-person narration without revealing much at all about herself except that it feels good to press her legs together. Here we have a 13-year-old girl in a precocious body who turns the heads of grown men, yet seems to live in a social and cultural vacuum. Gee, it would have been fun to get her take on Texas middle-schoolers! But no, what we get is a girl so shy she can't buy her own tampons yet tells her boyfriend she wants to have an orgasm. In every scene, she tells us who sits in which chair (like a stage director) but provides no clue about motivation or context; she lets things happen. Fine, you might say, she's only 13. Yes, but the author isn't 13. She's pushing actors onto a stage, winding them up, and watching them bump into each other. Maybe that's why this reads more like a science report than a novel. A flawed science report at that, since author Erian manages to situate Lebanon in North Africa."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly written","review":"For the kind hype it received, this is a surprisingly badly written novel. The representation of the Lebanese character is so misinformed it verges on the laughable. The author obviously has no knowledge of Lebanese society."},{"rating":"1","title":"Creepily overhyped","review":"A flat and bewildering book relying heavily on the \\"underage girl seeking love and approval and getting abuse, some of which she likes\\" cliche. Nothing in this book is brave, insightful, or even well-observed, though it did remind me how much I liked PUSH by Sapphire, a book that actually seems to care about its young protagonist. Erian's TOWELHEAD simply kicks its sketchy main character through a numbing series of grotesque and improbable assaults - think Judy Blume if she was aiming for hipster notoriety."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mediocre novel.","review":"I purchased \\"towelhead\\" based on the review I saw in the new york times. This book does not aim for good literature, it only has sales in mind. The novel is packed with cliches and stereotypical situations that use hype and the current interest in the middle east to sell. The book is lightweight and seems to have a couple of intentionally designed \\"controvertial\\" ideas that are the core of the sales pitch. The book is then fattened up with fillers for the rest of the story to justify those flimsy core ideas. It is surprising a novel of this low a caliber is even mentioned in any newspaper reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"SICK!","review":"I can't imagine anyone other than an oversexed adolescentenjoying this book. I don't consider myself a prude, but pageafter page of a thirteen year old's oral sex, etc. was toomuch. Unfortunately, I continued reading until the end hopingto find some redeeming quality to the book. None found. YUCK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Compelling but flawed","review":"I couldn't put this book down and had it read less than 24 hours after I got it. It was a compelling story. However, I had a hard time suspending my disbelief at the author's characterization of a 13-year-old girl's sexual development. It appears that every man Jasira comes in contact with lusts after her, and she inevitably performs some kind of sex act with him. Is the suburban world really filled with that many men who readily take advantage of 13-year-olds? I was a thirteen year old girl in 1990, and what I was thinking and feeling at that age was light years removed from Jasira. I was barely shaving my legs, and yet this book has repeated references to \\"personal grooming.\\" It's not just the fetish of one character but everyone in the book seemed preoccupied by it.Jasira's saviors seem a little too perfect, and everyone else is terribly flawed. I think this book would have been less provocative (and more believable) if Jasira had been an older teenager."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"This is the story of Jasira, who at age 13 is sent to live with her Lebanese dad in Houston, after her mom found out Jasira was having \\"an improper relationship\\" with her boyfriend.This story mixes racism, teenage sexual self discovery and rape. I didn't find it that attractive, I find it hard to feel anything towards Jasira except pity and frustration. I do think that the characters were somewhat cliche: selfish mother, strict and violent dad from the Middle East, teenage girl obsessed with sex, abusive neighbor, and tolerant and savior-type American young woman. Overall I would not recommend this book unless you want to read about the specific issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"A murky read","review":"I feel manipulated by the publishing houses' media machine. This book was hyped undeservedly. Short of a few fleeting moments it did not grab my attention. The writing seems weak and one dimensional, and the characters are unrealistic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"I think this book was amazing. The most impressive thing to me was the depth of the characters - they were so believable and so human. Some did despicable things, yet one would have to be blind to not also see how funny they can be. I can relate to and understand the motives, of almost every character in the book, and I think thats a feat on the author's part. Jasira is not a towelhead so much as she is a young American girl struggling to find her worth in a society where parenting your children is optional and difficult. Daddy is bound to make mistakes, even if his intentions are good. And we can all agree that societally, a girl's value is between her legs - no matter what people want to pretend, this is the message they getdaily - and you only have to watch tv or listen to the radio for an hour to see it. This story, for me, shows how a girl might come to believe that in her own head. I think this book was smart funny sad powerful and very, very rewarding."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYER BEWARE","review":"Buyer Beware-- This is not a John Tiller Game, it is a paul breffell game and I wasted over thirty dollars buying it.

I wish I could get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was very disappointed with this book. The ideas were not new and the coverage was very superficial. This could be forgiven if there wasn't such a clear bias in the book. There were shades of bias in the early chapters, but as the book moved into the more modern elections it became clear that Shogan has a serious axe to grind. His coverage of the 2000 election is particularly skewed. His disdain for President Bush is quite evident. An example of this disdain can be found in his summary of the 2000 election from page 243: \\"Here was the governor of Texas, possessed of slim credentials, a nondescript intellect, and an underwhelming persona running a nose ahead of the incumbent vice president of an administration that had presided over a time of unparalleled prosperity. What's wrong with this picture?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining but biased","review":"It was great fun to relive the details of Presidential campaigns from 1968 to the present, and the objective facts presented were well written. But the author skewed the \\"Bad News\\", overemphasizing Republican media victories and completely forgetting about certain unfair biases against Republicans (i.e. 1992 Iran Contra disclosures three days before the general election). Shogan really goes over the top in railing against the image of Gore 2000 as \\"the great exaggerator\\". There really were many good parts, but this man is obviously still angry about George W. Bush winning the Presidency, and it shows."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maya Moon","review":"Fantastic book!! A great story that is well told and well illustrated.

I have downloaded video files from Internet Archive that are 100% better than this product. I would not award this item with one star if I could have selected none. It appears like the product was produced using various individuals who did not have the same ability. On one occasion Custers hair is red and then later it is blond like it should be.

It is amazing that somebody made a movie where President Grant and Sitting Bull were going to sit down together between the two armies and discuss peace, but that Custer screwed the whole thing up on purpose by disobeying orders and attacking the indians while Grant was waiting to be taken to the meeting place. It is certainly sympathetic to the indians, and a bit ahead of its time in 1954 in this respect. Sitting Bull chides one of his braves not to scalp Custer because we do not scalp brave men who died in battle. I recommend that you watch \\"Little Big Man\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its All Hype","review":"This book is an AOL marketing ploy to enocurage how spectacular AOL is and really lacks any useful substance.

I set out to find something that was in-between New Age and Classical, but that fell a little short of Smooth Jazz. Somehow, I stumbled upon this disc. I was, of course, somewhat skeptical in that I thought Tesh was a pianist or sax player or a wannabie on those instruments. I took a chance on one of the used CD's at about 6 bucks. To my surprise, the CD was just what I was looking for! It's melodic, well composed and Tesh's playing is, well, pretty darn good.I find myself listening to it almost daily.If you're looking for a CD for the quite moments, look no further. While it is not great or likely to become the new rage, it is worthy of a listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"SIMPLE PREDICTABLE PLOT","review":"The best thing about this book was the reader.

While the Green Book has valuable information that WILL improve your game, the Blue Book is a bad sequel and provides very little useful information as it is only a diary of previous hands played by Phil in numerous situations. You will learn more from watching Poker After Dark and visually watching how hands are played out by professionals.What really upset me about this book, was a hand that is described starting on page 73 and runs for 8 pages only to be told if you want to know the outcome of the hand to go to Phil Gordons website. I payed $22.00 for information in this book, not to be told to go to a website for the rest of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read","review":"I started with Gordon's Green book which is quite good but this one was even better. I actually went back and end it a second time a month later. The most valuable part were the problems. I kept seeing problems which I had run into recently and his thought process with how to proceed with each one was very useful. Also his unique humorous style made the book quite enjoyable. I would recommend this one for anyone who wants to improve their game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kinda like watching poker on TV only in book form.","review":"If you like watching poker tournaments on TV then I think you will like this book. I read Phil Gordon's Little Green Book and really liked the segments where he described actual hands that he had played in the past and how they turned out, good or bad. I actually wanted more of that and this book is exactly that, more play by play action. I like the format and the way he gives you the opportunity to think about what you would do given the information he had at each turn of the hand. It is sort of like a practice book for what you may have learned in the Little Green Book. I definitely think you need to read the Green Book first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Basic, but good. Short and Informative","review":"If you have basic poker knowledge (read the Phil Gordon's Green book) then this is a great follow-up. Even if you didn't read the Green book, you'll learn something reading this book. It's an easy read, entertaining, and has some good info. For a casual player who wants to get better but doesn't want to get too involved in poker theory, there's no beating Phil Gordon's Green and Blue book. For a serious player, it's still a good read if not a bit fluffy, like Phil Gordon himself. READ IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gordon's Poker Education Through Example... Fantastic!!","review":"With a couple of Poker books read, I really enjoyed sitting down with Phil Gordon's Little Blue Book. This is a good short read, it is almost like a manual as it offers lessons learned at the tables. And don't get me wrong, Phil is very lively and articulate so it anything but a bore. I think this is a great book for the air traveler on your wway to Vegas (or any destination for that matter)It has prompted me to go out and get Phil's other other books. I suggest you do the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five stars for Larry and the band, three for the production","review":"Let me start out by saying that Larry Carlton plays his ass off on this disc, as does the rest of his band. He's always been able to play the blues like this, and it's about time he did it on record.Something about the production doesn't do it for me, though. Larry's tone is spectacular (as always), but it seems like everything else is way too far in the background. The horns, especially, sound thin and compressed, without punch. There's some sort of synth strings over the top of the horns on some of the tracks which really doesn't need to be there. The Hammond organ doesn't growl; it purrs.If this group put out a live record, it would be amazing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Buy","review":"I've been a fan of LC's since his first album, and I used to buy albums and CD's without review. But after buying a few that just didn't do it for me, I'm a little more carefull. I went through the samples...of course the first song is all sax. Who chooses these samples?! I want to hear Larry! I went through the other samples and I just didn't hear the technical smoothness that I like. Maybe I'm just not a big blues fan. I really prefer Larry's work on the Four-Play CD's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Preaching Christianity is the bottom line here.","review":"I became aware of Dr. Reker's conservative outlook by statements such as, sex before marriage is illegal in South Carolina, so Susan Smith was breaking the law. He also describes things subjectively, as in, \\"tawdry sexual exploits\\". As the book continues, he brings in religion more and more. The last 1/4 of the book is sheer preaching. It is a sermon. He talks about Jesus dying on the cross for our sins... I felt decieved by the fact that the title and cover of the book did not say that it is written with a Christian perspective. An apt title would be, \\"The Christian Interpretation of the Susan Smith Case.\\" If that's what you want, buy the book. If not, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is more analysis and not the story","review":"I wanted to know the story of Susan Smith.

The author was clearly a very talented science writer, and this book is a treasure, not at all out of date even 30 years after it was written.Particularly nice are the intuitive and engaging ways in which Pagels explains difficult concepts in quantum and statistical physics. For example, setting different interpretations of quantum mechanics in the busy \\"Reality Marketplace\\" with different vendors shouting out their 'offers' was simply brilliant.Highly recommended, for professional physicists and general public alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a great book on Quantum Physics, you just have to get past the Authors personal views on God","review":"This is a really good book on Quantum Physics. I really want to give it 5 stars, but the draw back is that the Author is constantly injecting his views about God into book, which at times is very distracting. The book is good because it guides you through both the history of Quantum Physics, as well as its core concepts. If the Author is still alive, I hope that he will choose to release a new edition of this book that speaks to the new developments, discoveries and theories that have occured since the original publication of the book in the 1980's."},{"rating":"2","title":"The General did it.","review":"The authors gained access to many documents, letters, journals, etc. from the participants in and survivors of the battle not previously available - particularly British.

They demonstrate beyond any debate that Lord Chelmsford was responsible for the British catastrophe and that he and his aide Crealock disgracefully shifted the blame onto Durnford, the colonial officer who died on the field.Well done and an excellent read for those interested in the wars of the Victorian period."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost Perfect","review":"I am a 57 year-old, arthritic woman, who uses this ramp to get my scooter from the back of my KIA minivan - BY MYSELF - without dismantling the scooter! I can handle the sections fine.

The acting is good, but the movie is so slow-moving and repetitious that it could be edited way down and still not be very interesting.The Indians had really nifty costumes, though. And John Huston had a unique hat. That is about it for the whole movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A dramatic rendition of a true story","review":"The story of Hugh Glass, well known to many South Dakotans, is one of the great sagas of that state, and of the northwest in general. It takes place only 19 years after the Lewis and Clark expedition, when the area was still both wild and racially and tribally divided. Glass, left to die by comrades after being badly mauled by a female grizzly bear, survives and seeks revenge on the men who left him (one of whom, Jim Bridger, later became quite famous in his own right). He winds up not killing either one, but his survival story is a nearly unbelievable tale of courage, perseverance, intelligence and knowledge of the wilderness. Excellent movie, check it out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Weight training guide is comprehensive and clear","review":"I think Weight Training by Design is a very comprehensive, clear and logical training method. The BAM superset system will get you pumped. The workout is nice because it's both quick and effective. The book is much more specific than other weight training guides I've seen, and covers a variety of levels of difficulty and intensity. It works for me because I like to have a few routines I can do depending on my fitness level and what I'm trying to accomplish. The authors give very detailed information and recommendations about diet as well. Not just what to eat, but when. This would be a great book to have if you've just starting weight training, or if you're been training but really want to take it to the next level."},{"rating":"1","title":"No revolution just uninspired rehashing","review":"Liked the reviews I read here about this book. After purchasing and reading the book, the reviews are truley misleading. Content which is meager has little explanation for nearly any exercise suggested. BAM is better used by Emeril then in this book.Fancy topics like \\"Posture and Ergonomics\\" once I read it, are nothing more then superficial observations. Telling me how to stand and sit are not training techniques.The chapter on abs has 6 exercises with 2 being used twice one on a bench and one on the floor counting for 4 of the 6.Sadly the reviews sucked for this book. If I had flipped thru the book for just a few seconds I would have passed without a moments hesitation, instead I wasted a few bucks and some time confirming how feeble the book was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please, think before you by","review":"I realy do not understand how this book could be 5 star. Most of the exercises are done on machine, mostly Cybex.So it is definitely not for home users.Most of the exercises are isolation exercises. So, not for beginners, who should start with compound.There is no explanations about how to breath, and for beginner it can hurt the health very badly.So, maybe this book is for beginner who is going to gym with personal trainer who can give the explanation how to breath. But if you have a certified personal trainer, why you need this book?Revolutionary concept? : ) Do not be funny! About that, you can find tones of more usefull materials.I gave 1 star for \\"things to avoid\\" in exercises description, that is the best point in this book.

I wasn't even applying much turning force at all. It was useless to continue so I returned this piece of junk. The cable is very weak. Prior to this I had a hand-crank drum auger that was made entirely of metal and it lasted for about 10 years. This Cobra drum auger lasted less than 5 minutes before the cable kinked.

Unlike many bath gels we've tried, it didn't leave his skin dry or irritated. At the same time it managed to remove all the excess oils and get his skin really clean. He's not a big fan of fragranced soap, but even he thought the fragrance was mild enough and I rather liked the smell it left on him. I'd recommend it and so would he."},{"rating":"2","title":"Haunting score!","review":"There is no doubt that Ennio Morricone is a very gifted composer. Morricone understands music well, knowing that one does not have to create loud and noisy soundtracks in order to be appreciated. While seeing the film, I was enchanted by the slow and haunting music during the pivotal scenes (sporadic piano notes, gorgeous orchestra). Some of the classic songs can be a bit tiresome, but the rest is just great."},{"rating":"1","title":"This are the songs of the film?","review":"If you are thinking that this are all the songs of the film you are wrong. I had saen the movie recently and it was a surprise to hear a lot of song from Rurouni Kenshin (Samurai X) - yes, the anime - composed by Noriyuki Asakura. What a shock! And, from far, that are the best songs of the film (Kaoru to Misao or Departure as an example)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful music that made the movie complete","review":"There are sparatic 40's style gems amongst the most beautiful new classical music I think I have ever heard as a soundtrack. Track 20 'ladies and gentelmen of the jurry' is a slow, intense theme which will have you thinking about it for months after listening to it. There are a few classical ones that you may skip over because of their direct tie with the movie (they don't really work just as songs.) Overall, the movie was a beautiful rendition of a book of genius, and this soundtrack does both justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprisingly useless","review":"For a dictionary that claims to have 130,000 entries, this one is missing a lot of words.

The paper is the kind used for coloring books, and the printing is poorly done. In some instances it is all but impossible to read the black print on dark gray background. I had expected to receive a book of at least as good quality as Que's Complete Idiot's Guide to Windows 95. Sorry about this poor review. This is the first time in a long time I've been so disappointed in a book I had ordered sight unseen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inaccurate size","review":"This bra is not as described. The 36B that I ordered was a full 2 inches shorter in the chest band than the other bras of the same size that I own. There is no way this could serve functionally as a nursing bra. The fabric on the cups did not even begin to cover the breast area. When I opened the package I had to laugh because they looked just like little girls' training bras. Do not waste your money! I immediately sent them back for a refund."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the price","review":"I was getting frustrated with bras fitting weirdly, or being uncomfortable, or being far too expensive. This does the trick, comfortably, is reasonably priced, and is very true to size. The cups are pretty thin so you definitely need to wear some sort of breast pad under them so as not to show through if you get cold, or if you have darker nipples and are wearing a light colored shirt. They're also stretchy so you can grow & shrink when you're full or empty of milk. I had hoped to wear under some v-neck shirts, but it's not quite deep enough for that. But it is comfortable enough to wear all day, and then wear to bed.... one less thing to do before I pass out when baby sleeps!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Captain Bones Gold","review":"We bought this game after returning Disney Dream Sketcher....My daughter and son really loves this game.

We put it together, and they goofed around with it, pushing the monkey so the skeleton would come out. Before we could actually sit down to play it, the skeleton was no longer working!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game but ours broke","review":"This game was so much fun until it started acting like it had a short in it. Sometimes it would work and sometimes it wouldn't. We only had it maybe a month before it started acting this way. Captain Bones does come unhinged if pulled on but he is easy to snap back together. I have accepted that ours in officially done for, so I finally threw it away today. I will most likely buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do not let your child pull on Captain Bones","review":"This game was a favorite of my 2 boys. We actually returned one that wasn't working so well and purchased another one. My 3 year old was playing with it on his own and now captain bones won't work at all. He must have pulled on him, so don't allow your younger children to play this game unattended. Otherwise, it's a great and fun game!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy","review":"The concept is great but the manufacturing of it was horrible. The captain pops out and jerks around. It NEVER comes close to any game pieces. Since it was a gift and we don't have the receipt, we can't even return it. Don't waste your money and buy something else. My boys were very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"their thrill is in the anticipation of the attack!","review":"No mechanical problems with the game, though I do agree it seems to be \\"delicate\\" in some places. Better to let an older kid or an adult set it up, don't let the little ones manhandle it too much!Their fun is in the anticipation of the attack- that skeleton spins up and out to randomly snatch a player's coin away, then just as quickly, he whirls back into his pirate's chest.Good for this age group, best if you whip them into a frenzy with your drama when the attack happens............."},{"rating":"1","title":"fun when it works","review":"My kids loved this game, but it did not last. If the game did not break down I would give this game 5 stars. The problem is that Captain Bones stopped working after two or three games. The game was a blast and lots of fun at first. If they fix the problem I would definatly give it 5 stars. Too bad it broke down after such a short time."},{"rating":"1","title":"This toy is terrible!","review":"I have no idea what the other reviewers are thinking, but this toy is awful. The peices do not fit together right, the spinner does not work and the skeleton does not even come close to coming out of the treasure chest far enough to steal any of the gold peices. We are definitely returning this toy. No good!"},{"rating":"1","title":"skeleton with a sweatband","review":"I repeatedly tapped the monkey's head but Captain Bones stayed in his treasure chest the whole time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Game EVER made","review":"Don't waste your money on this ridiculous toy. We are a game family and this was such a waste for our 4 1/2 year old and the older kids as well. I wish I could return it. It is a piece of JUNK. Another reviewer compared this to \\"Don't Wake Up Daddy\\", which is a much better game. I can't imagine the other people liking this even a little."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't believe thats all there is...","review":"The only problem with this audio set is the length. Unless there are some mysterious expanded sets floating around, the one I have consists of 2, 30min cassettes. Oh the agony! However, the 1 hour of total time is worth the set, simply because of Heston's voice. I mean come on, MOSES, reading the BIBLE. It just makes sense. Heston brings his trademark over-emoting to the King James Bible and his crackling voice just seems the perfect fit to the 400 year old language. If you enjoy the Bible and want to listen to some favorite stories and psalms injected with a new sense of majestic power, look no further. If you can't get enough of Heston rambling on and on about damn dirty apes and his people having to go, then grab this too because its in a very similar vein. I'll say it again, MOSES & THE BIBLE, it just makes sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christy Chung is Mesmerizing!","review":"I am glad I had seen this movie, because it's Christy Chung breakthrough performance, at the same time it's a very sexually disturbing film which reminded me of Juliette Binoche's Damage. I am not a fan of Christy, but it's amazing to see her transformed herself into a highly sexualized and Westernized stepmother role in this period drama that dealt with issues including abuse, abandonment, abortion, sexual perversion, and revenge in a wealthy Thai household. Also, she not only looked glamorous and beautiful, she also learnt all her lines in Thai. She gets to sleep with the adolence lead and another woman.A few disturbing scenes in this film including the little boy witnessing his father having sex, and the scene when Christy assisted her lover to have an abortion that caused a massive of amount of bleeding.This film is provocative, and can be overwhelming for some mainstream viewers. If you are a fan of Christy Chung, then you should not miss it."},{"rating":"1","title":"sex + tragic = art","review":"What is erotic? What is tragic? Is there a difference? There are so many films that focus on sex and the seemingly inevitable disastrous outcome of having it that its remarkable anyone has anything else to say on the subject. Nonzee Nimibutr's film explores a multi-layered onion of sex, family, and above all, dysfunction. As with most foreign films, the tone is heavy and the sex seems even more seedy, depressing, and ultimately pathetic.This might be precisely the point Nimibutr wants to make with Jan Dara, but it is difficult to give much back as a viewer. Our main character is seen growing from child to man, played by different actors and therefore, we lose our connection with him. Ultimately, its simply sad and I kept waiting for it to end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dinosaurs abound","review":"This is the perfect book for your little dinosaur lover.

Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Listening Waltzes","review":"I recently ordered this CD and have listened to it several times. If you like waltzes, you will really like this CD. I am transported to a grand ball room everytime I play it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for Dance Practice","review":"This is admittedly not a recording of high musicality, but it suits its purpose well -- providing pleasing music with which to practice the Viennese Waltz at the regulation tempo for the American style of the dance. These are intentionally not concert performances of Viennese-style music. They are strict-tempo performances intended for the ballroom dance known as the Viennese Waltz. There are many orchestras that are far better than this. But it is difficult to find, for example, recordings by the New York Philharmonic that hold to a strict 54 measure per minute tempo! If you're a musical purist looking for fine recordings of Strauss waltzes as he would have conducted them, don't buy this CD. If you're a ballroom dancer looking for practice music, this fits the bill well at a good price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Utopia","review":"This booked turned an ordinary middle of the week evening into a time-travel weekend getaway for me. If Barbarella had a beach house, it would be in this book. I keep coming back to it for the sense of place and experimentation on every page, and to wonder at how much architecture of essence is concentrated in one spot on the map. It strips away the glam veneer of the so-called Hamptons to show how creative minds used creative materials to construct fantastic but livable houses. I'm glad they're all in one book so I can escape any day of the week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't let the cover mislead you","review":"When i saw the cover of this book i thought this would be a great book. I wanted to find pictures of beautiful decorated houses,nice gardens and offcourse the habitants of the mansions. Well, that's not quite what's inside this book.

I wish I would have bought a different one, but it's still cute."},{"rating":"1","title":"good concept, not for scientists","review":"I was worried when the introduction tactfully implied that the author was playing fast and loose with the facts. Was that the best person they could get?! Then, I was just plain bored. It wasn't bad as a history lesson, but that's not why I bought the book. Perhaps the fact that I do have a medical background made me more skeptical. I expected to find more than unfounded speculation.

You mix Hatebreed and soulfly you get Ektomorf."},{"rating":"1","title":"did someone say soulfly?","review":"I bought this album with the impression it was a technical death metal album...unfortunately it is quite the opposite. This album has the nu-metal sound, but pretty harsh, and a bit more musical than most albums of the genre. There are some decent riffs, some interesting chants and the incorporation of some exotic instruments to break up the songs a little, perhaps add variety. But when I finish listening, I can't really remember anything that memorable. I think you'll like this if you are a Soulfly fan, which I am not, but if you are this may be worth your time. If you are like me and prefer the heavier side of things, this probably isn't your best choice... it gets 2 stars for effort, the chants, and reaching the level of musicianship past the usual nu-metal trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Standard Hatha Yoga Exercises with Movement","review":"This small book contains 18 yoga postures which are illustrated and described together with the benefits and contraditions of each. The main difference between these hatha yoga exercises and those available in other yoga books - is not in postures, but rather in the way that they are intended to be performed.

Muddy didn't put out any bad songs during this time period, and the fact that this recording contains a number of songs not featured on many other complations proves that. \\"Born lover\\" and \\"mad love\\" are lesser known songs but they stand up well next to the better known \\"hootchie coochie man\\". Great bargain!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Most overrated blues musician","review":"Muddy Waters should be given a lot of credit for essentially being the first major blues figure to use electric guitar and a backup band. However, that doesn't even begin to justify the almost godlike admiration many blues fans have for him. I'm sorry, but I've just never been able to get into the man's music. Granted, \\"Hoochie Coochie Man\\" is a classic, but that's as much for Little Walter's harmonica work as anything else. Also, this is a very poor compilation of his work. They left out most of his best stuff- \\"Just Want to Make Love\\", \\"Got my Mojo Working\\", \\"I'm Ready\\", and \\"Rolling Stone\\" are all superb works by Muddy, and all of them are absent here. It's not that there's anything wrong with his music, in fact much of it is quite good, just don't expect it to live up to the legendary name of Muddy Waters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not strong enough","review":"I bought this for my son along with the Machete.

I haven't been a teenage girl for many years, but when I was that age my friends and I thought it was funny (in a pathetic way) that 30 or 40 something guys thought we might be interested in them.Pedestrian, overblown, unsurprising plot coupled with the weird fixation on teenage cheerleaders make this a very disappointing book. Mr. Iles is talented, but this book doesn't impress."},{"rating":"1","title":"Iles can do better","review":"This novel requires that the readers suspend disbelief. I was appalled at the \\"romance\\" between a middle-aged physician and a 17-year old girl and, additionally, the coy interaction between the baby-sitter and main character. I can't believe I finished it, although the legal wrangling was often interesting. I think there was not enough effort made to make the characters believable - the main character's girlfriend was nothing short of sleazy, which is perhaps an apt description of much of this book. I hope that Iles has done and can do better. Somehow I can't see myself reading another one of his books until the memory of this one fades."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply terrible!","review":"This is one of many Greg Iles books that I have read. I have enjoyed the others, but this was beyond terrible. Cannot recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's done so much better","review":"This novel was juvenile compared to some of Iles' other novels (The Quiet Game, Mortal Fear). It was embarrasssingly weak and at times perverse in its portrayal of the relationships bewteen the characters. It was outrageous for the author (in the end) to throw his support toward the accused (Dr. Elliot) and support sexual relations between a 40 yr. old physician and a 17 year old girl. The story dragged. It had me suspending my belief (and this is fiction!) in that Penn Cage was this quasi-superhero who could leap the tallest building. This story included the fastest-moving rumor mill ever (word travel, of course, by cell phone mostly, from the babysitter, to Penn, to Dr. Elliot's wife, et al. --- simply too much to fathom).This was well below the author's capability. I did not finish this novel, I refused to be a victim to this elementary (probably rushed off to press) writing. Too bad, it could have been much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blame the victim.....","review":"This is the first book I have read by Greg Iles and the last. The running theme seems to be that l7 and 18 year old girls are stalking and lusting after men in their forties. As the story drags on, it is increasingly obvious that Mia is after poor Penn who valiantly attempts to treat her the way he treats his 9 year old daughter. This may be Mr. Iles fantasy, but it is laughable. I got as far as Mia, (18 years old), with her eyes locked on his, asking him (43 years old) to give her another hug but something stops him. I had to give up at that point. I may attempt to finish it one day, but I am sure that Drew (40 years old) will come out of it unpunished and lily white after being victimized and taken advantage of by Kate (17 years old."},{"rating":"2","title":"On The Mark","review":"Greg Iles is a truly gifted writer and one can find certain consistencies in the books that he writes. Save for his first two novels which are well done espionage thrillers, there is the use of his hometown of Natchez, Mississippi as a setting. The characters have great depth and are extremely well developed with a conteporary theme being central to the story line. In this novel, he delves into the complexities of growing up as a High Schooler in the twenty first century. This is done in the confines of a well written mystery with numerous double and triple twists throughout the work. As with many of his books, this seems like a film script with real depth as well as research having existed. This was an excellent and exciting read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"I haven't read a book this bad in years. I skimmed the last 150 pages. The plot develops into a story so unbelievable, it became laughable. I couldn't believe it managed to include not one but two story lines involving hot teenage babysitters attracted to middle age men. Who are these people? I have limited time to read pleasure books so I have to choose very carefully. If you fall into that category - skip this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another 5 stars for Greg Iles","review":"I absolutely loved this book. Greg Iles' writing is *so* vivid that you simply cannot put down his books. However, the only Greg Iles book I do not like is \\"The Footprints of God.\\" Thankfully, all the rest of his works are like \\"Turning Angel\\" in that they are page turners. Great read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to his early work","review":"I had to make myself finish reading Turning Angel. Too many implausible plotlines. He is a great writer and his characters are very real - but not in Turning Angel. His previous books are page turners - not this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Great One For Iles","review":"Despite what some of the other reviewers said, I really liked this book. It was another page turner for me. When I want to read instead of doing anything else, then I know it is a good book! I have read all of Greg Iles books and this one is another winner. I am an ardent fan and will continue to read everything that he writes. I think anyone who reads this book will enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Excellent Read from Greg Iles!!!","review":"Once again I was fascinated by this book and by the writing ability of Greg Iles! I could not put this book down and it's a fairly long book!I loved it and will continue to read the remainder of his books that I have not yet read (I am a new fan) until I am caught up to the current day and waiting for more from Greg Iles!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreck!","review":"I can't get through it and will have to just read the ending. Utter nonsense! If it weren't for the babysitter, Mia, Penn wouldn't have a clue as to what's going on and when he's on his own he's pretty useless. There isn't any character developement and the preachiness is a definite turn off. I wonder if this was written solely to make some residents of Natchez uncomfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Turning Angel???????","review":"I too was a little stumped as to why he called this book Turning Angel, the only thing I could figure was that he had made the reference that any direction you went it seemed that the angel was following you and any time it seemed that there was a fix on who the killer was it turned in a different direction to someone else. Anyway--- I really enjoy reading books by Greg Iles and this one was a page turner but I felt that this book wasn't exactly his greatest it was still a good read it had a lot of suspense!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A real page turner","review":"Not quite as good a Blood Memory and Mortal Fear, but up there with his best. A real page turner, I did nothing today except finish this book. Greg Iles characters are those you would like to meet and would be your friends. I hope he write a sequel, I would like to know what transpires in Penn and Annie's life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another gripping Greg Iles novel....","review":"I can't wait to read the rest of Greg Iles' books....This was great. Fast, disturbing, but couldn't put it down....."},{"rating":"2","title":"NASTINESS IN NATCHEZ","review":"TURNING ANGEL is one of Greg Iles' best books: full of rich detail, strong narrative, absorbing characters and some unexpected twists and turns.Penn Cage, the protagonist from THE QUIET GAME, is back home in Natchez. The town is thrown into a whirlwind when a beautiful and gifted 17 year old student, Kate Townsend, is found brutally murdered and raped. Penn finds that his long time friend, Dr. Drew Elliott, was having an affair with the girl and may be the prime suspect in her death.What appears to be a simple whodunit instead carousels into a provocative look at small city life; drug use and abuse; family betrayals and secrets; politics; racism; murder. There's lots of bodies that pile up and Penn must race against time to prove his friend's innocence.Iles lays all this out with some stunning in-depth looks at how the human psyche works; how the human spirit prevails; and how things aren't always as they seem.I found this one hard to put down and highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous and Insulting to Women","review":"This book was unbelievably bad! I am astounded with all of the positive reviews here. The author seems to be obsessed with older men having sex with teenage girls! Additionally, the plot is painfully contrived - trying to achieve a complicated story, the author just keeps throwing in more muck! This was really trashy - along the lines of romance novels with references to real literature to make it seem as though the book has substance - which it does not. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get this guy a competent editor","review":"This book is about 100 pages too long. Terrible editing,plus way too much repetition and detail. Entire paragraphs could be removed. I am only half way thru and this is a long slog. A very disappointing read. His last 3 books have been bad! Save yourself both time and money - don't buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A solid B / B-","review":"I loved Spandau Phoenix. LOVED it. I guess I was hoping for a fast, exciting thriller. This book wasn't horrible, but there were certainly some questionable moments that seemed a little far fetched even for a fiction book. I prefer Greg Iles focuses back to historical fiction thrillers. A decent 7.5/10."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turning Angel","review":"I was so disappointed in this book. I love murder mysteries but,this one was really lacking. It was repulsive to me I skipped most of it just to see who the murderer ended up being. I felt like I was reading porno, every one in that book was hornie and seemed to think it was alright to act on it. very disturbing how descriptive this book was and how terrible the language was. I was shocked at how bad it was. Maybe Mr. Isles writes that way in all his books. this was my first and my last. I wouldn't recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Turning Angels is my first Greg Iles read and it will be my last","review":"I had heard such great things about Greg Iles and had not read anything by him because murder mysteries are not my genre. Remember, I just owned up to the fact that murder mysteries are not my thing. So, a book has to be good; no, really good; to impress me. However, a friend was so excited about his books and told me that this was just a page turner so I was eager to give it a go.The book is a pot boiler. Truly all that is missing is the kitchen sink. The plot has no depth, teaches us nothing and hopes to convince us that the mere complexity of who could have done it makes it a brilliant book.The murder scene becomes laughable with so many who-done-its right there like they were all invited for a wienie roast.I finished the book and was interested enough to do that. However, I walked away from it wondering why I felt like I had to shake my head and find something to read that would take the bad taste away. This is not a good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"I used to be a fan of Greg Iles but his writing has gone steadily downhill and his most recent novel is really the nadir. The plot is completely contrived and full of implausible developments whose only purpose is to keep the narrative careening along at breakneck speed so that you don't stop to ask whether it makes any sense (which it doesn't). The characters are equally unbelievable, from the overachieving male protagonists whose lack of common sense makes you wonder how they tie their shoes in the morning to the vapid, Ivy League-bound coeds whose sole fictional purpose seems to be to satisfy the wet dreams of Mr. Iles and his middle-aged readers. Underlying it all is a leering voyeurism that makes the self-congratulatory moralizing of the narrator seem completely fraudulent. If you want cheap thrills tarted up as \\"unflinching realism,\\" save your money and watch the OC."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps You Guessing","review":"I'm only half-way into the book, but I like the style and plot. Somewhere between a Grisham and a Patterson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, BUT...","review":"I agree with most of what others have said in their reviews; this book is difficult to put down, has a great, brisk pace, and it will keep you guessing. But, the only problem I had was reading the excerpts from Kate's diary and the dialogue between Penn and his teenage babysitter, Mia. I had a hard time believing that teenagers really write and speak the way they do in Turning Angel. ESPECIALLY, the sexual content. It kind of reminded me of the bad pornography out there i.e. what a male wishes a woman would want and not what a woman really finds erotic. At the end of the book he thanks some teenagers for helping him by giving their perspective so who knows, this could be real stuff (scarey thought). Otherwise, it is an excellent read as are ALL of his books. Greg Iles is always a sure bet!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Be your own Mark Foley","review":"Thoughful male protagonists? If you are a forty-ish man who fantasizes about being seduced by his sexually experienced 17-year-old babysitter, who likes it rough, this novel will titillate you.

This was not. The book was too long, the plot rambling, and the characters undeveloped foils to Penn Cage's ego. Less is more in many things, a rule that should have been applied to the overabundant description of explicit sexual exploits.

But after opening it and dicovering how boring it was, my hopes faltered. I still gave it a go though and a couple of hours later when I finally got ready to start writing whether it was actually good enough as a play, my problems started. Bearing in mind that it was written 2500 years ago, i was intrigued that a play could last for so long. But honestly, thats where my interest stopped. It's lenghthy and dull, and although I know that it is a very historical and precise play, I just couldn't follow it.

I've had this album since it's original release and I think it's a waste of space but if you are into collecting cd's by Schenker as I am you will want this just to have your collection complete but it's not even worth my time to take it out of the case and put it into my cd player.

Hell, I'll even put in a Britney Spears cd before this junk and that's saying quite alot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"intense -- not a book to forget","review":"I loved this book. It reads well and feels real. I agree with one of the reviewers: this is the kind of book you live in, and then it is difficult to leave it. I thought about it a long time after I finished it, then I went back and re-read some of my favorite passages, such as Salaamat painting his buses or Dia at her farm. Given the sad turn their lives take at the end, these moments seem all the more precious when you relive them. And that is what a great book makes you do: want to go back."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap shots","review":"I will grant you that the writing is good....therefore 2 stars. The story itself is a rambling mess. The ending is just pathetic.Incest???? Give me a break. I really took offense at the authors attempt to sneak her anti war and anti American rhetoric into the story line.She did not have any facts to back up her case and left just enough information to leave an impression. The story nevercame together except the ridulous ending of the siblings. I was really disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than an inspiration","review":"First, let me comment on the fantastic cover. The bright colors and sharp design alone kept me returning to the content. :)There is nothing complicated about this book. It's a simple read -- Dr. Jeremiah's style is casual and encouraging, not at all intimidating as you might think a book written by a Bible scholar would be. It is practical and down-to-earth, but also exciting and stimulating. It cheers the reader on like a football coach on the day of the championship. And at the end I was ready to run off the sidelines and on to victory! I recommend this book to everyone who desires a fuller, more passionate life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Commentary Mark's Gospel","review":"This is an outstanding product.

She was WANTED for murder.4 out of 5 book club members thought the book deserved 1 star. One member says \\"In The beginning, she keeps talking about her nails, she doesn't get to the point .\\" One member thought it was suspenseful.I recommend this book for people who likes mysteries.

I have to admit, I didn't really get into it until I read a few chapters. But towards the ending it gets so exhilarating! I would have never guessed the ending; it was great fun trying, though! There are some points where you think, \\"She's never going to get out of this!\\" but she's usually smart enough to escape anything that happens to her.There were also some times where you are thinking, \\"Why did she do that?!

Well... not EVERYTHING, but... well... read this story and you'll know what I mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wanted/ a kid's review","review":"Wanted is a great book if you like mysteries. It's about a girl whose father has told her to take the Corvette which is her father's favorite car, and drive it to the place where she loves to get milkshakes. The only problem is she is only 15 years old. Oh yeah, and she's also accused of killing her father, too. This story is an excellent attention grabber.

It was very presictable and I just wanted it to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda Dull","review":"I like her music but I don't think I'd like her as a person. She seems to have a tendency blame everyone for her troubles but herself. For this to be a tell-all book, she just glossed over the fact that the members of her group sued her. She simply blamed that on Motown. Ms. Reeves claims to be a born-again Christian but it's hard to believe that when you read about her feelings toward the late Tammi Terrell. I had read in another book that the 'women' of Motown were jealous of Tammi but judging from this memoir, Martha seems to be the culprit. I'm glad I got this book off ebay for a low price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dancing in the Street","review":"I wish the book had a better cover...

If you need to buy a new battery, better pay a little more for an original Samsung, this one's not worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"works great","review":"This battery works great. It fits perfectly. And holds its charge well. The only downside is that because of its paper covering it is a little harder than the original to remove if you want to switch batteries.

I was sorely disappointed. The original, charming and careful illustrations have been replaced in this reprint with some terribly sloppy, cartoonish goop. Some of the animals in the illustrations are unrecognizable because the illustrations are, in my opinion, just a bunch of misshapen globs. Several times while I was reading this book, my 5-year old twins would ask me to explain to them what the picture was. Aside from just being downright ugly, the new, sloppy illustrations don't fit with the carefully chosen wording of the text. I'm going to track down a copy of the original edition and would urge anyone else to do the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rhyme Holds Up After All These Years","review":"This book was a childhood favorite, and my son has my well-worn copy. When I heard it was going to be reprinted, I immediately made a list of all the kids I know who need a copy of their own. I give this version 4 stars ONLY because of the new pictures. I am disappointed that the illustrations have been re-done by George Booth, but that is my only criticism of the re-print, and it's probably unfair. The original pictures are burned into my memory as the real deal. The kids to whom I've given this new version are delighted-- they never knew a different set of illustrations, and they find the rhymes as silly and fun as I did all those years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Art work iffy","review":"I had the original book when I was little.

Absolutely horrendous string buzz on every string, This guitar inexplicably has an extra fret, most guitars do not have a fret right next to the nut, but this one does. What's even worse is that when you fret the first or second fret, the same note plays?!? I've been playing guitar for 20 years and trust me, this guitar is worse than most toy guitars. Stay far away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the product advertised","review":"The guitar is listed as a 3/4 size. When we brought it to a local music store to have a string replaced.

I knew the sound quality wasn't going to be great but I was NOT expecting the painful buzzing and twanging this guitar inflicted on us. I thought we'd at least be able to tune the guitar to itself if not to the true E-B-G-D-A-E of a proper instrument but again was totally wrong!

Arrived quickly, which was nice and unexpected. Tried to tune and the 5th string (lower A) had a horrible buzz. Popped the bridge pin to make sure the string was seated correctly, checked the bridge, nut, everything reasonably possible, still a bad buzzing sound on just this one string. There was also a bunch of loose wood debris inside the body. I wasn't expecting perfection for this price, but it's obvious no one made any attempt to determine the playability of this guitar before shipping. It's being returned and replaced with another brand, yet to be determined."},{"rating":"2","title":"My grand daughter loves it","review":"I have played guitar for over 30 years now, my grand daughter (8 yrs old) thinks its cool and wanted a acoustic guitar.

However, the book never really answers the question: What exactly *is* Symbolism?After hundreds of pages of pseudo-erudition, I'm still not any wiser than before reading the book. There seems to be a total disconnect between the text and the paintings analyzed, nor do the works of art seem to have much in common with each other. And what on earth are the Pre-Raphaelites doing in this volume? Were they Symbolists? Nor do I understand the difference between Symbolism and Modernism, except that the artwork of the latter is even uglier.If you want a colourful volume of ugly, incomprehensible art, I'm sure you are going to like \\"Symbolism\\". Otherwise, you might as well skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard Goth Rock","review":"Definetly, in my opinion, one of the 90's greatest unknown metal albums. The band blends melodic hard rock with heavier sections with full attention paid to the entire audio spectrum (especially the bass), and while we're on the subject, this is a metal album that features bass guitar. Unusual but carried out with a finesse not usually associated with this genre. It's obvious the guys in the band have great chops, but they tend to rely on strong songwriting and anthemic hooks rather than extending extended solo instrumental parts. Songs like B.A.M.F. (you figure it out)and Devil's Lobotomy show that there may be a sense of humor beneath the nightmarish lyrics and goth-inspired art. All in all, this album is equivalent to riding a rollercoaster on the night before Halloween. Scary, fun and exhilarating.

The stage, the colorful scenery and the Ukrainian folkloric designs are beautifully done. The ballet and the Cossacks are delightful. As for the music, with better singers it could have been somehow better. The biggest disappoint is Grivnov's Vakula. His voice is not big enough for this role and it gets lost. A stronger and fuller voice would have been much better. Still, the overall production is entertaining and nice.

The two parts that I found most applicable to my own coaching clients were his step-by-step approach to coaching executives and the part on creating a \\"laboratory\\" that fosters collaboration within a group. I was able to bring these principles to a client who was wowed by what we were able to generate for her business. I would recommend this book to any coach, internal and external to a company, as well as to any leader who wants to create an \\"impossible future.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaders as coaches","review":"Not a difficult book to read on the importance of coach's influence inside of organizations and their need for commitment and vision. Starting with a definition of what Hargrove terms a transformational coach and their responsibilities he uses quotes, examples, and case studies to demonstrate his ideas of an effective coach.At times the word coach could be translated to leader or leadership whether in a corporation, military, or other endeavor, however his predominate use of the word is that of mentor. He portrays this person as a master at working with others to create change, collaboration, action, and above all vision.His simple graphics and tables give a simple outline view of his major points making them very clear to the reader.

Once the wire was past the crust, it cut well enough until it got to the other side at which point it started to tear the cake up rather than slice through it.

He is careful to point out pitfalls in practicing the disciplines, especially legalism, which incorrectly makes the disciplines and end in and of themselves.His interpretation of the meaning of each discipline for the Christian life is scriptually sound. His chapter on submission is particularly profound in it's explanation of true Christian submission which places both husband and wife on an equal playing ground.I highly recommend this book for anyone, Christian or otherwise, who is seeking to grow spiritually and would like to know how they can integrate these disciplines into their daily life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Celebration of Discipline","review":"I am afraid that this book is leading many astray. These \\"disciplines\\" are not prescribed in the Word of God. There is mysticism all throughout this writing. \\"Disciplines\\" of any type are not a means of grace. Grace is given in Christ through salvation. We are told to \\"grow in the grace and knowledge of Jesus Christ\\". We are never commanded to ask for more grace nor are we commanded to do spiritual activities to be \\"means\\" of receiving God's grace. This book is highly misleading to the believer in Christ. If one accepts the presupposition of \\"earning more grace\\" then you are hooked. Foster has a Quaker and Catholic and philosophy background and this is evident to the discerning mind.

But if you have anything other than a king size bed...don't buy this product. We have a queen size and there was absolutely no room for my husband and I to move around in after this was in bed with us. Plus, my son grew so quickly that he outgrew this thing 3 weeks after he was born. It was a nice idea...but not very practical for parents who weren't getting much sleep anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not useful for some babies","review":"My advice - keep the box and receipt. We decided we wanted to co-sleep before my first son was born. This seemed like the safest solution. He hated it!!! The first two nights we tried it, he absolutely cried when we laid him in it. The mattress is hard, and I have to imagine it doesn't smell anything like mom, so he was very unhappy. He also hated his bassinet. He slept next to me for the first 10 months of his life - then moved to a crib in our room for the next 8 months. My only point is that some kids need closer contact with mom than this allowed. I'm now expecting my 2nd and looking at co-sleepers, but won't throw out the box or receipt."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money","review":"I found this to be a waste of money. Unless you have a king size bed then you may find it useful. In a queen bed it takes up so much room that my husband and I were literally falling of the edges of our respective sides.

Otherwise a big thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"All I have to say is this is the worst item that I bought my 12 week old wouldn't sleep in it and it was very hard and took up alot of space in our bed I wouldn't suggest buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sleep positioners dangerous/Not good for wigglers","review":"This seemed like a great idea for co-sleeping in theory. However, in practice it didn't turn out to be so useful. First, the sleep positioners seem dangerous. We were careful to position her with her arms above the sleep positioners thinking that would prevent her from her body sliding down. We woke one morning to find that our 3 week old daughter had wiggled her body downward and turned her head so that her face directly up against the positioner. We were worried that she could have suffocated. After that incident I did research at the national SIDS website. The SIDS website strongly discourages the use of sleep positioners. Secondly, our daughter was such a wiggle-worm. She frequently wiggled out the bottom which made the snuggle nest useless. Thirdly, it did not make breastfeeding in bed any easier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps Baby Safe And Snug","review":"My husband and I bought this when our daughter was about 1 month old because we wanted her to be in bed with us. It was great because I stopped fearing that I would roll over her. When she was 2 months old, I transitioned her into the bassinet, but kept her in the Snuggle Nest inside the bassinet. It helped her make the change seamlessly. At 4 months, we put her in her own crib and mainly because she is a very active sleeper, we put the Snuggle Nest in the crib to keep her secure. Finally, at 5 months she has truly grown out of it. For our family, the Snuggle Nest was worth the money. I'm keeping it for our next baby. The only downside I could see would be that it does take up a good deal of room on the bed. It might be hard to get used to if you do not have a king-sized bed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not like it","review":"Although the concept for the snuggle nest is a great idea, I felt like the product could use much improvement. I tried it out with my two week old and didn't feel comfortable using it with her now, let alone as she got bigger and more mobile. The sides didn't come down far enough...when she started to wake up and fuss I felt like her little legs were starting to come off the mattress. And it wasn't easy to get her out of the bed in the middle of the night. I had to almost kneel on my bed to comfortably pick her up. The bed also takes up a lot of room in your bed, I have a king size bed and couldn't imagine placing this thing in anything smaller. I did not feel like this product was worth the $50 to last such a short time, for that kind of money I expect something with a little more quality to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"I love this product.

We call the nursery @ the hospital & asked them why? They told us to have him sleep w/ us. We did & it worked. He got some sleep but I didn't. I felt it was too dangerous. So my husband foud this Snuggle Nest & bought it. It took up so much space in the bed, it was also very hard & very dangerous! Suffication waiting to happen. My son hated it. He would rather sleep alone than sleep in this thing. We returned it. It is also VERY HOT. Everytime he slept in it he woke up soaked in sweat. Save your money.

We spent over $300.00 in cash buying things for my baby who is on the way. When we brought it home and opened the box, it was not wrapped in plastic, the DVD was missing and it had a stain on it. Also the matress is too hard for a newborn to sleep in. It looked like it had been used and brought back to the store. I went to the store to return or exchange it and Babies R Us refused to take it back! They said that they could not accept something in that condition. They sold it to me that way! My baby isn't even born yet so how could I have possibly used it. Now I am stuck with a $49.99 snuggle nest that I can't use.

But when we did use it, it served it's purpose...giving us peace of mind when our son was in between us. We have a queen size bed & it was a bit tight having it in between us...but since the sides of it are so strong, I did not have to worry about rolling over onto my baby, so I did not care.If the sheet got dirty, I put a pillow case over the pad instead, while it was in the wash, & it fit perfectly.I was a little disappointed that the attachable nightlight was broken when we opened the package but we did not really need it anyway.Overall, I think it's a good product that served it purpose. I plan on saving it & using it for our next baby."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not practical for co-sleeping","review":"I read great reviews about the Snuggle Nest and had high hopes. I was, however, disappointed. It takes up a great deal of room in the bed-- my husband and I have a king-sized bed and we are average sized, but we barely had room to turn over!Additionally, the main reason I wanted to co-sleep was to make nighttime nursing easier. With the Snuggle Nest's \\"walls,\\" I still had to sit up and lift my daughter out to feed her . . . defeating half the purpose! Eventually I ditched the Nest altogether and my daughter slept in the crook of my arm. We slept much better, and my husband and I had room to wiggle!It is a good product to use for naps and such when the baby has the bed to herself, but it can only be used until she can roll over anyway . . . for me, a product that only works part of the time for only a few months isn't worth the $50 price tag."},{"rating":"2","title":"great little bed","review":"My daughter isn't even a week old yet but I am extremely happy I bought this bed. My husband was a bit against co-sleeping because he was afraid he'd roll onto the baby but after buying this he realized that that we could still co-sleep with her being safe. This bed has helped up put our minds at ease knowing she is close to us especially since she was 5lb 3oz at birth and jaundice. Seeing your baby under those UV lights for 26 hours makes you never want her to more then an arms reach.We are also going to be traveling 8 hours away to a wedding in two months and there is no way I'd ever put my baby on a hotel bed. Hopefully the trip will be more pleasant because she will feel comfortable still sleeping in her own bed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very useful","review":"I registered for this thinking that I could use it for overnight trips. I actually used it the first two weeks after I got home from the hospital. I had an unplanned c-section and the bassinet I got required me to get out of bed and stand up in order to pick up my baby. This snuggle nest was my saving grace. I didn't feel comfortable enough having my newborn sleep right next to me but I felt he was much safer being in the snuggle nest. I will still bring this with me for overnight trips since it is so light. I also love the little battery operated night light it comes with.

This led me to evaluate the HLS series when I was forced to leave my existing system behind on moving to the USA.The HLS615 in an exceptionally good sounding speaker. Not only does the horn system add that directional punch, but the midrange is rich and warm as well. These speakers are ported on the back and deserve to be placed at least 3 feet in front of a wall to maximise bass response.Overall a great speaker for the price, either for audio or home theatre applications."},{"rating":"2","title":"No evil 'sucralose', thank goodness!","review":"Many energy drinks contain the artificial sweetener 'sucralose', which causes me migraines and makes me lethargic.

Or buy 2 for $4.00 deal at the local gas station. Great idea buying in bulk if you consume a can per day. Plus it makes me perform better in bed which is a bonus. Red Bull gives you boner...I mean wings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget wholesalers","review":"Forget wholesalers like Costco.

When I went to get some cans today, 7 of the 12 remaining cans had leaked at least half their contents, leaving behind a moldy mess. I also had to toss several other food items that I had stored next to the red bull because they were also covered in mold. The cans are still more than two months from their expiration date.

It's not something I would consider using in the longterm as a way of boosting my energy levels.Fellow amazon users might be keen to try a product called Gene Eden.

Are there many people like him out there? I think that the answer might be yes. All in all, this is a quite sad and pathetic story about a heavily flawed person with a not quite likable and understanding wife, lousy job choices, bad decisions and goofy friends and foes. The whole story is a bit far-fetched and strung-out. Still quite readable since D.K. is a very good author who can write well if he really wants to."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun Read, If You Try Not to Think Too Much","review":"Douglas Kennedy is great a taking an arrogant yuppie, and bringing him down a few pegs, and does a great job here. For some reason, it's fun to see Ned Allen's high-style life fall apart, and then watch him try to hold it together. One big quibble: Any time the protagonist or anyone else flew somewhere (South or East or out of the Country) Kennedy would always mention in the book that it was an American Airlines flight. Even a flight to Cayman is on American Eagle. It was so distracting, at one point, for no reason, Ned is asked, \\"Are you flying Delta\\" and he says, \\"no, American.\\" I thought maybe the airline figured into the plot later, but now, having finished the book, I'm wondering if Kennedy received a stipend from the airline!Otherwise, it was a quick, fun, page-turning read, and ironically, I finished the book while flying an American flight from Boston to LA, so maybe the subliminal messages worked!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disjointed","review":"The ending was a downer - let's start with that.And rule #1 of your basic good vs. evil morality play was violated: good villains.

Here's hoping the next one is better."},{"rating":"2","title":"It could happen to you","review":"I really enjoyed this book. The plot was fast moving and exciting.

Poor Ned had so much go wrong all at once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great beach/airplane book","review":"I read this book on a recent vacation in about 2.5 days. Great literature it's not, but a great page-turner it is, especially if you've ever been in sales or worked in a big company. The style reminds me of early Sydney Sheldon or Irwin Shaw - fast paced and fun to read in that you really want to find out what comes next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kennedy touches all the bases","review":"As a thriller, this book is certainly serviceable, albeit formulaic. Kennedy knows how to set up a scenario. Halfway through the book, I found myself empathizing with Ned. But the pacing of the last half of the book was off, as if Kennedy got tired of his own story."},{"rating":"2","title":"i really enjoyed this book. entertaining!","review":"i enjoyed this book very much and mite give it a 5 star except i felt the last quarter of the book seemed rushed. it was missing something. stil it was a good read. i live in greenwich and enjoyed reading a book partially set in my backyard. i never read doug k. before but i will try another of his books."},{"rating":"1","title":"a grisham wanna be","review":"The book was actually good but a kind of played out storyline.

A likable protagonist, even though at times you want to thump him on the head and say, \\"Ned!! Ned!!\\" \\"Ned, WHAT are you doing?\\" I enjoyed this book and would reccomend it to anyone who wants to read pure entertainment...with a twist. Also, an FYI to my fellow reviewer, 'Martina,' American Airlines just happens to own 85% of all gates in the Carribean market, as well as many places the character Ned traveled to throughout the novel. As an frequent traveler, I was actually thrilled to see an author be very accurate in his information and not simply create flights that do not exist in real life."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Enjoyable, Quick Read (But A Dumb Ending)","review":"I felt Kennedy did a great job of developing the characters. The glimpse into the high-stakes, fast-paced world of advertising, sales, and Manhattan life was very interesting. This is truly \\"Death of a Salesman\\" for the 90s. You will breeze through the protagonist's rise and fall; I truly pitied his character, because he could easily be me if I were to make some less than optimal (but not necessarily \\"bad\\") decisions. I must agree with many of the other reviews I read here on Amazon: the ending is bad! I had to reread the last chapter just to make sense of this ending, and it is still a stretch. It almost feels as if he was in a rush to finish the book and tried to put together this over-the-top, suspenseful, thriller ending. Problem: it just does not work."},{"rating":"1","title":"not close to \\"The Big Picture\\"","review":"more detail on the business aspects on \\"the job\\" would have added some intrigue... rather than Ned's pathetic personal problems which grew tiresome and predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thin plaguarism of the real world mixed with the Book of Job","review":"If you are familiar with ComputerWorld and the life of Donald Trump, you can skip the first 100 pages as their details are replayed under a thin disguise. Let's face it, the purpose of this type of light-weight fiction is to be mind-candy, but if you are looking to escape the real world you have come to the wrong book. A few overplayed archtypical characters gives the book the little depth that it has."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 un-connected books and a painfully contrived close","review":"2 main points - one Ned is a seller but hypocritcially resents it when others sell (at huge profit) the companies that provide him with a job. Two, the last 50 pages are so clumsy and obvious that the editor of this book should be ashamed. Tjhe book 'The Ax' (Westlake) is much sharper at projecting the angry soul of the 'lost the job' survivor. The book is brilliantly readable and eminantly forgettable because Kennedy forgets that coherence is a pre-requisite and that 'from sociological tome ' to 'thriller' doesnt work when the latter is tagged on. The love scene with Debbie doesnt work at all.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for a quick read","review":"A good quick holiday read.

The scent, on the other hand, was too medicine-like. It worked VERY quickly to alleviate itch but the smell was too much. I expected it to be scentless because of its clear color.

This album long out of print is finally available again so we can revisit his wonderful rock and funk renderings.

The center channel speaker is identical to the satellites for seamless pans, with two midranges for extra power and clarity in the dialog channel, but is configured for horizontal placement on top of many televisions. The satellite and center speakers are all video-shielded for placement near a television.

Talbott makes references that are hard to relate to modern word. In the first few chapters he tries to equate situtations with equations. He makes references to further chapters and his other book instead of giving straight-forward examples ie. \\"I explain this in chapter...\\" and he does that very very often. You might find yourself re-reading much of the material to even get a sense of what is going on. Many of the sentences are lenghty, run-on and fill with sophiticated words, so be ready with a dictionary nearby.

The basic premise of an unpopular teenager gaining revenge on his tormentors via a projection of his unconscious mind has been done much better by other writers. The characters in Grant's novel would not be out of place in a grade-z teen slasher flick. There is the unpopular kid, the school bullies, the stuck-up beauty, and the self-absorbed parents who have no idea what is going on in their son's life. They are all totally one-dimensional, and their actions are frequently illogical & inexplicable. Worst of all, the story lacks any type of resolution.This was a very unsatisfying book, one that I did not enjoy at all. It was the first, and only, book I ever read by Charles Grant.

The romance between La Contessa and the ship doctor is the best of all. Werner and Signoret bring warmth and world-weary acceptance to their brief affair. Lee Marvin and Michael Dunn provide comedic contrast in their individual disabilities and perspectives. Jose Grecco's dance troupe provides true dancing entertainment, and cynacism at the same time. Jose Ferrar offers a truly terrifying and funny portrait of the Nazi era to come. George Segal and Elizabeth Ashley are just annoying.

Never mind that she lacked a great voice: what mattered were the slammin' house BEATS, provided by Maryland-based DJs the Basement Boys. It's tempting to dismiss Miss Waters as a one-hit-wonder, but the truth of the matter is, she released a string of radio/club hits like \\"Makin' Happy,\\" \\"Gypsy Woman,\\" \\"100% Pure Love,\\" and so forth. Crystal Waters was one of the few club/dance divas that mattered, and this CD will make a nice addition to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just try NOT to dance when you listen to this album","review":"Crystal Waters has a great voice and great producers to have made such a wonderful body of work that is all highlighted on this Greatest Hits album.The album gets you dancing and singing for over an hour, all the while, broadening all musical horizons. She creates great songs for the dancing fool and making the sad happy again. These songs lift up the weary soul. Just try and NOT dance and sing when you listen to this album.

Hopefully, more \\"best of\\" collections will come from the team that put this one together!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"100 'best' it ain't","review":"I bought this book to read to my wife; we are both greatly disappointed. While the variety is broad, many of the poems are bizarre and difficult to understand the relationship between the author's selection, and the topic of love. I had hoped for and expected that a \\"100 Best\\" collection would have wonderful examples of the expression of love. That's not what this book is about. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Promises a lot, but fails to deliver","review":"After 300 pages of growing suspense and confusion, the final explanation for everything seems a little tacked on, to be frank. The entire story, until the final 10 pages or so, pulls very strongly at our desire to believe what is happening, but as far as conspiracy theories go, the eventual explanation seems a little too convenient as if every loose thread was picked up in a half-hazard sort of way. The book draws you in, irresistibly so, and that is definitely the book's strong suit. I found myself periodically putting down the book just to try out various explanations, to see if they worked, to see if it accounted for all the little twists and turns. It gets at you and is worth it for that. However, the ending doesn't live up to the suspense created by the rest of the novel, and indeed, it doesn't jive with the rest of the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good! It reads like a Hitchcock movie","review":"I found this at my local library I since I am a Matheson fan I gave it a try. It is very reminescint of Hitchcock's falsey accused man on the run theme.

I was, therefore very disappointed by this work. There are so many plot twists and instances of the hero being drugged and knocked out, that it becomes sort of silly. I wondered if the author was trying to spoof Robert Ludlum stories or just didn't have any new ideas. Those constant plot twists and perils reminded me of the old \\"serialized\\" thrillers from the '40s and '50s. I really had to work to get through this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Matheson","review":"I picked this up from the library a few days ago and read it through within a few hours. It was an enjoyable read. Matheson has a knack for creating impossible situations and building suspense throughout. The actions scenes are fun and fast-paced. I also found the explanation in the end quite satisfying. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard To Believe Matheson Wrote This Book","review":"I don't review books very often, but this book is so terrible, that I almost feel compelled to do so.Richard Matheson is a great writer, and if you look at the front of this book, you'll see quite a few 5 star reviews by famous authors. That's what got me to read this book.Unfortunately, this must be one of the worst books I have ever read. I find it unbelievable that the same person who wrote I AM LEGEND wrote this; it's simply full of terribly writing. The plot is weak; the main character is extremely annoying, and the love interest is hard to buy, as well. What made her fall in love with him? Why?Whatever you do, don't waste your time reading this."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst","review":"This is one of the worst books I've ever read. I read it while I was in the hospital, and after about 80 pages, I realized that I would rather stare at the ceiling than continue reading this book.

However, the other songs on the CD don't really appeal to me. You have to be a fan of Hawaian music, and I didn't know whether I was or not (I have not visited Hawa yet) but clearly I am not. I am not saying this is a bad CD. I am sure those who like Hawaian-style music will love it.

I immediately logged on to amazon.com and ordered it. I don't care much for the rest of the album, but 'Somewhere Over The Rainbow...\\" is absolutely special and beautiful. I would happily pay twice or three times the price of the album for that song alone. I am rating it as 5 stars because the medley alone is easily worth the cost of the entire album. And who knows? You might enjoy the other songs, too..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Took some getting used to, but .....","review":"I now consider this cd one of my all-time favorites. I bought the cd under an Amazon review that this is the cd to buy if you have never purchased an IZ cd before. That was some great advice. I first purhased his music because of the classic, \\"Somewhere Over the Rainbow,\\" track found in movies and various tv drama series. Now, I listen to each song on the CD and just relax.

He has one of the most heavenly voices I have ever heard. Many people have commented on how sad it is to have lost a wonderful musical talent. After listening to his music, do yourself a favor and take the time to learn about braddah IZ. You'll realize that he was much more than just a great entertainer.

Auwe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Iz Facing Future","review":"This is the first time I have ever heard anything by Israel. Like many others I was looking for his version 'Over The Rainbow' not knowing who sang it. I found it here on Amazon and ordered this cd after reading all the positive reviews. When I received it I listened to it for about 3 hours. Just beautiful. I especially love the 2nd song, Ka Huila Wai. I never tire of hearing it.

The story of Israel was even more interesting than finding the recording. What a talent taken too young. I will warn you if you want Facing Future primarily for Somewhere it appears it was a concert cut and IZ has a dedication name of Gabby on the front end and an unusual vocal close out. I want to use the recording for family pictures etc and I did not expect this. I'll bet he has it on another album with a clean cut from a recording studio. The rest of Facing Future is in his native language but it is still enjoyable....what a voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is one fabulous CD!!","review":"This CD is worth having in your CD Collection.

This man was 800 pounds before his death and yet his mighty fingers play his beloved little ukulele effortlessly. This features one of the most widely recognized remakes of \\"Somewhere Over the Rainbow/What A Wonderful World\\" today. Heard on Etoys commercials, Meet Joe Black Soundtrack and ER, it's taken on a life of it's own. There's also a great remake of \\"Take Me Home Country Road\\" with a Hawaiian twist. A sentimental favorite is \\"Hawaii \`78\\" which is a tale of what the ali'i (royalty) would think of modern day Hawaii. Words cannot express the wonderful things I have to say about this piece of musical genius. If you like Hawaiian music or just love a good, sweet melody...Facing Future is the right choice for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have","review":"I was introduced to Brother Iz while in Hawaii last month...what a wonderful sound!!

Iz did a wonderful job at incorporating his native culture into the music. I plan to check out some of his older albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"IZ THE GREATEST","review":"The melodic diversity of IZ is to behold.

His untimely death in 1997 was a national day of mourning, and rightly so. His work, not just in Hawaiian music, but also in keeping the Hawaiian heritage and culture alive, gives inspiration to all, and this collection of songs gives a great window into a truly legendary performer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely captures spirit of Hawaii and a man gone too soon","review":"I love Hawaii and much of its music. When I first heard Israel sing, I knew I had to collect all of his music. His voice is so sweet, his lyrics so meaningful, his ukelele so perfect. We heard his music when we were in Hawaii and listening to KPOA on Maui. Even though Israel is gone, his spirit still lives on through his wonderful music. Many times I listen to it and it calms and soothes me and makes me very happy. It's almost as if I am in Hawaii, for his music captures a spirit of aloha from the Islands. The world is a sad place without Israel, however we will always have his music to remember him by. Imagine my surprise when I heard \\"Over the Rainbow\\" at the end of the movie Meet Joe Black! How perfect! If you are contemplating buying this CD, do it! If you love Hawaii, you will be happy you did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Aside from 1-2 tracks, it was a disappointment","review":"I bought this CD for my Mom thinking she would like Izzy's voice. With the exception of the \\"What a Wonderful World\\" cover, the rest of the tunes were a big disappointment. His voice may have been nice and calming but I don't need to hear tracks of him \\"talking\\". It's my own fault for not listening closer to the sample tracks but if you've heard his cover tune on the radio, I'd recommend buying that single track and save the rest of your money for something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"IZ Facing Future","review":"Very touching, well done CD.

IZ was responsible for introducing me to the world of Pacific Islander music, and it is now all that I listen to.

I hope his music recieves all of the recognition he and it deserves. May he rest in peace."},{"rating":"2","title":"IZ touches the heart of what Hawaiian music is all about.","review":"I grew up in Hawaii and my wife and I visit the islands every year. Often I yearn for the laid back music of Hawaii and when I do I always include IZ. His sound represents the holiness and spiritual bond Hawaiians have with their culture.

I feel like I made a \\"Find\\" with IZ and \\"Facing Future\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Tender, melodic, beautiful music that captures Hawaii","review":"I was introduced to \\"Brudda Iz\\" while in Hawaii on my honeymoon and immediately fell in love. That such a soaring, gentle voice could come from such a huge man playing such a small instrument is amazing. I've heard nothing before or since that so captures the feel of what Hawaii is - what it was to me, anyway. Even his songs sung in his native Hawaiian, which I couldn't understand a bit of, were equally beautiful. The highlight of this disc, however, is Iz's now classic take on Somewhere Over the Rainbow/What a Beautiful World. I don't think that any song can match it for sheer emotion and feeling. Buy this CD and find yourself surprised to know how to say his real name, but to know him only as \\"Brudda Iz.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifully simple","review":"This beautiful clear voice gives me goosebumps, especially Hawaii '78.

His work with the Makaha Sons of Ni'hau, available right here at Amazon, are priceless. Check out \\"Na Mele Henoheno Na Makahiki\\" a \\"best of\\" compilation from this group's first three albums. When searching here, just type in: Makaha Sons, in the artist box and you'll find more of this incredible music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Voice of an Angel","review":"My husband and I recently spent 11 days in Oahu and it was then we kept hearing about this man \\"Iz\\". After much searching we were able to find the CD \\"Facing Future\\" and bought it and took it back to listen to. We listened to it everyday and I was immediately hooked. What a voice! Normally this would not be my kind of music but it was so peaceful and fun - even though I could not understand many of the words. Now that we are back home I put on my \\"Iz\\" cd every night when I go to bed and I actually wake up in a good mood and I have never been a morning person. Am sorry that I never heard of him before his death but he definitely made a wonderful contribution during his time on earth.

But the rest of the CD is excellent as well. Hawai'i '78 is so melodic and heartfelt. I wish I knew what IZ was saying in Hawaiian. I have been listening to this CD constantly and now my two sisters and their children all hooked as well. They had both been to Hawaii and said that IZ's music evokes the island so well. I'm sure they're right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gives Goose Bumps","review":"What a voice for a big man. He will be missed forever, but his voice keeps his spirit alive in this fantastic CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice for a change.","review":"This is definitely a change for me in my choice of music, but I enjoyed it.

I found that Iz's clear voice was soothing and pleasant."},{"rating":"2","title":"IZ voice of the people","review":"hi from the beautiful land of ItalyI think Israel Kamakawiwo'ole ( the fearless eyes the bold face) had a magic touch in his voice and in the way he was able to improvise and rearrange all the songs he sang. the story behind the medley that changed the world is quite interesting ..it is on his biography that Amazon sells as well called: IZ voice of the people. in short: he called the studio in the middle of the night saying he had something in mind and he absolutely had to record it .. he was so persistent and sweet that the producer agreed so he went to the studio, sat down with his Ukulele played 4 songs ( over the rainbow/wonderful world was one of them) and then he said: now I'm tired.. and he left... and that is the version we all love... I think this shows his genius his talent, how big he was and he will always be. long live Israel Kamakawiwo'ole and please check all his music he was simply astonishing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth listening to","review":"I bought this CD just for the Over the Rainbow track but found all the other tracks good to listen to even though most are not in English.

It is still an important CD to have in a Hawaiian music collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear, Pure Sound from a True Artist","review":"This is an absolutely beautiful album. If you're just buying it for Somewhere Over the Rainbow/What a Wonderful World, like I did, you will be overwhelmingly surprised. IZ's voice is so clear and pure and beautiful - you will swear you are on the beach on (your favorite island) in Hawaii with a drink in one hand and the sunset in front of you. But it's more than that - it's a social commentary on the history of the islands and a pride so deep and strong, it's inspiring. We Californians can only dream of feeling so loyal to our home state. Once you buy your first IZ album, you will be hooked for life. He is an amazing artist!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this CD","review":"There will never be another singer like Bruddah IZ. His voice and music just touches my soul. Whenever I feel I would like to take a vacation, but it's just not possible, I put in one of his CDs and take a mini-vacation in my mind. It's relaxing, soothing, upbeat, and uplifting. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lovely","review":"I first heard this song by IZ \\"Somewhere Over the Rainbow\\" at the end of the movie \\"Fifty First Dates\\" and I liked it.

I love the music and the way he put the 2 songs together, it's very soothing and Israel had a wonderful voice. This is one of those tunes that stays in my head forever.

I was not overly impressed because of his size. I bought this CD because I just wanted to remember him. I was totally shocked at the RECORDING - shocked to tears because the CD has caught the magnificense of his amazing VOICE! Yes, I was prejudiced by his size, but this CD is only the start of amassing a collection of a voice so full of love and his love of Hawaii.

It never fails to relax me and put a smile on my face - it brings me right back to that beautiful setting. I especially love the original sounding remakes of old classics, but with the hawaiian touch. I try hard to sing along, despite the hawaiian lyrics, and don't mind that I make a fool of myself.My kids love it, too.

The footswitch is very durable and stable on the floor. It can also be used as a momentary switch for any application (mute, keyboard sustain, etc...) BUT DON'T TRY TO USE IT TO SWITCH AMP CHANNELS. For that purpose you need a latching toggle switch that opens/closes each time it's depressed. This one is designed only to stay switched as long as your foot's on it.Also, if you'd prefer a cheaper, less bulky momentary pedal, shop around for a keyboard sustain pedal. They perform the same function for a much lower price and have a smaller/lower profile. Be sure you get one that has switchable polarity. Also, a keyboard sustain pedal usually comes with a permanently attatched cable which might be more clutter than you care for. This pedal can use whatever length of 1/4\\" patch cable or pedal jumper you have on hand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be sure to order the right version of this product","review":"I didn't realize until I had received the item that this is the non-latching version of this footswitch. My intention is to use at to switch between amp modes. This non-latching version isn't appropriate as it requires the pedal to be continuously pressed to be \\"on\\". Look for the FS-5L for the latching version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"I bought the Boss FS-5U pedal for hands free punching for my recording project. The pedal is sturdy and works exactly the way I had hoped. The folks at Tascam recommended this pedal and I in turn would highly recommend this pedal for any recording artist who needs hands free recording. It does the job quite well and I am very happy with it! A great buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding? 4 stars???","review":"Where to begin? There should be a product warning on this dvd similar to those we find onfood and drug items. First warning: Do you really want to waste 240 minutes of your brief life watching Tom Cruise disappoint and Jamie Foxx excel? Second warning: Obviously therewas no attempt to edit this monster. One scene after another is WAY TOO LONG and unnecessarily so. At times I thought this v-e-r-y long and boring colossus might be for people who know little or no English and need endless repetition of an already v-e-r-y thin plotline. What a waste!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did anyone else think this sucked?","review":"This movie was boring, pointless, and plotless. I can't believe people are giving this movie the highest amount of stars. Tom Cruise looks ugly, and Jamie Foxx has the most disgusting flavor saver on his face. Not only does riding in a taxi suck, but movies about them do too. And as a New Yorker, I can tell you that the chance of getting an English-speaking cabbie is rare, as well as a clean cab, along with a nice driver. In a totally braindead movie, the only good thing about this movie is that it ends. I looked at my watch several times, as well as 2 trips to the restrooms. I almost fell asleep. There was like zero action and the previews tell the whole story. Don't waste your time or your money on this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry - disappointing","review":"Found myself wanting to turn it off before the ending. And saying to myself, boring.

Any hit man that had half brain and one who chooses his suits to be handmade from a Hong Kong tailor to \\"blend in\\" would not hire a cab to go around and kill people and maybe, maybe, maybe, he would do this once, but repeat it as a consistent MO. C'mon. All Vincent has to do is go to Yahoo maps and find where these people live.A previous reviewer said set your Cruise Control to \\"evil\\", how about setting it to \\"pathetically absurd\\" or better yet, you the potential viewer, set it to \\"reverse\\" and don't waste you time watching this drivel.And by the way what the hell is happening to Michael Mann, going from Daniel Day Lewis in \\"Last of the Mohicans\\", William Peterson in \\"Manhunter\\", and Pacino, Deniro, and Kilmer in \\"Heat\\"--to now, Cruise and the fumbling Jamie Foxx and soon enough Colin Farrell in a \\"Miami Vice\\" remake?Huh?This movie sucks a big fat one."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT 2 DISCS SET! WELL PACED ACTION FILM WITH GOOD CHARACTERS!","review":"I saw this film a few years ago and decided to give it another look. While the film is contrived at times, it is helped greatly by a wonderfully cold performance by Tom Cruise. The film is well paced and builds slowly to an intense climax. Fox and Pickett should also be commended for turning in believable performances under crazy situations.

The ending to your average Die Hard movie is harder to predict than this.

One of the worst \\"hitman\\" type flicks ever created.

The film depicts a third-shift LA as a very bleak, electric land of concrete. The filmwork really captivates, so this makes for a great film visually, but storywise it is somewhat silly (a contract killer... hires a cab?)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Acting, Acting, Acting","review":"If you like Tom Cruise's acting, see the movie. If you like Jamie Foxx's acting, see the movie. Well done by both. Great direction and great score."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Film and My Favorite of the Year..So Far!","review":"Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx are outstanding! Without a doubt Tom Cruise will be nominated and most likely win the best actor Oscar (Denzel got one for a much more basic bad-guy role) for his role as the cool and dangerous hitman named Vincent. Foxx should at least get nominated for a supporting role, because he proves to everyone that he can hold his own with Cruise. Without these two casting choices the movie wouldn't be half as good. The plot is a little thin and predictable at times, but the dialogue is written very well and the direction is tight. The action scenes (mainly Tom kicking butt) aren't gory, but they are brutal and fast much as they would be in a real fight with a trained killer delivering the blows. The realism of the film adds much more depth and some of the time I completely forgot I was watching a hollywood made movie. Kudos to all involved and thanks Micheal Mann for reviving the thriller/suspense genre in such a stylish way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Toms BEST film (by far)","review":"This is the ONLY film of Toms I was even 100% sold about his character.

WHERE THE SHOOTERS KILL 6 PEOPLE AND THE ONE THEY WANT TO KILL NEVER GETS HIT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Michael Mann does it again","review":"Fans of \\"Heat\\" should not miss \\"Collateral,\\" a terrific thriller starring Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx. Foxx plays a mild-mannered cab driver who has no idea that a normal-seeming fare is going to give him the ride of his life. The less you know about the plot the better, so i'll just mention that the cast is outstanding, the pacing is excellent, and there's surprising humor as well. In fact, at one point I found myself hoping that the movie was going to be as long as \\"Heat\\" (it wasn't) because I was enjoying it so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strong performances, surprising twists","review":"Well worth seeing, more than the usual twists and turns, although I do have to say the ending may be hotly debated by viewers - good or bad? Even so, go see this one to see Tom Cruise departs from his usual \\"good guy saves the world\\" persona, playing a hit man who encounters an unwitting cabdriver and makes him part of his game plan.A solid and riveting movie, with a bit of philosophy thrown in, just enough to keep things from being formulaic, as Cruise and the cabbie debate ethics. Try to see it in a theatre without too many people or distractions so you can give it your full concentrations - and don't buy too much soda. You're not going to want to miss a moment of this one, let alone for a restroom break.Won't say more, this is one plot that doesn't deserve any spoilers."},{"rating":"1","title":"When scientologists ATTACK!!!","review":"I thought my sobriety was impeding my ability to enjoy this \\"film\\"-after all, I heard so many great things about it, and my goodness!!! Jamie Foxx was even nominated for supporting actor!! So I had a beer..watched some more, and just got angrier. I like dumb movies, really, but when dumb movies try to look smart, I just can't stand it. If you couldn't figure out where this was headed after the first \\"hit\\" by Tom Cruise, maybe you should swallow a bullet yourself and save your neighborhood dog-catcher the trouble. This movie should have been 20 minutes long. Let me put it this way-if you don't get agitated with the scene where the cops pull over Jamie and Tom, chances are you are a moron-enjoy the film. The rest of you-check out a film by Michael Mann that doesn't suck-\\"Heat\\". I could watch that movie with the sound off and enjoy it a million times more than this Hollywood drivel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take it to the bank","review":"Forget the contrived ending in an empty city; revel in the performances of two fine actors and the work of one of the most consistently entertaining and rewarding directors working.

I say, Zilch! Its almost what this stupid movie is worth - 0 stars. But I was in a generous mood and gave it 2, only for the visual experience. Bad plot, bad script are the tale of this movie. Seeing all these positive reviews tells me more about the dumbing down of American society than anything!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Collateral","review":"It's amazing just how quickly I decided this movie really sucks. A music video without the music! For the USA Today, MTV, no attention span generation! With exclamation points! However, just to be fair and because I had nothing better to do, I endured 20 minutes. Give me a medal! Tom Cruise looks better with mustache, beard, gray hair. Jamie Foxx's talents are wasted here. It's writing like this that makes us realize that Aaron Spelling was much better than we gave him credit for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent action, terrible story","review":"First of all, I don't know who Michael Mann is. I've gotta look him up.Second of all, I'm writing because I'm surprised by the positive reviews for this movies. I finished this movie in half the time. It was just corny, predictable, and all in all pretty lame. 2.5 stars, mostly for the action scenes. The characters, while not wholly one-dimensional, are too easily read. There is no complexity, which makes it a subpar drama. It's also a lame action movie because of the ill-disguised attempts to put artificial depth into the characters. I find most of the dialog agonizing to sit through.But at least I finished the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad your money wasn't collateral.","review":"I think this movie is being way too over-praised. I foundevery lingering moment of the movie to be draining. I quicklyfound myself void of interest, energy, and sanity. Tom Cruiseand Jamie Foxx have succeeded in stealing away two hours of mylife.

If your man loved movies such as \\"Bad Boys 1 &2,\\" \\"Enemy of the State,\\" \\"Mission Impossible,\\" or any other high action movies, then \\"Collatoral\\" will be for them. I watched this film with my husband. I admit the film was good, but awefully predictable at times. He was very disapointed when before the movie even got started good I revealed plot twists. It could be that because I am a writer I had a keen insight of how the story would unfold. Anyway, it was a good movie and Tom Cruise played a really good bad guy and it was interesting to see Jamie Foxx not being cool or a tough guy, he was fantastic as a humble cab driver. I enjoyed this film. There was a lot of action, it was high paced, and exciting at times."},{"rating":"1","title":"unbeliveable","review":"The fact that a hitman is driving around in a cab killing people is bad enough but dragging the cab driver around with him was stupid. This plot has so many flaws in it I can't list them all. Its described as a taunt drama between the two men, but its so stupid you cant get into it. Really bad theater bad. By the way Tommy crusie is way over rated as an actor he gets his roles based on his looks not talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Collatteral Review: EDIT.","review":"I originally rated this movie 3 stars, but after reading some of the other bad reviews, it reminded me of how this movie downward spiraled, so I now want to lower my rating to 2 stars. The ONLY reason I am now giving it 2 stars is because of the song being played during the coyote scene. Cool song, dumb movie. Thanks reviewers for inspiring me to tell the REAL truth!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not To Be Missed","review":"This movie embodies all the elements that a good film should; comedy, action, consisancy, intensity, good direction, and good acting. I am not generally a Tom Cruise fan, but I really enjoyed this film.Cruise is a hitman who has one night to hit all five of the targets on his list. He enlists the help of a cab driver (Jamie Foxx) to take him from hit to hit.Cruise and Foxx have a wonderfully magnetic on screen chemistry. This movie is not in the least serious when dealing with life and death themes. You may even find yourself cheering for the next hit on Cruise's list. Laughing throughout the film is inevitable, although at the same time its intensity draws in the audience. If you're looking for a fun filled night of intense action and unrelenting comedy, Collateral is not to be passed up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This movie looked like it would be one of the good ones this summer: with Tom Cruise and Mark Ruffalo I expected something fun to watch. This was neither intelligent (the character development was lengthy *and* flimsy, making the talking-head scenes boring) nor exciting (with the exception of a few sequences near the end). Most of the plot didn't make sense, the writing was generally dull with only a few good moments, and the contortions that Tom Cruise pulled his face into in attempts to look evil were actually laughable. More ambitious than a regular action film, but not more intelligent, so the mediocrity just becomes more noticeable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic gun battles brought to you by Vincent","review":"Tom Cruise (Vincent) has complete control of his handguns in this movie. He blows away all his \\"targets\\" with style and panache. Well, he should. He's an extremely well-trained assassin, on a \\"night on the town\\" picking his victims from his notebook computer; going from place to place with Jamie Foxx as his unsolicited cab driver(?), Max. Ahhh...Vincent shoots people and then, shoots more people. I really loved the way he put down the scumbag punks in the alley. HK USP, Glock, HK MP4, Beretta, Sig-Sauer, Uzi? Just some of the guns used in this mayhem-for-hire movie. Jada Pinkett-Smith is one of his \\"targets.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom Cruise at his Best","review":"I'm not normally a big Tom Cruise fan. This movie was on cable a while ago, and I caught part of it. It was so good, that I immediately ordered it on Amazon.Tom Cruise makes a great cold-blooded killer who is arrogant and charming, yet occasionally very human. Jamie Foxx is excellent as his unwilling partner, a cabbie with unfulfilled dreams of Success. The L.A. scenery is used very well as the backdrop for the Criminal activity. There is a wonderfully choreographed nightclub scene that is a sort of ballet of Violence. The end comes almost too soon, always a sign that it's a good movie. One of the Best crime dramas of this millenium, so far !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Collateral","review":"This movie is an expertly-made thriller. Max has lived a mundane life as a cab driver for twelve years. The faces have come and gone from his rear-view mirror: people and places he's long since forgotten--until tonight. Vincent is a contract killer. When an off-shore narco-trafficking cartel learns that they're about to be indicted by a federal grand jury, they mount an operation to identify and kill the key witnesses, and the last stage is tonight. It is on this very night that Vincent has arrived--and five bodies are supposed to fall. Circumstances cause Vincent to hijack Max' taxicab, and Max becomes collateral--an expendable person who's in the wrong place at the wrong time. It's a perfect hit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Collateral: Good flick!","review":"I would say this is not exactly a chick flick. A lot of good scenes and a nice twist to the plot. Has a nice low budget ring to it. Minimal animation. Tired of big budget duds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another Hollywood trash","review":"I don't even know why I watched this movie. I didn't entertain me, it didn't move me, it didn't teach me anything. Wasted time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did Tom Cruise payoff the critics?","review":"I can't fathom why so many critics give this generic action movie such great reviews. It reminded me of that HBO show Taxi Cab confessions. The action scenes are generic as anything Stalone or Gov. Arnold did back in the eighties. The movie has a lot of stupid behavior on the part of Jamie Fox. Two cops pull him over and instead of jumping out and telling the cops Cruise has a gun and is forcing me to drive him around he lies to the cops. Stupid scene. I love Michael Mann's movie Heat but this one is a turkey. He should have gotten Deniro or Pacino to play the killer instead of Cruise. He cannot be taken serious as a contract killer. Whats next Hillary Duff as a street hooker? Lame movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"The real Cruise","review":"This movie is so cool because Tom Cruise totally wastes so many mofo's. In the club scene Micahel Mann shows his dynamic camera work as Vincent (Tom Cruise) kills so many people with precision skill. He snaps one guys neck, then kicks a guy's leg which snaps at the knee and later takes out one of his contracts. The movie is paced really well and we see Jamie Foxx showing his acting skills as a convincing meek yet virtuous cab driver. Whenever Vincent kills someone it looks so awesome. We need more ultra violent movies like this. The movie is also very deep and dark and we see who Vincent is and why he turned out the way he did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Is This Movie In Charles' Store?","review":"Jamie Foxx, Tom Cruise, what a cast, what a movie? Wrong. Remind me not to watch this movie again. The speech is inaudible and the music is too loud. I turned up the sound to try and understand what Tom Cruise was saying (without success) and got blasted by a sound track. This movie is so mediocre it took me 2 (yes two) nights to watch it. And Jada Pinkett-Smith was so uncomfortable infront of the camera her acting ability equated that of an amateur urinating naked infront of the camera for the first time. The only reason to watch this movie is to have said been there, done that. Take your punishment and get it over.\\"The Saint\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for us Boomers","review":"If you are in your 40's or 50's as I am, have an above average IQ and appreciate music, avoid this film. Jamie Fox was impressive in an ubelievable character. Too many flaws to count; as an example expert shot Tom Cruise misses Jamie Fox in the Metro Rail shootout, yet Fox hits him. Fox uses two shots on a glass door at the office building but only one on dangerous Cruise. Most of the sound track was probably an elementary school percussion class."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie!","review":"Other than the end, where I felt this movie got a little weak, it was an enjoyable movie, and I feel like watching it again (something I can hardly ever say).Cruise plays a heartless hitman, and does a believable job at it. Just as I was thinking \\"There is something wrong with this guy - his upbringing must have been crap or some genetic psychological problem.\\" Max, the cab driver, pointed out pretty much the same thing.Anyway, I found the movie quite enjoyable. It's a simple plot, so one should know that going in, but it kept my attention better than most."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie","review":"I watched Collateral for about 10 minutes and fell in love with Foxx's charecter. Foxx play \\"Max\\" taxi driver with dreams but not actions. Tom Cruise plays \\"Vincent\\" a hitman that is as cool as ice and you can not help but like him. Throughout the movie Max drives Vincent across LA to different assasination points all the while discusing everything from the philosophy of killing a man to the improvisation of jazz. Overall I thought the movie was great. I thought the screen play was spot on, the plot twist was not predictable, and the way Mann filmed LA at night was simply beautiful. The scene where the car was parked at a light and you see the silhouette of the palm trees against the incandescent LA sky was gorgeous, along with the three coyotes. The only thing i did not like about the movie was the shift from a psychological thriller to a shoot-em-up action movie near the end, i really enjoyed the dialogue a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant sound and picture - the new demo DVD","review":"This is a very nice movie that has a gripping story.The picture and sound quality are extremely good.

I would give this movie negative stars if possible it was terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's so far-fetched and illogical that it's ridiculous.","review":"It's so far-fetched and illogical that it's ridiculous. I can never believe what the movie showed me. It depicted that the Cruise, the professional assasin could not kill Jamie the taxi driver!At the end, the dialogue was so childish that it's unbearable! Cruise said to Jamie \\"I was just trying to make a living!\\" before trying to kill Jamie. But it turned out Cruise was killed by Jamie!

The chance occurrence regarding two random fares in a taxi winding up having very much to do with each other is ridiculous. Having the taxi driver pretend to be a hit man and getting away with it was another incident that left credibility behind, as well as the insertion of the mother into the film. This film was an excuse to portray Tom Cruise in a particularly nasty role, but that was just not enough of a reason to sit through it, at least not for me . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible plot","review":"Everything up to the climax was decent, then the whole movie just crashes and burns when the story takes an unbelievable turn and then it ends."},{"rating":"2","title":"great thriller, but what kind of assassin is tom cruise?","review":"i really liked this movie, but the problem i have is that the role of the assassin is played by tom cruise. tom cruise. nobody is scared of tom cruise. he belongs in romantic dramas, not playing a contract killer. but if you can ignore that, collateral is a smart thriller keeping you on the edge of your seat. Foxx gives a good performance as the cab driver, steering away from his usual comedic roles. the scenery blends well with the movie, a nocturnal Los Angeles from the \\"glitz to the ghettos\\". some people such as me, can even find humor in tom shooting everybody. the plot never runs too terribly thin, though becomes hard to follow towards the end but picks itself up quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"The nightclub scene is the best.","review":"Collateral starring Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx is a film that actually works even though the premise is outrageous. This is probably Cruise's best performance ever! Who knew he could play such a seedy character. Foxx was nominated for best supporting actor, he is pretty good in this even though he is not my cup of tea. The only thing wrong with this film is the casting of Jada Pinkett Smith, jeez that woman cannot act worth a dime! This film isn't perfect but it's pretty close thanks to director Michael Mann."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cruise Control","review":"I was skeptical about this movie, I mean Tom Cruise as a grey headed assassin and I thought of Jamie Fox as a comedian, but when I saw this movie last year I was really taken aback. The movie is well paced and Cruise is in rare form, Fox does a nice job, but this is Cruise's movie and he is very good, expecially when things start to go wrong, his character is riviting. My only qualms are the movie is a bit long and I really did not buy Jada Pincket being into Jamie Fox, that really is a stretch, uh in real live or film quite frankly. Having said that I would still recommend this movie, when it good, it's really good and that's worth the price of the DVD, plus the extra's are nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Collateral","review":"Micheal Mann's collateral is a well directed film which portrays tom cruise of all people as a hitman and tom crusie is cold blooded in this movie he fit the role to a T with jamie foxx as his reluctant driver he puts a somewhat comedic twist to the movie both actors portray their charecters well in this movie especialy jamie foxx who has show himself in a variety of more serious roles over the last few years a well acted movie a must see for any fan of cruise or foxx"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tom is equal to his talented self - Quality entertainment","review":"When I get a Tom Cruise movie, I expected it to be well acted, to have a good story, and to be flawlessly made. I got my money's worth with Collateral.Cruise is a great villain, ruthless and human in the space of the same second. The interaction between him and Foxx is worth seeing as they ride around in a taxi, unseen and unremembered. To top it off, the ending is the crème de la crème; don't miss it.An upcoming actor who is worth seeing is Mark Ruffalo. He started as Jennifer Garner's boyfriend in 13 Going on 30, and then he tried his hand-and succeeded-in unrated territory with In the Cut, to be back in the role of the tough, good-hearted cop in Collateral."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Your Average Action Movie","review":"When I considered all the marvellous subplots intertwined with the \\"typical\\" action plot of Collateral, I realized that the action was only about half the story. It's really a sort of brainy drama masquerading as an action film. Michael Mann, however, seamlessly brings the two together, and even treats the audience to excellent cinematography! (I saw \\"The Interpreter\\" after buying the Collateral DVD--big mistake. It made me sick to find that the cinematographic potential in the UN building was squandered.)Buy the DVD, and don't focus on the main plot too much--focus on the subplots and individual characters. And remember to enjoy it! :D"},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty good considering the silly hitman formula","review":"I usually hate movies about hitmen. It's so comical how in hitmen movies that they can go on a rampage, shooting things, exploding things, and still wander away from a scene without much police attention. When's the last time you saw a news story about a hitmen on a rampage? Yeah, never. It's just Hollywood story time. Anyway, that said, I had fun with this movie, to my great surprise. Talent is the key - talented acting, writing, and directing. Some parts of the movie had serious artistic flair. Am I the only one still haunted by the scene were Cruise and Foxx come across the coyotes crossing the street?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliche","review":"This was an extremely cliche movie about a killer (Tom Cruise) who forced his cab driver (Jamie Foxx) to become his designated driver for the evening so he could kill people. The movie was so terribly cliche that for about twenty minutes of it, I got up and dusted and vacuumed with the movie still going. I added a new vacuum bag, came back, and the movie was still as boring as it had been for the past 45 minutes. The only interesting parts were when Jada Pinkett came in."},{"rating":"1","title":"I have never been so motivated to return a rental DVD.","review":"Tom Cruise and Jamie Foxx both act superbly.

I like dumb action movies, sometimes, like all those old bruce willis movies or even steven segal. However, the endings are all the same: stupid. That's OK on those movies, cause they were trash from the beginning, and you take them for what they are. This movie starts off to be a really cool, thoughtful, interesting movie. Then, near the end, you hear the flushing sound, and realize that this movie is just a big loaf, being flushed along with the $3 you spent to rent it. What a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"DVD SCAMERS","review":"Beware of this firm, their US branch forwards overstocked DVD's from the U.K., what you probably will not notice is the DVD's are playable only in \\"Region 2\\", the UK and Europe.

I should have come here first and read the reviews, now I'm just another casualty of the terrible ending. This pretty cool movie all of a sudden starts marching lockstep with the formula action movie ending you've already seen a million times. They even shoehorn in a pretty girl at the end for the hero to save and fall in love with, even though she hasn't been in the movie since a couple minutes during the opening credits. It also irritates me how in these movies the bad guy is incredibly skilled and deadly, but when he fights the main characters his skills are suddenly gone. Either that, or the loser cab driver suddenly acquires navy seal training. Either way, I ain't buying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great gun handling by Cruise in this.","review":"Not a huge Tom Cruise or Jamie Foxx fan, but this was a pretty good movie.

Papas' presentation of all these topics is very lucid. It is not a general textbook on electromagnetics but there is much to be learned from the book by anyone interested in the topics with which it deals.

After many months Paulsen finally adjusts to his new home. One of Paulsen's cousins \\"Harry\\" tells Paulsen that in the winter Harry's dad tells them stories about their lives.

Gary Paulsen is a great writer, and this book combines the excitement of wilderness survival with a very poignant story about a friendship between a teenager and an old man with a badly disfigured face. This is what young adult books should be."},{"rating":"2","title":"the legendary foxman","review":"I liked this book because it was fun and easy to read. It also was easy to visualize the parts of the book when and how they happen. It is packed full of detail. It is a little sad in the beginning, but gets a little bit better as you progress through the story.The Foxman is about a 15-year-old boy who was taken away from his parents because one night they got so drunk that they tried to kill their own son with a butcher's knife. So the boy went to go live up north with his aunt, uncle, and cousins. They are farmers in the northern wilderness. At first he didn't like it there but once the winter stories came he'd grown to like it more than his old home. That's when he met the foxman, an old man who had fought in the wars. He was named the foxman for his skills of catching fox.I would recommend this book to anyone who likes surprise endings and needs to picture what is going on to actually understand the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book I have ever read","review":"I thought this book was a very amazing book and exciting .

They spot a small house with a smoke coming out of the chimney. My favorite character was Carl because he was the one who taught his cousin how to hunt all animals and he his also kind of funny and he knows more about hunting. My favorite part of the book was when the boys was lost in the woods and a big storm was coming.

After the Sage Woman calendars (no longer in print) I've used for the past several years, this is a real disappointment. Being an 'international' calendar, it does not even have important dates marked.

No one goes to this much effort to communicate how he feels through the instrument using melody. When you can play like this, with that tone, you reach people, emotionally...you transcend mere chops, and in fact have an almost verbal language that you can talk to people with. I think it's what all of us guitarists aspire to. I On U, the song, is my favorite melody, by far, but there are plenty of gems to be found on this disc. Overall his guitar sound is absolutely angelic. His mixes could use some work, and the lack of a live drummer really takes so much away from the melodic potential of this album in my view. I hope he re-releases with an all-star cast of studio gods. I'm all for the experimental atmospherics, though, just would be great to hear a steve smith or dean castronovo driving these melodies with the flair and boundless energy we all know and love them for!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Timeless Guitar Playing Journey","review":"I love this album, though I confess I got to song 3, Timeless Motion, and stopped listening to the rest of the album for quite a while.

NS is beyond phenomenal on this entire CD. I on U is also great, Blue Passion...just get the whole CD or download it.

I found one song catchy, worth listening too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neal Schon - Nice Solo Disc From Journey Guitarist","review":"\\"I On U\\" is an all instrumental solo album released by Journey / Santana guitarist Neal Schon on Steve Vai's Favored Nations label. Schon uses a lot of electronics on this disc with keyboardist Igor Len as his main collaborator. Overall this is a nice album. Schon is a great player and shows off his many guitar skills here. The music is shredding at times, but never in a metal capacity. In fact I find much of this disc reminds me of more electronic psych progressive rock bands like Ozric Tentacles or Hydria Spacefolk. There is not much that sounds like Journey here, so this may not be fans of the band's cup of tea, but it is a very pleasant instrumental work from Schon."},{"rating":"1","title":"step in the wrong direction","review":"I must say that this album is a huge disappointment. Having promised so much with Electric World and Beyond the Thunder, this is a step in the wrong direction. Sure Neal is as crisp and virtuoso as usual, but one expects a little more creativity and soul. It seems that many a talented guitarist become obsessed with \\"fret board diarrhoea\\". To quote the great Miles Davies, \\"it's not how fast you talk, but what you say that counts\\". Neal is clearly out to compete with the likes of Vai and Satriani. Perhaps for commercial reasons, maybe a pat on the back, who knows?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unlike Neal Schon","review":"As many other listeners had written, I am a great fan of Neal's music. But the latest effort I on U is a disappointing one. Neal is a tremendous guitar player, I have advocated this fact even while he was playing second fiddle to Santana from 1970-72 and later with Journey. Then of course he had a memorable stint with Jan Hammer in the 80's. I on U is unlike Neal's earlier solo efforts namely Electric World & Beyond the Thunder. Even the album Voice incorporating some popular hits sounded much better. In the current CD, Neal's guitar melody is there throughout, I think it's the instrumentation that suffers particularly the percussion & keyboards. It sounds so unnatural & contrived. Neal is basically a rock guitarist & to see him indulge in an album like this finds him like a fish out of water."},{"rating":"1","title":"Below Neal Schon's standard","review":"I am pro-Neal Schon. I own many of his solo efforts and every Journey album to date. However, I honestly can't understand why everyone is rating this album with 5 stars. It simply does not meet the mark on this one.None of the tracks have a theme that will 'grab' you. These aren't songs that will stick in your head. Saying that this album is 'Neal exploring his melodic side' is pretty inaccurate. If want to hear Neal's 'melodic side,' by \\"Beyond the Thunder....\\" one of his best to date. These tracks are him basically exploring his improvisational side and jamming to a drum machine. Even live drum tracks by a great drummer such as Omar Hakim sound as if they are programmed.I was disappointed on this one. Neal is an exceptional guitarist....one of the best in the world. He just didn't hit the mark on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Instrumental CD","review":"Let me start off by saying that I am a huge fan of Journey. So naturally I approach this CD with some positive bias. BUT, I am also a big fan of instrumental CDs of all sorts, including New Age, Movie Soundtracks, what have you. I have bought most of Joe Satriani's albums and I am a big fan of Eddie Van Halen. I personally think that guitar work on this album is superior to any of Neal Schon's previous albums. The emotion and soul that this album evokes is definitely superior. Maybe some people who love Satriani, Steve Vai, or Malmsteen won't think this guitar album measures up, BUT when one listens to this album as an instrumental CD IT IS SPECTACULAR. This music grabs me and moves me. I love it. I love this CD. I love Neal Schon. Wow. This CD has emotion and soul and it is just gorgeous and moving music."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Schon magic","review":"As a guitar fan I'd have to say that this is my favourite Neal Schon solo album after Beyond The Thunder. They're a differnt style from one another though, so perhaps the comparison is unfair...both are great listening though.All told this is an excellent album, very easy listening and never, ever boring. I don't agree with another reviewer's comments that this album sounds like a Satch or Vai effort - if you have more than a cursory interest in their music you'd be able to tell Schon, Vai and Satriani from one another in the bat of an eyelid.Don't hesitate to buy it - Schon fans (and anyone who likes the guitar genre) will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Buy It!","review":"I love this CD.

This 1970 sex farce is one of his worst, which means it's unmitigated garbage.Sellers plays a middle-aged lothario who meets his match in a free-spirited young kook (Goldie Hawn, in her second starring film role), and before long, they're off on a series of wacky romantic adventures. Nothing seems more dated than this sort of '70s \\"mod\\" comedy, and nothing seems more wasteful than an actor of Sellers' stature wallowing in material clearly beneath him.

This time, I followed the instructions for first time cleaning and that went fine, then tried to brew 8 cups of coffee and it died at 6 cups and never worked again. This coffeemaker really sucks. Never buy one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Messy","review":"We are on our second coffeemaker in two weeks. The first one spilled all over our kitchen one morning when the carafe did not hold the drip basket open during brewing. There was coffee and coffee grounds all over our kitchen counters and kitchen floor, ruining the hardwood. The second coffeemaker is now doing the same thing unless someone stands next to it holding the carafe against the back. That makes the timer useless and is generally very inconvenient."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two strikes, its out.","review":"We tried one, worked well for a couple of months; then it went into a 'cleaning cycle' and never came back. I must say the B&D service was great: One telephone call and they sent a new one right away. But after a few weeks, the new one did the same thing. Great service doesn't help a product that breaks repeatedly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware the \\"Audible Alert\\"!","review":"This machine makes a good cup of coffee and promptly, but the \\"audible alert\\" is making me nuts. It consists of a series of 4 intermittent beeps that sound at the end of the brewing cycle and are as loud as any alarm clock. Aside from being startling, annoying, etc., it really spooks the pets. There's no way to shut the thing off, so I'm stuck with it. If I had known about this feature prior to purchase, I never would have bought this coffee maker. I don't know if this is \\"user friendly\\" overkill or technology run amock, but I can't believe this thing was released on an unsuspecting public. I strongly suggest you look elsewhere for a coffee maker."},{"rating":"1","title":"good-bye B&D","review":"I've had this coffee pot before, and was willing to try it again even tho the beep is too loud and warranty is too short. Lasted about 10 months before water tank leaked everywhere. Bought a replacement. This one seemed more cheaply made than the other. Slightly leaked with first use. Beep is still too loud. Black plastic piece that has something to do with the pause feature kept coming off. Sorry B&D--can't recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Product","review":"I have not personally used this coffee maker because it was a present to my brother.

The content, covering a broad range of styles spanning several centuries, includes some music to make almost anyone happier at Christmas. The blend is superb, the arrangements are innovative but true to the music, the intonation is nearly perfect, and Chanticleer sings as though the music means something to them. An hour spent listening to this album will unwind you from the crinkiest pre-Christmas blues and tensions. Don't be without it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Our Heart's Joy: A Chanticleer Christmas","review":"I bought this album mainly for the single track 'Ave Maria' by Franz Biebl - well worth the price just for that track alone. But I was amazed to find that the rest of the album is just as good, with some well-known Christmas songs, but mostly with lesser-known ones which should be heard more often. Some of the tracks sound like there are women singing, but per Wikipedia Chanticleer is an all-male group, so the high voices are CounterTenors, something once common in the Middle Ages but done rarely these days. Most of the tracks are in Latin, with some Spanish, at least one French, and one or two in English. This is I believe a compilation from several of their concerts or albums, and it is well worth listening to all year - not just at Christmas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing music","review":"Chanticleer creats some wonderful music here... This CD is a great one for enjoyment year-round! The Biebl \\"Ave Maria\\" is one of the most beautiful choral pieces written in the last 100 years, and Chanticleer performs it exquisitely. I've yet to find another recording of it anywhere, so enjoy this one! The rest of the CD is not lacking, either -- the closing \\"Silent Night\\" arrangement is the best I have ever heard. This one comes highly recommended to any lover of Christmas or choral music."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Biography of MJ Himself","review":"I like to read biographies of athletes but so many times they do not explain the athlete's life, game, how he gets ready for a game or how he deals with all the critism. This biography is just the oposite and I feel they explain every thing about what Michael Jordan does and who he really is. Another reason why I give this book 4-stars is because it is not often that you get to hear what the athlete really thinks about the critism or how they handle it, or any thing to deal with there life outside the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brudda Iz","review":"For fans of Brudda Iz this is must listening.

He makes everything he sings his own, no matter the genre, the era. He sings traditional (pre-statehood) Hawaiian music with a vibrance that reflects his love of the islands and the early way of island life which he worked to promote. He sings popular standards adding his own soaring improvisations, his own interpretations, revealing music we never knew was there. Buy this recording. Buy all his recordings, as I have. Listen to them all by yourself, then listen to them with your closest friends. They are deeply-felt, deeply-personal works of music that have touched me and broadened my vision of what good music can be."},{"rating":"2","title":"IZ in Concert","review":"What a GREAT CD! Isreal was a very talented man, he has a voice like an angel and a wonderful sense of humor.

To think that he is no longer with us really breaks my heart, I will truly miss the music of this very special person."},{"rating":"2","title":"IZ LIVES! (Through his spirit of music)","review":"I'm collecting ALL the IZ CD's, and have the book \\"IZ, Voice of the People\\". You can't go wrong with ANY of his music! This wonderful Hawaiian singer, who left this world too soon, will always be respected and revered in the music world. For a trip to Hawaii, via this beautiful, unique VOICE, try any \\"IZ\\". I can't say which is my favorite CD, as they all take me away to a place of total relaxation and joy. He will live forever in the hearts of all who knew him, and have enjoyed his song! ~ Aloha from Colorado!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a Concert with lots of talk","review":"This was disappointing. The talk interrupts the enjoyment of the music. Not good for backround listening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much talk - not enough music","review":"I buy albums for the music, and this one does not deliver. Because of all of the chat it is not an album I could play more than twice without getting bored by it.Personally, I have taken some tracks to mp3 so that I just get the music, and even some of those needed editting to remove more superfluous chat.Not, in my opinion, an album for those just wanting to listen to music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Iz Lives","review":"Wow, is all you can say after you listen to the this cd, it's incredible. Opening, with the soft soothing ahi wela it gets a wonderfuil start. After four slow melodic songs margarita livens it up with a great modern sound that only Iz could perfect. The back half of the cd is even more unbeleivable with great tracks like n dis' life, white sandy beach, and hawai'i 78 that will put you in a trance. Topping it all off Iz sings E Ala E, the crowd alone sends chills right through me, the song is truly magical. The quality of this cd is fantastic it feels like you are there with Iz. It is a great collection of his music and if you are looking for Hawaiian music this is a must. Iz's voice sounds as if it is from heaven and he creates music that is completely unforgetable. So everyone go out and buy Iz:The man and his music, and never forget this great man with a giant's heart. Iz lives on in our hearts forever!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"This poster looks amazing, the quality is really great, and the colors look fantastic.

A mish-mash of interviews presented verbatim, trial transcripts, political vitriol and armchair lawyering, the book relates a fascinating event in a thoroughly biased manner.The escape and shooting of a number of lions from Ligertown, a ramshackle would-be zoo near Lava Hot Springs, Idaho, tore apart a town as people took sides, and spawned any number of conspiracy theories. The author definitely chose to side with Ligertown's owners and presents it glaringly in print. Those readers who agree with the author will have an easy time reading this book. For the rest of us - if we're determined enough to read past the author's partisan prose - we may be able to find the story of Ligertown's demise an intriguing real-life tale."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Not going to waste too much time time about how poor this product is. Suffice it to say that you should listen to the negative reviews. The instructions are poor and the part quality is worse. If you do get one look at D Leong's review for a bunch of good tips about actually making it work. Kudos to him for sticking it out. The box says it's good to 8 and up. If you handed this to a mechanically inclined 8 year-old you'd risk ruining a whole career in engineering. There are a couple Youtube videos of this thing working out there. One has different colored parts. I wonder if they changed manufacturers or something.If anyone knows of a similar, high quality model please comment."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good idea poorly executed","review":"Step 41 of the instructions begins, \\"The long awaited moment has arrived! You will now have the opportunity to run your engine for the first time.\\" Perhaps one out of 41 purchasers will get that far. Some of the plastic screw posts cracked when the screws went in. The camshaft instructions were contradictory, but we eventually figured that out. Various details in the instructions did not match the parts. We had to use aluminum foil to get the batteries to make contact in the power pack, and the motor was wired in reverse. This toy is a good visual introduction to engines and cleaner than tearing down a real engine, but a real engine might be less frustrating!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good model, but missing part","review":"My 13-year old son is building this for a school project. He definitely needs help from his father, but they are managing quite well in getting through most of it although the instructions sometimes are confusing. Luckily, my husband is quite handy and can help my son. It looks good so far, but there is a part missing so the model cannot be completed until the part arrives. I contacted the company and they are sending the missing part. Overall, it is a very educational project."},{"rating":"1","title":"xmas present motor","review":"nice , but was missing parts and had to wait couple of weeks for parts not a happy camper was a xmas gift"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply not worth any price","review":"I have purchased two of these. Neither worked.The first, with orange features (water pump, etc) was purchased perhaps four years ago. It was fragile and broke during assembly. Pehaps with the instructions in earlier reviews I could have made it work.The second, purchased last month, had blue features. The parts simply all were not for the same kit. One intake valve was missing. The timing belt cover simply was for a different variation of the kit. I don't mean hard to fit or poor fit, I mean the wrong part.I should have known better but the second kit was being constructed with my Cub Scouts during a Den meeting. It was quite anticlimactic that we had to stop halfway through due to the wrong parts. At least we were able to review a little engine anatomy.Smithsonian should be ashamed of itself with this one.In retrospect we should have purchased a broken lawnmower for less cost than this kit and disassembled it. Still might do that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Uncle Larry","review":"Purchased this for my mechanically-inclined 8 year old nephew. We very much enjoyed putting it together over 3.5 hours the afternoon of Christmas. He located all the parts and drove in all the screws. He really caught on to cam and rocker arm function and valve and piston timing. Wow! Late in the afternoon he proudly displayed his functioning engine to the entire family. I think his grandmother, who followed our progress throughout the afternoon, was the most excited. She kept telling my nephew what a good Christmas memory this will be. I agree. Excellent kit! Detailed but not too complex. You do need a good micro phillips head screwdriver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Colossal disappointment","review":"Mom and grandad built this because he lost interest after ten minutes when we were still figuring out which way round everything went. A bunch of tiny screws that mom had to screw into very fragile plastic. No explanation to kids about what the parts of the engine actually did in reality. A much smaller toy than we imagined and once it is built you'd be absolutely crazy to take it apart to construct again. There is no way an 8 yr old would have the mental endurance or interest to stay with this project from start to finish. But hey, it lights up!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of Junk -- Do Not Buy!","review":"My son got this model for Christmas. He was very excited to put it together. We are a mechanically minded family and relish these kinds of challenges. HOWEVER, this model and its instructions are so poorly executed, that it is doomed to fail.

Lots of potential, but a disaster as is.Do this at a minimum:Use a high-quality screwdriver. Don't bother with the included one.Drill out every screw hole with a 5/64th bit. The screws will still be hard to get in all the way. You might want to also do what I did: After the 5/64th bit, use a 3/32 bit just a little ways into the screw holes, so there is less self-tapping the screw has to do. If you drill all the way to the bottom of the holes with the 3/32nd, the screws will just fall in. (If you have an 11/128th bit, you're probably set! Never heard of one of those though.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"LIFESTYL ALL THE WAY","review":"I'VE BEEN A BIG LIFESTYL FAN SINCE I KAN REMEMBER, THE ALBUM IZ GREAT QUALITY, PRODUCTIONS, AND FLOWZ.

I hope they all manage to live it down, but it's sufficiently forgettable that they probably will.Having been persuaded to watch this by a teenage relative who has since apologized, we did our best to keep ourselves awake (insert Mogadorian/Mogadon joke here) by providing our own commentary, but what this really needs to make it entertaining is the Mystery Science Theatre 3000 crew."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks like a run of the mill T.V. intro","review":"The intro or trailer tells the whole story.

There is no number two.I wonder if the same people will be in the TV series should this take place.

I regret that I gave this movie my undivided attention.This movie made no sense and its plot was about as coherent as a reality tv show. The special effects were good, yes, but if it had no effects this movie would not have anything to stand on. The producer's standpoint is fully transparent in that the only function of the movie is to cater to a certain audience (14-16 years old).And this is NOT jealousy speaking but I could not shake the vibe that the main character was supposed to have a \\"look how cute I am\\" thing going on at all times.

The story is actually pretty good, especially for teen fiction, I've watched my copy more than once and don't get tired if it.Resemblance to the book \\"I am number Four\\" is the usual Hollywood adaptation, much of each (book or movie) has nothing to do with the other- but the story has lots of action and impressive FX work.I wouldn't mind a sequel, actress Teresa Palmer (in one of the extras) evidently thought there were hopes of one- but I doubt that we'll see one- I haven't heard word of anything.

It's as if the main male lead (do any of the girls count since they were in the movie so little and did so little to move the plot?) forgets he has powers and just hides for a bit.The book has to be a completely stellar work compared to this shoddy movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't wait for the sequel...","review":"This movie felt like nothing more than a trailer for the sequel. Casting was terrible, save for Timothy Olyphant, who was chronically underutilized; story was lacking(surprise!);the pace was alright, but the plot was less of a coordinated mash-up than an absolute cluster-cuss crafted from Bay's previous partial storylines, with no direction, no ending, and no depth."},{"rating":"2","title":"movie","review":"I've read the books and decided to try out the movie.

This film was summed up with the two minute movie trailer. No need to spend money. Seriously one of the Top Four Worst movies of 2011. 15 minutes into the movie, I kept checking my watch to see how much longer I had to endure and suffer before the movie ended. The script was full of cheesy lines, the special effects looked like the film was made for some cheesy 60's horror movie. It's films like this, that make you wish there were evil space villains out there, just so they could put you out of your misery while you suffer through this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too generic, not interesting","review":"I decided to go against reviews and rent I Am Number Four anyway since the trailer appealed to me and it was the type of story that I enjoy. I did not find it worth my time or money, however. There's just no interesting substance, character-wise, to this movie, nothing to engage with to get you invested in the story. It's like they adapted the most generic, bland fan fiction they could possibly find about an alien high school teen coming into his powers and then paid someone to add some really CGI intensive action sequences to it. I can't tell if the main actor is really that bland or whether he was doing the best he could with the poor script."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible move","review":"Just stay away.

IF YOU LIKE ACTION MOVIES, THIS HAS PLENTY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks cohesiveness and overly ambitious","review":"\\"I Am Number Four\\" is an action science-fiction thriller with an interesting premise. Number Four (Alex Pettyfer) is an alien whose home planet, Lorien, was destroyed by an evil race of hit men called the Mogadorians. Four is one of nine Lorien children sent to Earth to escape their planet's destruction. Legend says that they will eventually gain enough power to vanquish the Modadorians. So the Mogadorians have tracked them to Earth, intent on wiping out all nine. One, Two and Three have already been killed. Four must act quickly and decisively, but first he must hide in plain sight. How? By enrolling in his local high school.This movie is all over the place and far too ambitious. Sometimes it aspires to be \\"The Matrix,\\" other times \\"The X Files,\\" and still others a John Hughes flick. Bonus extras on the Blu-ray/DVD/Digital Combo Pack include a making-of featurette, bloopers, and six deleted scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!","review":"I love this movie and have watched it four times already!

If you want to watch a good show with teens, watch Buffy. Buffy is way better. Better acting, much better script, lots of humor and suspense.

The video just didn't drag me in the way the book was able too. Not enough backdrop and the life the \\"aliens\\" had left behind to completely gring the viewer into the picture of just why they were there and what the reasons for same were. The acting is acceptable more focused for the teenage crowd. I felt that with a little more aged theme the movie could have come across much better. Have read the sequel \\"The Power of Six\\" and enjoyed it as much as the first - but will not be waiting with baited breathed if a movie sequel is made."},{"rating":"2","title":"love this","review":"I got this for myself after ordering it twice on cable love this movie love the quality hoping there is a number 5 haha"},{"rating":"2","title":"Much better then I expected","review":"I rented this movie to have something to watch while I ate.

When i bought it I wasn't sure if it would be hit or miss, but as I sat down and watched it I saw that \\"I Am Number Four\\" was a big hit to me and my family. But I believe that the book might be better than the film. I'm very excited to see the sequal to this film and see how they put it all together. Out of 1-5 stars I give it a 4 1/2 star rating. It was definitely worth the money I spent on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets Interesting After a Slow Start","review":"The first few scenes seem to be going in the direction of a teenage high school flick with the usual suspects appearing in their assigned roles. Fortunately the movie doesn't lose too much time before it shifts gear to more of a sci-fi adventure flick with some interesting twists and turns.As the movie progresses we get vicious alien invaders and space monsters, not to mention shape shifters and lovely alien heroines. All told this rather traditional mix results in an entertaining sci-fi adventure that held my attention all the way to the sort of end.I say sort of end because it definitely screams sequel to me; the story stops with no conclusive resolution to the main problem. If we don't see a sequel to this one it will only be because the receipts don't justify it; I suppose time will tell and I certainly wish them well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nicely done!","review":"Great plot, great characters and it was all done very well.

I always look carefully to ensure I am ordering the Blu-Ray version DVD and that I am getting the original case and cover.

When I started learning Spanish, I found this book to be very useful as a basic grammar for beginners and helped me to progress greatly. A couple of years later though I made the mistake of buying the Kindle version to brush up on my Spanish. Unless there is a new version of the product available, I would strongly advise you not to do the same. The book is essentially a scanned PDF of the entire book, which means you can't take notes with your Kindle nor search for a specific section. What good is that to learners who want to brush up on a specific section of grammar or have a particular query?

This book may be beneficial to some.....it depends on how your brain is wired. This book has a highlighted box around each \\"blunder\\" while the correct way to express the Spanish is not highlighted, and in fact, at times can be difficult to find in the paragraphs preceding or following the highlighted blunder. So I am blinded by the glare from the highlighted blunder, without being able to see the correction. I agree with a previous reviewer: I feel that the errors are being cemented in my brain, not the correction. This is the only Spanish instructional book for which I have ever wanted a refund. But I own it now. I keep picking it up, thinking maybe this time it will help me. Then I put it down, thinking that this book and I really do not get along. Good luck to you, but I would not buy this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"This book was very helpful in correcting my Spanish grammar errors. The grammatical explanations and examples are clear. The \\"blunders\\" are clearly indicated in red ink and with a red check mark.

At first I wondered maybe if something was lost in translation, but it's just so ... uninteresting. There was a good premise here and plenty of opportunity for satire, but everything is so stiff and wooden - the acting is horrible, the dialogue is horrible, the plot is awkward and sort of series of absurd sketches (American actors out of work and performing in Japanese bars, foreign leaders kowtowing to the PM of Japan, the eccentric scientist trying to explain it all) loosely tied against the end of the world.

I was looking forward to hearing John Williams once again as I sat down to watch the movie. I was looking forward to the musical journey that Williams always takes you on. His music brings deep impact and brings a \\"magic touch\\" with it. This soundtrack was a dud; I was not moved in any way. I just sat there and thought to myself, \\"Is this it?\\".

While not a bad work, it is not the same caliber as the masterful scores of the previous movies, Prisoner of Azkaban in particular. I personally am very disappointed in the choice to switch composers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mostly good","review":"I was disappointed to hear that John Williams didn't do the score for the forth in the Potter series, but I have to admit that Doyle, et. al. did a great job. The music captures the spirit of HP4 while still being true to the themes originated by Williams in HP1, 2, and 3. Some of the pieces are quite powerful, somewhat reminiscent of the Pirates of the Caribbean soundtrack (which is a must-buy).If it were not for the three Weird Sisters songs at the end of the CD, I would have given it 5 stars. But these three tracks seriously detract from the CD's overall appeal. It's like mixing AC/DC with Beethoven; they both have their place, but not together.Buy the CD then re-burn it to another disk leaving off the last three tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT SOUNDTRACK!!","review":"Even though John Williams didn't do anything with this soundtrack, this was a very well done soundtrack and I don't and won't regret buying it.

Overall I am ashamed of this soundtrack, as it is an insult to the Harry potter franchise"},{"rating":"1","title":"The new guy...","review":"I actually don't have this soundtrack, and will never buy it. Why? Because I really, really dislike the music in the fourth movie.I saw the movie of course, and spent quite a bit of time hissing to my friends, \\"What's the deal with this music? It's like a daytime soap or something! Where's the Harry Potter theme?\\" I stayed to watch the credits, and, sure enough, John Williams has clearly disappeared.I work at a movie theatre, and I must say that the orchestral music at the end of Disney's \\"Chicken Little\\" sounds more like Harry Potter music than the music at the end of the Harry Potter film.I am not happy with this new music at all--it actually distracted me from the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go Back to Williams or go to Howard Shore","review":"I was very disappointed to listen to this soundtrack. If I could I would take it back. I currently have all the soundtracks and this is the worst. I wish they would go back to Williams or even better Howard Shore of LOTR fame. He did an excellent job with the triology."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good indeed","review":"Overall, Patrick Doyle's composition was great, he's very good at representing darkness through the music. And the three vocal songs from the Yule Ball were great. (If the music wasn't played during the Yule Ball, I would have hated having this music. There is no place for vocal music in the background for this type of film)My only gripe about the soundtrack is that John Williams theme is nowhere to be found. I understand that the reason for having a new composer is to come up with new themes for various things, but the main theme that is so recognizable as the Harry Potter theme by everyone who's seen the films should not be cut out completely. For this reason alone, I had to mark down the soundtrack, but if I could have given it four and a half, I would haveI haven't seen the film as of yet, so if the theme is still in the movie, I apologize. I'm going by what I heard on the soundtrack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different, but good...","review":"I just bought the new soundtrack for Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire. It has been a tradition for me to go out the day each one comes out and get it. I was sad to find out that John Williams is no longer the \\"music man\\" for the Harry Potter productions, but as I found out I am beginning to like Patrick Doyle's take on how the music should sound. I like the Celtic/Scottish feel of some of the tracks. However, my favorite track is the Hogwarts march because of the brass ensemble which performs it. I am always in awe of a brass ensemble that can sound that good. You may not like the change, because the original harry potter feel is gone. However, with change in the story line comes change in the music..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Soundtrack!","review":"I bought this CD for myself because I am planning a Yule Ball at my school and wanted to have a copy of Harry's Waltz. The soundtrack is great! Mine shipped quickly and was in great condition when I got it! Patrick Doyle is one of my favorite Potter composers and I think all the tracks are wonderful. The only other Harry Potter soundtrack I own is the first one, and I noticed that there are fewer tracks on Goblet of Fire's soundtrack and was surprised that all the tracks are shorter which is why I gave it only 4 stars. But overall, great soundtrack at a great price!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Doyle at Top Form!","review":"I'm sure stepping into the shoes of John Williams is enough to give anybody a case of the jitters... However, Doyle manages with such grace and elegance that one wouldn't notice. \\"Harry Potter and the Goblet of Fire\\" is not just a great score, it's a masterpiece of classical music that I'm sure Doyle is very proud of. Unlike his successor (Hooper) Patrick Doyle chose to take the Potter series an entirely different direction with a sobering and dramatic work. While tracks like \\"Harry in Winter\\" pull at the heartstrings, \\"The Yule Ball\\" and it's like are pure classical bliss. Also keep your ears peeled for Doyle's reworking of \\"Hedwig's Theme\\" which sounds very akin to a Bohemian/gypsy tune mixed with a gothic flair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please Mr Williams come back","review":"After seeing this movie and owning all the other soundtracks for Harry Potter I added this to my Christmas list. Upon opening presents I realized I could not recall the music from this film, which was not the case with the others. Now I know why. Without John Williams at the helm this music is empty and disapointing. It's just not Harry Potter-ish. I have nothing against this composer and am sure he is very talented. Just not for the Harry Potter movies. Mr Williams who is a musical genius did all the Star Wars movies so why not these? Not going to be playing this CD very often."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment...","review":"This score regrettably fails to deliver.

Divorced from the film, Patrick Doyle's score simply cannot touch the sense of wonder, anticipation & magic that John Williams pours into the previous three scores.

I guess that's the difference between good and great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let's wave the wand and bring John Williams back for the Order of the Phoenix.","review":"While Doyle is a fine composer in his own right, there simply is no comparison to John Williams.

It is not remotely directional and can be expected to pick up the same sound whether you are pointing it at your subject or not. In other words, in a noisy room you can expect to get sound salad from everything more than 4 inches away from it.The only situation where it would be usefull is one in which you need to have the mic close to your mouth and for some reason can't pick up the 1 ounce digital recorder it is plugged into."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work on iMac or dead on arrival","review":"Should this thing work on an iMac?

However, this isn't the most durable microphone. I was able to use it for 3 or 4 video shoots before it just stopped working all together. I take pride in caring for my equipment. I don't believe its lack of durability was affected by the way I treated the microphone. As I was always sure to put it in my camera bag immediately following use.One day I attempted to plug it in for a wedding I was shooting. I did a test, as always, before filming and it just didn't work.Very difficult to find a durable wired microphone as I have been through 2 other mics that stopped working shortly after or immediately after purchasing them.If you need a mic for a shoot or two and don't mind wasting $25 buy this mic. If you're looking for something more durable, good luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE THIS THING!!!","review":"This made my digital voice recorder 10x better, it picked up the sound much clearer and from farther away.

Only problem is you get mono sound, which actually tends to work better for many spoken word recordings.

With the mic's power derived from the recording unit itself, in this case a dv camcorder, I was free to natter away ad infinitum. The audio was clean and clip-free and so the mic is recommended.I'm knocking off a star for the silver clip - bizarre they would include a chrome clip on a clip-mic, and also for the lack of cable length (around 3 feet)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just A Bit To Much.","review":"Great mic but a bit to senitive for my needs.

It works great for this purpose.Nuance, on their supported hardware page recommended the Olympus ME-12 mic + WS 500 for \\"excellent\\" voice recognition. Unfortunately, I did not get those results using Nuance's recommended settings.However, using the ME-15 and WS 500(dictation mode, ST XQ, with voice filter on)I achieved excellent results.The cost/performance for the ME-15 is very good. When teamed with the Olympus WS 500 you can't go wrong. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear sound, nice clip","review":"I bought this to replace my headset, since I own a nice set of headphones I'd rather use when audio conferencing (generally Skype through my computer).The first thing I noticed was the short cord (3 feet long). You'll almost certainly need an extension cord if you aren't using the front/top mic jack on your desktop or a laptop. The clip swivels, which is quite nice, so you can clip it anywhere and still point it at your mouth. I generally clip it to my headphone wires or my shirt.Volume was a bit of an issue. This is my first time using a clip on microphone, and I had to max the microphone volume on my computer to get adequate sound out of it. This was more of a problem with the Linux version of Skype than the Windows one. The microphone is fairly directional, so talking into it helps.Audio quality is a big step up over my previous no-name brand headset, and everyone I talk to mentions how much clearer I sound.Pros:-Nice clip-Clear soundCons:-Pricy-Short wire-Low volume"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a quality item","review":"You get what you pay for. The Olympus ME-15 is a small, lightweight lavalier style microphone. The cord is just three feet long, which makes it too short for most uses except recording your own voice. The mic is omnidirectional (picks up sound from all directions), which means it's pretty useless except under very quiet conditions. If you use the attached clip, the mic has a tendency to pick up extraneous sounds like clothing rubbing against it. If you don't use the clip, your fingers can cause annoying extraneous sounds, too. Bottom line, it's compact and works as designed. It just isn't designed all that well. And for the price, I suppose that's all you can really expect. I'll keep it as an emergency back-up travel mic, but it's really no better than the built-in mic on my Olympus 300M."},{"rating":"2","title":"pretty handy!","review":"This is a pretty handy little tool to have when conducting interviews, or if you just don't want to hold the recorder up to your face 24/7.

I listened to quite a few similar multi-speaker combo systems before purchasing the JBL. It is way better than either Boston Acoustics or Cambridge Soundworks systems that are priced higher. Its true that there are better systems out there, but for a reasonable price, you can get yourself a good sounding system. If you like classical or jazz the treble is crisp, and if you like rock or rap, trust me, the bass is more than sufficient to shake your house. In addition, the subwoofer is a tasteful deep black, and the satellite speakers are quite inconspicuous. The JBL SCS125 can be integrated into your sound space nicely and easily fills the space with deep, rich sound. You be the judge and go listen yourself, then get this system and have enough cash left over to get a new component!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy for music reproduction.","review":"This system is at best adequate for Home Theatre in a smaller room.

Mr. Wilson lets his reader experience what it is like to drive and/or ride in an eighteen wheeler. But this book is more than a description of life on the road. Mr. Wilson makes observations about life, his and other's. He shows kindness toward the people he meets and tries to understand why they are out there,too.Mr. Wilson, like the authors of \\"Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance\\" and \\"Moby Dick\\" uses detailed descriptions of men performing a particular occupation to make universal observations about his beliefs and questions about life. He never gets preachy, though, and just when the writing might be getting a little bit \\"mystical\\" something happens with the \\"load\\" or the equipment and he pulls us right back into the urgency of the moment. This is a fascinating book for anyone who ever wondered what those guys inside those big trucks that whiz past us on the freeway at 3:00 am. are really like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly enough of what I expected","review":"This otherwise well-written book spent way too many words telling me about what food and liquids Mr. Wilson ingested during his days and too many flowery descriptions of the sunsets and other things he viewed out the window.I wanted to know much more about his initial training (almost no information provided about that), the operation/maintenance chores of the tractors and trailers (some of that provided, but not enough) and the financial aspects of being a long-haul trucker (very little mention of that). Also almost completely missing was information about the well-known sordid aspects of truck stops.Mr. Wilson seems to be a fine writer and should know his stuff about trucking so I'd ask him to write another book, this time mostly about what he omitted from his first book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book could have been interesting, but was written in a boring diary format that desperately needed some polishing with the help of a professional writer.Being a former truck driver I can tell you that the world of OTR trucking is a bizarre sub-culture of America. The average person would be very surprised, shocked -- and a bit scared if they knew what goes on out on the highways, in the rest stops, and in the truck stops of this country. And watch out after the sun goes down! Truckers rarely speak of this as it portrays the profession in a bad light, but sometimes the truth hurts.Wilson could have written about this sub-culture, but instead wrote incessantly about the most boring and mundane parts of the job. I have no doubt that Wilson was one of the few who did not take part in this renegade trucker behavior; however, he could never convince me that he did not see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Holiday Cinderella","review":"This doll is actually the holiday cinderella doll, which it fails to mention in the ad.

However, we only ran them each for less than 2 months when they both just stopped working. The first one went out and I thought it may have just been something I did or a flaw with that specific one, but then about a week later the other one did the same thing. I'm so upset because these were amazing, but they are not worth it if they die out so fast. I didn't move them around a lot or treat them harshly, one sat in the living room and the other in the foyer. Very frustrating.

We have radiator heat in an old Chicago condo, which means the radiators can be loud and the heat unpredictable. So I found this fantastic heater that is quiet and heats the room incredibly well! It's perfect and I know as soon as she begins to walk that I won't be worried about her touching it since it isn't hot to touch and if knocked over, it turns off. The only thing is I wish it had a temperature gauge and had an automatic shut off option once it hit a certain temperature- but honestly, I'm not sure this actually exists. All in all, this is perfect- we have it on the floor in her room, tucked away by a desk during the day and pull it out on the floor at night."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soo quiet!","review":"I have to admit that looks had a great deal to do with why I chose this one.

I would recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Effective little heater","review":"This heater is small, but it does the job. I bought it to use in a bathroom that never seems to get warm in the winter. It is quiet and keeps the room a comfortable temperature. Since I have pets, I like the safety features, so I know that little noses won't get burned and it will cut off if tipped over. It's very light weight and easy to move around, and since it is so small, it's easy to store at the back of the closet during the summer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"I received this heater the other day. When I opened the Amazon box, I noticed the tape on the outside looked odd and like the box was part of a return from another customer. But, I thought a return could be for more than just damaged. I plugged in the heater and it worked for less than 60 seconds. Now it doesn't even turn on. This heater might work fine normally. Why I'm giving this 1 star is that this company sent me out a heater that had already clearly been returned by another customer.

The idea of an electric heater in a child's room freaks me out but her room stays considerably cooler than the others upstairs. We tried pumping up the heat but then our other daughter and ourselves are too hot. This heater provides several safety features that help alleviate some of the worries. It has an anti-tip switch that shuts it off, and an over heat safety switch too. It is not blazing hot on the main surface but I would keep my hand on it too long. I just put it up on a dresser and put it far enough back to keep it out of reach. The cord is secured behind the dresser and I feal comfortable leaving it to run in her room.

After waiting for 10 minutes, I grew increasinly colder, it still hadn't come back on. I tried moving it to the coldest room (mudroom with no supplemental heat) and still it shut off. Tried letting it rest to possibly reset itself and no matter what, it shut off again. I can only think that it is defective in some way given the great reviews by others.

There isnt 1 bad song on this cd. \\"You Were Meant For Me\\", \\"Touch Me\\" and \\"Dreaming\\" are 3 excellent songs. Her duet with Willie Valentin called \\"Love You Need You\\" is one of the best freestyle duets Ive ever heard! I also love her remake of \\"What Will You Do\\".

The truth is, this cd is actually another good reason as to why latin hip-hop dance music is struggling. I gave \\"Dreaming\\" 2 stars (and I'm being real generous) only because of it's commercial releases which tricked me into purchasing this piece of garbage. What's a shame is that Synthia has a good voice but she's constantly singing the same played out, predictable lyrics over played out, predictable beats. This cd hits its lowest point with an extremely agonizing and corny cover of \\"Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow\\".

My son, who is 14 wanted a lighter one so that he could split with me so I bought him this one. It does have a nice handle but the head is pathetic. Neither one of us could reliably get the thing to split logs. One of us would swing it and it would just dent the log. I would switch to my eight pound and the log would split. I compared the two and there is not nearly as much taper on the the Truper six pound as there is on my eight so I took a grinder to it and tapered the head to match my older maul. The maul splits like a dream now.If you're having trouble getting this maul to split consistently try having more of a taper ground into the head, something Truper might want to do from the factory."},{"rating":"1","title":"all crust/ no lobster","review":"IT HAS BEEN 14 MONTHS SINCE I HAVE HAD THIS DISH..

A Monk Swimming has none of the nuances or poetry of Angela's Ashes; Malachy seems to have learned nothing from his misspent life. But he tells his tales (tall and otherwise) with wit and charm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedious and irritating","review":"The sole purpose of this book is to alert us to how much of a \\"card\\" McCourt is; how no party would be complete without him; and how so many parties have centered around him. The book is unrelenting in its promotion of McCourt's ego. Parts of it, frankly, I do not believe. His behavior as described throughout is boorish. To buy this book is only to give support, however tenuous, to his belief that his behavior is in some way amusing or acceptable. Tedious and irritating in the extreme."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloody Awful","review":"One star is extravagant and unwarranted praise for this terrible book.

Im sorry I wasted my money and my time..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I very much wanted to like this book... but was disappointed","review":"McCourt's bawdy memoir left me disappointed. His tales of bar-hopping, name-dropping, gold-smuggling, and family-desertion had me rolling my eyes. Yes, I had a couple of chuckles at Malachy's adventures, but they were few and far between. I bought the book because he was Frank's brother and thought it would be a decent read. This is only the second time in my life I wanted to return the book and ask for my cash back."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was disappointed with this book","review":"I must say that I missed the humor in this book. It appears to me that the author is trading off the popularity of his brother.

Not a book at all, not even a good story. McCourt must be much wittier in person that he is in print, his Irish gift of gab must have taken in his editor. He should take one of his brother's writing classes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Congrats, Malachy! You've made a quick buck!","review":"I was one of many who first read Angela's Ashes, and then moved on to A Monk Swimming. Having siblings myself, I realized that the two books would most likely be different. What I didn't expect however was to have to slog through a couple hundred pages of name dropping, stories of macho bar hopping, fighting, abandoning wife and children....for what? To help Malachy make a a few dollars by riding on brother Frank's coattails! Granted there were moments of hilarious humor too real to be made up, but I would not have missed a thing had I NOT read the book! One would appreciate this book only if one appreciates hearing tall tales and name dropping whilst imbibing SEVERAL stouts in the local bar! My advice: skip the book and wait for the movie starring Malachy as himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Monk Swimming","review":"After listening on tape to Angela's Ashes and Tiz, which was narrated by Frank McCourt, I couldn't wait to listen to \\"A Monk Swimming\\". What a disappointment! Malachy McCourt, like his brother, was the narrator on the tape. Malachy was not a very good narrator. The book was hard to follow and I wonder if everything he says he did was true. The ending left a person hanging wondering what happened to his marriage and children. I felt that since Frank wrote a book(s), Malachy decided to \\"cash in\\" also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining enough, but disappointing","review":"Malachy McCourt certainly has a way with words, but I'm afraid his adventrues are not all that riveting, and the few tantalising glimpses that we have into other aspects of his life are not fully developed (for instance, who is Diana, to whom the book is dedicated with such love?).\\"Angela's Ashes\\", by big brother Frank, is far superior."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Rip Off","review":"This book was a rip off. I felt as though I was Malachy's latest victim in his con game. Can I rate this book lower than 1 star?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Clever phrases can't excuse Malachy McCourt's sordid youth.","review":"Malacy McCourt isn't the writer his brother Frank is, although he can sometimes turn a clever phrase. However, his facility for language can't hide the fact that he spent his early days in New York engaged in boozing, whoring, and illegal activity. Perhaps we're supposed to find his antics amusing or cute, but to me this is a tale of a wasted, squalid life. Since the book ends somewhere in the 60's, I smell a sequel coming, wherein I'm sure Mr. McCourt has an ephiphany and turns his life around. I won't be wasting my time reading it, though. Let's be honest--were it not for the success (and rightfully earned success) of \\"Angela's Ashes,\\" would anyone care about Malachy McCourt or his book?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Drunkalogue From An Expert Practicioner Thereof","review":"Anyone who has ever attended a 12 step meeting will recognize A MONK SWIMMING for what it is, a typical \\"drunkalogue.\\" McCourt regales the reader with tales of binges and betrayals intermixed with a healthy dose of name dropping. He talks of illegal acts (gold smuggling) as if they were something to be proud of. He seems to think that he's cute. I happen to think that he's not.His brother, Frank, has written a very good book. Malachy should leave the writing to the writer in the family and stick to his day job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let me save you some time if you haven't read this book yet...","review":"Here's the deal: Do you enjoy poorly written books about constant drinking, boorish behavior, and sexual athleticism that left me wondering if he wasn't a candidate for constant STDs or worse. Egad, this was bad! AND lots of namedropping, but don't look for interesting tales of these famous men, because there are none...just the names of those he met and drank with. What a total waste of time, ink and paper. YUCK!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A major dissappointment after reading Angela's Ashes.","review":"On the coattails of his brother's classic hit(Angela's Ashes), A Monk Swimming by Malachy McCort is a singular dissapointment. This memoir can be summed up as a superficial glimpse into an arrogant Irishman's experience getting laid and drunk in America. I wish I had spent my money buying 'Tis by Frank McCourt, instead. However, I gave the book two stars because I'm Irish, too, and can relate to some of his humorous midadventures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reader must assume the role of a bartendar","review":"Granted - there are a number of very witty lines in this book, and I don't doubt that I'd find Malachy quite hilarious were I serving him in a pub. However, this book has no depth and seems extremely egotistical - no plot, no theme, just the constant rambling and repetition that is known all too well by anyone who has loved an alcoholic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting","review":"I don't consider myself a prude, but I found A Monk Swimming to be a disgusting, waste-of-time book about a drunk and a womanizer with no redeeming qualities. Some humor in spots, but they were overshadowed by the unpleasant escapades that he endulged in. 'Tis a shame that I write this after enjoying his brother's book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A humorous journey through an Irishman's logic.","review":"I was curious to read this book since I found his brother's book \\"Angela's Ashes\\" among my favorites. I've met a few Irish folk from across the sea, and their humor and sense of fun mirrors those of Malachy. The anecdotal stories caught me in a laugh many times. His use of the English language is equally amusing. And not unlike \\"Angela's Ashes,\\" Malachy McCourt can easily inject humor into any difficult moment. A lesson for all of us. Anyone planning of spending some time in an Irish pub, should read this book first."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dissapointing","review":"Enjoyed Angela's Ashes and had hoped that Malachy had some of the talent for writing that his brother Frank showed. However, it would seem Malachy's talents are all inherited from what we have read of his father - he is a drunkard, womanizer and has no education. He even brags that his brother is the only Teacher in the US without a High School diploma. If that is indeed so, it certainly does not show in Frank's writing, but is typical of the sort of down play Malachy makes of all his characters. He appears as a thoroughly dispicable character and his book is not worth the time to plough through!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Some interesting moments, but McCourt needs writing lessons","review":"Like many others, I loved Angela's Ashes, by Frank McCourt, the brother of Malachy McCourt. I wanted to hear more of the McCourt story. I ignored the bad review in the New York Times.I should have listened to the New York Times.Though the book has some interesting moments, McCourt has trouble describing them. His writing is stilted, awkward, and preachy. That's too bad because there were some good bits, like when he claims to have meet Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip. With better editing and perhaps writing lessons, this book could have been so much better.There is only one reason this book is on the best seller list: Angela's Ashes. On its own, I cannot see how A Monk Swimming could generate such interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"chronic debauchery with no redeeming moment","review":"Despite the wonderfully colorful, brilliantly whimsical prose, this book was frustrating. I read on and on, enduring the sad path of chronic alcoholism and eggregiously amoral behavior, waiting hopefully for Malachy to reflect some insight or remorse, but it never happens. He must have had friends who tried to intercept this destructive behavior but they are not mentioned. He never brings us up to the present time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Try the audio version","review":"Malachy McCourt is an actor, not a writer. As somebody once said of Finnegan's Wake, it only makes sense when spoken aloud, with a faint brogue. He has no eye; so you often have read and reread sentences to understand what he means, and his syntax is needlessly elaborate. He does have the Irish instinct for wordplay--he calls his brother's fiancee \\"The War Department\\". But what gave \\"Angela's Ashes\\" its power was a certain restraint and understatement. None of that here. Since this book would never have seen print without the success of his brother's, Malachy will just have to endure the comparisons. Get that money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A somewhat entertaining but shallow read.","review":"I was looking forward to reading this memoir by Malachy McCourt, especially after having read (and loved)\\"Angela's Ashes\\", by Frank McCourt. Although I knew when I began the book that it was a completely different book in tone, I was disappointed by the shallow and insensitive narration of past events. Malachy seemed unable to care about anyone around him except in the most superficial of ways (ie, \\"the mother\\"). When I finished the book, I felt less like I'd been entertained and more like I'd been cautioned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stories meant to be heard, not read","review":"I have no doubt that if I was in a pub with Mr. McCourt, and he started telling stories, I would be enthralled. He is the quintessential Irish storyteller. Unfortunately, his patter doesn't translate to the page very well. His stories end up sounding forced, stilted, sometimes simply obscene. What may be missing here is the knowing smile or wink (which we'd see in the pub) that tell us what he's really thinking."},{"rating":"1","title":"He isn't his brother.","review":"This book sucks so bad that I returned it !! I was expecting something on the lines of Angela's Ashes and what I got was garbage. Malachy saw a chance to ride on brother Frank's success, and wrote a sordid memoir of a drunken failure who spends his life leeching on others. What a waste of paper and my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"An embarrassment to his brother, Frank.","review":"This is a cheap way to cash in on brother Frank McCourt's success with \\"Angela's Ashes\\". Even without comparing the two books (and you can't), this book is trash. Malachy boldly writes of drinking, his sexual conquests and more drinking. I thought he had it bad in Ireland, but maybe he'd be better off there, poor. Can't believe I wasted my money on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bring on more Malachy!","review":"It serves no purpose to compare the two brothers. They are different writers/talents and different human beings. As my own personality tends to be more like Frank, I am particularly delighted with this fresh and humorously 'sobering' book from Malachy. (Couldn't help the pun.)Malachy is JUST TELLING A STORY - HIS STORY! Readers should try to get over their own personal, perhaps uptight issues and enjoy the humanity that Malachy is offering up. What a unique glimpse into a personality that most of us rarely see, or want to see, close up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever . . .","review":"When I read Frank McCourt's \\"Angela's Ashes,\\" I was intrigued by Frank's affectionate portrayal of his brother Malachy. So intrigued, that I immediately bought \\"A Monk Swimming\\" to learn more about this amusing character. What an amazing disappointment. He has abolutely no redeeming qualities whatsoever. During the course of the book, I found him more and more offensive. I didn't even finish it, and I rarely put a book away without finishing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I picked up \\"A Monk Swimming\\" thinking I was going to get more on the progress of the McCourt brothers journey out of the depths of abject physical and emotional poverty. I knew Frank had made it after reading both of his books. I was so disappionted that Malachy McCort spent 290 pages telling the world what a total reprobate he was, and never got to any level of awareness. A tale of misspent youth, and life. It was interesting to note that the \\"About the Author\\" blurb indicates he is a happily married father of 5...I would have liked to know how that happened as the book certainly didn't give one any indication that he was was heading toward an epiphany that would result is such a dramatic change...I am delighted that this occured, and would have enjoyed reading how, rather than the ad nauseam of his immature antics."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book I have read in ages!","review":"This is the worst book I have read in ages. Not only is it extremely badly written, but it is badly written by a chauvinistic, alcoholic & obnoxious bore with an over-inflated ego.\\".....in my opinion, there wasn't a party in New York City that was complete without my wit & my exuberance, not to mention my presence.\\"The content of this book is extremely poor. Malachy has nothing worthwhile to tell & has learned nothing from his harsh childhood.If you liked 'Angela's Ashes', try 'Bridge Across my Sorrows' by Christina Noble. Also about a harsh, Irish Catholic childhood. The difference being that Christina Noble has done something worthwhile with her life."},{"rating":"1","title":"There really isn't much","review":"in this book. I definitely got the idea that it was published only because of the success of his brother's books. I thought it might be an eye-witness account of NYC life in the '50's and 60's but it is not. He was too drunk at the time to remember anything. Couple a bothersome writiing style with the repetitious re-telling of the same story over and over and you have this book. There was only one story that made me laugh. He finds his hated father in bed with two bald old women. Malachy shakes his dad awake who looks around and asks \\" Who are these guys?\\"That's it - now you don't have to read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"STUNNING, BRILLIANT, INTELLIGENT, FRIGGING HILARIOUS","review":"mm has the touch. now that he has lived long and learned so much, he can look back and see. compare this book not to angela's ashes, but to 'tis, and you will see just how good mm's book about his crazy, stupid, fun life really is. i'm glad he was not my father, but he lived it and we're better for it. natural wit and sparkling natural intelligence make this book a must read for any millenium. since so many of us paddies died en route and so many were illiterate all of their lives, mm will just have to speak for us all. we're damn lucky."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK...2+ stars...Enjoy it for what it is","review":"If you're expecting Frank's brother to have the same lyrical writing style or the same quality, you will be sorely disappointed. Except for the hype, one would not know these two were brothers by the writing. However, at times it is uproariously funny, but the drunken larks and women seem to get somewhat repetitive and tiresome. For the most part, it held my attention, but it's one of those books you could open about anywhere and not have missed that much. Pretty good for a book to read on a plane."},{"rating":"1","title":"a real ego trip","review":"IF I HEARD ONCE MORE OF HIS DIPPING HIS WICK AND LEAVING HIS WIFE AND CHILDREN AT HOME WHILE HE DRANK THE DAY AWAY AND SMUGGLED GOLD..., THERE IS NOTHING TO ADMIRE IN THIS MAN. HE IS TOTALLY SELF-CENTERED AND THIS ENTIRE BOOK IS AN EGO TRIP. THIS DOES NOT EVEN TOUCH ANGELA'S ASHES........"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech!","review":"Let's face it... the only reason you'd look into reading this book is if you have already read and enjoyed Angela's Ashes. Well, don't bother. If there was some story line buried between the covers of this book, I never found it. I'm still wondering why I forced myself to read the whole thing! How anyone could think that name dropping, drinking and being a bad father and husband is great reading is beyond me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trust the others, I didn't; it's not worth it!","review":"I really wanted to read this book, I read all of the reviews, most of them bad. I figured that they were snobs who had read his brother's book. Since I enjoy a good laugh and a light read occasionally I went ahead and bought the book in spite of the reviews. Trust me, they were right. It's not that funny (one LOL), it's mostly boring, talk-show kind of crap. Suit yourself, but I'll admit that I should have listened."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUST LIKE HIS FATHER!","review":"Too bad Malachy didn't leave well enough alone-the description his brother, Frank, gave him was just enough and probably the best anyone would care to give him.It is often said there is a \\"black sheep\\" in every Irish family - well - this guy can go for two!Don't waste time or money on this stupid admission of his personal bad news."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY disappointing . . .","review":"I was thrilled to see that Malachy McCourt had written his own memoirs. Frank painted a charming portrait of his brother, but Malachy truly disappoints.I wasn't impressed by his exploits, nor was I impressed by his story-telling talent. He displayed no redeeming qualities, and after a short time, I did not care whatever became of him, but trudged through all the same.Please don't torture yourself with this book. If you are determined to read it anyway, wait for the paperback -- but don't say I didn't warn you."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book put the Irish race back 400 years! Sad!","review":"My own Irishness enjoyed his rapier Irish wit at first--after that fun beginning his book traveled ever downhill. The only reason I continued reading was to find the place where \\"until he (Malachy) had no choice but to stop and turn and face his past\\" as stated on the jacket cover. Was that part of the story left out? Maybe he's planning on writing a sequel. I'd like to think Malachy grew up. His childhood was indeed horrible, but when he matured (?) he must have sometime realized that he had to take responsibily for his own actions. His \\"words\\" to God especially sickened me. Glad I got this book from the library rather than putting money out for it. His \\"bro\\" Frank is a prince!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I should have waited for the paperback - what a waste of time and money. The only thing I got out of it was the proper way to pronounce 'Cead Mille Failte'. I was half-expecting something similar to Hamill's 'A Drinking Life' (five stars in my eyes) but was very disappointed"},{"rating":"1","title":"More selfishness","review":"Malachy is not the man his brother is, and it was downright painful to read this book. His memoirs are filled with acts of selfishness and carelessness, without any appretiation of others nor the world he was in. A huge contrast to Frank."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for the the book club","review":"Only for the book club would I have completed this book. I did not enjoy it and see the writing as an affectation of Irishness. The dialect did not ring true as authentic at all. Not to ever read sez, face hole, blower, bro, bod, fleshpots, premi, and other terms that can't be placed in this review would please me greatly.It appears to me that Malachy McCourt can only be capitalizing on his brother, Frank's, literary success. Obviously, Malachy is well read, has educated himself, and supports civil rights and social justice. These are positives, but the only positives I see.What a shame that there are some 35 more years to go in his memoir. I hope he declines to continue writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic......really pitiful","review":"Boy was this a waste of money. The book finished without further direction or conclusion...as though McCourt had to drop pen and head out to get faceless again. In the words of Ross Perot; \\"drunken tales of moral emptiness\\". Reading this book was more depressing that amusing. I would give this an inverted rating if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"Even though I had heard that \\"A Monk Swimming\\" was no \\"Angela's Ashes\\", I was expecting something better. While I enjoyed the author's command of the language and his wonderful prose, I was bored with the constant tales of drinking etc. A somewhat depressing book, and I did not find it funny at all. Sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wash your mouth out with soap, Malachy","review":"I was expecting to be charmed by another McCourt, but instead I was shocked by the use of profanity on the second page and then again in later chapters. Malachy, if you MUST use the f-word, please use the less offensive Irish version. It truly detracts from the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abysmal!","review":"Wonder what Frank's younger brother Malachy (or is it Malady?) has been up to? He's gone off and written himself a book with the thought that those of us who loved Angela's Ashes will at least pony up the $16.77 to feed what must be one of the all-time big egos. Malachy's book has none of the charm, poignancy or appeal of the elder McCourt's. Malachy bypasses most of the obvious opportunities to write something worth reading, opting instead to name-drop and describe incredibly boorish feats of bravado (disrobing in a restaurant where he was asked to check his topcoat--gosh, was I impressed!). My advice? Readers-save your dough; Malachy-don't give up your soaps."},{"rating":"1","title":"The wrong McCourt","review":"This hackneyed 12-step \\"drunk-a-log\\" is a load of Irish tripe. And I say that as an Irish fan of Frank McCourt."},{"rating":"1","title":"This mpnk dorwned","review":"A Monk Swimming has to be one of the worst books I have ever read. I am convinced that it was published because of the author's brother's literary success. Page after page of name dropping isn't a memoir."},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughing all the way to the bank","review":"Talk about brand extension! If you weren't cynical about publishers before, you will be now. McCourt can't write. The book collapses after the first chapter. The space devoted to his gold-smuggling career is repetitious filler, not funny the first time around. Who edited this mess? The problem with the book is not that McCourt was a womanizing drunk: it's that he can't make the life of a womanizing drunk sound funny or interesting."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Monk Sucking","review":"It's a story filled with dichotomies. Malachy continually lauds himself for standing up for the downtrodden yet casually refers to women as \\"fleshpots\\". He villifies his father by calling him irresponsible, oversexed, drunk. This self-pitying fool seems to be unaware that his actions prove that he is no better, and possibly even worse, than his father.In the back of the book it says that he is happily married. I kept waiting to hear about the love of his life. Instead you'll hear him glorify the mire of his former life.I so desperately wanted to like this book but I found myself doing just the opposite."},{"rating":"2","title":"M. McCourt's Biographical Ancedotes Sure to Entertain","review":"Those of a delicate nature may wish to avoid this colorful compilation of essentially biographically ancedotes compiled by an Irishman of not insubstantial roguish accomplishments. Those who appreciate the impressions and musings of a real character, however, will throughly enjoy Malachy McCourt's recital of some of his more notable encounters with characters famous and not. While the author's efforts will most certainly initially receive more attention due to the recent and highly publicized literary achievements of his brother Frank (\\"Angela's Ashes\\"), the writing itself soon captivates the reader and displays the author's own mastery of the language and the art of storytelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Apples and Oranges Would be More Appropriate to Compare","review":"If people could come to accept this book as a discrete item rather than as a book penned by one of the McCourts, perhaps they could enjoy it fully. This book, perhaps to readers' disappointment, is not about the Limerick slums: it's about an angry young man who blows through America, a hedonist's heaven, and doesn't make excuses for his actions. And what a refrefshing read! Reading this book is like sitting across from M. McCourt at a barroom table as he spins tale upon tale, sometimes making us raise our eyebrows but nearly always making us collapse with laughter. I can almost taste the Guinness, and taste the tears of mirth and regret."},{"rating":"2","title":"a perfect blend of poetry and truck driver's slang","review":"I liked Angela's Ashes which described Malachy as flambouyant and frivolous. I bought A Monk Swimming out of curiosity, and I must I admit my prejudice. I was ready to slam it before even reading it, thinking that Malachy was just riding on his brother's popularity. But I was wrong. I was a little scandalized with Malachy's revelations about his sexcapades. But I must admit I fell for his literary style. I loved the way he waxed poetry to his truck driver's language. I liked his lack of linguistic inhibitions I mean, the way he freely defied the English language gurus. After reading this, I realized it's not fair to refer to Malachy simply as Frank's brother."},{"rating":"2","title":"chalk one up for malachy!","review":"Having read Angela's Ashes and knowing what a cute and charming lad Malachy was in childhood I was dying to know how he would \\"turn out.\\" Needless to say, I was not disappointed....Malachy's misadventures made me laugh out loud and wonder if I would ever get to know someone that zany with a gigantic lust for life...both McCourt brothers have been blessed with the gift of storytelling...don't pass it up."},{"rating":"1","title":"I missed something here....","review":"The back cover shows a young and feisty Malachy McCourt while the front shows a nearly invisible old man. From these and the title I expected somewhere an epiphany of sorts which never happened. Other than to make a quick buck, what were the publishers thinking? A memoir of all the drunken and forgotten evenings Mr McCourt spent left me wondering what the point was. I felt I had just finished an autobiography by Mother Theresa and followed it with one by Peter OToole. McCourt had to know there would be comparisons, especially because brother Franks book was an exceptional memoir as well as a finely crafted book. Had I bought the book I would be demanding my money back. I feel, to put it in the authors word. . . . shagged..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Than This","review":"I wanted to like Malachy McCourt, I met him in Angela's Ashes, and was so glad he'd made his way to the US and a possible fortunate future with food and housing.Malachy McCourt takes all the goodness and prosperity that was before him and drinks it away, just like his father. That isn't reason to give this book a 2 star rating though.The rating is because the book is a shallow account of a shallow man who in writing this book is a name dropping account of his tenuous stardom.The book started of well enough; McCourt can be a very clever writer but it just got so egotistical- how many women he could and did sleep with, how many drinks he could and did drink. how many people he could and did swear at, how many well known people he could and did insult. His writing ability deserved better than thisThe best of the book is to be read in the last part five- Father to the Man. It is heartbreaking and so well written.

You've been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T WASTE YOUR TIME....","review":"This book is a great dissappointment. If you are looking for the artistry Frank McCourt's ANGELAS ASHES you are not going to find it here. Malachy does not have his brother's gift for words. And who cares about his irresponsible youth all over New York and India?? It is a book that would never have been printed if it was not for brother Frank and his glowing succes with the fabulous ANGELAS ASHES. Take my word for it, don't waste your time with A MONK SWIMMING....please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment!","review":"Desperate for more of the McCourt family stories, I decided to read this book by Frank's brother. What a disappointment. The ability to colorfully tell a story is there (possibly a family trait), but there was little to cherish in this story. My expectation that this would be a character who would rise above his impoverished beginnings were shattered by his squandering of opportunities. My hope was that the character would at some point take stock of his life and decide it was time to take responsibility for it. I assume things became better, but I have no intention of reading any more by this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"IN THEIR FACES MALACHY!","review":"FOR ANYONE WHO HAS EVER GROWN UP ON \\"THE WRONG SIDE OF THE TRACKS\\" AND CARED TO RELIVE THE EXPERIENCE FOR MILLIONS TO CRITICIZE I SAY HOORAY! MOST OF US HAVE NEVER HAD TO LIVE THROUGH THAT LEVEL OF HELL. SO HOW CAN YOU JUDGE THE MAN ON HIS OWN PERSONAL DEMONS? I FOUND THE BOOK TO BE INTERESTING FOR THE SIMPLE FACT THAT HE WAS TELLING THE READER THAT WHILE HE MAY HAVE BEEN BOASTING ABOUT THE LIFESTYLE, IT WAS A RESULT OF HIS RUNNING AWAY FROM HIS PROBLEMS. THIS BOOK IS ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT HE STOPPED RUNNING AND FACED THEM. IT IS AMAZING TO ME HOW FRAGILE OUR CHILDHOOD REALLY IS AND HOW IN MANY RESPECTS THAT TIME IN OUR LIVES IS THE FOUNDATION FOR WHO WE ULTIMATELY BECOME. FOR SOMEONE WHO CAME FROM THAT BACKGROUND AND ENDED UP WHERE HE IS NOW IS A FEAT THAT MOST OF US CANNOT EVEN FATHOM!"},{"rating":"1","title":"rip off","review":"This book was enjoyable but i'm sure some exagerations were involved. About 1/4 way through, much seemed as if i read this before. Then it came to me, this is a rip off of \\"The Ginger Man\\" by J.P. Donleavy. To my amazement, the author actually mentions this book later on. At least Donleavy's book was a novel.Big brother ought to smack the little brother for this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritating and egotistical","review":"I've been taking a break from this book for over a month now. I just can't bring myself to go onto the next chapter. I'll admit i expected something \\"rollicking and fun\\" but this is just some ego-maniac given a soapbox to stand on. I wish I had just gotten the audio version as i think the language would've worked that way - seeing it printed out was just too irritating : \\"just a mo'\\"? I've finished 2 other books during the breaks i've taken from this one and at this rate I should be finished by Christmas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who cares","review":"I had just finished reading \\"Tis\\" by Frank McCourt which I was already dissapointed in, but thought a quick follow up of Malachy's book would be an interesting comparison since both were written basically about the same years in their lives here in America. Why would the author think that readers would want to know about every drunken escapade in his life? Every chapter was about drinking, womanizing and name dropping. I did not find anything likable or funny about him. After reading \\"Tis\\" and \\"Monk Swimming\\", I no longer felt that pain for either author for their poverty stricken childhood. Neither one of these boys grew into nice men. The chip on the shoulder remains throughout."},{"rating":"1","title":"A hardy start, but loses drive towards the end","review":"I was at first disgusted by Malachy McCourt's attempt to live off his brother Frank's success as a writer, but when I actually picked up A Monk Swimming, I was impressed by his originality and divorce from imitation. The first half or so of the book consists of some dubiously and some exceedingly funny tales told in creative, innovative language. Somewhere along the way, however, the book descends into a ultimate sameness, page after page: the drunkeness and sex escapades of the author. At the same time, Malachy runs out of ways to make English interesting. In the end, although a reformation is hinted at, none is ever really told, and the book is concluded with stories of Malachy's father, Malachy, which really don't fit the previous theme."},{"rating":"1","title":"drunk-a-log","review":"What a disappointment. No depth. A poorly written drunk-a-log. What did he do get his 4th step published?

I should not have wasted both the money and time in purchasing and reading this lousy book."},{"rating":"1","title":"victriolic nonsense","review":"If you like pointless sarcastic vitriolic junk, buy this book. Mr McCourt has nothing good to say about anything. He attacks everything here, captitalism, God, religion, Ireland, England America, rich folk, poor folk, his family with absolutely no wisdom of any kind to contribute. He seems to find nobility in drunkeness, public nudity promiscuitity and profanity. What a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Capitalizing on big bro's success","review":"I took two books with me for my extended plane flight - \\"A Monk Swimming\\" and \\"Airframe\\" by Crichton. Relatively scared of flying, I didn't realize that Airframe was about plane crashes until I was in the air. Upon trudging through 35 pages of \\"A Monk Swimming\\" I found that sitting in a cold sweat during each bump of the plane in turbulence, reading \\"Airframe\\", was better than reading what might be the worst book my eyes have ever scanned through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange","review":"Frank McCourt wasn't really perfect. He drank quite a bit, left his wife and child. And yet, despite all of that and his affairs he is somewhat endearing. He also went on to become a teacher struggling to teach teenagers who had their minds on other things.But, his bother on the other hand. I just don't get him. The way he did foolish things wtihout much thought and was rude to his wife...Perhaps I am just judgemental, but I just don't like a Monk Swimming as much as Angela's Ashes. I know the books are entirely different, by different people, but still. Frank's story is the more interesting of the two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Junk with Letters Thrown In","review":"This book is junk. How dare Frank McCourt's brother sponge off Frank like this! I couldn't get past the first few pages, it was so bad. I wasn't expecting an Angela's Ashes; I would have settled for a little bit of honesty from the author! Is that too much to ask? I quickly got tired of the author telling of his exuberant, extraverted adventures as a boy, then having either the audacity or the blindness to claim a page later how he was just this \\"shy\\" little creature. Malachey couldn't be shy if his life depended on it! What a bunch of mularkey. This whole book was a scam. Don't waste your money. What little I read was terribly poor writing. This man had no business entering the field of writing, he is an actor and bartender who has obviously spent very little time honing any sort of craft, he is simply a remora fish eating the crumbs off the tailfin of his brother.And the countless, shameless name-dropping! Who cares! This was a fiasco."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Reading","review":"I just finished both of Frank Mc court's books which were wonferful. I just bought this book by his brother. I am only on the second Chapter and I love the book already. I am looking forward to reading this book and I hope it brings a great story like the last to books. Thank You"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, I get it, and this book is an Abomination","review":"At some point in this book, probably half-way, I realized \\"Yes, this IS all there is.\\" So, is this book a joke, another middle finger from Malachy to the rest of us because his Dad was a bum, etc.? I think so. How else can you explain it? A joke. Unless, of course, you're stimulated by repetitious sexual self-aggrandizement or wish your to fortify your opinion that the Irish are a putrid race. Thank God we're all not like Malachy, \\"dipping the wick\\" into any unlucky woman who walks into our spheres of forceful inebriated influence. Just because a man is clever with the language and has 3 tall tales to tell over and over ad nauseum does not justify publishing this tripe. I am a sucker. ZERO STARS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tired barstool tales retold to capitalize on Frank's success","review":"I agree that M. McCourt's book should not be compared with Angela's Ashes. One is a heartfelt and beautifully written childhood memoir; the other is a hodgepodge of apochryphal stories, much embellished over the years, put down on paper to make a fast buck. I am not surprised by M. McCourt's desire to do this. The praise lavished on the book's style and language by people who should know better is a surprise. I find the book thin,self involved and above all intensely repetitive. Change the names, change the location,add the usual diatribe about the Brits and you've completed another chapter. This was easy money for Malachy McCourt. Thank heaven mine was a borrowed copy. I own Angela's Ashes, book and unabridged on tape. But then as we have all agreed the two books should not be compared!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Loser's Lament","review":"As some recent reviews mention, I don't think McCourt is truly proud of his past. But he clearly is not too proud to immerse his readers in the graphic details of his drunken, selfish days. (Which the dust jacket assures us are over and that he is happily married.) Honest? About as honest as a typical guest on Jerry Springer and just as eager to shock. I detect more than a pinch of blarney (B.S.) in these twice told tales. Funny? I never even snickered at his tiresome exploits. Perhaps McCourt's is funnier in person. What's left is a long, boring litany of self-pity, selfishness and exaggeration. Happily married? Let's ask his second wife."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't believe they are brothers...","review":"I was so eager to read A MONK SWIMMING after finishing brother Frank's ANGELA'S ASHES...I wanted to know what happenned to the McCourt brothers after their arrival in N.Y. What a disappointment! While Frank becomes a teacher and a Purlitzer Price winner, brother Malachy becomes a self-destructing, womanizing drunk, worse than his father because he knew better! I read Malachy's book because of \\"Angela's Ashes\\", and it is hard not to compare them and be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time reading this book.","review":"It is apparant that Malachy McCourt scribbled this book in order to receive some benefits of his brother's fame."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dog of a book","review":"Readers expecting a reprise of brother Frank McCourt's book will be very dissappointed. I sure was. I'm pretty compulsive about finishing books once I've started, but if I'd had another book to start I wouldn't have bothered with this one. Malachy McCourt tells of many a drunk, which are semi-credible, and many a bedding, which are not. He drops names frequently, but tells us nothing of value about anyone. A total waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have stopped with his brother's book!","review":"Perhaps my expectations were too high after reading \\"Angela's Ashes\\". Fifty pages into \\"A Monk Swimming\\", I realized I should not have bought it. After 100 pages, I stopped reading it. Malachy's story is a drunken braggard's tale of shameless debauchery. I found it had no literary value and I would not recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I'd never bought this book.","review":"I wish I had read other readers' reviews before purchasing this book. It is absolutely the worst book I have ever attempted to read. Seldom do I begin a book and not finish it.

I wouldn't recommend giving the author another sale!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow book, badly written","review":"This wretched book's defenders say that its critics are just too uptight to appreciate Malachy's story, but they're wrong. Although he is not my favorite kind of person, what I most object to about this book is how poorly written it is: The narrative is episodic instead of thoughtfully plotted; the writing style comprises nothing more than cliches, cloying mannerisms, and juvenile attempts at cleverness; and the characters range from one dimensional (the author) to all but invisible (his victims). The book gives us absolutely no one to care about. Anyone who thinks it is well written doesn't know what good writing is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont even try to compare this to his Big Brother Frank's Hit","review":"I was so dissapointed in this book. I had so looked forward to seeing Malachy's version of growing up in Ireland. I ended up reading about a drunken man who couldnt control his temper and bragged about bedding women. It gets even worse. He talks about how important he was, who he knew and how he knew them and we even got to hear about what a jerk Caroll O'Connor really is. Give it a rest Malachy. I wanted a story that wasnt about you bragging the whole story through. It made me wonder if this book shouldve been on the fiction shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"A long winded story, but short on depth","review":"I was impressed by Malachy's ignorance of the consequences of his own behavior. this was not a mea culpa even though it could have or should have been.

McCourt is an excellent writer in his own right and tells the tales of his alcoholic young adulthood with humor, sadness, and a great love of the English language. An excellent read, much more than a lark."},{"rating":"1","title":"So much talent...wasted!!","review":"Reading this book all I could think was...so much wasted talent. This book is clearly written by a man who is more in love with himself than any other human in the world. To add to this, he clearly has talents that could have taken him far but instead he boasts about all of his sexual conquests, his drunken escapades, and lack of maintaining worthy employment. Surely this shows the immaturity of Mr. McCourt. The one senerio that played over & over in this book was the abandonment by his father at an early age. McCourt tried to pull at your heartstrings about being a child without a responsible father when in reality he did the same thing to his wife & children. This book is not worth the paper it was written on and I regret wasting my time & money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Book for Masochists","review":"Let's hope that a three hundred year heritage of great Irish literature hasn't fizzled down to the level of Malachy McCourt's memoirs. It is just barely possible that the autobiographical tales of a dissolute, profane, self-absorbed, drunken, under-employed name-dropper might turn out to be interesting. But not in this volume. While reading this book, the reader is likely to find himself or herself wishing that McCourt, like a few of his unfortunate siblings, had remained on Irish soil."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"After reading Angela's Ashes and Tis, I was really looking forward to reading this book. Unfortunately, from the opening page, it became clear this guy is full of hot air and has absolutely no talent as a writer.

He and his publisher are just cashing in on his brother's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly disappointing","review":"I am a hopelessly addicted bookworm and there are very few books that I actually regret buying or reading but this would have to be one of them. The size of this man's ego is simply astounding and I read through to the very last page hoping (and truly believing) that he would wake up to himself and admit he wasn't \\"God's gift to the world\\".

I believe the directions said put paper down, but there is a reason why it comes with goggles (chips do fly at first). Doesn't take long to get all the pieces out (at least when they are excited). The only \\"bad\\" thing about the whole thing is that after awhile the back legs fall off if the kids mess with it too much. They go back in easily, but they can come out once they pick it up to look at it or move it.

To this listener, the rest of the CD is overwritten, overproduced, and at times borders on the histrionic. I guess a Yale education may not be the best available passport to some professions. There's plenty of promise, but here it is unfulfilled. I'd like to see another CD from her where she eases up a bit -- she needs to write about what she knows rather than trying to be \\"artist,\\" and to learn that there are more than two speeds -- power ballad and power power -- to performing.

Willie Hutch knows that it \\"takes sacrifice, it takes hard work, it's a way of life\\" to create timeless classics like \\"Glow\\", and that is why he has \\"reached the upper level.\\" Willie Hutch has got the glow, but this cd doesn't, and that is why it should be boycotted...if anyone is even purchasing this cd to begin with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I am a huge Willie Hutch fan. I would not recommend this disk though. It seems to be mostly his later music and not the early classics from the films \\"The Mack\\" and \\"Foxy Brown\\". I would definitely recommend picking up both of those soundtracks instead of this compilation. This disk does include a few tracks from The Mack soundtrack and the theme song from Foxy Brown. However, there is too much filler. Not the real soulful songs you would expect from Willie Hutch. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kristin Banks - Wonderful","review":"An incredible voice, with great range, doing magic with some teriffic (and very interesting) lyrics. Celine with a nice acoustic beat, and with a minor touch of country thrown in. In addition, each song is really different. The combination is hard to beat - great songs performed brilliantly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"Kristin's voice is superb and never falters during any of the songs. I particularly like \\"Jewel in your Crown\\" and \\"Another Women's Dream\\". All songs not only sound great, but the lyrics and well thought out, emotional and I found them very personal to me. I only wish I had the opportunity to see Kristin live, as being down under is a little prohibitive."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful and enjoyable to read","review":"This has been the most useful book I've found on this subject in 18 years of facilitating adolescent support and therapy groups.

It can be used as a reference, but also makes easy and enjoyable reading. I am using it as a \\"refresher\\" as I ran adolescent groups years ago and now again, am being asked to provide. I am particularlyimpressed with the mixture of Mr. Malekoff's respect for and seriousness about the children he works with, his highest recommendation of groups, as an excellent modality for this age, and his lovely sense of humor, which i believe is lacking in many treatments, for young and older, and which I always try to use or introduce to people in my care! Thanks for the helpful source!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic & Informative","review":"This is one of the few books I've held on to from my graduate coursework.

When I read Borrower of the Night, I thought it was a good book. Street of the Five Moons was better, and so forth. After Trojan Gold, I thought I had just read the best book this author was capable of producing- and, let me tell you, it was good. But then I came across Night Train To Memphis. The book was so gripping I read it twice in one night and then kept it for a week, refusing to return it to the friend I had borrowed it from.

Come on, Ms. Peters...four years is long enough!For those of you who haven't read them, I would reccomend the first four books in this series as well as the amelia Peabody books. E.

This book is closer to a soap opera then to a serious mystery novel. It reminds me little of M.C. Beaton novels, only that in my opinion those are significantly more enjoyable to read. Perhaps it has been a mistake to start with a 5th book in the series, if the 1st book in the series comes my way I will give it a try, if only to verify that the rest is not much better then the 5th. I guess these books are targeted towards female audience.On the other thought, I might give this author miss in a future it took a considerable effort to get to the end of this book.

The craft of its manufacture is high, the tone is clear and volume good, and the price is spectacular. My first worry was that this would be a dumbed down, inferior version of the Dean Performer EAB.

There are too many mistakes re: royalty, not to mention basic grammatical errors, therefore the average royal reader should skip this book. Not worth the headache and hassle! (Unless you enjoy correcting mistakes on every other page.) Plus, it does not have a very well established thesis; the authors often jump form subject to subject, making the reader guess what's coming next. Nor does the book have any real endnotes or bibliography = not the book for ANY historian."},{"rating":"2","title":"More about hemophilia and history than scandal","review":"It's too bad so many reviewers and editors chose to focus on the small part of this book which questions Queen Victoria's legitimacy, because that's not really what this book is about. It's far more about how the interbreeding of British and other European royalty had profound consequences for world history. The bulk of the book traces the competitive sexual politics prior to Victoria's birth, and the way inbreeding among royalty contributed to the spread of the hemophilia gene, causing major world upheaval (in particular, to the fall of the Russian tsar). Much has been written of the privileges of 19th century royalty, but this book brings into sharper focus the way these royals' private behavior had public consequences. An interesting treatise on an aspect of history that is often overlooked: that many European wars were family conflicts extended to a grand scale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good movie -but","review":"While I did not read all reviews those that I did read I mostly agree with.I only gave it 4 stars because I thought it was longer than it had to be to tell the story.I noticed one glaring error (but did not let it affect my rating) and that wasthe scene in which the airfield operator was repairing a piece of electronic equipment.The board that he was working on showed a series of power transistors but the mostrudimentary transistor was not invented until after the war in 1947.This movie did make me wish that some Hollywood producer would have the foresightto make a Doc-u Drama on the Woman's Air Service Pilots (WASP). There is a story thatis dieing to be told in a movie format. I only wish that I had the money to do it. :-)I think the directer of \\"A League of There Own\\" could do a good job of it.As I'm a war movie buff this DVD will go in my library but a lot of time will go by before watching it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been a great story","review":"As a World War II Commemorative Tour Director for the past 28 years, I anticipated that this movie would reveal the little-known history of aircraft were flown across the Atlantic.

This two-part Canadian Miniseries tells how a place most residents of the USA (and Canada and England, for that matter) had never heard of in 1939 became the primary embarkation point for thousands of US and Canadian built fighters and bombers flown to England to help turn the tide of the Second World War. It's an interesting story, with a little human conflict, a little star-crossed love, and a lot of pride in what the human race can do when the chips are down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting Historically","review":"This video is well done as a historical mini-series. It is not so well acted and produced that it is something to watch over-and-over, but the little-known history behind this video is worth learning and those who actually flew those missions are worthy of our respect and thanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"a hipster collector piece, not much more","review":"Observations:1) DVD obviously copied from a VHS or other low quality medium, with occasional tracking problems.2) Buddy Mix has a Ziggy Stardust hair cut.3) The two main portions of this DVD are nearly identical. Singing for Girls is just Singing for Guys but a different octave. Not much talk about the different theories behind each.4) The last section is a cheesy music video from the 80's of pure Buddy Mix propaganda.5) I would have liked a discussion on the soft palate.Conclusion:Excellent for getting your friends together and having a sing along / comedy hour. Wouldn't agree that it is the \\"complete how to sing\\" dvd... maybe some good pointers that could be worth paying less than $20."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry, but it's just ...","review":"This reads like poorly researched graduate-school blathering (which I expect it is).Mr Lock appears to have approached his sources with his thesis already formed and to have avoided all contact with anything that might force him to reconsider. Check out his footnote admitting that his use of Ellington's song title is totally inappropriate to what he's trying to make it mean, yet he decided to use it anyway!His comparison of Sun Ra's mythological musings and autobiographical confessions with slave narratives is ridiculous in that it reveals a thorough lack of knowledge of comparative religion. The author acts as though the experience of death and rebirth or of choosing a new name to reflect a new station in life were phenomena unique to (and invented by) African-Americans. He clearly didn't research this topic thoroughly.This is a really shoddy work and not worth your time, much less your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"feminism in the late Victorian era..","review":"\\"The Odd Women\\" is a very well written yet somewhat stiff read concerning the plight of a few London women on how to best proceed with their lives. Marriage? Work/career? The book dares to present women as independent, productive individuals rather than doormats for husbands. Although Gissing writes excellent prose and his characterizations are quite in depth I found the book to be bogged down with too much cerebral banter; at times it felt like I was reading a play rather than a novel. I think the book is best viewed from a historical perspective rather than as anything one would choose for reading enjoyment.Bottom line: life in late Victorian England never seemed so dull yet detailed with such richness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Getting Better!","review":"When I Bought The First Season, I Watched One Time And That Was About It, I Didn't Watch Over And Over Again Like I Did With My Simpsons, Family Guy, Or South Park Boxsets, But I Watch All Of The Season 2 Episodes On Tv And Each Episode Was Very Funny.

I remember seeing this in the theater, then finally purchasing the laser disc when it was released. This has to be one of my favorite Aussie flicks, but this version is not worth the money even if they charged a dollar. The color is muted, the sound was poor even though the box claims \\"enhanced\\" and nowhere does it state on the box or on any purchase sites that it is fullscreen, so you're left with the feeling of being taken once it arrives. WHO transfers a film musical to full screen these days? The US version is a rip off. Wait until someone in Australia takes pity on us here in the US and releases a widescreen enhanced version. I purchased mine from Barnes and Noble and immediately sent it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Album","review":"Can't say much more than other reviewers have already put in words, but thought I'd add my piece in to solidify the greatness of this album.

Very beautiful with several color photos and many rare shots. The late John Kobal was one of the best film writers of the 70's and well known for his vast photo collection.

There are critical treatment decisions to be made right after the initial diagnosis, and the choices one makes will affect one's future quality of life to a major degree. Discussions with one's urologist are helpful, but there is much to learn if one wishes to make informed decisions.Mark Schoenberg's book provides the essential facts to help bladder cancer patients make those critical decisions.

His optimistic and reassuring approach is straight forward, no beating around the bush. The reader obtains a thoroughly well rounded education through Dr.Schoenbergs' discussion of anatomy, analogies, drawings, treatments, and outcomes.Great reference book should be in everyones library. My suggestion for the book would have been to list the major Bladder Cancer Centers in the United States.

Every song on the album is amazing! From the angry \\"Deep Six\\" to the beautiful \\"Change of Season\\" and the stunning \\"Apparitions\\" MGB has it covered. I cannot wait for their new album and I am gonna fly all the way up to Canada to see them live the next chance I get!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Alternative Rock's Lyrical Answer to Tori Amos","review":"A combination of angry grooves and melancholy guitars, this band has a Tori-esque method of lyricism that touches and moves despite moments of undecipherable nonsense. Raw power and emotion shine through clearly in Matt Good's vocals. The only downfall? The similarity between some songs is striking, and would be almost monotonous at times if the music werent so darn good to begin with. Highly recommended, but new listeners to MGB should start with Beautiful Midnight."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'd give it more than 5 stars if I could.","review":"Canada's best kept secret.

Made forCanadian radio sound. And it's a shame. There seems to be suchpotential for this unit to become so much more, but it seems thatcreating a more commerical sound was the route they opted for.Thesad songs (about half of them) this band spins out make one wonder iftheir is any happiness in their world. The majority of this CD is slowmellow wish-you-were-here type ballads like the singleApparitions. Very moody and bleak.The more upbeat songs(Everything is Automatic, which sounds a lot like 54-40) are aboutbeing proud to be a misfit in suburban society. There are one or twocatchy tunes ... that even the most tone deaf person could tap a toeto. Good as filler, but nothing substantial enough to leave a lastingimpression."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good guide book for the beginners in quantum chemistry","review":"Quantum chemical calculation method has become an indispensable tool in exploring chemistry. However, for the inborn difficulty of quantum chemistry the beginners hesitate to adopt this powerful tool in their research. This book provides various specific examples and exercises. They are appropriately chosen to improve your capability. When I have some problems in determining which basis set must be selected and the theoretical level at which calculation will be processed, this book is a good guide to me. Although all the content is based on only one commercial packge(Gaussian series), I would like to recommend this book to all scientists who have interests in computational chemistry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the Job!","review":"when I first installed this, which was pretty easy considering I've never done this before, I noticed that the lights were flickering a lot and it would not dim.

Once I put those in, it worked perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it says","review":"I ordered 2 of these and they work fine as single pole.

Unfortunately, I missed the review saying you have to buy the additional plate to go with the unit. I purchased two dimmers and upon installing them both, the dimmers make a loud buzzing noise and the dimmer does not dim the lights at all. It just works as an on/off switch. I'm not sure if I am doing something wrong or if it is a faulty product but I do not feel like wasting my time to figure it out. I tried to return the product but by the time I got around to it, I was no longer able to return the item.

This anthology features big name authors such as Lawrence Block, Robert B. Parker, Michael Connelly, and Thomas Perry. The collection covers the subject of baseball from a variety perspectives ranging from Little League to the Majors and from benchwarming little boys and baseball parents to historic superstars and sports agents. Highlights include \\"Harlem Nocturne\\" by Robert Parker, a story featuring some fellows named Rickey and Robinson and \\"Pick-Off Play\\" by Troy Soos starring his series character baseball journeyman/everyman Mickey Rawlings. I recommend MURDERERS' ROW for any mystery reader interested in baseball (as all good people are)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Book","review":"Now this is what I call mystery book.

As always with a William Stafford book the poems range over a variety of styles and although the poems are not directly linked, as you read more of Stafford, all his work in a sense forms one whole. Perhaps more than any review it is better to offer the title poem:PasswordsA PROGRAM OF POEMSMight people stumble and wanderfor not knowing the right words,and get lost in their wandering?So--should you stand in the streetanswering all passwordsday and night for any stranger?You couldn't do that.But sometimes your wordsmight link especially to some other person.Here is a package,a program of passwords.It is to bring strangers together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tight song","review":"I don't care for Memphis Bleek all that much but this song is pretty tight.

Fr.Stan's music, in my opinion, is aimed at todays society, especially the young, and is excellent for those who don't want to listen to the traditional style of christian music, but still want to praise God in their listening.

It is a quick read (only 60 pages) and exegetes John 6:35-45 in easy to read language and will \\"prime the pump\\" for succeeding study to the subject. I would recommend that you read this first, if you are new to Calvinism, and then start to read books like \\"The Potter's Freedom\\" or the \\"Bondage of the Will\\" or \\"The Freedom of the Will\\"Those books will get into more in depth thought but this book is a great way to start your study and won't take too much time as it only took me a little over an hour to read the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy piano book, not vocal seletions","review":"The way this product is advertised in the description is a bit misleading.

He actually used one of the songs for his recital."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Pretty - Not So Helpful","review":"Sigh... Like most of Andrew Lloyd Webber's sheet music, selections from Phantom of the Opera gives you a watered-down transcription featuring many cuts. Even worse, the accompaniment is hardly the original accompaniment at all, rather it simply follows the vocal line. This might be acceptable for fans who simply want to play through the music on their parlor piano without a vocalist, but for a real musical theater fan, it's very disappointing. So far, I've only found one place which gives an accurate transciption of the accompaniment (an excerpt from the full piano-vocal score). The Singer's Musical Theatre Anthology: Soprano, Vol. 3, compiled by Richard Walters features \\"Think of Me\\" and \\"Wishing You Were Somehow Here Again\\" in their original form. For performers and accompanists alike, there's something to get excited about. So far, we're still waiting on more from the Phantom of the Opera, but they're creating a 4th edition of the Anthologies soon, so watch out."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS THE 'EASY PIANO' VERSION, NOT THE FULL SCORE","review":"MUSICIANS TAKE NOTE!!!

It was better and sturdier than I expected.

I first saw Simmonds' video \\"I Can't Do That\\" on BET sometime in September, and something about it was memorable enough to file in my subconscious memory. It wasn't until a couple of weeks ago when I saw his performance on Soul Train that I decided to give him a shot by buying the CD.I never thought I'd get this hooked so fast! Most of the other reviews seem to draw parallels between Simmonds and Eric Benet, but his music reminds me more of an English Funk/R&B group called Level 42. The one thing that makes Simmonds music a real treat is the musicianship that's displayed on the record. You can actually hear strings, a real bass, and horns along with some electronic music elements.It's hard to pick a favorite track on the CD, but I really like the single, \\"I Can't Do That\\", and I also like \\"Universe\\". This CD really needs to be heard, but unfortunately, there are no music outlets in the U.S. for this kind of music on radio.

Stephen Simmonds is awesome.I heard Stephen Simmmond's album back in Europe in 1998 when his \\"Get Down\\" single was released. It even got some radio playback in Asia where I was working. A great track with great hooks. That got me hooked. Got the rest of the European album, and have been happy everytime I put it in the car cd. I surely thought that EMI would have him release in the US urban market, but 2 long years later, I see that he is here. It is great to find that Priority Records has worked hard to release this gem of an album. His album is definitely due for some great exposure in the USA as he belongs in this scene.If you like D'angelo, Maxwell, and others in the new R&B/Soul category, you have to try this album out.

I anticipated some great music in the vein of Angie Stone, Pru Renfro, Joe, et al. I can't for the life of me figure out what they were listening to! This cd offers nothing to promote it other than the fact Mr. Simmonds wrote or co-wrote every song on the cd. His voice here is not remarkable in any setting he presents, the songs are dull, the playing is uninspired. In addition to the aforementioned shortcomings, there is a sameness to every song on this disk. Not just because the same person wrote each song, but more so because Mr. Simmonds lacks objectivity in his work and he either did not seek outside input or ignored the input given. Skip this cd; maybe next time or check him out in another setting doing someone else's music. He could be a great R&B singer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hmmmm...","review":"I purchased this cd based on people saying how \\"great\\" it is, and I'm not feeling this one.

Those are brief, but very clear, and practical for those who intend to use this book on their own.Although the names of the asanas have been \\"anglicized\\" while one would rather have them in their Sanskrit-like form (i.e., with the appropriate diacritics etc.), this is surely not a real \\"problem\\".

I looked through many books, and I saw this one at a store the other day. I waited to look at the reviews although I loved the description and pictures I saw from the little I looked at the book. The reviews helped a little, but this was by far the best book in terms of pictures, details, and number of poses illustrated. It doesn't bother talking as much about philosophy and other details as much as it just shows how to do the poses. I also love the description of the various benefits that each of the poses may have or what they can help i.e. increase focus, increase circulation, stimulate digestion, etc. I have had it for one day, but I already went through the whole book, and I started practicing some poses. I can't wait to master them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learn About Yoga Poses","review":"Full-color images of yoga poses accompany instructions and explanations for each one. There are also alternative ways for people who've suffered injuries to do the poses."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and easy to use","review":"I teach a basic yoga class and I have several yoga books. This one is my favorite. All of the poses are divided by type, there are several photographed suggestions for variations, and it tells you which poses to avoid if you have certain ailments. Counterposes are listed, and the index has photos of the poses - so if you half-remember a pose but not its name, you can still find it.This is the book that I find myself reaching for when I'm putting classes together or if I'm looking something up.The only thing it doesn't have are a lot of yoga routines. It has a few good ones in back but not a lot. I personally prefer this layout that focuses more on good instruction for a wide variety of poses rather than fewer poses and a lot of routines, but if you want such a book, I would suggestB.K.S. Iyengar Yoga: The Path to Holistic Health. It's my second favorite and they each seem to fill the gaps in the other."},{"rating":"2","title":"Non-Ferrous Metal Cutting saw is excellent value!","review":"I have been looking for a good non-ferrous metal cutting saw for some time.This saw blade cuts aluminum extrusions cleanly with no burrs.Creating metal picture frames is now faster and more profitable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice looking","review":"This was a great addition to my kitchen.

I leave it to others to debate Mezzrow's place in jazz history. I found it interesting as a social study. Tales of 1920s gangsters and prohibition, the Chicago and Harlem music scene, and race relations. Of course, it's not always clear how much of this is true and how much may be a product of Mezzrow's (or Wolfe's) desire to make the story better.For me, Mezzrow came across as the ultimate wannabe. He wanted to be a black jazz musician from New Orleans. He was a Russian Jew, born in Chicago. He lived the life, the music *was* his life (except when opium was his life), but he could never fully be what he wasn't.Compare, for example, Louis Armstrong's autobiography \\"Satchmo.\\" Armstrong matter-of-factly tells about his life, not wanting it to be anything else. Mezzrow is always trying to be something he isn't and never can be. He was an interesting character.It's a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking for Jazz, Mezz tells all.","review":"I bought this book a few years back.

Sam still has my copy of that book. He ended up taking to Amsterdam, where he lives now. I found another copy, a first edition, for a dollar in a used book store. I gave the man his dollar and got out quick. I'm sorry to see this book (at time of writing) is out of print. If it ends up in print. It's worth the read.

The first is studio, in which Archie and his pals put down some unique variations of the then prevalent avant garde. The second CD is live in Afreaka; two long jams.

I totally disagree when people say that it's better than the Grand Theft Auto series. True Crime is different from GTA in several ways, whether it's shooting, driving, cuts-scenes, etc. However, it is the GTA look alike game for the Gamecube. It is a must have for all Gamecube owners. What really surprises me about the game is the 250 square MILES of L.A. re-created. What technology these days. Overall, if I was asked to say a few words about True Crime, i'd say,Freewill.

It is not only the best introduction to Manichaeism available to date, but every page drips with the astounding erudition and expertise of the author. Thus, it is inspiring academically as well as an invaluable historical reference work. I paid $100 for this book, and, after having read it, I think every penny was well spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD of the Year","review":"This is by FAR the best CD I have purchased in the past year. No Mermaid was the first song I heard on the CD when it was first released, and I instantly fell in love with Sinead's mellow, wistful music. And the CD is very complete. There are some catchy, faster moving tracks like No Mermaid, Whatever it Takes..., and Diving to Be Deeper. Then there are slower, more penetrative tracks like Don't I Know, Hot on Your Trail, and Loose Ends. The song What Can Never Be actually made me cry. I love EVERY song on this CD; and there are few CDs I can say that about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very surprising, an excellent album!","review":"I bought this cd because of someone's recommendation on Amazon, so I really didn't know what to expect. For most of my life I've gravitated toward male artists, and lately I've realized that I do love very talented female artists (Jann Arden, Sheryl Crow, Sixpence, Jennifer Knapp). But it's difficult to find them, so I decided to go with Bethany's recommendation. She was right!At first I didn't know what to think of this sound - modern but folksy with a classic voice. So I played the cd several times while reading. Now I'm hooked. The slow songs are wonderful background music, and the more pop sounding songs are excellent. I wouldn't say that her voice is quite as quality as Sarah McLaughlin, but I enjoy her style a lot more - it's more mellow and thought provoking. I won't pretend to understand all of the lyrics, but overall this is an excellent piece of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Perfect Album","review":"I count this as one of only 5 albums I've listened to and was totally enthralled from the very first playing. There is NOTHING out of place on No Mermaid. Sinead, you are absolutely wonderful! This effort works on so many levels: the music is great without being overwhelming, the lyrics are some of the best EVER written, and the selection is perfect. I saw you live in Columbia Missouri and you showed you could put an \\"edge\\" into the live material. I hope everyone purchases this album--they will not be dissapointed. Songs that won't be heard on the radio but that great are Loose Ends, Disillusioned, and Hot on Your Trail. Sinead runs the gambit of sultry without sounding stereotypical. I just can't stop listening to this album!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best album in 2 years","review":"I am a cowboy Junkies fan extrodinaire and found myself swep away by \\"No Mermaid\\".

You really do get lost in this music. I especially like No Mermaid, Diving to Be Deeper, and Don't I Know. I wish she would go more acoustic and less produced. I saw her perform, and while she was cool (and really pregnant), the band was kind of anonymous. She did one song with only her guitar, and that was a really intimate, beautiful experience. Anyway, strange & entangling music... I recommend this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album, but poor production","review":"I really like the songs and Sinead's voice. I heard her first on the WFUV-FM \\"CityFolk Live\\" CD, and went out and bought this album. I Really don't like the production though, too much production (drum machines, synthesizers). I like hearing sinead stripped down acoustic more. I'm sure the production was beyond her control though. She really is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that impressed","review":"It's been done before.....and much better.

Best CD I've purchased this year. Without a doubt!","review":"I bought this CD on a whim...Wow! I can't quit playing it! The music is layered, rich, woven, complex and sophisticated.

Definitely one of the best CD's I've purchased this year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"Brilliant! I haven't stopped playing it since I got it.

This movie is closer to \\"this is bad for a high school English project\\". It would never have been released had Tony Jaa not later become famous. But i bet he doesn't tell any of his friends that he was ever in this (despite what other reviews say, Tony Jaa was in the movie and was a major character; you just wouldn't recognize him)i was appalled the first time i saw it but to be mean i made my friends sit through a few minutes of it and eventually it grew on me.

The voice overs almost made me laugh in disgust...and the acting oh my god the acting was terrible. When Tony Jaa did his 10 minutes of action i was pleased. He did well but he wasn't tied into the movie that well. If your looking for a nice action movie with some great moves, this ain't it. Really don't waste your time and money.

The fight scenes were flat and had no style...they looked like bar brawls than martial arts.This is a Panna Rikkikrai movie, he's one of the main characters.

He is very readable and presents himself as a fellow spiritual traveller rather than some superior enlighted being (many dislike the superior tone in Eckart Tolle's books). I would give it five stars but for two reasons: I would have liked a little more sharing of his personal stories (they are there, but too few and too brief) and the contradiction in stating that \\"..if someone really knows the Truth, they are eager to share it\\" with charging $2000 for his week-long workshop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful!!!","review":"This is a wonderful, uplifting, inspirational book.

I have had a Freud blade in my Makita for years. For the price it is almost not worth sending them out for sharpening, unless you have a RELIABLE service close by and don't have to ship it. It will last for years anyhow with just hobby use. Just as a side note - cutting laminated flooring is extremely hard on a blade. It will dull the best of blades.

My problems lie with the engineering. It's doubtful if any major label would have issued these recordings. Many of the musicians are way off the microphone on some tracks. You strain to hear them, then Louis cuts loose directly into the microphone and knocks you backwards. There is blurring and other types of distortion here and there. And, most annoying of all, many of the songs are faded out halfway through. The short time (about 41 minutes) makes me think these tapes were originally prepared to cut LPs.

The variety of colors (admittedly lacking in asian and black women), mixed couples, all shapes and sizes, all varieties of people (nerdy looking, leather boys, middle-age yuppies, it had everything), everything was just a wonderful slice of PEOPLE, not of gay people.

And ignore the fox and other animals who walk right up to you. You're deer hunting.If I was training myself to hunt real deer or if I was already a deer hunter or if I was brain damamged I might find a reason to play this game a lot more. But I could never enjoy it. There is no real adventure, no heart pounding action, no challenge. At least the Big Game Hunter game has animals stalking and attacking you!I've found deer trapped by the landscape, not able to even run.

The tunnel would collapse and everyone would be trapped under the mountain. Ebert thought it was an excellent idea. And as it turns out Mr. Allen should have went with it. Because the movie he wound up making is an idiotic waste of time; ranks among the worst sequels ever made; and marked the beginning of the end of Allen's reign as the \\"Master of Disaster.\\" Side note: Allen directed this mess and, as \\"Beyond TPA\\" star Michael Caine said in his autobiography, good ol' Irwin should have stuck to producing!

And another thing... the color does not match when comparing the 2.IMHO, If it is fur (I doubt it), then it is fur from 2 different species of animal.

Using the principles of Gratitude, Intentions, Forgiveness, Tithing and Surrender will lead to an abundant life, but each one has its challenges.Chapter by chapter you are guided through a process of inner healing and growth of consciousness.The author suggests finding a Prosperity Prayer partner to complete the exercises with you, but if you're going it alone you'll find all the support and gentle encouragement you need built right into the text. Stories from students who have taken the 5 Gifts for an Abundant Life Course reveal how the process works in real life. The insight the author shares from her own journey provides inspiration and her words of wisdom about the process make each step forward easier to take.I highly recommend this book for anyone who wishes to learn how to live an abundant life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have!!!","review":"I have used this product for over 8 years and was devastated when it was no longer carried in stores.

I introduced the Bar-B-Chew Rib yesterday afternoon along with the Bar-B-Chew Steak (for powerful chewers) and a few other toys.

A Letter Fom Death Row was everything I thought it was going to be and more. Most people stereotype him as some hair metal burn out so they would never give this album a chance. That's why I think most radio stations won't play anything off the album. And also the fact that it was recorded on an independent label. It was poorly recorded and that is very evident, more in some songs than others. Anyway the songs that I think should be on the radio are as follows: Times Like these, which has very nice melody and style that would be very up to date. Angst Mary, which has a very funky rythm that gets in your head. Exellent song. And last but not least, The Devil Inside. A very well written and beautiful song. I think if any of these 3 songs were played on the radio, they would become instant hits. And I hope someday, somehow they will!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"As bad as the movie","review":"Michaels rightly couldn't get anyone to distribute his poorly conceived, written and acted golden turkey of a movie, so he was reduced to sell it on his own website.

To be honest, though, I find it difficult to understand the lyrics in most of their songs, even when I know what they are. I blame this on the Spanish accent ('river' sounds like 'reaver', 'meadows' sound like 'maydows', 'the' sounds like 'they', etc).

Upon looking down at the needle, we see it going back and forth, toward and away from the center where the record fits over the spindle.Both copies of McCartney's vinyl single, \\"Dance Tonight\\", do JUST THAT. Bummer.

Ex-Beatle Paul McCartney, still remains as deep and definitive with his style and sound, which hasn't lost its edge over the years. With his latest single, Dance Tonight, the first single from his Starbucks label debut Memory Almost Full, is a delightful little diddy. I really love this song, and its charasmatic video, where ghosts come out of the package, seeking his mandolin. Even though he has been teased heavily this past year, because of being 64, and his saddened divorce from Heather Mills, Paul's boyish charm and style still remains unique and is still full of splice. I know that this single sounds great, but I hope the next single continues to shine like this one does.Song: B+1,200th Review!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Book contains serious misinformation on taxes","review":"\\"Don't Die Broke,\\" contains gross errors on pp. 244-245.

Starts slowly, moves very quickly and aside from the invisible duelist, is quite easy to beat. 9 hours, give or take a few for cereal breaks, but this game really stinks.FOR A SEQUAL, YOU SHOULD'VE BEEN ABLE TO CHOOSE AT THE BEGINNING WHETHER REVAN WAS LIGHT OR DARK AND SET UP YOUR CHARACTER THAT WAY.

Not one piece has broken in 2 years. When he was 2 years old, he would sometimes get frustrated when the raised up track pieces would fall. I have heard of some parents nailing them together, but we didn't do that. Eventually we bought a battery operated train engine for the set and that renewed the fun.

I like, too, that the concepts are explained well. In the section on having a will, for example, the authors explain in good detail their recommendations for what to include.

Not having exposed coils makes it very easy to clean.It has two anti-clutter features which I like -- one is that the cord wraps under the base so you only have as much cord exposed as you need -- and it's feet slide easily across the counter so storage against the counter wall after the steam has ceased is easy.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"least amount of plastic","review":"I searched for hours (no exaggeration) to find an electric kettle that did not have plastic that would come in contact with the water.

The only plastic that comes in contact with the water is on the lid when pouring and you can open the lid and avoid this all together. It is a winner! It boils water in about 2 min. Even if filled just to the max line it does spurt a little water as it comes to a boil so be careful. The max water level is only about half way up the kettle. I measured how much water was in there after heating and is only about 5 1/2. I'm not sure where they are getting the 8 cups from.

I bought this because I like to have hot boiling water to clean up with-I don't have a working stove/range right now and I use the Kettle for this purpose. I normally use the Keurig for one cup of hot water (cocoa, tea) and if I need more for the teapot I then use the Electric Kettle; I will probably use it more for for tea now that the weather is colder.It has a design flaw in that it has a mesh strainer at the top and when you pour, some of the water dribbles down the front of the kettle and not where you are pouring it (a cup, teapot, over the dishes, etc.) This could be annoying and possibly unsafe. I still love it; it boils water, it turns itself off. That's all I needed and that's what it does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Design flaw overwhelms everything good about this product","review":"I bought this product 6 months ago. Initially, I liked it a lot. Heats water quickly, nice looking, and the cool touch definitely works. I didn't mind the quirky top release or the relatively small capacity. But after 6 months I absolutely hate this unit. You can not pour it without water running down the unit and all over the place. It doesn't matter if the top is closed or open, you can't pour without spilling hot water. I've tried pouring slowly, fast, with a full pot, half empty pot - it doesn't matter. Now it just plain annoys me everyday that I use it.If you don't mind mopping up after each pour, you will like its other features and price. It appears to be made of good quality parts.

I'm trying to eliminate BPA's from my diet! The part that holds the water is stainless and plastic free, however inside of the lid is totally plastic and subject to condensation which drips down into the kettle water. So, this is, more than likely, adding BPA's to the water. The lid is also a pain as far as I'm concerned, having to remove it and line up tabs every time it's replaced on the kettle. Water level is also difficult to see, so I'm not happy about that. I will keep this kettle because it's too much trouble to return, and it does offer less plastic contact with the water than most, but as soon as something better comes along, i.e. completely plastic free, it's out of here!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible.","review":"We've had this kettle for about 1.5 months.

There were a few minor issues, though: (a) the two parts of the plastic handle divided somewhat, (b) I never seemed able to pour boiled water without some leaking down the side of the kettle on to the counter, & (c) the water seemed to boil quite a while before shutting off. Even so, I'd say I was happy with the unit until this morning. Maybe, in a perfect world, I would have only given the kettle 3.5 stars, but looking at the problems reported by users of different brands, maybe it deserves 4.5 stars.However, it died this morning, just one minute into boiling a full kettle.

Guess again the limitation imposed by cool to touch (otherwise the kettle will need to be too big, because of the double walled construction)When filling water, seeing the max level is not an issue as the bottom of the opened lid is where the max limit is.Cord not connected to the kettle, is part of the swivel baseLook wise also it is good"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken!","review":"Nice kettle, but stopped working after only 2 months.

You can eliminate the lid but the \\"auto\\" shut-off won't work -- however, you can shut it off manually. I use a porcelain saucer as a lid to avoid any sputtering @ high boil. This kettle is magically fast, coming to a full rolling boil in under 4 mins. The exterior design is very sleek looking, and the interior is seamless stainless steel, with no water gauge (which is a good thing since they are plastic). If it weren't for the lid being plastic, I would have given this 5-stars.

This kettle is muchmore sturdy and well built. Can't really think of anything bad to say about the product, except maybe the price.

There is some magical way to get the boiling water not to pour all over the place, but since I did not go to Hogwarts, I do not know what it is; 2. The good reviews are from people who do not actually use it for anything that involves boiling water; 3. The people who wrote the reviews were paid to write them.I still give it 2 stars because the design is pretty awesome, if not functional."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great kettle","review":"Works great, no burns, easy, the way technology should be.I also like that it's stainless steel.Great kettle indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tee kettle","review":"TThe product was a gift for my wife and she seems pleased with it.

There has to be a lot better kettles than this out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic still touches the hot water!","review":"Does noboy notice that the underside of the lid is all plastic? Also, that black shadowing in the photo near the \\"spout\\" on top of the lid is not shadowing or light reflection. It's plastic! Worse yet, there is no way to pour out your water without it flowing along all that plastic at the spout unless you completly remove the lid before heating the water! I'm sending this back and asking for my shipping fees credited to me as well. This is a misrepresented product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst design ever for lid and spout","review":"I could not imagine such a terrible design for the lid and spout. It's way too hard to fill the kettle via the spout since it is so tiny (you would have to use a funnel). Filling it after pushing the button to open the lid results in the lid opening downwards into the kettle so you can't fill it more than half full."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for tea drinkers with a sensitive palette or nose","review":"I am a regular tea drinker and nearly burn the house down every couple of years when the whistle on my stove top tea kettle breaks and I boil the kettle dry. I decided after a great deal of research to try a stainless electric kettle and this one had the fewest reviews regarding odor or taste. It is fine for brewing a robust cup of tea; however, there is a distinct chemical flavor that comes through with lighter teas such as a green/black tea mix that I have as a second cuppa.I'm not sure what to do or what product to try next, but I am quite disappointed. Additionally, as it comes to a full roiling boil, it is very loud. Rather like a dull roar."},{"rating":"2","title":"mostly wonderful","review":"I was looking for an electric kettle that would heat water up quickly and not have contact with plastic. This kettle is excellent in that regard, and the outside gets warm, but not hot, to the touch (nice on cold mornings!). What I didn't consider was the spout - this kettle has no distinct spout, so it tends to dribble water unless you pour at just the right angle and velocity. If I were to buy again, I'd probably look for one with a definite spout, and possibly for one with a thermostat. The water comes to a vigorous boil before the unit shuts off, which is hotter than I like for tea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great product","review":"Given the price I expected somethign better. But let's start with what's good:Pro:- All stainless steel inside, no heating coil or plastic- Acceptable volumeCons:- Spout leaks towards the base while pouring water out of the kettle. Unbelievable! A major design flaw.- Can hardly see the MAX line when filling up with water- Switch stays in the \\"on\\" position when kettle removed from the base.The cons may not be that many but just the fact that the spout is leaking water along the kettle to the base should be an issue that prohibits further production of ths kettle.I would not recommend to buy it but the problem is that the US market has not many alternatives for kettles without plastic, heating coil and fill gage (which is also always a major issue with almost any kettle)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best electric kettle that I've found","review":"When looking for an electric kettle, my primary criteria was that no plastic be in contact with the boiling water. This one was well-reviewed and several reviewers noted that the parts that contact the water are all metal. I've had the kettle for a year now (June 2010-June 2011) and even though it's seen daily use, and often multiple times per day, it still works without a hiccup. Not bad for $49, which was the price at the time. In convenience and simplicity, this product excels. I'd definitely buy it again.Incidentally, the reason I gave it 4 stars is that it's made in China. The primary criterion of \\"no plastic\\" (in contact with the boiling water) was more important, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it! (but not 8 cups, 4 1/2 to max fill line) Otherwise perfect!","review":"I have RO water, excellent. No funny smells or taste from tea pot. Nothing plastic inside the pot. Lid has some plastic on it, but I flip open lid when pouring. (careful of steam escaping, common sense???) Don't overfill, only to fill line = 4 1/2 cups. or 36 0z.(less than 64) and no leak problems (common sense???) Boils fast. Takes a few seconds to actually AUTO shut off after boil. Love that it's cordless and no plastic inside where water boils, only steam will touch plastic on the lid. Cord is adjustable, winding in base. Does have a plastic screen for sediment but removable and unnecessary with good water. LOVE IT SO FAR..... Five stars when they change the 8 cup description... :)Update:Almost a year later of EVERYDAY use and still working wonderfully!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading measurement","review":"64 US fluid ounces = 1.89270589 liters, unless you're Hamilton Beach.Everything in the literature on this kettle states 8 cups. And 8 cups = 64 oz (which is precisely the measurement used in the description on Amazon). But the kettle holds no more than 1.2 liters (and states as much on the box).I am very disappointed. I purchased this to replace a 1.7 liter Breville, based on its reviews. Were I to do this over, I'd buy the Breville again.It does a fine job of boiling water, as long as you don't want more than 1.2 liters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Smells just like a band-aid","review":"One of the main reasons I bought this kettle was due to the stainless steel interior. Boiling water in a plastic kettle never seemed like such a great idea. This one looked pretty good and several people commented that there was no plastic smell. Sadly, I was not so fortunate. I don't know if my nose is more sensitive than most or if they changed factories in China, but my kettle has that plastic 'band-aid' smell to it when it boils. I've determined that the smell comes from where the handle attaches to the kettle. On the inside of the kettle there's exposed plastic which gives off this nasty smell. I've tried putting lemon juice on it, white vinegar, etc. Nothing's helped. I've boiled maybe 20-30 kettles of water and it still stinks, although slightly less. I'm hopeful it will completely fade soon, but wow. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"water coming out of the bottom after two uses","review":"I spent hours looking over reviews in order to replace my old (cheap) electric kettle. I decided on this one based on price and ratings. However, after just two uses, water is leaking out of the bottom little holes of the kettle. I would definitely not recommend this kettle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Use it every day.","review":"I use this several times each day for tea water. After burning one too many tea pots on the stove, a friend gave me this as a gift. The auto shut off is perfect for me and it holds enough water for several large mugs of hot chocolate or tea.The lid opens for filling with a push of a button on the handle and I have no problem filling it.Hope it doesn't wear out as fast as some people have reported here. Mine has been in use about six months."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Dangerous Design Flaw","review":"Oh dear! I was so hopeful that this kettle would be the one! Especially after reading many reviews and the Amazon forum about the all stainless steel construction (except the underside plastic of the lid on this one).Unfortunately this particular kettle pours hot, scalding water over your hands, feet and whatever else may be in the way. Some how the design of the lip is faulty. I'm British and grew up with electric kettles so I have used many! I sent it back. Buyer beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Kettle","review":"I have been using electric kettles for deacdes and this is the worst kettle that I have ever owned or used.

I am very surprised at all the positive reviews as these reviews on Amazon.com pursuaded me to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent product","review":"I love this product and I bought 2 more for my daughter and son. I love it is stainless, no plastic inside the pot, no tube inside which is hard to clean, the pot cover is easy to remove and it's wide enough for cleaning. I have been to many stores also searched online, this is the only one perfect product I found. Perfect 10."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I am very happy with this kettle. In regards to some of the negatives in other reviews; I have no problem pouring, the spout works great. I do not have a problem seeing the \\"Max\\" water line mark...I'm very happy it does not have a plastic water indicator like other stainless kettles. I love how cool the kettle and the base feel. I use to use a trivet to protect my counter with my other plastic kettle. This kettle stays very cool. There is no exposed element inside and it stays very clean. Only thing that surprised me is it dose release some steam from the lid while it boils, so you don't want it right under a counter."},{"rating":"2","title":"$53.44 is alotta money","review":"Target prices this at $39.99 HOWEVER the store does not have this item in stock and with shipping and sales tax, I may as well order this from Amazon. I checked out the display unit in the store and it is heavy and completely metal. Other styles have plastic lids. I'm keeping my Proctor Silex 9 dollar kettle to heat vinegar for cleaning.I think this design is pretty cute. The lid pops into side hinges so it swings with a push of the button on the handle for refills. There's no noticeable need to line up the kettle to the power pad when placing the kettle onto the pad or lifting the kettle from the pad.After a week of ownership, I love this kettle!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DOES NOT MAKE 8 CUPS AS ADVERTISED","review":"This tea kettle does not make 8 cups.

(maybe around the bottom part, you could touch and keep your hands on, but definitely not around top! Couldn't even keep my hands on for a second! I couldn't use this because i have a small child with hands busy like a raccoon. He'll burn his hands sooner or later.(for the kettle stays hot for a while..)Spout is really poorly designed, water seeps out too wide if I tip it too fast/too low for the water amount.The way the lid opens makes it hard for me to pour water in to fill. I wonder if other people take the lid off every time...It is a beautiful kettle, but not good enough for me to keep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great electric kettle","review":"So nice to have this quick, easy way to heat water for tea. Lots faster than on the stove top. I like the stainless steel inside. It did have a plastic smell from the cover for about 6 boilings, and then that went away. I gave a 4 star because if you heat multiple times the outside does get hot to touch. Fun to watch the blue light and bubbles of water boiling - so say the older gentlemen in our family."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not 64 ounces!","review":"This is not a review of the product, just Amazon's product description.

Double wall stainless steel with no seams to potentially leak. No plastic comes in contact with the boiling water, so no after-taste or possible health effects from plastic chemicals.

When I did unpack it I found that the max fill line is very low in the big kettle. It may hold 64oz but you can't boil that much at once..... The kettle seemed sturdy and I liked the double walls, the only plastic on the inside that gets in contact with the water (and then only when pouring) is the filter.Would have liked to keep this one but I make tea for a family and 5 cups are not enough!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Spills when pouring","review":"I liked the design of this kettle and it does boil quickly, however, it leaks almost every time I pour water from the kettle. This is a major flaw, as it means that I need to wipe the counter each time I pour, but it also unsafe as the hot water that spills can also flow off the counter and cause burns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hamilton Beach Electric Kettle","review":"Inserting and using the lid is not user friendly. Our water is soft and a coating appeared on inside of kettle and was almost impossible to remove. Loud noise and vibrations are heard as the water comes to a boil. The automatic shutoff takes too long to function."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classy looking piece","review":"I've been using this for about a week now and I just love it. Using water out of the tap leaves a horrible looking film and water spots on the inside. I've been using purified water and it stays clean if water remains in there for any period of time and it boils really quickly. The lid is a little tricky to get on but nothing I would complain about. This is definitely a plus for sure and I'm loving mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would be perfect if it didn't dribble","review":"I was trying to avoid plastic when heating water, and this kettle fits the bill. I only have two complaints: it puts out more steam when heating than my plastic kettle, so I have to move it out from under my wooden cabinets and it dribbles most of the time when you pour the hot water into a cup or other container. I also miss knowing how much water is inside, but giving up the plastic window was worth it until they figure out another indicator."},{"rating":"1","title":"DRIPS....ALWAYS","review":"This kettle boils well but drips whether the lid is closed or open for pouring.

Have to purchase another one for summer cottage! No coils/wires for the water to touch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't pour without dribbling!","review":"On the bright side, this product is stainless steel, no plastic inside, & electric.The problem with this kettle is that it dribbles all down the machine and onto the floor (and your shoes) no matter how fast or slow you try to pour due to a terrible spout. AWFUL. The problem is that the spout area is thick and wide. Usually spouts are very thin and come to an edge. Think of it as the difference between water shooting off a gutter vs. spilling over a bathtub. This is just bad design. I returned it after trying to deal with it for 2 weeks. Gave it a good chance!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not 8 cups","review":"Kettle description says it holds 8 cups. When filled with 8 cups this kettle leaks out of an overflow hole at the top of the handle then it flows down to weep holes in the base. Max fill line is at around 5 cups. It probably won't leak if only filled to max line. Unfortunately I need more capacity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice looks, completely dysfunctional","review":"This kettle has one nice feature in its completely stainless steel design with cool touch - the outside does not get as hot as the liquid inside. Apart from that it is hopeless in actual use. Filling it is not easy: there's no spout really so you open the lid; the flip lid design then has the filter neatly covering where you'd normally put the faucet. But you get it full, turn it on, and it boils, that much works. Next be *very* careful pouring it and do so very slowly: the lid does not seal against the sides and boiling water escapes from more than just the notched spout. After this the lack of a water level indicator is just a minor nuisance.If you need a smart looking kitchen, it is perfect. If you need something functional for making hot water, it is far from perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great kettle","review":"The only drawbacks are that it has a short cord and it's difficult to fill up at a water fountain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sent it back","review":"The top never fit on it.

I am returning this tomorrow."},{"rating":"1","title":"Takes very long to pop up","review":"I purchased this product because of it's stainless interior, it's quality and style, but I was surprised to see that the automatic pop up doesn't work properly, after the water reaches boiling, it would continue to bubble for at least a minute or two, (and for boiling water that's allot, making wet the whole cabinet above it from the steam) till it finally stops, I have had other Kettle's (cheaper) that popped immediately as water reached boiling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best kettle available","review":"Hamilton Beach has discontinued this model(NOV 2009), if you like it buy it now before it disappears!This is the only kettle I have found with a seamless boiling chamber. The only plastic is in the lid that does not come in contact with the boiling water. All the others have seams, nuts, bolts, level indicators, etc that can leach chemicals, corrode, or leak. If you are going to the effort of using highly filtered or distilled water, you don't want to add back contaminants while making your tea or coffee.I have used one for over two years with no problems. I went to buy a second for the office and found out that it has been discontinued. When I found that Amazon had remaining inventory, I bought two.PROSBoils 2 cups in under 2 minutes.

I then placed it on the counter near a 40 cup percolator and was surprised to find that it was more than half the percolator's size. It is a tremendously bulky kettle for such a small volume capacity. And while it does remain cool to the touch and is all steel, there is no water level indicator that i could find and the lid was quarky to use. Its size also made it hard to fill unless you have a deep sink.The only thing i found going for this kettle was the fact that there was no plastic... unless you count the lid and the built in filter.To summarize, the bulkiness and lack of water capacity offset this all metal kettle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally a non plastic kettle","review":"As most here, I was looking specifically for non plastic kettle due to chemicals and smell.

I do not recommend.-------My early review is below:She is a beauty, and will always be my first, even if she has some flaws.Water: heated.Counter appeal: Just fine.Lack of plastic exposed to hot water: Pretty good. I decided to be freaked out about BPA plastic while shopping for an electric kettle. Just an added level of difficulty. This kettle seems a pretty good option: A little bit of the handle mount is plastic and the lid has plastic undersides. I am pretty comfortable as these do not directly contact the water.Long term concern: Some water seems to get into the internal workings under certain conditions. It drips from the bottom when I pour. This is only slightly messy.

A dramatic and exciting supernatural showdown, The Cleansing documents John Harvey as a truly gifted writer and storyteller, and is enthusiastically recommended reading for fantasy fiction enthusiasts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as needed","review":"I am using this to power 6 Boss pedals.Paired it up with a \\"One Spot Adapter\\"Everything seems to be working just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what a pedalphile needs.","review":"I bought this to supplement my current 1-spot, so now instead of being able to power just five pedals, I can power nine!

The pedal is probably more to blame than the 1-Spot extension, but I thought I'd mention it.2. I wish there was a bit more space in between plugs.

I suspect Harmon Kardon is simply reeling in as many suckers as it can before reducing the price to what it should be. And that would be $20 to $40.

This remote has 12 dedicated buttons to quickly jump from one device to another. It also has dedicated Channel +/- and Volume +/- control buttons; the Channel conveniently changes to the track/chapter skip +/- function when you choose DVD or CD.The most serious shortcoming of the Sony remote, however, is that the display is hardly viewable without first activating the backlight.

If you don't have a windows machine to use to configure it, you're stuck with the pre-defined layouts which are nearly useless. If you do manage to customize it with your computer, it ALMOST becomes usable, but the size and slowness of the operating system make it more worthwhile to just find your real remotes.My TC-1000 has been sitting on the lower shelf of my coffee table for 4 months, gathering dust."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book helps YOU get results!","review":"Danny Cox has brought his experience and enthusiasm into every page in this book.

Instead, it's just another poorly executed story by a writer without a lot of talent. The story of the loser son, his fighting and uneducated parents and the tenuous baseball connection around which its story is hatched rings hollow and is perhaps only sightly more compelling reading than the minutes from a local school board meeting. None of the characters are well developed, the story is tired, the stakes are low. I struggled to finish this book and probably only did so because every now and then Jones would break from his formulaic characterizations and predictable plot for a quick flourish of imagination and inspiration. The Elements of Hitting is sad as a story and as a book. It takes a depressing story, which in better hands should have been interesting, and leaves it stranded at first base while the writer strikes out without so much as taking a good swing. And that's sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbearably bad book","review":"To give you an idea about how little merit should be placed in this author's work, consider this: of the four example problems used in the book, three of them are solved incorrectly! Once again an education professor proves how useless a degree in education really is. As a math teacher and math major, I advocate for the content experts over the so-called education experts. The whole book can be summed up by the following observation: \\"Word problems in most math textbooks seem contrived.\\" So? They're useful tools to gradually warm up to real-world math applications which may be more useful but are certainly less beautiful. I was hoping for an honest critique of math education, what I got was a petulant diatribe on the nature of word problems.

So it's claiming the ground of reasonable environmentalism for itself, while painting the people who actually do that work as an extremist enemy. I wonder what Ms. Pride would characterize as good environmental ideas beyond just assuming that everyone and every company will judiciously avoid damaging the environment and responsibly clean up after themselves if theres a mistake.We should all be teaching kids to think critically about current issues, in a way and on a level they can grasp; but that's not what's done here.

This definitely didn't do it.

I did not have terribly stained teeth when I started, but I drink a lot of coffee so I like to use whitening toothpaste and occasional white strips.This did nothing more than any Crest Whitening Toothpaste, which I usually use. I saw NO DIFFERENCE at all in appearance and, in fact, my teeth felt less clean. I use a sonicare toothbrush and I felt this toothpaste did not have enough grit or something. I wanted to brush my teeth 3 or 4 times a day, instead of my usual 2 because they just felt kind of slimy or something.Also, it is a pain in the a$$ to use the 2 tubes. Can they not utilize the technology developed by Aquafresh or other brands where the 2 types of paste are separated but both flow from a single tube or canister? Nothing special here at all. Total Hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"Supersmile Whitening System","review":"I am sorry to say that this product did not perform at all the way I had hoped.

Don't use this system..I felt like my teeth did not get any cleaner after brushing patiently. I honestly got teeth that got more yellow..I followed directions perfectly. I used it only on a dry toothbrush. I always wet my toothbrush before applying toothpaste and so I bought an extra toothbrush just in case I make that mistake I would have a dry spare.

Not only did I use exactly as directed, I also brushed my teeth for twice as long as recommended, and at times, 3 times a day. My husband & son said they see no difference what-so-ever. For the price of these 'toothpaste'. I expected at least some good results. I'll return to my dentists' whitening gel.

Also, pay attention to the listed dimensions, since this seems larger than standard mats."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing product","review":"For the person who gets the occasional pimple, these are phenomenal. Put one on overnight and the blemish will most likely be completely gone. If it was a really large one, it will at least be significantly smaller and less noticeable.

I would definitely recommend these to a friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, the acne patches came just in time. ...","review":"Well, the acne patches came just in time.

And I did so much like her other book \\"African Laughter\\". But this! Narcissistic, if ever I read one. Lessing at 70 or so is saying, \\"Here, look at me! At how wonderfully I write.\\" To ask the reader to believe that three men, all under the age of 40, are in love with a 65-year-old woman, is ludicrous. And that she, who, hopefully would have gained some insight and wisdom by now, is so grief-stricken over the loss of the 35-year-old (whom she never sleeps with or even kisses or seems to have any meaningful conversations with) that it takes two years to get over, is simply beyond my suspension of disbelief. These people never really talk to one another, never, ever say what they think, at least what Lessing says they think. The world of theatre and its convulsive relationships.

Cut finish was decent, and it didn't splinter or crack at all. With the cost of lexan I thought it prudent to get an appropriate blade, this one worked well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great storyline but amateurish writing at best","review":"The storyline for this book was excellent as you can see from some of the other reviews so I won't explain it again. The thing that bothered me about the book was the dialogue. I found that the characters were saying things out of the ordinary for the TNG crew we all know. For instance, Captain Picard asks Data if a Jeffries Tube leads to the bridge. Can anyone tell my why he would even have had to ask that??? Captain Picard would have already known that, I know I did! Also the writing is not very descriptive or detailed. The only reason I finished it is because I wanted to find out how Wesley rejoined Starfleet. If you want to fill in the gaps between Wesley's departure from TNG and his return to Starfleet I suggest you read the book, otherwise don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"FUN","review":"Vornholt has written a very memorable and well done novel. This is a great start to a long series of books. I found the plot exciting and orginal. The book goes at a very quick pace, and I found myself caught up in the action and twisting plot. The novel does what it should: It reads like a television show. This novel will satisfy readers that love ST:TNG. It gives wonderful insight into the long forgotten Traveler, and fans finally get to see just what Wesley Crusher has been up to. Picard is put in a bad situation, and the the crew has a mystery to solve. Satisfying read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality of eBook is lacking","review":"Returned eBook due to faulty formatting: each italicized word - and one tends to be every page or so - leaves the rest of the paragraph italicized.Amazon says they can't \\"troubleshoot\\" with me due to having returned it.Sarcasm: Great introduction to a series of books.Willing to update if formatting is fixed."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Familiar\\" Characters?","review":"This novel, while containing a good premise, suffers deplorably from one of Vornholt's most noted issues: familiarity with established characters and poor writing.Readers familiar with the characters of \\"Star Trek: The Next Generation\\" may find themselves wondering, based on the dialogue and actions of his characters, if Vornholt has ever actually seen the characters in action on a television screen. The two simply do not match.Added to this is an excessivly florid writing style that attempts to describe but ultimately annoys, and a failure to understand that using the word \\"said\\" is actually okay.The sum total of the novel, despite the interesting premise, is not enough to make it a worthy read unless you really haven't got anything else to read at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"I'm sorry, but this book is, simply put, not good. The writing level is extremely elementary and the dialogue is robotic and completely unrealistic. The plot line contained potential that was never explored and the entire time the story spends in Rashanar is a garbled mess of ridiculous occurrences. I rarely give books less than three stars but I was very disappointed with A Time to be Born. The only reason why I spent time finishing it was because I had paid for it and continued to hope that it would get better. It didn't.

After being challenged to find glasses that have longer temples for my wide head, so as not to pinch my ears, I came across these. They fit very well (I have the 55mm ones). I think the largest size would be too big. IMO these are the best wire-frame sunglasses around. Very, very similar to Ray Bays for 1/3 of the price. The gray lenses are not the darkest, and they are not polarized, but they cut glare and can be worn without having to take them off/on again when going briefly indoors. A classic design, especially for men, that will not go out of style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great start to the worlds best series!","review":"Oh my gosh this was SO good!

But when a sickly foal is born Ashleigh can't help loving Wonder (and I don't think anyone reading the book can either.)

Every story is rich in creativity and from the very beginning Serling grabs you and takes you on a journey through his mind. The simplicity of the word flow matched with the complexity of the descriptions in his stories create a very enjoyable reading experience.

If you enjoy her voice with Lyle, you must purchase her own CDs! She is truly a gem. I can't say enough about Lyle Lovett.

He surrounds himself with talented musicians and constantly name drops \\"Texas\\" in his songs in a desperate attempt to manufacture some sense of athuenticity. His lyrics are knowingly clever in a nudge-nudge wink-wink sort of way that would have made Lightnin' Hopkins reach for the bottle. Highly recommended for college students wanting to impress roommates with the maturity of their tastes, and people who have a vague sense that it is cool to listen to country, blues, and folk.
