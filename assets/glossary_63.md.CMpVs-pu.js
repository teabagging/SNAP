Run and gun does not work so well. Precise aiming and patience is a must. I really dont recall how long it took me to beat the game, but... it wasn't that long at all. The story was great though, sniper stage was great, and so was being an aerial gunner in the aerial gunner stage.Online Play: Is great. For the most part i didn't have any big issues. lots of challenges to complete. The maps are nicely laid out and the modes are fun as well.Graphics: AWESOME, AWESOME.... AND...

Graphics are very realistic, however the game would have been more fun if the backgrounds were more interactive like in Black for the PS2. I was hoping to destroy most everything I saw. It's a different game than previous COD'S but vastly better. My only other small gripe is I wanted to see another nuke explosion when the timer ran out. All we get is time's up. I'm sure there is more than enough room on a PS3 disc to have seen huge nuclear explosions. Still, the first nuke explosion was very satisfying graphically. It rocked. Maybe in the next COD we can use a few nukes against the bad guys. That would rule!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good graphics, good gamplay, good replay value, Overall GREAT GAME!","review":"Call of Duty 4 has great graphics, not quite the full potential of the ps3 but certainly as good as what the 360 would have to offer. It has some of the coolest story line effects(NUKES) that I've ever seen in a fps. I haven't tried the online multiplayer yet but I would expect it's good too. The split-screen multiplayer is very fun, offering the ability to call in air strikes and attack helicopters.

Experience allows you to unlock more and better weapons, gunsights and explosives to use as well as additional \\"perks\\" to customize your kit.I have to admit, lately I've been regretting my purchase of a PS3. With GTA4 moved back almost a year I've felt the catalog of games was really lacking. I no longer think that. CoD4 is the most fun I've had with a console game in a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"MP for the masses","review":"You can get information on CoD4 anywhere, so I won't prattle on about the game's graphics/gameplay/etc. The multiplayer is phenomenal - it's the first game since Counterstrike that I feel like I could play for days, months, and years on end. You gain experience and unlock new features almost every match, so the motivation and reward system outclass any other shooter.

However, the multiplayer mode on PS3 has been riddled with technical problems since release date.

In fact on the weekend of the games release, the multiplayer mode was completely inaccessable for almost a day.Before buying i strongly recommend reading through the forums on the charlieoscardelta website to see what the owners of the game are saying.There is a major patch in the works but as yet there is no E.T.A."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of my favorites...","review":"this game was terrific... gameplay was awesome, scenes/levels were fun. one of my favorites! kind of wish there was a 2-player story mode, that was the only drawback for me..."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Role-model for Multiplayer FPS","review":"When I first started playing this game on campaign mode, it was fun, challenging at some points but entirely too short. The campaign could use some length (as with any video game now-adays) although what was available was well written. The thing that i liked best about this game was its multiplayer ability. It reminded me of the good (and cheaper) days of Goldeneye 007 for good old Nintendo 64. Although much better graphics, obviously, and better game engine altogether, this game will just as much be a multiplayer classic as that was, far outdoing the overated Halo multiplayer capabilities where players see who can jump around the best and get a headshot, CoD4 requires less time to become a decent (more time to become excellent) player, allowing people to pick up the game and perform competently enough to grow a few ranks and have fun not getting sniped every time they spawn (in most cases haha)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought it was a great product...but my cats...not so much!","review":"I got the unscented because I was struggling to find a cat litter that my picky little angels would use.

It contains over 200 pages, but only the first 25 pages mention the word Chihuahua in the text. The rest of the information including the rearing, raising and training of pups seemed to be more focused on big dogs. The real main focus of this book seemed to be selling you products that were mentioned and pictured. The only thing I liked about this book was the many colored pictures of Chihuahuas. Don't waste your money on this book!

I used to worry about her and wonder how she could keep giving so much for such a long time. But this time she speaks, and she is funny, emotional, but it became clear to me (I've rarely gotten to see her in concert recently and I was just worried that she might get tired) that we give to her as she gives to us.

The girls didn't do ANYTHING!!! They just shot a couple of bad guys and left the rest of the enemies for the male soldiers! Of course, the action scenes were so-so, the graphics were blurred, and the story was stupid.Another thing, the movie has only 3 action scenes: one at the begining, the second in the middle, and the third one at the end. The first and the third one were the longest but they were set at midnight, so you won't see the action so clear.The only positive thing, is that the dvd has a cool intro with commercials, cartoons and movie previews before the movie starts.

Dave Perry covers pretty much covers all the bases with his highly enjoyable writing style, and scattered illustrations on almost every page. I particularly enjoyed the role of the bicycle as personal transportation AND as a working tool, not only in the States, but all over the world.

If you are not great at debugging the author's code, be prepare to be frustrated and disappointed. I can't give this book a high rating because of all the errors but for reference alone and coverage on basic OOP structure I have to give it 5 stars.

So, I'm hoping that the author's updated downloadable code will help me feel better about spending money on this book.Currently I'm about 200 pages into the book, other then typos and poor code formatting, the book seems like it might be a good primer to help me get started. If they do a second edition of this book they should definitely take the time to explain what's happening in the code in greater detail.

It seems it was too much hard work for Nicholas Cronk to rewrite his introduction, or even for OUP to change the back cover.As it stands, much of the critical material is rendered obsolete, though perhaps less so than the 250 year-old translation.Buy the Penguin edition instead - modern translation, half the price, no disproven theories."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Special about Poodles","review":"The book contains the usual material about dogs in general and nothing that pertains specifically to poodles.

I find that the magnet has to be about 1/4 to 1/3 inch away from the light and directly in front in order to work, thus the photo illustrations of the lights as positioned in the drawers, toolboxes, cabinets, etc. simply cannot work for all practical purposes. Therefore I find that I have simply wasted the money that I spent to illuminate my drawers and cabinets. If these lights could be turned on by pressing a switch, they would be far more functional. More detailed information about how the lights operated would have been much appreciated before I purchased. It's a great idea but lacks some practicality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite enjoyable and varied","review":"I wanted some music to accompany a slide show I was making of China trip photos.

It was great to have them available since Edison's vertical-cut discs could not be played on a standard three-speed phono of the time. Unfortunately, they were not all transferred at the proper speed (some Edison discs were recorded at 80 rpm, many others were recorded closer to 78 rpm, especially after 1926), so the resulting improper pitch deterred from the enjoyment of the great music.30 years later, those same tired transfers, complete with incorrect pitch and fake echo, have come back to haunt us in digital form. There are other Ramblers/Golden Gate collections out there (Timeless and Document each have fine sets avaialble) with excellent remastering; that's where anyone interested in this music should start.

Who can forget Charlie trying to direct the Christmas pageant? Like the other Peanuts figures in the series, Charlie is a bit larger than usual toys this size. Not only that, but he has one big head! Despite the seemingly wierd proportions and dimensions, the figure looks like a real-life version of the beloved comic strip and cartoon loser. The figure includes a directors chair, megaphone, stage notes that can actually be read, and a small part of the stage on which the Christmas pageant is supposed to be performed upon. The stage can be connected with the set pieces of other figures in the series.

It is not snug (as in \\"tight like a glove\\"? or someone who fits a large trying to fit into a meduim?) but it is absolutely a great fit. I have not found anything out there that fits like this.

The coverage is very similar to Fundamentals of Analytical Chemistry. The example problems and homework problems are illustrative and challanging. The experiments presented in the final chapters are well documented. My only observations for improvement would be the use of more detailed analysis of some of the insert examples. For example, a battery technology that is discussed in a step by step fashion in terms of equilibria, balancing redox equations, and problem solving.

I know plastic is all The Big Scare these days with BPA just waiting to leach out and cause us all horrible, painful diseases. Relax, as a chemist, I can assure you that anything leached out of these containers will drip down the sides and all over your hands when you take the plate and cover out of the microwave. I'm serious about that-condensation does form and it is often very hot, so pot holders are in order.

John Eisenberg immerses the reader in the early 19th century, long before spectator sports were in vogue. This is truly a story where truth is more powerful than fiction. A Hollywood script writer would be hard pressed to come up with a better story. There are enough plot twists and suspense to keep most readers totally engaged. You don't have to be interested in horse racing to enjoy this book. Eisenberg said he used his author's license to fill in some of the blanks pertaining to the events surrounding the race. He has, however, seemingly done so with restraint, which I believe makes the book better. This book deserves more recognition than it has received."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it!","review":"I tried to use these in my staple gun.1.jammed-took an hour to fix2. they break(not heavy duty)2. the whole row would not fit in my stapler(not that big a deal, but annoying)I ended up wasting a ton of these.

At a minimum I anticipated a scientific review of the latest research in the field, a survey of recent findings.

I was at times bogged down by some weighed down language but none the less a very good book. I felt that the author gave a very well \\"mapped\\" out depiction of how we evolved as humans.

This book is a disproof of that conventional wisdom.Mr. Olson is a fine writer, but he is not a scientist. Within the first 50 pages he has spent 2 pages on an incorrect explanation of an important genetic concept.Give me instead the real McCoy: Luigi Luca Cavalli-Sforza is a scientist with true insight. His book, \\"Genes, Peoples, and Languages\\" is beautifully inspired. He truly understands what he is writing about; and the most interesting elements of Mr. Olson's book are better handled in (if not derived from) Dr. Cavalli-Sforza's book.Mr. Olson, by contrast, is a layman who doesn't quite comprehend that about which he writes.

The author repeatedly points out that human beings are definitely not the same genetically -- otherwise it wouldn't be possible to write a book like this at all. DNA sequences obviously differ from person to person and group to group, and these differences are a reflection of our individual and collective histories.The much more interesting question is whether, given the history of our species, one would expect groups to differ genetically in anything other than superficial ways. No evidence for such differences exists, nor is such evidence likely ever to exist given the profound influence of familial and social environments on human traits. That's the real message emerging from modern genetics research. Racism based on the idea that groups have significant biological differences is dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Political Correctness butchers an interesting subject","review":"Through his political correctness, Mr. Olson spoils an interesting subject! His message, repeated over and over again is: As all mankind has been interbreeding time over time, we are all the same, and therefore racism is unfounded!He does not seem to realise, what a dangerous road he is leading his readers down with this politically correct message: What if future science proofs, that his thesis is wrong, that there ARE substantial genetic differences between people - after all, this is a new science?

The initial segments on mitonchondrial DNA and our genetics is probably the most readable and understandable treatment that I have seen. About halfway through the book, however, Olson stops trying to trace human migration and development. His emphasis becomes avoiding rascism. At this point, the history and science dwindles away and the emphasis becomes how intermixed our gene pools are. It was almost as if his underlying motivation was a desire to use science to prove a political position. It became rather pedantic at this point.

I use the pocket on the inside of the case for holding the USB cable that way the camera and the cable are never far apart. The case is a bit cramped and fits nothing more than the camera and one other small item like extra batteries or the USB cable.

The camera (Canon PowerShot Pro Series S5 IS 8.0MP Digital Camera with 12x Optical Image Stabilized Zoom) just fits in it, and only if you position the camera just right will the case close properly. And with Canon's persistent loose lens cap design, I can hardly put the camera in or take it out without knocking the lens cap off.There's no room to stash extra batteries or memory cards. And because it has no strap of its own, when I take the camera out of it, it is loose and I have to hang on to it. It would only be useful to me if I put it on a belt, which I don't wear anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"75 deluxe soft case","review":"This case is too small for Canon PowerShot Pro Series S5 IS 8.0MP Digital Camera.Canon PSC-75 Deluxe Soft Case for S1 IS, S2 IS, and G6 Cameras."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great if you want only a Camera Carry bag","review":"I was clear with my requirements. I wanted a camera carry bag just to tuck my Canon Powershot S2 IS between shots in a typical outing. For that this bag is just perfect. Of course it is difficult to pack in another set of AA batteries, but then it is fine in that it reduces the overall weight that I have to carry around my neck. As pointed out, you can leave the neck strap outside. It also has a belt loop."},{"rating":"2","title":"A minimally larger would have been better","review":"The first version of this review bashed the case for being too small to comfortably fit Canon Powershot S2 IS.I have since found that the camera DOES actually fit well enough if you are careful when putting it in. When inserting it (lens facing forward), you need to push it all the way to the back of the case, so that the bottom edge of the lens touches the bottom of the case, NOT the front.If you don't do it right, the case will buldge, and you will probably find out when re-opening it that that flimsy lens cover has fallen off (oops!).I thought this might be a helpful hint, cause it wasn't obvious to me at first at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Canon SX10 IS","review":"Horrible, Horrible, Horrible!!!!!!! Case is not for Canon Power Shot SX10 IS! I am disappointed that Amazon shows this case with the SX10 IS. The camera fits in the case but the case will not close completely. If you close the case as much as possible it keeps pressing the power button causing the camera to turn on which will run the batteries down. The images associated with the case are very deceiving. The camera in pictures looks like the SX10 IS but now that I have the case I notice that that case appears to be held open as far as possible so that you can't tell that IT WON'T CLOSE WITH THE CAMERA INSIDE!!!!! Trying to decide if it is worth returning the product after reading the return policy. Ace's Policy states you can't get a full refund if it has been opened! How do they expect you to see if it fits without opening it. After shipping, etc. I would probably only get $5-$10 back. At least they get to keep their profit!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great design","review":"The case is made of nice leather and fits the camera. It is cumbersome to use, the zippers on the side do not lock, and can un-zip on their own. The velcro closure at the top provides some security if the camera is put in the case just right, with the strap folded neatly and put to the side of the lens. Otherwise everything bulges too much and it's difficult to secure the velcro. The case has to come off to use the camera, so it functions best when the case is on your belt.Basically, this case is adequate, but no more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the S5 IS - Even though Amazon recommends it to you!","review":"This case is small.

Just a belt loop and a little loop that buttons on the left.-Build quality is top notch.-Coushining is about 1/4 in. thick.One thing that I've noticed is that once you remove the camera from the bag, out comes the long strap with the camera, and now you have a camera bag thats awkward to put somewhere convenient."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon PSC-75 Deluxe Soft Case for S3 IS, S2 IS, S1 IS & G6 Digital Cameras","review":"The most perfect case for the canon S3 !!!!His size is perfect for the camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Canon PSC-75 Deluxe Soft Case for S2 IS, S1 IS & G6 Digital Cameras","review":"Well made.

I got a 2GB high speed card for around $40. A 4GB can be ordered for around $90.

The camera can't be completely enclosed in the case since the camera's carrying strap hangs out and any shock protection it provides is minimal. It doesn't fit well. From the side, it seems to have a triangular design, though how that fits a roughly rectangular camera body is beyond me. The camera has to be manuvered around to get it inside. If the case was built for this set of cameras, they should fit right in. It is hard to get the camera inside without knocking off the lens cap. There isn't enough space provided even for an extra set of batteries, although there is enough room for an extra memory card (woopie). A couple of extra side compartments would have been useful. I'm sure I can find a generic bag that will be more useful, but I shouldn't need to after buying Canon's custom bag especially designed for this set of cameras."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect fit for S2 IS, extra batteries & strap!","review":"When I read the other reviews here, I was worried the bag would be too tight a fit for my Canon S2 IS. Imagine my surprise when not only the camera fit, but 4 AA batteries, and the folded strap fit, as well (albeit the top flap is not quite completely overlapping all the velcro...).With the extra batteries, the camera and case is a little too heavy for my belt, but it's good to have a close-fitting case to protect the camera when we're on the move.I think the trick may be getting the camer all the way down into the case, and having the lense pointing out (toward the logo plate).Unless quality control is lacking, and some cases are tighter than others, I don't understand the \\"too tight\\" complaints regarding this case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not big enough","review":"I would have loved to have a bag which can hold a set of spare battries as well as a spare memory card.

We had seen how useful swings can be with our first child, who used one at day care. First of all: There are two separate motors, each needing lots of batteries. Picking up a crying baby insures you will forget to switch off one of them, as they are inconveintly located, so you eat batteries up when the vibrator is not in use. Poor, poor poor, swing- it's weak and doesn't stay swinging. Even the first day in use it was weak, like the mechanism was designed for a clock pendulum, not a swing carrying the weight of a baby. The bears do not rotate, at least after the first day. Uncomfortable, diappointingly cheaply made. The covers are easy to get off & wash, that's about all that is designed right."},{"rating":"1","title":"direct connect","review":"found this cable would not fit my phone.

The only drawback I have so far seen is that there is a dark arch in the bottom of the pictures when using the flash. I wish Canon had designed in threads for a UV-Haze filter, but they did not. That's a big piece of glass to be hanging out there with no protection from scratches and fingerprints. Be careful.

Period."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very wide and blocks the flash","review":"This lens only provides a modest bump in wide-angle coverage. Standing in an average room at home, it's the same as stepping back one foot. I'm not sure it's worth the money for that tiny gain.Also, it partially blocks the flash on the S5. If you plan to use it with the built-in flash, expect the bottom third of each photo to be dark. Fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Lens","review":"Received this lens converter today and took a few interior shots with it to assure it's condition. I am extremely pleased with this lens. It is of the highest quality and delivers sharp clear pictures with a much wider field of view than the S5IS lens is capable of without it.

I was able to use it after I opened the box and started shooting to see if if really made a difference. It did! But be mindful that it is bound to create a dark spot in the bottom of your pictures if you just use the built-in flash of the camera because the lens protrudes and it blacks out that area of any object or subject you wish to photograph. Best in outdoor photography or one where you do not need a flash.

They set it up on our pool table, and spend hours playing it. Every game is \\"new\\". The boys have been totally engrossed while also interacting with each other - something they don't do while playing most video games. Also, unlike video games, the Heroscape game is not addicting! We no longer allow video games in our house, and the Heroscape games provide entertainment, imagination, forces them to use their noggins to create a strategy to win, and allows competitive gaming while also providing opportunities to expand and create new games. Lastly, they have not broken any of the pieces, which for my kids is nothing short of a small miracle. I love the whole concept!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Addition","review":"This addition to Heroscape is great! I've wanted it for 3 years and I finally got it for my birthday.

In fact, I've read through all of them for a second time this year.'Pursuit' brings together characters from two books: A Matter of Trust & Shield of Justice. Rad does it in such a masterful way, bringing in three interesting couples (Rebecca and Catherine from Justice, Jason and Sarah & Sloan and Michael from Trust), each with it's own trials and triumphs. She also plants the seed for another couple to emerge through rookie cop Mitchell and prostitute Sandy.One might think such a varied cast of characters would make the book hard to follow, but the synergy between personalities gives the book itself depth and dimensionality.I never tire of Rad's work. This one certainly didn't disappoint!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still in pursuit","review":"I loved that Radclyffe intertwined Sloan and Michael's story with Rebecca and Catherine's.

For all those who knew and loved him during his secular days, this will be a welcome return. For those new to his music, he is the professor who will teach you how this music, Soul/ballads, is supposed to be rendered. He is not a shouter in the vein of an Otis Redding or a Wilson Pickett. This is an artist. He takes to the high places and makes you feel and see the low places.In the late seventies and early eighties, this was THE mood music.

I wanted to give five stars just because it is Al Green, but I gave four. My reasons are: Al doesn't sound relaxed and laid back enough, and those background singers sound kind of tacky.

The situations in which the main character gets involved in throughout the whole film get more weird each time, yet the movie remains entertaining. Despite its weirdness I kept watching it because it's also so addictive [I ended up watching some of the funniest scenes over and over again]. Viewers who don't get all the jokes at the first time around should watch the film again 'cause it is fully of subtle jokes that you would miss the first or even second time around. Overall it's a very funny film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank you DreamQuest Films","review":"Most of the reviewers have already praised this rare Kitano comedy, so I don't really see a reason repeating them.

I bought my DVD through Amazon Marketplace, directly through the manufacturer. What a deal! Thank you DreamQuest Films for releasing this rare film on R1 DVD.Kitano fans should really support these small studios that dare to release less known titles from our favourite director. Now what about releasing DOLLS on DVD? I hope that film will be available on Amazon soon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Occasionally funny","review":"I really wanted to like this film, because it is silly, and weird, and has cute topless girls in it.

But it just did not work for me, sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Professional Quality Blender","review":"The blender is heavier and larger than my old one. It requires a larger bowl to blend flour and butter. The tines are thick compared to the stamped ones on my old blender. Can't see how they would bend unless one was using extreme force.

It's nice to see this quality in kitchen tools."},{"rating":"2","title":"This cuts frozen butter like nobody's business","review":"I've tried a few different methods and gadgets of cutting frozen butter into flour. This is by far the simplest and quickest way to do it. I was a little worried about the large space between the blades, but it turned out that it was no problem at all. This blender is sturdy, has a good weight to it (without being too heavy) and handles frozen butter really well. The curve of the blades works well with my mixing bowls. I am not sure about that one star review as I feel it is a really well built and it didn't bend or buckle with frozen butter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now this will cut the butter!","review":"Sturdy and tough, will cut through anything.

One good example is page 25: I can't readily see the difference among the same color family. Considering I'm a color expert, this is a big drawback. Soft yet vivid water-color technique may help improve the quality. Well, the problem may be with the printer rather than with the author.The layout of the book in general, i.e., text and graphics, lacks good aesthetic quality. Better fonts and generous margins would help improve it by a great measure.All in all, the book doesn't live up to its price.

Some of the bonus tracks are fascinating. Imagine traditonal Indian instruments combined with funk in the same piece! There's even a barely recognizable but beautiful version of David Crosby's \\"Guinnevere\\".What everyone else is saying about the re-mastered sound is certainly true. I listened to some of this album on my car stereo and was shocked by the realistic, clear sounds that came out of those small no-frills speakers!

This book is a prime example of the importance of Sergio as one of the most essential and overlooked authors in Latin American literature. His ability to bring alive the dreams, plights, success and defeat of the Nicaraguan revolution, more than 10 years their electoral downfall, shows how politics and human sensitivity are intertwined in Latin America. His account of the Sandinista revolution is excellent because from its start, he was a player, and although he did not fall within the dogmas of some of his contemporaries, he is not without fault. At its core, his account continues that old school adage \\"Don't mess with Uncle Sam\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth reading","review":"This political memoir is very fair, lucid, and self-aware. Very helpful if you would like to understand more about what has gone on, and is going on in Nicaragua."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry but","review":"I really despise this show. There.

Sorry about this, but if that Jerry guy had real sense, he'd quickly dispose of the girls, who are actually probably causing more of a problem than the \\"villians\\" they take out.Too materialistic and popularity oriented for me, but hey, if you like this kind of stuff, go for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Enjoyable Read","review":"In \\"The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay,\\" Mr. Chabon crafts a very nice tale of intrigue, deception, and humor. The book is well written, very precise, and some passages really make you feel like you are right there in New York City.My reason for giving it a 4 instead of a 5 is that I got confused. This is absolutely a work of fiction, but there are references to real places (New York, Prague), real people (Hitler, Orson Welles) and real things (Empire State Building). So, I was not able to slip completely into the fantasy world that Mr. Chabon worked so hard to create. I was perhaps biased by my own opinions of the real references.But, don't let this stop you from buying it. It is a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in disjointed unemotional novel","review":"I'd read one other book by Chabon, Summerland, and so I came to this book with high expectation. Those expectations were dashed. Though I found the beginning of the book interesting, the story lost steam once Josef reached New York. For me, the trouble with this novel can be summarized as follows: Too much telling, not enough showing. We're constantly told how the characters react and the effect is a bloodless, lifeless novel about characters I wanted to care about but didn't. The overuse of obscure words was not something I felt added anything to the novel other than impresse me with the author's pretensions."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Masterpiece","review":"Quite simply, this is the best book I've read in several years. The prose is powerful, the characters are engaging and the plot more than keeps the pages turning. A truely well-crafted bit of literature. I can't imagine why anyone wouldn't like this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it... but a little Forrest Gumpish, too...","review":"I was swept along. It was a true page turner. The character development was exquisite -- really very, very good. It's practically a paean to NYC, and reading it after you-know-what turned my beloved hometown topsy turvy with horror and sorrow helped.But! There is a bit of Forrest Gump syndrome with many brushes with famous figures that I'm torn about -- half the time I wanted to hoot and just go with it, the other times I snorted cynically and rolled my eyes.Also, read the book -- the movie will be a huge, maudlin schmaltzfest involving Tom Hanks or something..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Grady Tripp's Runaway Novel","review":"Chabon's \\"Wonder Boys\\" was a fantastic novel. Read it. (The movie adaptation was also excellent.) In it, professor and author Grady Tripp is writing a novel that runs to several thousand pages with no sign of ending. He cannot control what does and does not go in or focus on a through-line.Although only 656 pages, \\"The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay\\" is Chabon's runaway novel. If you are very interested in comic books, there is a good 200 page novel in there somewhere. If you are very interested in World War II era Eastern European refugess and their lives in the United States, there is a good 200 pages of that in there somewhere. But as it stands, they are not worth digging out of \\"Kavalier & Clay\\".Chabon has done some excellent work and has been very successful. And most authors have a great investment in their work. But Chabon's editor needs to stand up more firmly. In the meantime, read (or re-read) \\"Wonder Boys\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sinks to the level of its subject matter","review":"If you like your Pulitzer-winners average then this is the book for you. \\"The Amazing Adventures\\" probably really deserves a three, but it loses one star for the damage it does to the reputation of a venerated award. It's a novel about comic books that has the plot pacing and dialogue of its subject matter but provides no saran-wrapped women to gawk at. Furthermore, the prose is overly romantic and the romances are overly prosaic. (Ha! Give ME a Pulitzer for THAT!) Buy the book if you want but keep your expectations low."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated and badly structured.","review":"Can't believe all the hype about this book, I pretty much hated it, and yes, I did read it through cover to cover.I was uninvolved with the characters and thought that the plot was weirdly passive and totally uninteresting. Some dramatic scenes were built up to and then flunked - performed offstage, like cheap or dated theatre that is not able to show the action. This is understandable for theatre, but this is a book, FGS, where you can do anything if you have the ability. Clearly Chabon does not.Or is this the point of it? I found the book to be an overwritten non-event - little humor (that worked), little action, nothing edifying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Throw Me a Bone, Please","review":"Ok, the book is well written, good command of english, well researched, etc, etc, but PLEASE, that which is submitted as great fiction does not need to be abysmally dark and depressing. I stopped reading about half way through when the boat full of war orphans was sunk by the nazi U-boat. Mine you the book was depressing up till then, but that tipped my scale. I'd recommend the book to someone dedicated to reading who can ignore the story's melencholy..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprisingly funny","review":"Given that this book won the Pulitzer for fiction, I expected beautiful writing. What surprised me was the amount of laugh-out-loud humor, much of it based integrally in the well-drawn characters and their interaction with each other. This book's wide scope reminds me of the best John Irving, without Irving's occasional lazy habits. First-rate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superheroes, Houdini,The Golem of Prague...","review":"Welcome to the Golden Age of Superheroes! Fueled by imagination the team of Kavalier and Clay create the Escapist, a combination of Houdini and Superman, who battles Nazis before anyone else and becomes one of the most popular superheroes ever. Michael Chabon has recreated the world of the thirties and forties, a world populated by surrealists, escape artists, radio stars and comic books. With Kavalier, a young man who escapes the Nazi occupation of Prague, and Clay, a New Yorker who escapes from an unhappy childhood, Chabon creates an endearing team. While the book loses focus when Kavalier goes to war, the total effect is one of nostalgia looked at through the eyes of a modern writer with a love for wonderful world of comics. Besides any guy who thanks Jack \\"King\\" Kirby in his acknowledgements deserves my thanks for remembering one of comics' greatest artists."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Wonder Boys","review":"I think everyone else has pretty much summed up the plot, characters, etc., but I thought I'd add that I read Wonder Boys and didn't really like it, so I almost didn't read A.A.K.C. But, I'm glad I did, because it really is one of the best books I've ever read. Some of the vocabulary is a little heavy so keep a pocket dictionary around; and if you're not familiar with Jewish folk tales and mysticism, it might be good to read something like Gershon Winkler's Golem of Prague book or just review the golem of prague legend itself.Overall, it's the best book I've read since Bulgakov's The Master and Margarita."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book! Pulitzer Prize though?","review":"I can speak very highly of this book. A fantastic adventure of two boys who write/draw comic books in the run-up to World War II. Kavalier escaped from Nazi occupation of Austria and Clay is a boy with bigger dreams than talent. They are a perfect match - and a perfect commentary on freedoms and life during a very hard time in America's history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the Wonder Boys instead","review":"Having just finished the Wonder Boys, an engrossing and very funny book, I began K and K with great anticipation.What a disappointment. There is a little light humor here and there, but in the main this is a long and rather disjointed tale which totally fails to maintain any momentum. I have persevered to the 71% mark but I'm now beginning to resent the time which could have been spent on the next book in my queue.Do read the Wonder Boys. It's, well, wonderful..David"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read","review":"Great book. So well written, interesting, and different. So many times your read a book and you can pick out sections, characters, plot lines that you have read before. This book opens up like a new world in front of you waiting for you to explore it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, engaging novel","review":"I love this book! The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay gripped me from the beginning to the end. Most books I read have boring, slow-paced beginnings, but Chabon successfully makes the introduction as interesting and engaging as possible. He also develops his characters through actions and words. This book not only sparks thinking in the areas of racism and gay rights, but also is just plain enjoyable! This book won several awards, including the 2001 Pulitzer Prize, the Pen/Faulkner, and the Bay Area Book Reviewer's. This novel is one that should be on everyone's bookshelf and definitely holds a place as one of my all time favorites. I highly recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Voyage","review":"It has been years since I have read a novel that so beautifully utilized the English language. This book is a wonderful journey tracing the lives of well developed characters. I am not certain the last 100 pages match the first 500, and Chabon seemed to have trouble figuring out how to tie up loose ends, but all in all, well worth the trip."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Book of 2000","review":"I first read \\"Kavalier & Clay\\" back when it came out, and I was floored by it. As a result, I was delighted to hear it won the Pulitzer. This is a tremendous leap for Chabon from his earlier works (which are, in their own right, very good) and, I believe, one of the best pieces of recent fiction. Chabon does a masterful job of presenting the world of comic books in such a way that even those with no interest in comics are drawn in. Wartime New York - and, indeed, wartime America - are vivdely portrayed. Joe, Sam and Rosa will stay with you long after you've finished reading it, but the lesser characters (e.g. George Deasey) are equally meaningful and memorable. \\"Kavalier & Clay\\" is as finely-crafted, entertaining, and enlightening a novel as you'll find anywhere. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gets better the longer you let it sit","review":"There's something about great books. They grow on you after you've finished reading them. The details fade and with the okay books, you start to forget about them altogether. But the great ones grow, and you continue to care for the characters and the story. That's how this book was to me. Reading it, I have to admit I was a little let down. I thought maybe it was over-hyped. I wanted more amazement, more adventure. I wanted more outlandish turns. I wanted the characters to be more likable. But at the end, when I finished it, I think I got everything I wanted. And even after 600+ pages, I wanted 400 more. And that, to me, is the sign of a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow...","review":"Unlike many reviewers here, I did not catch onto the allusions to comics nor to Jewish culture. I found that I couldn't read this book without a dictionary on hand; I never would've guessed I needed the dictionary this much reading a book about comic books. Despite all this, this is easily the best fiction I have read in several years. The plot is unforgettable. The character development phenomenal... even though these boys accomplished some outrageous feats, they were still portrayed as the boys next door. The characters come alive as each of them leaves a firm impression of realistic emotions, as they are constantly doubting, blushing, hoping, and more blushing... (I think Chabon used the word \\"blush\\" more than 100x in this book).After finishing, I felt satisfied with an amazing story, enriched with an appreciation for Jewish culture, knowledgeable about the art of comic books, and gained a vastly improved vocabulary. I suggest you go through this experience as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stink,Stank,Stunk","review":"I really wanted to like,love,appreciate and become emamored with this book as if it was a lover, and yet this was not the case I was fond of the setting, of the time period and the storyline placing two young men together trying to find their place in the world, one a visual artist the other a writer and yet the writing always took me out of the storyline Michael Chabon has a style of writing that just comes across as if I was sludging thru a wasteland of armatures never sturdy enough to hold onto the tangible storyline I was always reminded that I was reading and never felt I could just enter ino the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-rated","review":"How this book won a Pulitzer I'll never know. There may be material here for a couple of good short stories, but a 700 page book?!I kept on anticipating some fabulous, comic book sized event to take place, but the book never got \\"lift off\\".Several friends told me it was a good piece of historical writing, that war-time New York and the golden age of comics were beautifully captured. I have a love of old comic books and the people who created them, but it fails to capture that magic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Takes 10 minutes to read 5 minutes of action.","review":"This is the most overwritten book that I have ever read. This author could write for 2 pages about his own fingerprint. This book could have been cut in half and been much more interesting! I read books to get into the plot, not read a lot of fancy prose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over-written prose distracts from the story","review":"I found this book to be horribly over-written. The prose was so distracting and mis-used that it, unfortunately, took away from what might have been a very good story. Sometimes, it seems the Pulitzer committee awards based on vocabulary. And really, in my mind, the words a writer uses should pull you in, not distract you. This book was not great. O.K., at best. Want a good book? Read \\"Sacred Country\\" by Rose Tremain or the Booker Prize-winning \\"White Tiger.\\" Those books will blow you away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chabon Has Done Considerably Better","review":"I agree with most of the others who found the book overblown with characters that should have become more interesting than the comics they loved. What I find truly interesting, though, is the number of people who found this book engaging. I read it on the basis of good reviews. Likely my last Chabon book, which is sad because he has written some wonderful stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Irritating Zig-Zags","review":"I like the writing in this book. I like the characters in it. It took me to a different time and place. The characters are rich and complex. I cannot, however, recommend this book. It has many sub-stories within its main storyline. Many of them are never resolved. They just fade away. The book zig-zags all of the place. I finished four-fifths of the book and gave up. I got tired of twists and turns that ended nowhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe this won the Pulitzer.","review":"The only reason I finished the book is so I could feel qualified to write a review, and express my distaste for the writing. My impression is that Mr. Chabon has an overly developed verbal capability, but has nothing of any substance to say. The plot and character interaction were juvenile, the writing style overly embellished, and the book was much too long. Finishing it was a truly painful experience. The Pulitzer has lost all credibility."},{"rating":"1","title":"I kept waiting for the good parts...","review":"It's possible that I went into this book with inaccurate expectations, but I was dissappointed with it.I think the one big hindrance I had was that I am not an immigrant, I am not gay, and I don't hate German people.These three topics seemed to be the driving motivations for the characters in the book. While the story appears to be floating around a fictitious comic book publishing company, the personal lives of the artist and writer are where we spend most of our time.This author may not appreciate that a heterosexual man may not want to read about a character's homosexual attraction to another man. Or that descendants of German immigrants may not want to read about Germans being so hated and reviled during this period .I'm sure that jewish, gay men living in New York find this book to be wonderful, the author does write very well.But I and most people I know here in the south are probably not part of the target audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"A comics book without the graphics.","review":"It is a needlessly thick tome of unconvincing events and sequences. The atmosphere and style is similar to that of comics books. I dare say it is a comics book without the graphics. Highly unrecompensed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mind-numbingly boring","review":"Chabon has a masterful command of the English language. Either that, or he has a masterful command of a thesaurus. I've never seen such unnecessary vocabulary used anywhere. It was excessive, confusing and at times, it looked like he only wrote these words to show off.Mr. Chabon - Tell a story. Tell it well. Stop writing.Unless you have a lot of time to flip the pages of this directionless and frustrating book, skip it. Read something more interesting and exciting. There's plenty out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Verbal Gymnastics","review":"Two words describe this book. Slow & Boring. Chabon is one of those authors that apparently writes with a dictionary by his side. I've never seen so many words that I've never heard of before.(Except Clive Barker's Imajica)The story just never moves along and I think that it is written for those with a jewish backround. I just didn't understand all his judaic references. ( Would someone please tell me what a Golem is ?) If you're looking for an adventurous book than this is not for you. If you are looking for another book that plods along and wallows in it's self important vocabulary and all along you are thinking that boy am I smart I can understand everything he is writing than this is for you.To compare this with a comic book as some others are would be to liken charles dickens to spongebob squarepants"},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthy candidate for \\"Great American Novel\\"","review":"I'm not an avid reader of comic books, but this novel is simply wonderful. Spanning more than two decades around WWII, this book traces the friendship/partnership of two Jewish cousins in NYC as they launch their famous comic book character The Escapist. The story goes from Prague to Brooklyn to Antarctica, weaving together the lives of the two cousins Sammy Clay and Joe Kavalier, and their friend/muse Rosa Saks (Luna Moth). Chabon's writing is brilliant: the way he develops his characters and unfolds their stories (not always in chronological order -- he saves some surprises for his readers) is a pleasure to read. When thinking of candidates for the title of \\"Great American Novel,\\" this one falls right up there with To Kill a Mockingbird, The Great Gatsby, and Adventures of Huckleberry Finn."},{"rating":"2","title":"So much stimuli but no big BANG","review":"I enjoy Chabon's writing, he has a secret message in his stories that take on more meanings then one. But after the halfway point of this story the reader knows where the pieces will fall, looks at the remaining 300 pages, and says \\"they better not\\", but they do. The first time I read Kavalier and Clay I skipped to the back and read what happened just to confirm my hypothesis, and happily read on from the point I left off. I have read all of Chabons work and I like this book the best, partially because it is a great story and partially because Chabons creative and loud vocabulary stands out so much. But there is no gold at the end of the rainbow, what was previously just a hunch becomes a reality and the book leaves you starving for a more mature ending."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great but somewhat disappointing American experience","review":"Through the first two thirds of of Kavalier and Klay, Chabon shows a great mastery of the story-telling art. The novel moves with perfect pace and beautifully constructed sentences. Chabon captures much of the American experience of the era, particularly in regards to the immigrant experience. But Chabon gets hung up on a certain element in the last third (I won't reveal exactly what it is, as it is a major plot factor). Consequently the book almost falls apart in my opinion. Chabon hammers the reader over the head with this certain aspect, and it simply becomes annoying. Perhaps others won't view it as large a hinderance as I do, but for me it became too heavy-handed. Overall, I still believe the book is a great accomplishment and a great read for anyone, but it would have benefited from a little more restraint on Chabon's part in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Amazing Book...is it the Great American Novel?","review":"I have read this book four times now, every couple months or so, and it still floors me every time.The breath and scope is astonishing...From Prague, to NYC, to Antartica!! Tackles so many themes so successfully. A pleasure to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was a Pulitzer?","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this novel. In a nutshell, Chabon took the movie Chasing Amy, stripped away the sharp dialogue and provocative examination of courtship and sexual politics and managed to walk away with a Pulitzer. Intriguing themes such as Holocaust survivor's guilt and homosexuality / family values in the 40's and 50's ran throughout the novel. Chabon, however, failed to explore these themes with the thought and insight worthy of a Pulitzer. Time and time again, pivotal life-altering decisions made by the characters were summarized in a few pages, or glossed over entirely leaving the reader with 500+ pages of filler material. The result is a book with a hollow plot and lackluster character development that was difficult to finish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I was disappointed in this book. I didn't even finish it. I tried and tried to like it, but it was just too dense and there wasn't enough reward to keep going. It reminded me a bit of the The Fountainhead, only the story isn't as good and the characters aren't nearly as interesting. They are somewhat intriguing. That's what kept me coming back to it, but after I'd made it halfway through without ever getting to anything that \\"hooked\\" me in, I decided it wasn't worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating page turner","review":"I couldn't put this down. It was so interesting and twisty-turny. It was very interesting, very funny at times and still poignant. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baroque, yes. But brilliant, too","review":"I haven't been so taken by a book for a long, long time. Chabon's use of language, while sometimes over the top, is also frequently so evocative and original that I'm amazed. Beyond this, the book is also very funny, quite moving, and full of enough plot to keep the reader turning the pages. I don't even like comic books, but Chabon makes this world so engaging, and so intrinsically woven into the world of pre-war New York, that it becomes fascinating. Really a tour de force. Give it a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lacks depth","review":"The characters, plot, and themes lack any sort of interesting, analytical depth that makes a book worth reading. Chabon is consistently infatuated with the extreme breadth of his vocabulary, which is quite impressive but is not enough to carry a book or make a book \\"great.\\" While reading this gigantic paperweight of a novel, I also read a book by Graham Greene and a handful of short stories by Flannery O'Conner just so that I wouldn't forget WHY I enjoy reading. I slogged through to the end and found that I had held out hope only to be left still wanting something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"many toos","review":"This book was too long, too confusing and too much work to read and understand.

Moments of insight."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was not worth the time it took me to read it.","review":"I had read a number of online reviews telling how wonderfull this novel was, but when I read it for myself I was extreamly disapointed by its lack of everything. I finished the book thinking why did I read this? It dragged in plot and flipped around so much that I could keep things straight. I do not recomend this book to anyone who likes to read, becase you will be let down. And for those people who hate to read, don't go near this book because it will bite you and you'll get discouredged from reading anything"},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly puerile (hence its popularity)","review":"This 640-page essay in political correctness is a bloated bore of a book whose fanatical reception is a frightening commentary on the utter debasement of U.S. literary \\"culture.\\" If you love comic books, never progressed beyond puberty in your mental and emotional development, think like everybody else does, and have an infinite capacity for tolerating tediousness, this is definitely the book for you. The author is far from unskilled in verbal artistry, but his conception of character, plot, and theme is that of a highly gifted high school sophomore. In short, this is a children's book, not something a mature adult can enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Writer Gone Pulitzer Prize Winner","review":"Chabon lost his touch. After winning the Pulitzer for Wonder Boys, he has begun to take himself to seriously. Glances at the dust covers of the two books tell the story (in less than Kavalier&#65533;s droll 600+ pages). Chabon&#65533;s portrait goes from light and genuine, to over-polished and dreary. His bio shifts from lucky kid from Pittsburgh, to &#65533;living in Berkeley, with his wife, also a novelist&#65533;&#65533; Kavalier and Clay is a slow and trite attempt to a period piece that is like watching a Charlie Chaplin movie with your eyes closed. Instead of reading this book, read Wonder one more time. If you liked Wonder, try Lit Life by Kurt Wenzel."},{"rating":"1","title":"About two-thirds too long","review":"Less a novel than Chabon's ample opinion of his vocabulary, this book needed editing like Britney Spears needs underpants. Too long, too ambitious, too bad I was not warned!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pullitzer Prize Ausbrecher=Escape","review":"I really wanted to know how a Jewish boy from Prague made it big with his cousin in New York.

The pair in the box wasn't stopped by the Reichssicherheitsdienst; they were probably not more on the ball than Homelandsecurity is nowadays, I was withering on the vine of boredom and at page 200 I quit; 400 pages short of the end, never met Houdini or Tesla and other Ausbrecher. The author must have won the Pullitzer-Prize in a sweepstake. Give me a break!

Should do his homework first."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Turgid and Verbose, Yet Original Novel","review":"I had high expectations for this novel when my wife finished it and told me the entertaining subject. For the first 70 pages I was fully engaged and interested, especially about the fascinating story of the artist who escaped from the Nazis during World War II. Thereafter, I started skipping long sections of the novel owing to redundant descriptions and a very slow pace. Unfortunately, Mr. Chabon took an original subject and got bogged down in excruciating detail. It is indeed ironic that a novel about the fast-paced world of comic book characters reads more like a treatise on the art of the comic book. Perhaps the editor and not the author is at fault."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brilliant beginning turns unfocused and long-winded...","review":"What starts as a wonderful and exciting story of WWII comic book geniuses turns into an exercise in \\"admire my writing technique\\", complete with painfully long diatribes and head-scratching tangents. In the end, a very disappointing book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I'm really sorry to have to disagree with the reviewers below but, I was so disappointed I have to speak out. This book has all the trappings of a page turner; 2 boy genuises, WW2, the Holocaust, nazis, a magician, a strong man, escape artists, a golem and the Golden Age of the comic book industry. All that and homoerotic undertones in the main characters' friendship too! It promised to be good. Unfortunately it wasn't. The prose is written in an overblown, florid pulp-fiction style that sometimes works and but, just as often is distracting or annoying. The author also favors lengthy description of just about everything. While this kind of detail would make for some great visuals in a movie it drags down the plot of the book. I got a third of the way through this book and just had to give up. Quite frankly, I was bored.Bottom line: skip this book and wait for the movie kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful characters - They are so real!!","review":"Joe, Rosa and Sam are so well described through their actions thast you really care about them.I thought Chabon did a marvelous job entertaining the reader. There is not much action to the story, but you love the characters so much you just want to see what happens to them.And that is the hallmark of a wonderful author.I wish I could read more about what happens to Joe and Rosa, and Sammy after the novel ends. I want a sequel.Anyway, anyone who give this book anything less than a near perfect rating, is either malicious, inexperienced, or not an avid reader.Becasue this is a beautifully written novel, and deserves all the praise it has received.Great job Michael!! I hope one day to get my copy autographed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't understand all the hoopla","review":"While the detail is overwhelming, it is also awkwardly integrated into the story. At times the plot seems lost, and then, all of a sudden, like magic, it is there in full Hollywood-style melodrama. Some moments are absolutely implausible. You'd do better to stick to the Chabon stories... now, they're as light as air..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, if not a bit pretentious","review":"Although I have not yet finished Kavalier & Clay, I am thoroughly enjoying the book. Chabon is truly gifted -- while reading this, I find myself saddened now and then at the knowledge that I will never write like he does -- although at times his word choice and obscure allusions are somewhat pretentious. In other words, this is a great story that could be told in \\"not so many words.\\"Nontheless, with 100 pages to go, I know I will be awake most of the night trying to finish. I find myself sucked into 1940s and 50s NYC, and involved in the lives of these characters -- all of whom I could befriend -- and it's difficult to put the book down once the plot gets rolling. I recommend Kavalier & Clay to anyone who enjoys well-crafted writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't put it down.","review":"This book is a gem. One of the best I have ever read. Here's some example of what I mean by one of the best:1. I was emotionally involved in the characters. By the end of the book, I felt sympathy for them, cried with them, and was happy for them.2. I couldn't put the book down. I am a slow reader, but flew through this book in record time. All of my spare time I wanted to spend reading this book.3. It won the Pulitzer!4. Chabon came up with an amazing way of weaving a tale that incorporates both fantasy and reality. This story may be about a seemingly lighthearted topic on the cover synopsis (comics), but in reality, it's a story about human relationships and life. I was deeply moved by the story.5. The book had an underlying theme of escape. It's a profound statement for times such as those we live in. Escape is noble goal. This book helped me escape, but provoked some good thinking as well.I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys good literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"so close to great","review":"Chabon needs a more aggressive editor (either internal or external).While I found huge chunks of this book just stunningly beautiful, too often it felt bloated. This book will not last.I don't suppose I regret reading The Amazing Adventures..., but I think it's unfortunate that the tighter novel within this novel was not rescued.Also, at some points I had to check the cover to make sure that I hadn't picked up Ragtime by mistake.Sometimes less is more.I wish Chabon or his editor had realized this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathtaking adventures in NYC","review":"This book is a work of art. Every young (and young in heart) reader, will find this book very interesting. I admire the research work that was done by the talented author Michael Chabon. There so much to learn from this book: about the history of the Jewish community in Czecoslovakia prior to WWII, about WWII itself, about living in NYC in the 30's, 40's and 50's. Of course, this book is also like an encyclopedia for funny-books history. Those who have ever visited or lived in NYC, would find the book even more interesting, since major part of the story takes place in the big apple. The amazing story is full of surprises, wonderful unexpected moments, misteries and magical adventures. I couldn't get my hands (and my eyes) off the book. Absolutely, work of art!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing is a fitting description","review":"I loved this book: I loved that it was about comic books and magicians and NYC during the 1940s, and that it has a golem.

Just go out and get this wonderfully exciting yet human story today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Captivating, imaginative and totally human","review":"I was surprised that I actually felt regretful, even sad, when I finished the book. Definitely my favourite to date! The tale, one of epic proportion, revolves around the lives of 3 characters - Josef, Sammy and Rosa - all of whom were totally real and believeable. And the care at which Chabon develops his characters is simply mind-blowing. The entire tale wasn't rushed in any way (600+ pages) and yet it absorbed me right from the very first page. Chabon writes with amazing prose and captures the imagination of his readers with his introspective, and descriptive writing while maintaining the pace of the story throughout. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Luna Moth... ohh...","review":"I loved this book from Page One, and still loved it at the end. The protagonists are gutsy and short-sighted and irritating and magical... they're human, and beautifully so. The sub-plot of the comics is nothing short of brilliant. Each one of them was so believable, I wished he had a companion comic book to go along with the book. I've recommended this to many people... truly worthy of the Pulitzer, unlike the doubtful book that won this year's prize.... Compelling read. You'll be thinking about the characters, human or otherwise, long after you put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Scott! It's a Hit!","review":"There is a sweetness about this book that surprised and gratified me beyond measure. It is the 1930's, and two cousins, one of marginal talent and the other a bona-fide artist, launch a comic-book character. Their genius idea(based on the true history of comics) is to have the comic books set in the\\"real\\" world. So, imagine the drama here: in the first issue, Hitler is delivered a knockout punch!From this first attempt the team of Kavalier & Clay becomes a hit; but what Chabon does that is equally fascinating is take the lives of the creators and turn them into stories that have the vague feel of comic-book adventure and yet feel very plausible as mid-century lives. The writing is so smoothit's like glass.This is the most all-around entertaining book I have readsince Brauner's Love Songs of the Tone-Deaf, which is veryreminiscent in tone and that enthusiastic, yet not dumbed-down American spirit."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC","review":"This is a pretty old book and there are plenty of glowing reviews but I want to be counted among the lovers of The Amazing Adventures of K & C. Something called it to mind. The only reason I'm not giving this book 5 stars is I read it almost ten years ago and don't want to throw around those 5 star ratings but my recollection is of a complex, fascinating and enjoyable read with lots of characters to care about - including Dali."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's long, but it's good.","review":"This was my first time reading Chabon. I like the way he writes and I really liked the story he tells in this book. This may sound odd, but I wanted the book to end so I could find out what happens.Is it for everyone? Probably not. If you are reading Dan Brown, it is not likely you'd like this - I attempted to read Dan once. You want some thing different and you like stories about people? This might be the book for you.The book, to me, is beyond description. There are plenty of long reviews extolling the virtues of this book. You don't need another one. If you are reading the reviews, you probably are interested. Take a chance. I did and it paid off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful story, beautifully told!","review":"There are already scores of 5 star reviews with clear descriptions of this book. I'm writing to dispute an earlier comment-- that the book would hold power only for those who love comic books, or are of the WW2 generation. I'm 24, I've never read a comic book, and I couldn't disagree more. I didn't find the comic book references at all confusing or distracting-- they just give the story a little context, color, and humor. The story is so strong, so well crafted, and so beautifully told it would be a shame for a younger, non-comic lover, to shy away from it based on the previous poster's comments."},{"rating":"2","title":"muddles in the middle, otherwise great","review":"This book starts off just... excellent. I was immediately absorbed and couldn't put it down.Then there is the middle section, where the cousins split apart, and they pretty much don't interact anymore. The novel thus loses steam.Towards the end it picks up the pace, though.A fun ride. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best I've read in a while","review":"In looking at some other reviews, I caught myself momentarily wondering if I read the same book as people who were declaring it so mediocre. Cavalier and Klay is incredible. It could have gone on even longer for me. It does skip around in some places, but I don't think it hurts the book any. The writing is clean, but heartfelt. It's the polar opposite of Dave Eggers heartless (albeit funny) prose.I also recently read The Brothers K and I would have to say both books are forcing their way into my favorites."},{"rating":"1","title":"OVERRATED","review":"This is an amazingly silly book. Poorly executed prose, lame meandering plot and boring characters. It's mind boggling how this book won any award."},{"rating":"1","title":"Couldn't finish this book","review":"This book [isn't good] to put it mildly. I finally put this book down half way through. I *REALLY* tried to read it all the way through as I always finish a book I start. I jsut couldn't take it anymore. I was bored. I hated Cabon's writting prose, I hated his charachters, I hated this book period. I would not recommend this book to anyone. I'd rather pull all my eyelashes out for fun than read this book.on a side note..maybe the movie will be better!?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Colossal Bore","review":"To be honest I couldn't even finish this book.I'm a comic book collector. My brother is a comic book writer. I know comic books. I know the history of comic books.I also know this book is boring and is uninteresting after the boys get their comic book career off the ground.Also, call me \\"homophobic\\", but does the author have to put a homosexual writer in every book? (Wonder Boys had one as well) This just didn't ring true - it had the feeling of \\"I need a homosexual writer\\" rather than Sammy NEEDING to be a homosexual writer.After it got boring, it got stupid - the entire World War 2 segment in particular. We went from quasi-realistic to soap opera mush in the span of about 10 pages.Please skip telling me that it \\"ended great\\" - because I don't care. I'm off reading GOOD books now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bored..","review":"I first heard about this book when mention was made of it on The OC, a television show. One of the characters, Seth, liked to read it, or had read it innumerable times.I thought I'd check it out on Amazon, and found that it was a Pulitzer Prize winning novel and that it had a lot of good reviews.I have always liked comic-books, and since the book is the story of two comic-book writers in the 40's, I thought it'd be good.I have to say, that the book didn't really hold my interest. I persevered with it, until just over half-way through, where I was put off by the homosexual antics of one of the characters.I still kept reading, but the gay stuff kept coming up, so I quit reading it.Maybe that wouldn't be enough to put some off, but, as I said, it was quite boring before that even.There are better novels on escapes and magic."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was this???","review":"This book was recommended to me by a friend who stated it was one of the finest books she ever read. Perhaps I did not understand the story. I missed the point of the story. I could not relate to the characters. I did not find ir humorous. But did struggle to read it to the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Damn Good","review":"I don't know, this book just clicked for me. Chabon weaves the story of two comic book creators into reality, with enough indexed information and works sited that it reads like a true accout. The story is good. I'll just put it that simply. If you give this book a try, I'm sure you'll enjoy it. Otherwise, I wouldn't want to know you."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than a Comic Book Novel","review":"An amazing novel. A very simple statement, and obvious since this won the Pulitzer. This novel, on the surface, seems to be about the golden age of U.S. Comic Book publishing, but is really about two cousins, trying to escape their lives, and also includes some very well researched pop culture references to the era it is set in.The novel is a joy to read. The words just flow through you and create the images, smells, and sounds of the story. I normally read at a very brisk pace but as I read this book I slowed down so that I could savor this novel and extend my enjoyment of it.If you enjoy reading, you will love this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, verbose, and ends abruptly","review":"The title says it all. The characters were just interesting enough to keep me reading...kept waiting for some kind of payoff to make the investment of time worthwhile...never happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not compute.","review":"Could someone please explain to me how this won any award, much less the Pulitzer? I have loved every Pulitzer-winning novel I have ever read. Until now. Chabon's writing style drove me CRAZY. Too long, too many adjectives, and he does this annoying little thing with footnotes. I could not wait for this book to be OVER."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Pulitzer Dud","review":"I am a big Chabon fan and bought this book days after it hit the shelves. I couldn't even finish it. I got 350 pages in and realized I was reading an impressive research project that didn't contain a single character I cared about. It's amazing how often a young writer's learning to please some award committee coincides precisely with failing to please his/her biggest fans. If I want to learn about WWII New York and the history of comic books, I'll browse the non-fiction aisles. When I pick up Chabon, I'm looking for characters I want to take to bed with me every night. Don't expect to find them here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plodding, like a plow horse","review":"I'm an avid reader of many different genres - historical fiction, mystery, non-fiction history, sci-fi, fantasy, and even comic books and graphic novels. I generally like a deep, multi-faceted tome. I adore Umberto Eco. But this one never got moving - the action is as dull and plodding as an old plow horse, every bit of minutiae is pondered and examined and wondered at for so long, the book forgets its own plotlines. The characters, while promising at first, never fully develop into three dimensional people for me. And I found, that at about page 200, I couldn't care less if I ever found out what happened to these people. That's when I put the book down and moved on. I cannot believe this brick won a Pulitzer."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Pulitzer? Puh-lease","review":"I chose this book thinking that since it had won the Pulitzer Prize, it must be a masterpiece. Boy, was I disappointed! This novel is long, rambling and seems to go absolutely nowhere. Where's the climax? There is none. Don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay","review":"I have read other books by Michael Chabon, but this was by far the most inventive and well written. There is a reason why this book was a Pulitzer Prize winner which will become evident once you get into it. The price and shipping were OK, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful read!","review":"This is the type of book that stays with you long after you've finished reading it. Chabon takes his readers on a can't wait to turn the page adventure into the world of comics, magic and escapism as he expertly develops the main characters Sammy Clay, Joe Kavalier and Rosa. As they interact with each other and with a wealth of other interesting and unusual characters in the book the reader shares each character's dreams and visions and adventures through Chabon's exceptional style and mastery of the written word. You will yearn for more and as you reach the final pages. Read this book slowly and be mesmerized. Truly deservant of the Pulitzer Prize."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful History","review":"The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay is a wonderful snapshot of America immediately preceding WWII. For anyone who is old enough to have loved comic books, known American culture pre MTV and media immersion, or who just loves recent American History, AAKC is a wonderful book. The characters are interesting, and the command of facts the author brings to his subject superb. It's also one that can be read while commuting or travelling because the inner stories are episodic. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Comic Books and World Wars!!!","review":"When it comes to fiction, my tastes usually run to Sci-Fi, but my book club chose this book and I was amazingly surprised(pun intended)! Michael Chabon uses the real world of WWII and Comicsto bring his fictional characters to life. You feel what Josef feels as he escapes from Nazi occupied Prague and joins his cousin and partner Sammy in New York. You wish you were at the party with Harkoo and Salvadore Dali and that you could see the Empire Comics studio as the boys are weaving their magic.The story is believeable and the setting is unforgetable.This book is a must read!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A good example for a synthetic novel","review":"I like comic strips and respect them as a literary and art form. I am sincerely touched by the horrible suffering brought about by the Holocaust. I feel for homosexuals who are persecuted for their sexual identity. So why does this book not touch me emotionally? I had a similar experience reading Carlos Ruiz Zafon's 'Shadow of the Wind': in both cases the authors seem to be too clever for their own good, mixing ingredients and 'Zeitgeist' that seem to make sure to catch the attention of the reader and guarantee media attention and sales. In the case of Kavalier & Clay neither the story with all its improbabilities nor the characters with their shallowness convinced. A waste of time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you don't like comic books you won't like this one either","review":"It's probably not fair that I write a review for this book, considering the fact I never finished it. Maybe it was just about to turn around and become interesting. But I doubt it. The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier & Clay combines a background of the horrors of Jewish persecution under Nazi Germany, with some kind of weird fascination with comic book super heroes. I suppose I just didn't get it since I've never had any interest in super heroes or most comic books. If you're a comic book fan you might feel otherwise. It's well written, and apparently meticulously researched. However, I was a bit put off by some of the writing which uses a form of the English language somewhat above my education level (Which only reached bachelors degree). You like comic books and super heroes? You might love this book. Lot's of people did. But not this guy. It goes back to the Salvation Army for the next reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a great book","review":"Well developed characters. Continually surprised about how they developed, but still remained in character. Eloquently written. Some memorable and brilliant paragraphs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I cannot understand the wide appeal of this book. Obviously, a lot of the reviewers here loved it. I wanted to love it, too, having heard wonderful things about the book and the author; but after forcing myself through about 250 pages, I just had to give up. By that point, I couldn't muster the slightest interest in the characters or anything they did. Chabon's brand of humor did not appeal to me and the mystical aspects of the book seemed more preposterous than magical (unlike some other books I've loved, like Love in the Time of Cholera). I guess I missed something, but this book bored me more than anything I've read in years."},{"rating":"1","title":"What went wrong here?","review":"I have been a huge fan of Michael Chabon's books up until this one. It took me a while to get into it and then it took a lot to keep me interested. When I got to the part when Joe was in Alaska with that guy who was skinning the dogs and gluing their fur to the plane, I almost put it down without finishing it. But I had to finish it - I had to see where the story would go from there, and then I was sorely disappointed because I felt that the ending was rushed and wrapped up too neatly. If the part about Joe's time in Alaska had been cut out and more attention paid to the ending and the characters, this would have been a much better book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"This was a fun and engrossing read, I love Chabon, and this is my personal favorite book by him. The Yiddish Policeman's Union didn't quite stand up to expectations, but this book is fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Love Story","review":"The love abounds in this wonderful novel, but the most shining love story is Chabon's obvious love for the Golden Age greats: Siegel and Schuster, Simon and Kirby, Gil Kane, Shelly Moldoff, Joe Kubert, Will Eisner. Love for men who didn't know the art that they were making, and how they were changing the face of the world.Chabon's style is lyrical, and not strictly my cup of tea. But the passion he has for these characters and these stories leaks off the page, and absolutely pulled me in. The epic sweep of this book is always anchored by the characters that compel you to read further, and the love that wracks your heart.If you're not a comic fan, worry not. This book is for you as well. It's simply a wonderful, engaging novel, regardless of subject matter. But if you read carefully , you might learn why the Golden Age of Comics had it's luster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Reader","review":"This is an amazing book from one of, if not, the most talented writers in America today. If you want to be lifted away on a magic carpet ride of adventures, beautiful and hauntingly accurate descriptions of people and places, humor, pathos, intriguing facts, in depth history, and real human relationships, then read this book. It will be well worth your time. If you want straight plot with no delicious decriptions or wonderful and tantalizing prose, as it appears another \\"reader\\" does than go to the grocery store and buy some Tom Clancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great","review":"I started to read this novel with a bit of excitement as it came to me highly recommended. The prose is so ponderous to get through, that by the time I've reached the end of one of his run-on sentences, I have to reread the beginning to know what it was about. (Like that one!) I'm afraid that my $12.99 Kindle purchase price went down the drain."},{"rating":"2","title":"escapism","review":"This book robbed me of three nights worth of sleep, but it was worth it. The depth of research by Chabon allows the reader to enter past times and places effortlessly, and to watch as the characters live and grow among a dizzying set of circumstances."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Great American Novel?","review":"Believe everything that you've heard about this book. It's an ambitious book that reminds you of a time when writers believed in themselves and believed in the Holy Grail of The Great American Novel. Critics will feel uncomfortable about the expansiveness and the scope of the novel and their comments will be reminiscent of criticism of Twain's Huck Finn. There are times when we need to know the greatness in life and simply relish it, enjoy it as much as we can. Mr. Chabon has given us such a gift with this book. In short, Michael Chabon is the Michael Jordan of the literary world right now. Relish his achievements."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish I could give it more than 5 stars","review":"Always skeptical when reviews are toooo good? Believe everything you read that is positive about this wonderful book. Definitely an original and worth every accolade it has earned. And now, having won the Pulitzer, here's hoping Mr. Chabon finally gets the readership he deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enthralling, but slightly disappointing","review":"I must say this is an extremely enjoyable, lightning-quick read, but I was a little disappointed overall. I'm giving this 5 stars because it was so much fun and so darned good-hearted, but some of the writing is a bit... er... klunky. A lot of it is written beautifully, but it has an unfinished quality to it. The constant similes - some of them awfully clever - keep much of it from flowing as smoothly as one might like. Chabon also tends to be a bit more obvious than he really needs to be at times. Many sentences seem to have blinking, neon signs pointing to them, saying \\"This is the book's theme\\". Those are relatively minor complaints, though. The characters are so likeable and well-developed that I could have forgiven even more."},{"rating":"2","title":"On my list of favorite books","review":"\\"The Amazing Adventures of Kavalier and Clay\\" is by far one of my favorite books. I love the characters and the incorporation of comic-book culture into the story. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The novel reads like a film","review":"This is an amazing book. There are so many novels being published today that are written so simplistically they are more screenplays than literature. What is special about Kavalier and Klay is the depth and beauty of the visuals. About the golden age of comic books and other exceptionally significant parts of the twentieth century you are carried away by the perfect, constant descriptions of place, atmosphere and human emotion and it is in this way that the book reads like the very best aspects of the very best film. I literally look forward to the film that demands to be made to bring this incredible work of fiction to life.I see Adrian Brody as Kavalier, Elijah Wood as Klay and Zoey Deschanel as Rosa but that's just me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well-written, but I see what many are saying . . .","review":"First off, this novel never gets boring, which is quite an achievement for something so long. Chabon does an impressive job of telling the tale of two cousins with different backgrounds. Yet while the story and delivery are first-rate, there isn't exactly a literary message per se beyond keys, locks and imprisonment, be this last of the physical, social, mental or emotional sort. Sure, you could go back and write a book report about that sort of symbolism, but you don't really come away from the novel the same way you might with \\"Catcher in the Rye,\\" \\"The Heart is a Lonely Hunter,\\" \\"Elmer Gantry\\" or \\"The Great Gatsby,\\" but then those have weathered the test of time and \\"Kavalier and Clay\\" might suffer from being a work of contemporary fiction in that regard. What author who writes today really attains that kind of status in the here and now? Irving, Updike and Cormac McCarthy . . . maybe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I was dazzled and totally engrossed in this tale of the golden era of comic books. I love Chabon's style of writing and the deep character developement of Joseph Kavalier and Sam Clay. It is an extraordinary tale of survival of life during the time of World War II, and the extreme hardships one immigrant has to endure. Chabon writes in elegant, fluid details of the trivialities that occurs in the comic book business and its creators. This definetly is Pulitzer worthy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I bought this book solely off the enjoyment I had in reading Chabon's \\"Wonder Boys\\". When it arrived, I quickly dove into it, and for the first half of the book, was engrossed (I am somewhat of a comic book fan, and the subject matter was extremely interesting and well presented). Then enter the predictable and trite parts of the book. As soon as the \\"Ark of Miriam\\" was sunk, this book went down with it. It became a labor to finish, and when I was finished, I felt like I had been cheated off of a promise. The book just ended. I was left wondering whether or not a chapter was left off of the book accidently. After reading \\"Wonder Boys\\", I was thoroughly disappointed with this book and I am left wondering whether it is worth going back to read some of Chabon's earlier work. I think not!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading title","review":"It is with some kind of relief that I discover I am not the only one who hasn't finished reading this acclaimed novel. An American friend had recommended the book to me, and I was attracted by the promising title, which I found rather misleading afterwards. After several attempts and 200 pages of confusing reading, I gave up trying to understand. If you're looking for an exciting story about two young people, this novel is certainly not for you.At the same time, I read \\"The Solitude of Prime Numbers\\" by Paolo Giordano, in two days - simply breathtaking!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Hit for Mr Chabon","review":"I have loved reading everything Michael Chabon has written since I bought The Mysteries of Pittsburgh on a whim. This book is everything the professional critics have said. Mr Chabon has laid out a wonderful fictional history. He has clearly researched the comic book genre and learned its beauty well enough to mimic it and show it respect. This book is a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"This to me is a classic example of a known author, who because he is famous, his work becomes sloppy and unedited.He could easily have cut out 1/4 of the book and tightened things up. He drags the characters all over but I never felt like I got to know them. Also the period piece stuff felt really forced. Like he's saying: Look everybody it's the 1940s."},{"rating":"1","title":"Say what?","review":"I don't consider myself a lightweight when it comes to reading books. I have plowed through many boring books, usually non-fiction tomes.Remember \\"Giles Goat-Boy,\\" by the English professor, John Barth? That was considered a good book in its day, and I did finish it. I was much younger then.Chabon's book reminded me a bit of Barth's book, with its long, drawn-out arcane descriptions that the respective authors maybe thought would appeal to the reading public.I couldn't finish Chabon's book. I found it boring, confusing, too long, and the book itself (the paperbook) was hard to hold in the hands.I notice that some people found the book really intriguing, so it's probably just a matter of personal taste. But I can say that I personally know of at least one other avid reader who also did not like this book. Diximus."},{"rating":"1","title":"threw book away after reading 500 pages","review":"When I'll put a book in the trash rather than donate it, then I don't feel right about passing it along.It starts out okay, then it gets a little slow, then it gets disgusting. After that I don't know.I'm just guessing, but I think it got the Pulitzer prize for political correctness."},{"rating":"1","title":"All things are not \\"a matter of opinion\\".","review":"Opinion may be \\"amazing\\"; there is nevertheless such a thing as good taste and such a thing as bad taste. Good taste and good judgement will recognize that however admirable some of its qualities are, this book simply does not come together, does not form a unified aesthetic whole. This does not mean \\"Amazing adventures\\" hasn't other faults; it means its failure to cohere is its most significant fault. (Neither will good taste and good judgement consider Hemingway and Tom Robbins comparable, by the bye.)...Never believe ANY hype (or one who urges you to)."},{"rating":"1","title":"This got a Pulitzer????!","review":"Hard to believe that so many other reviewers found this book worthy -- including the Pulitzer Prize jury.

I like the way they've designed the weights to fit in front and back pockets, but would have liked to see a storage case for the weights. It will be a while before I get to the point of using all 40 weights and storing them can be a bit of a hassle.Overall, the vest is comfortable, durable and adjustable to fit.

Teri Polo has been one of my favorites in Hollywood since I saw her in this movie back when it came out back in 1993. Peter Berg is great as Dexter Rutecki and I like Paul Gross as T.J. Burke. How hot is Finola Hughes as Bryce Kellogg the rich and snobbish ski bunny. The skiing footage is great and breathtaking scenic views are plentiful.

The lead meets a wonderful female disk jockey who truly understands him and a rich woman who wants to use him as a plaything. Hmmm. Which one will he choose?

When the book arrived, from Amazon.com, I was initially disappointed; it appeared to be more of a 'booklet' than a book. And for twenty-five bucks, I expected more.Reading the book proved even a bigger disappointment; if I could, I'd return it for a refund. It was more a good old boy's story and rememberances than anything practical or useful.At most, this book should sell for $12. to $15. Even at that, I would not buy it after looking through it.If you want a nice story about a guy and his 48 Chrysler, buy it.

It is an interesting read, and more so for me since I just bought an identical car. I have to say that I was hoping for a little more detail and analysis of options on the specific car. For example, since the title says restore, I thought that there might be some discussion / sources / charts of the original options, colors, fabrics, etc. I think repair, repaint and reupholster is more accurate than restore.The book is longer on the author's personal story than of the car. Given his NASA background I had also hoped for a more technical diescussion.The book is not large or long and cost [money].

The book is especially strong on this latter feature, with detailed information (sometimes going on for pages) of each locale. I can only find one place that was somehow missed - a location known as Benjamin, which was someplace near Perkasie and had a post office from 1887-1917. (Anyone know where this might have been?) This is one of the few place names books that can be read for sheer pleasure as well as for specific information. Bucks County residents can be proud that such a book exists that so well describes and details their homeland.

I am a huge fan of Ted's guitar showmanship and even though I have almost all of his studio albums, I don't find myself returning very often to them because his lyrics are stupid and sexist and just aren't very intelligent. Not that I'm saying that I have to have extremely intelligent lyrics like you might get from Rush, but Nugent's stuff is so dumb he looks like an idiot a lot of the time. This INTENSITIES IN 10 CITIES is about the bottom of the barrel for old Teddy and I am just a few minutes away from selling my copy of this here on Amazon. I have such an extensive collection of all types of music that I don't need this taking up precious space I need for more valuable cd's.

Crummy songs (new songs, never recorded before), poor quality (production is very weak, a recurring theme on Nugent's albums after \\"Cat Scratch Fever\\"), all in all a bad album.

The pacing is so slow, that I found myself skipping ahead fifty or sixty pages, only to find that I could still keep current with the tale. Another fifty or sixty-page skip...same thing.

I read a little of everything, but lately, I felt a bit bored with some other types of work. I read ten pages, and borrowed it from my brother. Eight hours later I was finished. Very fast paced and easy to follow. A strong storyline, with survival of the fittest as the principal element.

It's a real page-turner and very fast paced. I absolutely loved it and it reminds me of the \\"Living Dead\\" movies, which I love! I couldn't put it down and I like that for once, the children are not the actual problem.

Not recommended for anyone over 30!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The End of the World as we Know it!!","review":"When I purchased this book I expected it to be like any other horror book that I've read lately; great beginning, let down ending. Boy, was I in for a shock! It was a rollercoaster ride! Not since a Steven King novel of about eight years ago, have I truly been this engrossed. All the characters, especially Nick Aten, were well written and you can actually experience the terror that they do! It was quite an experience and I highly recommend Blood Crazy to anyone who wants to read an engrossing and highly entertaining book. I LOVED IT!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Most original \\"zombie\\" story out there.","review":"This is my favorite post apocalyptic book.

Blood Crazy is fun, frightening, heartrending, gory, and always entertaining. Did I mention gory? I hate gore.

The dryer gets too hot and because the air flow is not strong enough, you end up burning your hair instead of drying it. If the fan was stronger I think there would be less of a chance to burn the hair, and it would cause less pain on the scalp.

As it turns out, the area where the cord attaches to the handle got so hot that it melted through the plastic coating, exposing about a half-inch of singed wires. A tad bit dangerous if you asked me! Granted, I used this dryer on the highest heat setting everyday for a year, so I got a lot of use out of it, but every other hairdryer I've had in the past simply blows cold air when it stops working properly--this one could've caused me bodily harm.

So... it never died, but it did become possessed, so some element of the afterlife is definitely evident. This thing is a hair-singeing, spark-shooting weapon, folks. If you buy it, use it for something other than what it was designed for or you'll be bald and blind!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good, but not spectacular","review":"If I could, I would rate this product 4.5 stars. It's not a miracle worker, but unlike all other hair dryers I've used, it doesn't fry my fine hair. (Granted, I always keep in on the 'Warm' setting.) I love that it has so may options and the cool blast button really works! I'm not sure that the ions make my hair dry faster, but as an experiment I have, on several occasions, dried with and without the ion setting on and I noticed two things: more even drying (not just dryer in the part of my hair closest to the dryer, but even further out) and softer/smoother texture, with the ion setting. Overall, totally worth the price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY THIS DRYER!!!!","review":"I am not sure if I got a dud one or not but my experience goes like this. For the first two months of owning this hair dryer, it did a fine job. Nothing out of the ordinary--dried my hair just fine. The last time I used it, I noticed the general smell of burning hair when I was done. The dryer did not feel overly hot so I wasn't sure what happend. The next thing I noticed was the floor of my bathroom. There was alot more hair on the floor than usual. Upon closer inspection, I felt sick to my stomach. I noticed that there were actual clumps of hair that had fallen out---including the root. They smelled like burning hair. There were sections that had 10 hairs clumped together by the burned root. I was scared. Needless to say, I am running out today to buy a new hairdryer. Because of the burning smell, I know the hairdryer is to blame rather than a medical condition or something else environmental. Do yourself a favor and purchase a different hair dryer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flames shooting","review":"Beware that after some use of this dryer, the cord loosens at its connection to the body of the dryer. If you lose power just once due to a loose cord connection, STOP using immediately. I didn't. I wiggled the cord and it started blowing hot air again. The next event was flames shooting out at me through the spot where the cord exits the body of the hair dryer. It is not only very scary when you have flames shooting at your face, hair, and clothing, but needless to say, very dangerous.When this dryer works, it is great, but this is not the only review reporting fireworks shooting out of the cord connection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst One EVER!!!

I am sure the hair dyer is defective so buyers beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star is a generous rating","review":"The first time my husband used this dryer, it seemed great. It had lots of power on high. A little while after he had finished using it, he noted that the barrel stayed hot for a long time after it was off. A few days later when I was drying my daughter's hair on high power, the dryer suddenly lost power. The high power had suddenly become almost low power but not quite. I also noticed a smell coming from the dryer. Reading through past reviews, I'm just glad my hair dryer didn't throw off sparks or catch on fire. When I read through the instruction manual, there was a section that stated that the hair dryer had an internal thermometer that would cause the hair dryer to cut power if it became too hot. My dryer managed to reach that too hot temperature in less than a minute of use. Don't waste your money on this hair dryer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible product","review":"I've actually owned three of these! I love the first one, lasted about a year.

Then last week, I was using it and sparks came out of the thing!!! Yes, sparks! I couldn't believe it. I believe that this thing should be recalled, so I contacted Revlon. Revlon wanted no part of it. They told me to contact Helen of Troy. I did that. Now, I am waiting for a reply. I have also contacted the consumer safety commission. I am basically begging for a recall. Please do not buy this hair dryer. After contacting Revlon, I will not buy anything Revlon. (I am David's wife.

I thought it would be good as I have fine long hair.I used it for about 10 minutes and something popped and it sounded different - I looked inside and it was red hot and started smoking. It may have spit out sparks as I felt something hit my head. I thought, this thing is going to light my head on fire.It is brand new and it won't work.Everytime I turn it on it starts to heat up and smokes.I have a wonderful Revlon hair dryer that works great, so I thought it would be good.

You'll love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Dryer!!","review":"This hair dryer is a lot quieter than any other dryer that I've owned. I was also presently suprised that it was so light compared to my travel hairdryer!! I also think it is great that it comes with the concentrator attachment to help get your hair extra straight. My only complaint is that this attachment is hard to attach and remove. I have long hair and it used to take me over 15 minutes to dry my hair.

Just this morning I was blow drying my hair when sparks began to fly out of the dryer, into my hair and onto the floor. In shock, I threw the dryer to the ground where it continued to spark and hiss a few more times until it died. I figured it must have reached it's end after a long life of use, but after reading some of the other reviews here I am surprised to learn that this has happened to others, and so soon after their purchase. Please stay away from this hair dryer unless you want to be scared out of your wits when you least expect it and risk burning off a part of your hair (or carpet)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst ever","review":"I had this dryer for 2 months and the handle got too hot to hold after about one minute, then the handle starting melting because it was too hot and then, it smelled like something was burning. I lost my receipt, so I called the company and they replaced it. I am afraid that I am going to have the same problem. This was a definite piece of garbage and I am sorry that I bought it. I wish the company had refunded my money. I bought a Conair in the interim and love that dryer. Do not get this one. It is horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be aware - dangerous product","review":"The fact that this hair dryer broke after 2 months of moderate and careful use is bad enough, but what is worse is the way it broke: IT EXPLODED in my hand just seconds after I had switched it on. I am not kidding, I still have a huge scare. It made a big bang, immediately started to smoke and damaged the electrical circuit. There was no outside trigger for this explosion at all. When shaking, the hair dryer now sounds like a box full of beans, everything is loose. I cannot tell you how mad I am that I was exposed to such a big risk! I feel lucky that nothing happened to me, apart from a life-long fear of hair driers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I bought this dryer less than one year ago and used it every other day. I am not a rough user and other dryers have lasted me 10 + years. On this model, partof the on - off slide plastic button cracked off , making it unusable. Button seems to be made from be less than durable plastic. The hairdryer when working, didn't do as good a job as my little travel hair dryer that is only 1250 watts.Looking at the review of others and my own experience it is a no - brainer that I won't buy this one again. Can't understand the disconnect between user reviews and my own experience versus high ratings for this model in Consumer Reports."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love, love love this one.","review":"I have had this model for somewhere around 8-10 years and it has worked great. Around 6 years ago I decided to purchase an expensive Chi dryer for $150 only because I thought it must be better since it was so much more expensive - wrong! I used that for about a year and the heating element quit so only cool air came out making it useless. It was just past the warranty period so I was out of luck. I pulled my Revlon back out and have used it ever since. Seeing it recommended as one of the best by Consumer Reports just confirmed what I already thought. After all these years it finally quit this morning. I'm going to purchase another one exactly the same as my old Revlon model."},{"rating":"1","title":"AMAZON!!!!

It would singe it at the roots and burn off clumps of hair. Then it would be cool for a minute and overheat again.

Other reviews seem to be great so I may have gotten a faulty one but be careful."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guarantee this dryer will be RECALLED!","review":"On the first use (following their instruction booklet exactly), this dryer burned off whole sections of my hair. After complaining to Revlon, I was instructed to contact the manufacturer, Helen of Troy. Frankly, if you're going to put your name on something my feeling is that you should stand by the product yourself and not send consumers on a wild goose chase to track down the responsible party!Instead I contacted the US Consumer Product Safety Commission via email and I received a phonecall from them. They sent an agent out to my home, purchased this dangerous dryer for cash, took pictures of all the burnt hair (yes, I saved all evidence) and I expect as there are many complaints about this product they will soon recall it.Don't buy this dryer or any other Revlon hair products.

After using it for 6 months (always on the warm settling, not hot), it fried my hair. My hair has never been this dry and unmanagable. Since the dryer was the only thing I changed in my hair-care regiment, I figured that was the answer. When I couldn't stand it any more, I started using my old non-ionic blow dryer. Within two weeks, I noticed my hair wasn't as dry and frizzy. I hate this dryer because of all the damage it did to my hair.

I have very thick long hair and it took the hair dryer much longer to dry my hair than my old one. After a couple uses I noticed the smell of burning hair and thought maybe it was a little too hot but my hair seemed fine so I didn't really worry about it. Then I began to notice after I showered and started to comb my wet hair a lot more hair than normal was falling out. It was falling out in thick strands which has never happened to me before. I thought maybe it was stress or horomones since I recently had a baby but the more I used the dryer I realized the intense heat was burning off and damaging my hair! Even now that I've stopped using it my hair is still fragile from the dryer and still comes out in clumps after I shower. Please stay away from this dryer!

The dryer is adequate and dries your hair. At least mine did for about a year until...Number 2: SPARKS FLEW OUT OF THIS DRYER. BIG ONES! While in use!

I ordered this dryer because the promise of smoother, shinier, softer hair sounded great. I really couldn't tell much difference in the texture of my hair with this dryer. If anything, it was harder to straighten my hair with it than with my old non-ionic dryer. It definitely took longer to dry my hair with this dryer.

My hair is much shinier and healthier-looking than the results from my old dryer. The fly-away hairs are minimized, which is great news during a Wisconsin winter. It was not quite as heat-intensive as my previous hair dryer (also a Revlon product), which I'm guessing will also help the future health of my hair.The buttons were a little stiff at first use, but I'm hoping they'll loosen up with more use.This dryer was approximately the same weight as my previous dryer. It was slightly less noisy, but at a different pitch (it seemed a little higher pitched).The only thing that prevents me from giving a five-star rating is that it seemed to take a little longer to dry my hair than with my previous dryer, which was the same wattage.I chose this product over the Conair product because this had more options in the heat/air level settings."},{"rating":"1","title":"nothing special","review":"I got this blow dryer hoping that my frizzy hair would dry faster and get less frizzy...it took much longer to blow-dry my hair and the ionic thing does nothing for it.

Unfortunately, Tom's been eating one too many pork pies, and bursts out of his pale blue two-piece, looking rather seedy.The charm of this story lies in the infectious playfulness of the children, their universally-understandable indifference to their elders' desire for 'respectability', and the quaint evocation of an Edwardian farmstead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read for Marines!","review":"This is required reading for some Marines deployed to Europe.

I am very impressed with the Geography Coloring Book, with its highly detailed maps and information. The coloring directions are quite clear. This book is a wonderful tool for visual learners to learn world geography."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing organization","review":"I bought this as a compliment to a basic geography workbook (daily geography), thinking it would reinforce the concepts and be a fun coloring activity to boot. Unfortunately, it is not organized in a way that makes sense or follows a build-on-concepts kind of format. The book begins with a nice overview of the globe, but then jumps to discussing volcanoes. It will take some searching to find appropriate pages that would accompany a basic geography text. Overall, is more \\"wordy\\" and less \\"picture-y\\" than I expected."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too cluttered and childish for high school","review":"Bought this to use for my geography class. It's far too cartoonish for any serious classwork. While it would be fine for the elementary grades, it is not designed for the high school, or even middle school, level. Many of the maps are crowded because of the fluff material (flags, color keys, etc). It's just too \\"user-unfriendly\\".If the maps were cleaned up this would be much better. As is, I'd avoid using this and wasting time and money. Finding a better atlas for student use may be more difficult, but it would be well worth the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful geography teacher","review":"This is a great way to learn world geography. By coloring and reading about the country, state, river, mountain range, or territory, we learn in many ways at once. It stays with you. There's the visual, the kinetic, and auditory learning, if read outloud, like we do with my jr. high daughter. It's challenging for her, but she's getting it. As a homeschooling tool it can't be beat. It's great for adults, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for use in the classroom.","review":"I have used the first edition for years and am finally updating. I use it in the clasroom for geography instuction and it is wonderful. The pages are very detailed yet simple to understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound - but you need a big head!","review":"The sound quality coming out of the headphones is pretty nice. However, if you are using headphones while doing an activity then prepare for them to fall off of your head. I used them while mowing my lawn, and I had no luck keeping them on. Finally I ended up putting my ear between the clip and ear piece so that they stayed in place. If they wanted me to use this technique then there is really no need for the part the goes behind your neck. These headphone are way too wide, and there is no way to adjust them smaller. These are great if you are sitting down and listening to music, but if you are on the move then go with something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Premium Behind Head Headphones","review":"These headphones suck! They do not stay on. Although they are nice and compact and you can fold them...they are made way too wide. Save your money! You will spend more time during your workouts hoping that they stay on your head. The music is even harder to hear for this reason!"},{"rating":"1","title":"These are screamers","review":"I bought a pair of these hoping for the best. I wanted a set of folding, behind the neck phones for travel. Typically, Altec-Lansing products tend to scream at you with enhanced highs...but your ears adjust and then they sound pretty good. These are the exception. These babies really scream, and the lower end doesn't hold up like on most Altec-Lansing products. In a word, \\"awful\\". After forcing myself to do some extended listening to see if they would come around, I couldn't wait to chuck these babies in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, but not great","review":"Not one of Dyango's best recordings. I like his earlier recordings, but this one simply did not hit the spot."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Military Thriller","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It had the requisite ingredients for a good thriller. It had richly drawn, convincing characters and several subplots that worked with the original story line. The descriptions of cadet life were insightful and informative. The writing was military: crisp, sharp and neat. The story presentation was fresh and interesting and to the author's credit, he manages to keep readers on edge, wanting more.I really enjoyed this book and I would gladly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Giving Civilians a Peek Inside","review":"Thoroughly enjoyed this book!

Unrealistic perhaps, but entertaining even so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting storyline, but...","review":"The author is clearly not fond of his alma mater, and I find it hard to believe that such high-ranking officials at the Academy would be involved in this type of coverup. In any case, this is a fast, easy read, and will certainly entertain.PS: I certainly hope the publishers have fired their proofreader; there were literally DOZENS of typographical errors in my copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the effort or money.","review":"I bought this book because a friend had recommended it and I read the reviews posted and thought I might learn something about the Academy and enjoy the book at the same time. I learned LITTLE that I wanted to know about West Point and spoke to West Pointers who said the book was highly fictionalized for effect quite often. I think the guy must have learned something there because he doesnt write badly, just not well enough to get me to buy another of his books. AND I have a hard time imagining Lee, Eisenhower, Grant or Buzz Aldrin having such filthy mouths as just about everyone in this book! Pointers I spoke to said the school frowns on talk like that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whinny","review":"I read this book awhile back and I was not impressed. Truscott sounded like a self-righteous and bitter crybaby who probably should have spent his college years back in the 60's with all the other hippies. I am sure West Point has its problems but the way that Truscott eviscerates the school you really have to wonder is it that bad? I also did not get a good sense of what the school was like for the cadets. I mean apart from plebe year how was it for the average upperclass cadet? If you want to read a book about a military college that celebrates both the good and the bad evenly. I recomend The Lords of Discipline by Pat Conroy. A Sense of Honor by James Webb. Or even the Academy by Ed Ruggero. West Point actually banned this book for 20 years, and probably for the first time my life I can probably say that I agree with a book banning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works fine for me","review":"I bought this to replace the tip in my Blue-Point center puch and it fit perfectly.

Bought this after buying cheaper very at HD, throwing this away, like other reviewers noted it doesn't punch/mark consistently (i guess i expected too much from a center punch/mark from a name brand). Bought this to replace a great punch i bought at flea market 25+ years ago, didn't realize a good one was so hard to come by."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done!","review":"I got a big kick out of this movie. Who hasn't been nudged aside by a garage sale fanatic wanting just the item you're reaching for? Besides being a subject people can relate to, the acting is well done and the characters believable. Lots of chuckles in this one. No wonder it has won awards!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"I bought this movie because I really enjoy mockumentary movies. I was hoping for a Christopher Guest-type movie. This movie was supposed to be about the funny things that happen at garage sales. Instead, it was a series of \\"talking-head\\" scenes in which people display their odd personalities. If it were funny, I would have been okay with that. It was not. There were a couple funny scenes, but overall I would recommend you skip this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"There is a reason it is out of print","review":"An interesting take on the Roland legend... and when I say \\"interesting\\", I mean \\"crappy.\\" The author manages to take some of the greatest characters of legend and rip the life out of them.

Madeira luxuriated in the part of the seductress, a role perfectly suited for her beautiful mezzo-contralto voice. The muscle-bound doofus with a noble heart fit Del Monaco's range, power, and dramatic abilities perfectly. He obviously enjoyed the role like no other. Molinari-Pradelli conducted with the right mixture of grandness and mystery the opera calls for, plus the orchestra and chorus work sounded just as involved. The bad--All of this could be confirmed by the listener IF ONLY ONE COULD HEAR THE PERFORMANCE THROUGH THE AWFUL RECORDING! Honestly, it sounds as if it had been recorded under water. One day, technology will be able to restore this performance so it can be properly enjoyed. The ugly--Del Monaco and Madeira's talents are wasted in the fact that they didn't make a studio recording of this opera. So what if Del Monaco's French is questionable?"},{"rating":"1","title":"amazing...i don't think so","review":"Amazing Irv doesn't deserve the title.

This film was not shot 1:33 as presented on this disc! It was shot in CinemaScope! There's a tremendous difference between a 1:33, panned and scanned presentation and the original aspect ratio!Besides, it's a British film in what appears to be a German version here. It would be bad enough to have German subtitles in a squeezed, P&S; print, but one wouldn't want Mills and Bogarde DUBBED with English titles either!Additionally, the running time indicated on this version is, I believe, inaccurate. It is definitely longer than 117 minutes.Though it has developed a cult following over the years, the film was badly received originally, which probably explains why it has never been commercially released IN English and IN the correct aspect ratio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non US DVD","review":"I didn't realize this would NOT play on an US DVD player,,,,so we can't see it.

Somewhere in all these tracks is a decent e.p., if you remember those. \\"The Magnificent Seven\\", \\"Washington Bullets\\", \\"The Call Up\\" are okay tunes.

Unfortunately, they felt they had to release EVERYTHING they had at this time (it was a TRIPLE album on vinyl), so there is a lot of downright boring stuff here.

Take my word for it, nothing new happens in essence, and any changes they made to pass this as a new movie are precisely what made it so bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm gonna be a meanie","review":"...and tell you to avoid this twaddle at all costs-this sequel is a sequel, and as such it is a bomb. Maybe it's my invented memory that the Bridget Jones I remember from the first movie was a likeable gal...because here, she's pretty irritating and I have trouble believing that insecurity and a chunky frame is enough to hook a successful lawyer with international connections. 'Cuz that's all Bridget does in this movie-obsess and babble inside and out of her head.Zellweger does a fine zoftig but beyond that, this is a chick flick only for devoted fans of the genre. But what do I know? I'm just a guy that got made to see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish they would have","review":"just left Bridget alone! This movie just doesn't do the story line any justice. She was living happily ever after, which is where I like my favorite movies to end!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unpleasant and unfunny","review":"As other reviewers have noted, this time around the film makers have made Bridget SO inept and inane that she's just not funny. The focus is on her incredibly bad mismatch with Mark Darcy and after the second or third break-up you wish they'd just end it and get it over with. We really needed much more of Hugh Grant's Daniel Cleaver for it seems he's the only one who really seems to like Bridget this time around. But when the film takes a preposterously unrealisticturn into a Thai prison it moves from unfunny to decidedly unpleasant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bridget Jones' Wobbley Bits","review":"Bridget is back and not at all terrible. The first movie was downright a keeper for life, so it was hard to imagine them re-creating the same atmosphere and level of hilarity as the first. While there are parts that are omited from the book and replaced with other situations,it is understandable why. For example,Cleaver is hardly in The Edge of Reason, but he's in the movie for a fair amount.Another involves her trip to Thailand.All the original actors/actresses are back which is key to pulling off a authentic sequel. The music, situations, \\"Bridgetisms\\" are all wonderful, if not at times better than before. And it is rewarding to know that her interview with Colin Firth did not go overlooked. Can't wait till I have enough money to buy this DVD and upgrade the original from VHS to DVD. Not as great as the first, but a worthy sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor follow-up to the wonderful Bridget Jones' Diary","review":"After reading the sequel to Bridget Jones' Diary, I was less than thrilled. Helen Fielding's second round with the singleton was not up to par with her first book. The same goes with the movie. I can pop in the first Bridget DVD anytime. It's hilarious, sweet, and as charming as any Austen adaptation should be; not so with the Edge of Reason. The movie is not funny in any sense of the word. The watcher sees poor Bridget go through one humiliating experience after another, and then there's the whole Thailand debacle. What is this, Brokedown Palace? I can safely say, though, that because of the many horrible changes/additions in the movie that were not in the book, I have a newfound respect for the novel. But what worries me is Fielding had a hand in writing the screenplay for Reason. All I can say is what was she thinking? I suggest reading the book, never the watching the movie, and for everyone to consider Bridget Jones' Diary the only movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie to watch over and over again","review":"Other viewers may not agree but I am a huge Colin Firth fan. I have had a crush on him ever since spotting him as the charming Mark Darcey in BBC's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was an awful film","review":"Thought I would like it because I liked the first one so much, but it is terrible!!!! Not even my favorite actors could save it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the movies I never get tired of","review":"Second part of the Bridget Jones series - just lovely! Liked the extras, too. Wouldn't it be fun if there was a third movie - both married, kids running wild and Bridget trying to cope? I would love to see that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun to See the Sequel","review":"I enjoyed the edge of reason because I love Colin Firth. It had some moving moments about relationships. Not quite as good as original but the edge of reason book wasn't as good either so I think the movie lived up to the book but better. I would see any movie Colin Firth was in."},{"rating":"1","title":"You're Kidding!","review":"If there was a worse film released in 2004 than Bridget Jones Mark II then I'm glad I didn't see it. After watching this execrable dross it dawned on me that I just wasted 1 hour and 40 minutes of my life that I won't be getting back.Yet, perhaps it was just me? Much of the audience did laugh from time to time at the often slap stick humour. I just found it predictable and tired.The original film of 2001 was fresh and at sometimes amusing. This sequel, however, showed that you can only get so much out of the one idea. Bridget Jones had morphed into an absurd caricature. She even gets stuck in a Thai jail on a drugs charge! What's more, the feeling of déjà vu when her two suitors are involved in another fight is palpable. It just wasn't funny!If you're even just thinking of seeing this film, don't waste your time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Godawfully dull and boring","review":"I fell asleep about two-thirds into this sequel when there seemed to be nothing at all happening. Colin Firth is dull as dirt as the dashing boyfriend lawyer, while Renee Zellweger's main joke is her fattened up appearance. The problem is there is no chemistry at all between the two, so we don't believe for even a second that Mark Darcy \\"loves\\" her, as he professes. And ditto for Hugh Grant who does and says nothing amusing. I didn't laugh even slightly, not even once, during this way too long comedy. Time to put this yarn to bed for good..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"I frankly don't understand why there are so many disapponted reviews. I think the movie is completely hilarious, and is just a good an adaptation of the second BJ book as the first one was. If you are looking for extra depth in the analysis of the reasons for why there are so many singltons around, look elsewhere. This movie is a lighthearted comedy, and excellent one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this movie","review":"I dont have the dvd yet but i saw the movie and i loved it, although mot as much as the first one. I still found it funny and romantic and i will definitely buy it when the dvd comes out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painfully un-funny","review":"Completely lacking in the originality and humor of the book, this is a sad sequel to a charming movie.Reading both of Ms. Jone's diarys, we see that Bridget isn't fat, she just thinks she is. The one time she reaches her goal of 119 lbs, she looks emaciated and aged. The film ignores this and makes her a porker of epic proportions.The best parts of Ms. Fielding's book center around Bridget's relationships with her friends, single and married. The film completely ignores this aspect, instead bringing back the tired love triangle between Bridget, Mark and Daniel.If Amazon had a negative star option, I'd give this sad sequel -20 stars.Pathetic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Listen to Reason: Skip this film","review":"Bridget Jones 1 was amusing and light. Bridget Jones Edge of Reason should never have been released. This movie is absolutely terrible from start to finish. Firstly, it lacks the originality and charm of the first one -- a symptom of being a forced sequel. Secondly, it's not funny in the least. Thirdly, the acting is terrible. I am usually a fan of Renee, but she is terrible here. Hugh Grant puts in his usual canned performance, and someone should really tell him it's time for him to try a slightly different role in the interest of saving his career and pride. Colin First is just plain unlikeable. Anyway, I wouldn't recommend this movie to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Want more..","review":"I loved this movie, it's fun and I had a craving to see it again so I'm buying it. I'm hoping they'll do yet another sequel. Great actors, great writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bridget Jones","review":"Ugh... Well acted, well edited, and I don't care to watch it. My wife loved this movie, and I bought it for her. She would give it a 5, but only give it a 2.What do you expect? It is a chick flick.

It has become a trademark when they are in a movie together."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bridget Jones-The Edge of Reason(Widescreen Edition)","review":"The product as well as the service of the provider was excellent.

I would suggest customers who want agreat shopping experience order from this company"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bridget Jones-Edge of Reason DVD","review":"If you enjoyed the original Bridget Jones and the occassional raining men, then The Edge of Reason is a must for your movie collection or just for viewing.The sequel picks up where Bridget Jones (Renee Zellweger) and Mark Darcy (Colin Firth) left off, the start of a new diary, new year, and new relationship. Of course, Bridget being paranoid and self conscious, doubts herself and her new life and, well, you need to watch the movie to find out what happens next. Oh, don't forget, Daniel Cleaver (Hugh Grant) still pops up from time to time to help poor Bridget along in a mess that could or couldn't be a relationship."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fun Follow-up to \\"Bridget Jones' Diary\\"","review":"Not as good as the first \\"Bridget\\" movie, but actually not that bad. I enjoyed watching it and plan on purchasing the DVD. Don't expect the movie to be like the book (when are they ever?)because parts are added or changed. I hated Jacinda Barrett's character's \\"secret\\" at the end of the movie and the Thai prison/\\"Like a Virgin\\" scene was also a bit cringe-worthy. Otherwise, an enjoyable movie kept alive by Hugh Grant and Colin Firth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"I thoroughtly enjoyed this movie. It is not rocket science but that's not what I chose this movie for. Bridget's character is not flawless. She is insecure but of good character, overall. Her chosen boyfriend is not terribly exciting but he's good to her/good for her. They genuinely care about each other. That is what is refreshing about this movie.I save 5 stars for Gone with the Wind or Polar Express, but this is close."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a disappointment!!","review":"I disagree with a previous reviewer: I found the \\"Edge of Reason\\" book much more palatable than the film.There simply aren't enough hours in life to waste even a part of one delineating in detail the reasons I was disappointed by this film after reading the book. Besides, most other reviewers have touched on them: the way Renee was shot SO unflatteringly; great liberties with the storyline and characters; cramming the story into too short of a running time. Enough said.Granted, this review is of the film, not the DVD iteself. But I doubt that any additional features would sufficiently overcome the movie's weaknesses to motivate me to spend money on the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointing","review":"I loved the first book and thought the first movie was fairly well done so I was excited when I heard they were going to make a movie from the next book as well. Unfortunately this one wasn't as true to the book or as good BY FAR. If you've read the book don't ruin it by watching this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Building Classroom Discipline","review":"I purchased this book to go along with a Behavior Management Class that I was taking.

It may cost more, but this Indian made punch was a waste of money. I used this punch once, then the tip fell off between jobsites, never to be found again. While I was smart enough to buy a replacement tip at the same time, it doesn't fit. The screw thread size has been changed. The Indian made punch uses a smaller thread than the US made punch.

The fit and style are wonderful. It is nice to find a style that avoids the 'vanity sizing' fad in jeans. I'll buy more, but in a different color.The 'Tumbled Rigid' color comes with a tiny tag that warns that the color 'may run' (and it certainly does). How old is that in an era of modern dye technology! At the very least, this problem should be specified in the product description so a different color could be selected.I've now purchased a total of 4 pair of the 514s. It is becoming clear that different 'colors' are also different fabrics each with its own 'shrink' factor. For example, 'Kale' shrinks almost none and comes out of the drier at the exact specified measurement. 'Scraped' shrinks the most while 'Tumbled Rigid' and 'Stavros' are somewhere in the middle. Be aware that the next color you order may not fit the same after a wash/dry as your current pair."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprise - great for women!","review":"I am a tall, slim woman with curvy feminine hips.

A nice low rise in the front without your derriere spilling out when you bend over - slim in the thighs - a nice flattering straight let - and solid feeling denim as opposed to stretchy, thin, cheesy stuff. And PS - my butt looks GREAT!If there are any women reading this review who just can't find a reasonably priced jean that looks good, give these a try!

I have had many pairs over the past several years and continue to appreciate the fit and color options. Ordinarily, I'd give them 5 stars. HOWEVER, I recently bought a pair in the Rigid Tank color and they are AWFUL. There was a tag on the jeans that this finish was unusual and to pay attention to the care instructions (wash inside out, etc.) I turned this pair inside out and washed them with the rest of my jeans. When this pair came out of the washer, there were faded/bleached lines wherever the jeans had been creased in the washer--and there were a lot of creases as they tumbled. When they came out of the dryer, they were at least 2 inches shorter.

I would never normaly buy something labeled as slim fit but I'm glad I accidentally bought these. I have a athletic build with bigger thighs so I generally stick with relaxed fit or lose fit jeans. The 514 has just as much room in the thighs but does not look as baggy as the other fits. I will say that the fits vary depending on which country that color was made in. The dark blue I bought in 34/32 fit really well. The indigo blue I bought from amazon were 34/32 but the material was not as thick and did not fit as well.

Beware slim straight in the US is freaking enourmous the waist fits fine but the bottoms of these jeans have a flare on them bigger than my parents wore in the 70's.

This last pair though, which is the first I have ordered on Amazon, did not meet my expectations. After about 3 weeks, first a hole appeard in the crotch area (slightly embarrassing) and then yesterday, after paying at the supermarket, as I put my wallet back in my back pocket with a normal amount of force (that means, very little) the whole back part tore off.I am disappointed.UPDATE: Thanks to Amazon's great policies, I am going to receive a replacement item.

As I was on vacation two different washing machines were used, so it isn't the machines fault, and after the first leg shred, I looked to see if perhaps it got caught on the shoe... the tear was too high, the pants definitely didn't drag... really disappointed with the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pair of jeans at a great price","review":"My husband ordered these and they look great.

It is a joke of the first order. How are you supposed to ever find the jeans you like when you can *NEVER* count on getting them twice in a row using the same model number? Who is the genius who decided that '514' should be applied to all manner of totally different pants? Who decided they should be made in disparate countries from production run to run?

With Levi's sometimes the inseam is slightly too short and other times it is almost 2 inches too long. I have many pairs of Levi's now that i must get hemmed.

Basically a relatively tall, super skinny guy with almost no butt. I ordered the 29x32, and while the waistband and length were a great fit, I ended up returning this item because the inseam fit was just plain awkward on my body type. These jeans are actually somewhat tight around my calves, but extremely baggy in the thighs through the seat, making for a very strange look. I also ordered a pair of the 511s in the same size, and they fit much better.

Jean material wears out faster than average.","review":"This is the third pair I've bought in four years. I do like the simple fit of these Levi's. Nothing trendy. What I don't get though is that the fabric seems to not hold up the way I would expect Levi's to. After a year of normal use (e.g. wearing to work, washing and drying) the cuffs are frayed and knees and seams are getting thin. After two years the knees are worn through and the corners of the back pockets have separated. I have other Levi's that I have owned for five or six years at this point that don't have any holes. If I still liked the way they look as much as these I be wearing them more often.Bottom-line, great fit and style but they really need to get a different supplier for this fabric."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality jeans","review":"Disppointed in the quality of these jeans.The crotch and back pocket ripped within one week of receiving.The denim seemed as flimsy as rice paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fit, careful with color runoff","review":"Fits great, had my wierd size (31x34).

The latest pair (514) lasted about three weeks and three times through the washing machine and it literally started to fall apart. I actually patched up the other three pair of jeans to try and stop the tearing, but it only extended the life a few months. It's a shame, Levi's used to be my go-to brand, but the quality has seriously declined over the past few years. The fit is great, but the quality of material is dismal.

This is the perfect design because it allows the manufacturer to use a really comfortable super smooth silicon that kind of sticks to your hand. Without the center it would be too floppy.Works perfectly. Great for all of my delicate cookware, from enameled cast iron to my metal pots. A regular metal whisk even scratched my cheap plastic mixing bowls.Bright vibrant colors. Aesthetically pleasing.Did I mention this is MADE IN THE USA?!! Buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny","review":"Even though several other cooks had recommended this whisk, I was skeptical about spending $20 for a kitchen utensil. I waited until I could get a good deal on shipping, and took the plunge. When it arrived, and I had a chance to use it....Not surprisingly, Le Creuset has created another gorgeous, balanced and durable product. The handle is rubberized silicone, which is easy to grip and feels very comfortable in the hand. It's a good length for all kinds of bowls & pans, and is strong enough to handle thick batters and sauces.I also own the larger Chef'n silicone-dipped whisk, which is also very nice. But I always reach for Le Creuset first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gotta love this whisk","review":"The title says it all! I have now purchased two of these in different colors because they are a delight to use. My arms do not tire out as quickly while trying to whip up a dish using this whisk.

Planning on ordering a couple for gifts for my mother-in-law who has trouble with wrist pain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rarely Snaps","review":"Nice exterior build.This device depends on a slightly bent interior rod eventually finding a hole to \\"snap\\" into. I got a lemon..... the rod is straight...every time I try to use the punch, the interior rod slips effortlessly into the hole...hence NO SNAP! The snap is what imparts the punch impulse to the device..... It works perhaps 1 time out of 20. Useless! Too much pain to return. Whatever happened to quality control?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I used it twice.

I went ahead and bought a Starrett for about $10 more.This product was really nice to have and light weight but the quality and durability was poor.

After I took the punch out of the package, I did a test punch, just to insure that it worked without any problems. For the initial punch it did work, albeit a light punch. It was not until a week or so later that I went to use the punch again, and this time it did nothing, no matter how I adjusted it or how hard I depressed the punch.Do yourself a favor, purchase the Starret automatic center punch that Amazon has listed. It will provide you with a lifetime of trouble free service."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only works a few dozen times!","review":"The tip broke off after only several dozen uses.

Would definitely buy another."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorta crappy","review":"Mine stopped working after a short while. Then I bought a Starrett. MUCH better.

The high setting is necessary to dry my thick, curly hair-- however that setting also overheats almost immediately and also blows all the curl out. The low setting keeps the curl but is cool and takes forever.

It's loaded with stereotypes about non-blacks, while being heavy with hatred & condemnation about people who stereotype blacks. Hypocrisy. While some opinions are based in reality, others are just plain wrong subjective conclusions. Aside from the subject matter, the flow of the poems and prose are hit & miss. Some do have a great rhythm & flow, while others just come off as a ripoff of Rabelasian lists and Celineian thought fragments. Instead of getting this non-black reader to understand her situation & sympathize with it, I instead found myself saying \\"Did you ever think you have so many problems with white people because you have so much hatred and annimosity towards them?\\" There's definately some \\"pot calling the kettle black\\" shenannigans going on here."},{"rating":"2","title":"several improvements, but...","review":"The new board is bigger than the old Milton Bradley version, and that's great. I like that land troops can cross a few of the narrow straits without a galley. The new battle system is simpler, but each die has two pictures of infantry, and only one of each other unit. So infantry has the best chance to hit, yet are the cheapest to buy. I've heard catapults were too powerful in the original rules for the old version, but they are too restricted here. Calvary still have more movement, but with the reduced effectiveness in battle, I don't see much point. Also, land troops on a galley do not participate in naval battle under the new rules. So a full ship is no more powerful than an empty ship. Your troops can be easily sunk so watch out. I guess some rules can be tweaked by house rules, but it would be pretty hard to convert the little pictures on the dice to make more sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Empire...Conquest of the","review":"Solid game components, flexible gameplay, historical scenarios and educational features, fast paced, large map.

Thanks to a little green elf who hires him to find a stolen unicorn, PI John Justin Mallory finds himself in an alternate New York where there are yellow elephants instead of taxis, horses talk and stuffed animals don't actually realize they are already dead, where hawkers sell suntan lotion in the middle of a blizzard and there's a Department of a Redundancy Department, among other things. Hilarity ensues, of course.But what I love most is, that amidst all the crazy stuff, Mallory is still a rather ruthless man, punishing and getting rid of anybody who betrays him or hurts his friends and without remorse too.

But the clear plasic piece wouldn't stay on so I needed to replace it. BUT after looking for the part it was cheaper to buy this little sweeper shark instead. It is quieter BUT it doesn't work very well. IT doesn't clean carpet or rugs very well unless its a flat carpet that doesn't have anything loose fibers. The only good thing is my kids like to use it.

I'm handicapped and can't push a big vacuum. So, this was just right to pick up the \\"top & showing\\" dirt until the housekeeper could get here once a week.But after two months the AC adapter cord just snapped in half. It was oddly brittle from the very beginning. I contacted Euro Pro who would not replace it under warranty. So, I ordered a new adapter from them (which came to approx. $15) with shipping. Now six weeks later, they sent me a card saying \\"due to overwhelming demand.....\\" the adapter is on back order. I wonder why they have such a large demand? Funnily enough, the cleaner has still been working for the whole six weeks on it's last charge. But, no more.

It doesn't have the suction of my previous Shark. This model is very difficult to empty. It says it is hands free emptying, but the dirt doesn't want to come out of the dirt container. It won't dump, you have to fish into the narrow opening to get the debris. My other model was very easy to empty, and held a lot more. Another issue involves the handle, it doesn't stay in place. I've had to tape it together to use the sweeper. Basically, I'm very disappointed by this product.

Then take out all the screws (10) using a standard screwdriver.

The power is enough for a sweeper of its size. The Shark works well on high-traffic carpet and kitchen flooring. The reason for two stars is that the handle broke off the unit at the base -- unexpectedly. As far as I can see, there isn't any way to remove the remaining piece of handle.

Some words of caution:1) empty the tray outside or over your trash can. Contents jammed inside will spill out!2) keep a dustpan handy for vinyl corners. This guy won't go there. For carpet, you'll need a vacuum with attachments-don't rely on this.3) I've owned a Shark dust buster before, and it quit on me after 6 months. I'm only 5 days into this one.

As with any such product, the punches can be abused by hitting them at an angle, or too hard. The small diameter punches can be bent or broken if not handled with respect. If the pin you are driving is resistant to being pushed out/in, use multipl gentle taps rather than hard blows. Make sure you are using the appropriate size punch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is this the quintessential Neo-prog album?.....","review":"I don't what it is about this album that makes it so good. It must be that the whole is greater than the sum of the parts. It is like a distillation of what makes great Neo-prog - inventive use of time signatures and tempo, intricate interplay of instruments, lyrics that are about more than just sex, drugs and girlfriends, and the understanding that the song is more important than your 15 minute solo (something that was unfortunately lost on some of the original prog bands). Milliontown packages all this in a fantastically well-produced album."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Gotta Here It","review":"With so much progressive rock that is really retrogressive (which is not necessarily bad)this band has a refreshing twist. I have certain bands I would consider modern progressive (I Mother Earth, Oceansize, and ____) but Frost does go beyond 70's bands like Yes, Kansas and Crack The Sky (who I love) to add a different sound. If the goal was to have a listenable progressive rock with a slice of pop, they hit the goal, but it goes beyond that. If there were a retrogressive 80's genre, this might fit that sound--1980's Rush fans will love it. I won't dissect every song, just listen and you'll love it. Black Light Machine is one of the best songs I've heard in quite a long time. It's got mood, great vocals, musicianship and it rocks! Buy this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"well worth your money","review":"I discovered this music while searching Amazon for Porcupine Tree. This \\"EP\\" is a great bargain because the 6 songs clock in at about an hour.This is beautiful, progressive rock music with a metal bend here, a pop turn there. The songs are complex, and heavily produced. The musicianship is eye opening, with time and tempo changing rhythms and multilayered melodies. The vocals are somewhat subdued, and often spacey.Super enjoyable, over and over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous","review":"This is absolutely superb.Best music I've heard in quite a while regardless of genre.A must buy for anyone IMO."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff and True Progressive Rock","review":"I definitely enjoy current progressive rock bands like the Flower Kings or Spock's Beard, etc., but they do have a distinct retro feel to them (not necessarily a bad thing). Frost, on the other hand, is progressive rock for the new century. Crafted with up-to-date studio processing and industrial rhythms, Frost sounds different and fresher than many bands in the genre and is worth a spin for any fan of progressive rock. Warning: they do not sound like genesis, '70s yes or Pink Flyod, but more like Nine Inch Nails/Arena/Trevor Rabin era YesOne weakness is the vocal performance...or more specifically, the vocal recording/style. Frequently heavily processed, the vocals simply don't 'shine' or carry a song. In fact, in the begininng of the last track \\"Milliontown\\" the processed vocals are almost whispered growlings that conflict with the beautiful solo piano in the background.The weakness aside, this is a great effort that will get frequent play in my CD collection"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Techno Prog","review":"How could this be anything other than brilliant, the guitar player from Arena, the rhythm section from IQ and a production/keyboard whizz in Jem Godfrey with lots of pop smarts. This is progressive rock with all the production tricks, whistles and bells that might have found themselves on the latest top 40 offering. It is a wonderful combination.For lovers of fine progressive rock and excellent musicianship who are not too snooty to enjoy a little studio \\"wizardry\\" - it is at times marvellously bombastic, (the frenetic opening just blows me away); the compositions are suitably complex and interesting - but always accessible. In places, Kino comes to mind, but forgive me if I say that this builds on that fine effort and delivers so much more. If anything was to bring the masses back to the glory of prog, this should be it. Ohhh so highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Milliontown is One In A Million","review":"Milliontown is a superb album from The Frost . It is one of those rare finds that combines first-rate ProgRock virtues within an instantly gratifying commercial release, sort of a 'Holy Grail' of hard rock. The lyrics of the near 30-minute title track (based on the book 'The Apprentice' by Gordon Houghton) also play masterfully within a dual context, one being as dark as death while the other is sublime, even romantic. Fans of veteran ProgRock super-groups Rush, Transatlantic, Saga and Spock's Beard will find plenty to enjoy here. HIGHLY recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"what has happened to a fine novelist?","review":"I am 2/3 through this book and doubt that I can finish it. I simply don't care. The plot is trite, the dialog isn't really dialog at all but something more akin to school essays, and Gilchrist seems to keep forgetting who the characters are. How can the daughter be a successful decorator and a whiney neurotic who doesn't seem she would be able to even hold a job above a menial level at the same time? Is Robert honest or is he not? Every time a character is reintroduced, it seems he or she has changed into someone else. What has happened to Gilchrist? This is really poor stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"It lost me after Chapter 2.","review":"I'm not even halfway through the book, and I've been mourning the loss of the strong, interesting and rather daunting 14-year-old protagonist. The early friendship between Sarah and Eugenie evoked wonderful portent of things to come; then -- bam! -- we're fast-forwarded into the present day, and Sarah has become shallow, dull and predictable. I'm not sure I care what happens to her, but because I love Paris, I'll read on. I'm curious to see if the City of Lights can brighten Sarah's lack of luster."},{"rating":"1","title":"An insult to the trees sacrificed for the printing.","review":"The worst 'novel' I've read in recent years. The characters are one-dimensional; their dialogue consists of drivel and farce. The structure of narrative is weak and you finish with absolutely nothing resolved other than the reinforcement of the author's failed ambition. Gilchrist (and you) should read \\"The Drowner\\" by Robert Drewe, an exquisite example of contemporary literature. This is simply terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"This should have remained on the drawing table.","review":"I am a huge fan. I have read everything Ms. Gilchrist has published. Why this was published at all is a mystery. It did nothing but sully a stellar reputation. The characters were annoyingly transparent. Her usually rich lexicon seemed pedantic and forced. This book was published before Ms. Gilchrist could hone it with her usual grace. Somehow I blame it on the publishers. Too eager to meet a deadline? Signed her to a multiple book deal and pressed the issue? Something just does not set well."},{"rating":"1","title":"I liked the cover","review":"The Jock Sturgis photo promises ambivalence and a cutting edge sensibility. The book doesn't deliver.

Just plain horrible.Thirdly, the characters are unreal. Sarah fails as a likeable protagonist--she is self-centered, cruel, and basically despicable. Her attitude towards Elise certaintly does not add to her charm--why does she repeatedly refer to Elise as \\"ugly\\" and blame Elise for the initial failed relationship with Jack?I cringed my way through this book wondering how it managed to get published in the first place."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could, I would give it no stars","review":"I have always enjoyed Ellen Gilchrist before but am sorely disappointed in this. I am really only two thirds through and I don't think I can finish. I laugh at the dialog- it is so improbable and unreal. There is not one character in the book that makes me want to know more. I am tired of Sarah's whining. She is boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Sarah Conley\\" - a big disappointment","review":"I have always enjoyed Gilchrist's novels for their off-beat humour and color. \\"Sarah Conley\\" has none of the same charm. Gilchrist keeps telling us what to think about her chracters but never shows us. Sarah and her lover, Jack, are supposed to be exceptional people - smart, accomplsihed and admirable. Instead they seem conventional, dull, and self-indulgent. The writing is laughably melodramatic and at the same time boring. It is difficult to care about what will happen. I only finished the book because I couldn't believe it would not redeem itself. It didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment for Gilchrist fans","review":"I'm a big fan of Ellen Gilchrist's previous works. Over the years she has created a large array of fascinating characters, characters that take on a life of their own in the mind of the reader. In her latest book Ellen Gilchrist introduces a completely new cast and, unfortunately, doesn't make us care a whole lot for any of its members. The one character that seems most like it could have jumped out of her older books commits suicide . The storyline is sketchy and at times does not ring true. My advice: read or re-read her older books."},{"rating":"1","title":"How did this woman win any fiction prizes?","review":"OK, I confess this is the first book by Ellen Gilchrest I've read. But the whole experience was excruciating. How could she take such a rich topic and destroy it with hackneyed dialog, completely flat characters and none of the texture that could be afforded by settings like Nashville, New York City and Paris? I'm not rushing out to buy any of her other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"When it became apparent to me that this book was boring, I kept reading anyway, simply because it was so bad. There is no one to like in this story. The self-centered, whiny characters don't even like each other. Jack and Eugenie don't like their kids. Eugenie didn't want them because she doesn't like kids. Yet she's a pediatrician? What was the author thinking in that choice?The narrative is yawn-worthy. The sun was shining. The sky was blue. She walked to the elevator and pushed the button. She went to the sixth floor and got off. She went to her office and took off her coat. She worked until ten o'clock.Shifts in point of view from author to characters is clumsy. It's mostly third person narrative and suddenly Jack or Sarah is thinking, in first person. The dialogue is trite and unnatural, as if it's a script and the actors are reading their lines in dress rehearsal. When Jack and Sarah are together, the dialogue slips into the stuff of romance novels. Sometimes they sound like teenagers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your time","review":"Possibly the worst book written. Sarah Conley had absolutely no character development as she acted on her primal instincts which depicted her true character: back-stabbing, selfish, and arrogant. The only character who seemed to care for her, Robert, was ultimately shafted and eventually forgotten. Sarah Conley epitomizes the stereotype that women always make the wrong decisions.I think I actually lost brain cells reading this \\"book.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's a good editor when you need one?","review":"Does Ms. Gilchrist no longer require an editor? If she had one, this novel might not have made it to press -- unless it was at Harlequin. Unfortunately, lack of censure has unleashed a piece of sub-standard work from an otherwise talented writer. It's a real let-down for Gilchrist fans. The story begins well, with the young Sarah but quickly falls to shreds as soon as we meet the adult Sarah-- someone I would not care to know or read about. The story becomes melodramatic with plastic characters and trite dialogue. I began to wonder if Ms. Gilchrist was trying to drag us into her midlife crisis. No thanks. It's such a shame because her earlier short fiction was beautiful, lyrical and funny with a cast of rich characters and intriguing plot-lines. Perhaps the genre is the problem. Short stories and novels are two entirely different beasts...Gilchrist should stick to what she does best."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"With its cheesy dialogue and unconvincing characters, I couldn't even finish this book. Ellen Gilchrist needs to spend more time observing human nature and listening to real-life conversations if she wants to write well.The really bizarre thing about this book is that she doesn't tell you when it takes place. In the first chapter, the protagonist is 14. In a later chapter, 1996, she has a 32-year-old boyfriend. Because the boyfriend is \\"younger,\\" I assumed she was in her late thirties. Many chapters later, I discovered that she was in her fifties. Suddenly her fear of pregnancy as a college student made sense, but why didn't the writer make that clear in the first place?"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Waste of Time and Money","review":"I've read several of Ellen Gilchrist's other books (Victory over Japan, Light Can Be Both Wave and Particle, In the Land of Dreamy Dreams) and loved them. That's why I picked up this book - and I was so disappointed. The characters were unreal, the dialog was trite, and the ending - where did that come from? It didn't ring true at all. What happened with Sarah's ex-boyfriend, who writes spooky letters to her? The author seemed to have lost interest in pursuing that storyline. And it's unbelievable that Jack doesn't mourn his daughter and wife more. The book doesn't seem like Gilchrist's other works at all - I have to wonder if an imposter wrote this book? I agree with some of the other reviewers - it was more of an outline of a book, not a real book. Also, it does seem that the publishers pushed it out before the author could fix it. Don't waste your time and money on this shabby effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy light with bad connector","review":"I purchased one of these in lights in October 2006, and commuted with it for 13 months. At that point I began to get an intermittent connection in the waterproof battery connector, which snaps together very tightly and was always difficult to get together.

After buying it a year ago because it was pretty cheap, No more than 4 DAYS AFTER THE PURCHASE, I purchased a Silent Hill game, and the graphics card was NOT compatible. I thought to myself, \\"fine..maybe it's just this one game\\", But the more games I would purchase, the more those games wouldn't work...I've also found out that the geforce mx 4 SERIES is basically *similiar* to geforce 2! Geforce 3 is actually higher and way more compatible with 3d games--which makes NO sense!!! You'd think geforce 4 (since it's supposed to be an upgrade from geforce 3) would be better..Not in this case.I'm being honest here, some games work.. But if you're looking for the newer, exciting 3D games..(For instance, Silent Hill games, Godfather, etc..) this card isn't for you.If you want to have some great smooth gameplay & gorgeous graphics--save up and buy a graphics card that is WORTH it.

It's a bit of a tome but you'll find issues covered here you never thought were relevant but turn out to be of quite fundamental importance. If you want to extract 'professional' software development from the hands of cowboys, this book shows how to go about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gaining an engineering view to software development","review":"Steve McConnell uses this book to address the common failing of most programmers, who find their design and coding practices enmeshing them into a code and fix cycle. This results in a large number of bugs which have to be addressed during development and greatly increases costs and reduces the effectiveness and robustness of the software. This is a great book which has forced me to look at my practices in both management of projects and in design and coding from a software engineering point of view. The author also gives a large number of opens a number of avenues for programmers to find out more about best practice in software development. The only fault I found was the concentration on certification in the second half of the book, however, given the problems in many software development teams, perhaps this emphasis is necessary."},{"rating":"1","title":"McConnell is human after all","review":"McConnell's previous books Code Complete and Software Project Survival Guide are great books by an expert, and on his topic of expertise. I highly recommend them. But this book is more like a series of editorials by a non-expert (at least not on the subjects of business, economics and public policy).For example, McConnell recommends government licensing of software engineers without addressing the free-market alternatives or the important negative effects of government licensing in all other industries. He apparently thinks that the only objections come from adolescent anti-authority types, when in fact there are many important objections from genuine experts of business/economics/public policy.Most of McConnell's regulars who have not read more thorough books on these topics will of course not even know what is missing in McConnell's book. They might think the issues are as simple as McConnell implies. They are not."},{"rating":"1","title":"readable but forgetable","review":"This very short book summarizes software engineering concepts that we have all heard elsewhere, although the author does an excellent job of presenting it in a readable form.My biggest complaint is that the author's usual audience (the programmers) will read this rather than upper management, the people who really need to understand this stuff. McConnell has established himself as a technical, not a business expert. Maybe he should partner up with someone like Tom Peters to write a book titled \\"A Passion for Excellent Software\\" because then upper management would read it and think about. This book is essentially preaching to the converted."},{"rating":"2","title":"More Valuable Insights from Steve McConnell!","review":"A superb read! McConnell's easy-to-read style prevails in this excellent analysis of the status of software engineering today and what should be done. He puts the state of current practices into context and notes that each of us has a choice: to stay with \\"code and fix development practices\\" or boldly venture toward a true profession.

And I have read about many villains and heroes, not just cookie cutter stuff either. In fact, just thinking about him disgusts me. But this fact is not the reason that I was so let down.

And those items have held up well.However, several other parts of the set are not so durable. The plastic forks quickly lost teeth and some of the spoons have broken. That's not a big deal for us, since we're not too concerned about choking and we can always replace the utensils with plastic disposables. The basket is nice, but some fabric fasteners inside quickly snapped.

This album has not only catchy pop music with wonderful harmonies and beautiful melodies, but some great instrumental ballads that might make even Vangelis jealous. The boys of Human League were quite ahead of their time.There is little from this album that would not hold up throughout most of the 1980s, and even to today's ears with the resurgence of analogue synths in pop music.

It gives a very realistic first hand look at a Dartmouth College graduate that decided to go through Officers Candidates School to become a Marine 2nd Lieutenant. Upon completing OCS, he then embarked on deployments to Afghanistan and Iraq before leaving the Marines.

I took the paperback on a flight for the periods where I can't turn on my Kindle. I never turned my Kindle on, because I could not put this down.The author joined the Marines after graduating from Dartmouth, having no idea how the world would change after 911. His honest portrayals of officer training, and his accounts of combat, leave little to the imagination. He tells you the good and the bad. The men and women he describes are living, breathing human beings, not cardboard cutouts or characters in a recruiting commercial.The chaotic nature of modern warfare is well illustrated. How does a soldier know when to pull the trigger when the he can't distinguish between enemy and non-combatants? As the author describes it, the choices are often between bad and worse.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best first-person account of OIF","review":"I just read One Bullet Away again, having first taken it in six months ago.

I was struck by his vivid descriptions of training at Quantico, which brought back memories of my own days as a Marine.

How many books can you find written about the experiences of a Marine Corps officer in war? A fair handful. How many such books can you find written by an articulate liberal arts major? Maybe just this one.The author's educated perspective on the Marine Corps perfectly underlines the amazing strengths and the maddening weakness of the Marine Corps, depicting that certain je ne sais quois those in or around the Marines understand and critics never see.He manages to illustrate his respect for the Marines and his mission while still exposing the stupidity of military bureaucracy, showing clearly that the good or evil possible with our military forces can really boil down to a good person or a fundamentally bad person in charge of a lowly combat platoon.If you want a thoughtful perspective on the USMC or the opening days of the war in Iraq, this book is up your alley."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Leader and A Writer","review":"This is a very good read - a good story by a good writer(a Marine officer with a B.A. in classics). Based on his story and writing I'd follow this man, this officer into battle. This book should be considered a companion read of GENERATION KILL by Evan Wright. Mr. Wright was an embedded reporter with Captain Fick's Marines. Read both books, not just one or the other. BOTH."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Bullet Away","review":"I could NOT put this book down! A real \\"guy\\" book; continuous action, colorful prose, just a damned good book, and a true story to boot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"No BS, sir. Marines appreciate that.\\"","review":"There's little more I can add to what other reviewers have already said of Nate Fick's One Bullet Away. All I can say is that, of the scores of military novels, memoirs, and histories that I've read over the years, One Bullet Away is one of the best, if not the best. Fick combines obviously well-read literacy, a sharp mind, and the thrills and action of the best fictional novels into a compelling meditation on leadership in the modern military. I came away from this book not only more informed about the boots-on-the-ground experience of the Iraq War, but wanting to be a better person and a stronger leader.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book on leadership","review":"Fick describes his training and experiences in combat with One Bullet Away. He, as the reluctant warrior, provides insight into his transformation from college student to Marine Officer. This book is a great read for anyone interested in military history and modern leadership."},{"rating":"2","title":"A riveting account of one marine's experience in war","review":"Nathaniel Fick's account of his life in the Marine Corps provides great insight into the heart and mind of one soldier caught up in the post 9/11 world. After graduating from Dartmouth, he enlists in the Marines for what he terms \\"an adventure\\" -- \\"something more tranformative\\" than the typical path that his peers took into corporate life and consulting. Fick's story of his training in the Corps and his deployments to Afghanistan and Iraq are riveting in their detail. His story of the challenges that a platoon commander faces in the midst of the chaos of combat and the ties that bind the platoon together are fascinating. This is a great book and should be read by those who want to understand what our armed forces are up against in today's world."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little bit of meaning in a hard world","review":"I have a great respect for Capt. Fick. Not only was he able to write a wonderfully engaging (on many levels) narrative of his experiences during Marine Corp training and the subsequent Iraq war, but he was able to open his heart and let us in on all of the fears, trials and tribulations that are associated with someone handed the lives of 23 men. I have been moved by this book like no other in recent memory. It is a great read for anyone interested in todays military and should be required reading for someone thinking about Marine OCS.Also, contrary to a previous reviewer, Capt. Fick was promoted two (2) times and his personal decision to leave the corps does not diminish in any way the story of how a marine officer is made!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping personal account of Afghan and Iraq wars","review":"The first half of the book, 'Peace', is quite interesting in describing the training of a Marine officer. This part is likely to stay with me longer than the second part, 'War'. The second part is more gripping as it describes the author's front line experience during wars. The war fighting keeps one turning the pages. The ending is hugely anticlimatic, however, and seems half-hearted. <Spoiler alert> The author decides to leave the Marine Corps just after he has proved himself a capable Marine officer. The quitting does not meet the promise of the title \\"making of a marine officer\\". In my mind, an officer is not quite made if he quits after his first promotion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell short and dry","review":"That pretty much sums it up.If anybody ever tried to eat those saltine crackers from an MRE in under a minute without water then this is what this book feels like.#1 I have never met a soldier or a marine without a sense of humor, but it looks like the author is the first exception to this rule.#2 I would consider myself an idealistic \\"country and honor\\" person but Fick's nonstop textbook propaganda tirades made me roll my eyes through some chapters. His OWN opinion and perception on the events barely show sometimes and it appears that he is scared to show what he really thinks or even say a word thats inappropriate at a family dinner table. Come on, man! Haven't you trained with regular guys, and shat right next to them in the field? Loosen up! This is not a book for kindergarten. You're not in front of your chain of command or giving some motivational speech in front of your platoon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait for the Paperback","review":"It must be the fall because all the Iraq books from part-time soldiers are out in time for school for the college kids and the urban elite to drool over. This is one book of many (My War, I Love my Rifle, This Man's Army) memoirs written way too soon. O'Brien waited 20 years before writing Things He Carried. The reason I come down on this one is that while the others are brash and undisciplined, at least they have a point. One Bullet plays to all audiences without taking a stand. I liked the writing and the opening, but darned if even a single sentence stayed with me a day after putting it down. This book cost $24. It's got all the right reviewers and background. But for anyone who's been in the military, the question will be...\\"And?\\" Wait until it's out on paperback before you blow any cash on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Bullet Away","review":"This book was written very well and really made the reader feel like they were there, going through training and riding through the deserts of Iraqi. I never wanted to put the book down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"Great read. Felt like I was on patrol with the author. Would recommend to anyone interested in the reality of combat in Afghanistan or Iraq."},{"rating":"2","title":"Father and Marine Officer Candidate Son read this","review":"My son decided to be a Marine in college this year and this book cemented his resolve to serve his country and be the best he can by being with the best. We both read this book twice as it was a road map for him and helpful to me to understand why my son feels the way he does. He couldn't decide what to do, whether to enlist or to go PLC. Believe it or not, my son contacted Nate Fick for advice, and more amazingly, Fick responded back with simple wisdom that didn't tell my son what to do, but guidance that shows Fick truely is who he wrote about in this book. This book and man has done more in his life through action than most even think about. This is a must read book for those thinking about serving our country and being a Marine, and for their families."},{"rating":"2","title":"The third great Anabasis","review":"A provocative, insightful, and fascinating read. Fick has always had a first class analytic mind (he is too modest to mention the Rintels prize for best honors thesis at Dartmouth for his study of Thucydidean realism), and has been able to apply it with a degree of detachment to a traumatic and intensely personal experience.This is a unique work. Evan Wright's book and series in Rolling Stone (which I also enjoyed and recommend) is superb at exploring character; Smith and West do a good job of laying out the wider picture. But Fick manages to convey both the experience of combat and the larger issues at stake for the individuals and the countries involved. His Anabasis blends, if you will, the immediacy of Xenophon's with the historical sense of Arrian's, and goes beyond either in the acuity of its perceptions.In sum, Fick's book is conscious at every level. It deserves to become a classic.Frank RussellProf. of History, Transylvania University"},{"rating":"1","title":"HUGE LET DOWN","review":"This plane was flown ONE TIME.....and the wheels broke off...I may was well have thrown my 140.00 (including shipping) in the garbage.

Being of the Clive Barker-Books of blood-type reader I was hoping this book was sick and depraved. What I found instead was a very well written book with great characters, satisfying violence, a shocking plot twist, and a neglected household until I finished it. It is more of an action adventure story but I had to find out why. Why??! So it also has elements of mystery and suspense.

Although this line up appeared on other releases by Nick and Dave, this is their only release as Rockpile. Aside from the great songs on the original release, this includes a session with the Beverly Brothers, which is what Dave and Nick called themselves for this unplugged recording where they cover their inspirations, the Everly Brothers. Their version of \\"Poor Jenny\\" is priceless. This release also includes a few live tunes that were previously unavailable. This is a joyous release, that proves how the boys were striving to create a newer harder version of the Everly Brothers.

A very tempting offer, as it included his very attractive daughter to be his bride, so it's clear that Batman must remember to keep his focus and not let his personal feelings get in the way of his mission.Also in the TPB, we see Batman square off against The Bronze Tiger, who proves to be Batman's match in martial arts combat. This just solidifies that Batman is a top 5 martial artist, because The Bronze Tiger was trained by Richard Dragon, who is supposedly was the greatest martial artist in the DCU. Dragon also trained Lady Shiva, who quite easily can beat Nightwing in open combat (Nightwing isn't exactly a slouch, either!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ra's al ghul in the seventies","review":"A fairly good look at Ra's al Ghul in the seventies.

This collection was not the definitive, ultimate Ra's Al Ghul tale I thought it might be. I think that story may still yet to have been written. The Neal Adams art is beautiful and just about worth the cover price alone. However, Neal's art only graces the pages of three of the stories collected here. In fact, Ra's Al Ghul himself fails to show up in two entire stories and makes only a cameo appearance in a third. Not what I expected. Oh yeah, and the entire collection has been re-colored in a modern style which is NOT an improvement. Another complaint of mine would be that we find out in these issues that Ra's Al Ghul is Batman's most dangerous foe. How do we know that? The comics tell us that. It didn't seem like anything happened to appoint Ra's to that position, suddenly Batman just begins thinking statements like that to himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would avoid the new edition","review":"Oh man, this new printing of TOFD is really bad.

It has made those trips much easier than they would have been if we'd been forced to bring both a stroller AND a car seat!That being said, I'm surprised that the consistent problem of the seat-belt coming across the child's chest too high has not been addressed. My son is petite (at four he's 38\\" tall and only 31 lbs) and is just NOW tall enough that the belt is no longer a problem. I've wondered many times why the seat can't be made with space in the back through which to thread the seat belt (similar to regular car seats).One pro that is important to mention is the fact that you can steer the stroller with one hand - unlike most umbrella strollers! Having the other hand/arm available to hold another child's hand through the airport, or your coffee, or your shoes as you run from security to your gate, is priceless!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me","review":"Strolex 2 is better!!!!!

That said, I would not purchase this item again because of the weak construction of the stroller portion.The name - 5-in-1 - is a bit disingenuous because 4 of the options (rear facing, forward facing, booster seat, airplane seat) can easily be applied to ANY car seat.Another reviewer mentioned this is \\"not a stroller I would use on a regular basis\\" and I couldn't agree more. The wheels are so poorly put together that navigating simple rises in pavement or the space between the jetway and the place are extraordinarily difficult. We've probably used this on 8-10 trips and the front wheels snapped off when exiting a plane this last trip - effectively making this a 1-in-1 sit 'n' drag.

It just sits on the belt and no need of taking the wheels off to make it fit when traveling alone with a toddler.

It is very expensive and for what? It made skid marks on my kitchen floor, it feels very flimsy and I was afraid I would break it, because the dust cup is plastic it creates static electricity which makes the debris just cling to the dust cup.

Instead of this vacuum picking up the hair, a large amount of hair seems to sick to the bottom of it so I have to constantly pick up the vac to shake it off and then let the vacuum give it another try. I have another vacuum, not a shark, that picks up almost every bit of hair and puts it where it belongs. The only thing I like about this vacuum is the disposal system where as it pops out to empty so you really don't have to touch the dirt in any way. I have also used it on the carpet but it really doesn't do a very good job.

After much thought I decided to just buy a new one to my dismay the cradle I had just purchased for the very same model didn't work for my new one... I am not a glutton for punishment, I just found myself invested in accessories for this model.

The thing broke down within the first week, and I had to call their support line to see if I could get a replacement. They argued with me and told me i could send it in for repair - while I also paid for all the shipping. Obviously, I protested and ended up getting a free brush replacement kit since i was \\"so angry\\" - the replacement set helped, but now the battery only lasts about 2 minutes on a full charge.

I have had extensive experience (sold 50 plus) of these units. They are poorly designed, and cheaply made using poor quality parts. The stock manufacturer warranty is only 90 days (which is just when the battery will begin to lose a charge, the belt will come off, or the poorly made plastic connection to the power head will break). Operation...they do not have suction, and rely on the brush to sweep. Carpet threads, string, and wet debris quickly becomes embeded on the brush. The sales pitch on TV was impressive, and the director must have been a genuis to make such a poor performing sweeper look so much better than it does when you actually have to use it. I depend on repeat customers for sales, and with the many returns and unhappy customers I have experienced when selling the Shark Ultras, I will no longer stock and sell ANY....

On the plus side, each fan can be run in either direction independent of the other one, which is nice and even on the high speed its not very noisy. If you are light sleeper this thing should not be a problem for you noise wise. Its a good buy for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"These are great window fans.

If there is any even very BRIEF pause in the electircal supply, the fan has an annoying problem of not turning back on when the electrical supply resumes. Since it is rather high above the door, this involves getting on a ladder to re-set the fairly needlessly complicated settings.When I called \\"customer support,\\" the lady kindly read to me from the instruction pamphlet which came with the fan and which offered no help whatsoever. She also said that the \\"technical\\" people didn't know any more information and would not be of any assistance. She also was good enough to point out to me that the fan was functioning as it was designed.Again, annoying! Sloppy design, and poor customer support."},{"rating":"1","title":"low air flow","review":"this fan is quiet but hardly moves any air on high speed. i have other window fans (discontiued) that move MUCH more air. also would like to be able to shut off one side if I wanted."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheapest product ever","review":"Holmes CEO to staff; \\"Hey gang, lets see just how cheap and horrible we can make a fan....\\" And the winner is ....Holmes! and the loser is us, the consumers....This fan feels cheap just holding it.

I switched the right fan from intake to exhaust and now the right fan wobbles and makes a bunch of noise. No matter which direction it's set to now.It works. And has some seemingly cool features. But the temp settings really don't work. At least not at helping to maintain a certain temp. they do turn the fans on and off, randomly. But setting the fan to 70 is not going to get you to 70 degrees in your room.. it's more like a dial setting allowing you to go from low to high.The fan works, but is really loud now.the main features that they make this fan more expensive don't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Themostat is useless","review":"Everything about this fan is fine except the thermostat. It limit-cycles. That means, when the temperature is near the set point, it switches on and off continuously every couple seconds. This is way less efficient electrically, and annoying to listen to. Instead, a control loop needs to implement hysteresis, preventing this from happening. (This is elementary -- did they take an 8th grade science project for the design?)The cheaper model doesn't have the thermostat but everything else is the same. Buy that one.

However, I find that all fans are extremely overpriced. I should have paid the extra $10-$20 for a tower fan, but I wanted one for the window. The high setting is not very high. Also, they advertise the one button to be convenient, but it's kind of annoying to scroll through 10 settings to turn the fan off; it goes through Low - 60,65,70,75,80 degrees & high - 60,65,70,75,80 degrees before it turns off. Other than that, it pretty much does what I wanted, bringing the cold air from outside into the room..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I've had good luck with Holmes fans over the years and have owned several of them. When one of ours suffered a fatal fall during the summer, I picked up this model at our local big box store. I should have spent the extra $ and ordered the HAWF3095 from amazon instead. First of all, there is a single button that takes you through the 13 possible settings: High, Low, High + temperature (60, 65, 70, 75, 80), Low + temperature, and Off. This sort of interface should be used when there are only 4-5 options to cycle through; with 13 it's ridiculous. The worse problem is the temperature control itself. Whenever the temperature outside approaches the target that you set, the fan will start to cycle on and off repeatedly. You're much better off spending the few extra dollars to get the \\"AccuTemp\\" model. The interface isn't a huge improvement, but the temperature control is much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"works great!","review":"Bought this fan to cool a ridiculously warm bedroom & it works like a charm.

When I get home I close the bedroom and turn it on and it gets the heat concentrated in the room out and then at night I have one side in and the other out, It cools the room like an air conditioner. If it is hot out at night I just have it in exhaust and it does a desent job on keeping the temperature down inside.I went ahead an ordered 2 more last year for a second room and the living room. The temperature controls work great and it is a great option. They fit great in the windows. I love them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works as intended, It's not the best.","review":"Pros: It just works. I bought it to be a fan, the temperature settings do not apply to me. Capable of independently changing fan direction with a physical switch.Cons: There's no ON/OFF switch or speed control. You have to press this single button in the center that needs a full 13 presses to be fully off again. It has to go to OFF / FAST / SLOW / (10 temp setting programs) / OFF (AGAIN).Other Thoughts: I wish that there was a window fan that would be able to stay in year-round that would have some kind of vent to close."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fan didn't work at all","review":"First of all, I have no complaints about Amazon. Ordering was easy, shipping was prompt. Received the fan, installed it, plugged it in, it didn't work. The fans would twitch, like they were going to start, but they never did. Took it out of the window, plugged it in, it worked. Put it back in the window, it didn't work. This fan is a piece of junk, and should not be purchased.

We have about 7 in our house, consisting of 3 different kinds, including this one. This one works good, air-flow and noise-level being comparable to the others we have. It fits into the window well. Features on it are same as our others, in-flowing air, out-flowing air, simple thermostat (close enough on accuracy for its purpose). The only drawback for me is having to push the button about 10 times to turn it off, then if you hit it one too many times you have to go thru it again. The buttons do make for a nicer thermostat feature, where our others have a dial witch isn't as accurate and is a little more glitchy. But I'd still take the glitchy dial and the simple off-low-med-high speed dial over having to push the buttons. If price were within a couple bucks or less I'd take the other, otherwise I'm cheap enough that I'd still stick with this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meeting my expectations","review":"This fan is quiet enough.

Fairly quiet operation.

I was very surprised at how well this little unit cooled my room. It works especially well if you have two or more windows in the room you use it in. Setting both blades to \\"exhaust\\" while the other window is open causes all the cool night air to be sucked right in.. It also works well with one blade set to \\"intake\\" and the other to \\"exhaust.\\" Lastly, as a smoker I can say that it removes most of the smoke and stale odors in the room when used regularly.

I was using arrow staples so it wasn't a fastener issue.To clear jams one must use a phillips screwdriver and a small (9mm?) wrench just to dissasemble the gun. This in itself is a pain, but the inability of the unit to fire more than 5 staples without a double-feed or complete jam is unacceptable. I would avoid this gun at all costs.

They were firing at the floor, at spiders in the corner, at the sky, and one even flew up and hit the corner of my eye! And the part about it jamming up is correct too, this thing couldn't fire more than 2 staples (whether they went into the baseboard or off in left-field somewhere) without jamming up. And then reassembling it is a PITA as well. I have always been skeptical of reviews online, but this one is right on the money. I will be trying the T25p and hope to have better luck.

The T25P looks well-made and is solidly built. Unfortunately the T25P's poor performance is an entirely different matter. I used this for one small job, tacking up some chicken wire to wooden posts. I then tried to use it again a few days later for a similar job. I got one staple out and it jammed. I kept the stapler in a closed tool box in the house, not out in the elements, so there is no possibility it malfunctioned due to rust or other such issues. I had to disassemble the stapler to try and get it working again, a major pain when trying to do a small job quickly. Over the course of this job, I had to take it apart five times to clear jams.

The four clips that support that brake pads on the bracket are too big. The center portion of these clips that slip into the bracket are too wide and would be pretty deformed if you pushed hard enough to get them on.

I do not see too much difference between brands when it comes to staples. Just note that you literally get a box and inside is 5,000 staples.

It's not terribly long, but the words and pictures are a real pleasure to read before bed every night. The animals in the story are neat, too, such as a tiger, mouse, monkey, etc. It describes something that the animals do (stretching \\"like a tiger waking from a dream\\") and then shows them all getting ready for bed (\\"now copy these creatures all ready for bed, close your eyes tight and rest your sleepy head\\").

No longer intimidating, lectio divina will henceforth be practiced in my home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scholarly and Thorough Treatment of the Practice of Lectio","review":"Father Casey's book is a thorough and scholarly walk through the history and contemporary significance of the practice of Lection Divina; almost too much so for the beginner who wishes to learn how to incorporate the practice into his/her prayer or meditation. Don't get me wrong, it's a very good treatise on the subject, albeit perhaps a little too regimented and \\"monastic\\" for me... for instance, his insistance that the practitioner of Lectio work their way slowly through one biblical book rather than attempt to target meaningful texts, strikes me as a little over-controlling; applicable to a serious monastic maybe, but for us regular folks who are just interested in deepening our practice, a gentler technique may be just as useful. A great book for beginning inquiry into Lectio is S.

It was definitely time to take a step up in technology. However, neither of the DVDs in this collection would play on the DVD player. We were able to get them to play on our computer, but the video production was of such poor quality, we would be better off watching them on reel-to-reel. The vids look like someone copied them to DVD from a VHS tape. Because they are not mastered, the sound differs from one vid to the next. Some videos froze and others skipped.When I requested a refund from Amazon, they were happy to oblige and said that I needn't bother returning the DVD collection.

The palette itself is also more attractive and a nicer size, not too big, not too little. In fact, I can carry 8 different lipstick colors in less space than one tube of lipstick.

The book consists of the pared down life story interviews of hundreds of Americans (two through five pages for most), and highlights both the hopes of younger and the bitterness of the elderly. American Dreams: Lost and Found interviews people from all walks of life and races, including civil rights activists, house wives, Miss America herself (winner in 1970), a Klansman, a coal miner, professors, unionizers, politicians, entrepreneurs, hippies, flappers, heroes, criminals, and even a few famous people like Arnold Schwarzenegger. It manages to accurately convey the intangible concept of 'American Dream,' which before reading this book, I thought would be impossible.Be warned this isn't a book to read in one or even ten sittings; it's like reading hundreds of short stories, each covering a lifetime of experiences."},{"rating":"2","title":"Famous, Funny, Forthright & Fabalous!","review":"The first time I saw Studs Terkel he was being interviewed on national television as to some of his writings.

Therefore, I read it somewhat begrudgingly. I actually put the book down for a while and returned to it months later to finish. When I did I discovered that this book was very fitting for where I was in my life. The challenges in this book are hard, but good. This book will in the end really challenge you to seek out how God would have you live your life, and then to commit to doing so in writing. The writing aspect of this book really appealed to me, and the challenges throughout really prompted some thought. Overall, this book was very thought-provoking and challenging and I would recommend this to any Christian who is tired of mediocrity and ready to commit all to Jesus Christ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Was great.

A lot of people don't want to change the name because they have lived there they're entire life's. The main person that came up with the idea to change the name was a woman named Mimi and her daughter Gretchen.

The story is somewhat predictable. The plot does not really start to take off until the end of the book.

If you don't find the female draconians amusing, theres something wrong with you! My thoughts for price, a little high, especially for a book that's easily read in less than ten hours.

The Capresso quit working yesterday, after 14 months. Just cold quit, no warning. I finally took it apart to see what happened, and it appears that one of the two field coils on the motor has burned out. We have used this grinder in a domestic environment, grinding enough beans for two people in the morning, more or less each day since we got it. This hardly qualifies as hard use. While it was working, it did a good job with the grind, although as other reviewers have noted, it is extremely noisy, difficult to clean, and a bit awkward to use.

After I bought the proper clamps I started an upholstery project of four chairs. After the first chair the fastener started to get harder and harder to open up and within another few clamps it jammed, i.e. ceased to work. I was in the middle of the project and could not find the receipt, so I bought another fastener - a different model from the same company with yet another clamp size; nothing else available - which allowed me to complete the job, but which also did not work as smoothly as I would wish for.I sent an email to Arrow to inquire whether they find it normal that the first fastener failed within the first hour of use.

I've used truly heavy duty staplers for this purpose in the past and I was a bit worried that this lighter weight stapler might not be sufficient -- but it works just fine.The staples hold well and unless you're trying to staple through four layers of 12oz canvas this stapler is perfectly adequate for the task. I also find that it is very comfortable to use (I've had other staplers that gave me blisters). No jams or double discharges. Works perfectly every time.

The author approaches the topics like cash flow and cost analysis as if the reader were a freshmen student. I was disappointed because the book is not what it claims to be. At the cash flow analysis, the author worries about how to show that the depreciation should be added to the profit after tax. Anybody who works in the field knows that.

As an adult, I find it seems to move through the song list quicker than I remembered when I was a kid. In a continuous loop, it's not a problem though, as long as you don't get bored. The fire is tended by a hand and a poker only; one never sees the actual person who pokes the log and tries to push a few broken wood pieces back into the fireplace. That itself is worth a laugh.

Beginning only around 1830 with Suhtaio and Tsistsitas conflicts with the Pawnees and other Native Nations of the upper -trans-Missouri Basin, he doesn't even talk about Sweet Medicine, barely mentioning him and then going on to a standard replay of American history.

I bought my third one in October 2007 and it stopped working a few days ago. Actually, I don't know if it stopped working.

Of course putting the shaver on turbo helped a lot also. It was a close and quick shave, even on the first time using it. The turbo did drain the battery from 40 minutes to 20, but with the Nickel Metal Hydride battery, even the directions say you can plug it in all the time when not shaving, so who cares how much it drains the battery.

With daily shaving, expect your battery to last about 18 months.

As others have stated, the airflow could be a bit stronger, but it works well and is quiet.My only beef with the fan is that the underside of the fan facing inside - that should hold it in place in the window frame - is not very deep, which means it could slide out of place more easily than my previous fan. Living in a high rise, that's a big deal.And with all of these fans - cleaning it can become a challenge. Even though you can unscrew the back cover, it doesn't fully come off, which makes it difficult - but it is doable.Note, too, you can currently get this cheaper elsewhere, S&H; free (hint: look for a wholesale club)."},{"rating":"2","title":"bionaire review","review":"Great looking fan, looks nice and high tech in my window, I secured it vertically with electrical tape. Yes, I had to take it apart, move the thermostat wire and tape it away from the moter to get the thermostat to work properly. exhaust mode seems fairly weak, but ok, high speed is a little noisy, so I keep it on medium. Definitely don't need the A/C most of the time with this fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Fan!","review":"I bought this fan because we couldn't use our central air during some construction this summer. It is the best money I've spent recently. Things I love about this fan: 3 speeds so just before I go to bed I turn it up on high and it really brings that cool night in quickly cooling the room, very quiet(I don't usually like \\"white noise\\" like some people but this doesn't bother me at all) and the temperature setting is really nice. Now that the temp at night is finally cooling off I usually set the thermostat on the fan at 75 on low. When the fan goes below 75 it shuts itself off! No waking up freezing in the middle of the night. It fit really good in our new replacement windows. The only thing I don't like is having to take it in and out of the window if it rains or its going to rain while I'm at work. Its just a small inconvenience though to being able to sleep good through the night. Shipping was good, about 3 days."},{"rating":"2","title":"super powerful and super quiet","review":"buy this fan! it's amazing.

It will quietly refresh your room during a warm summer night, allowing you to sleep and benefit from air circulation in those houses where there is no central air conditionning. It has 3 speeds and 3 air flow settings (In, Out, Exchange: one fan works in and the other out to exchange the room's air with the outside air) to rapidly get the room to the desired confort level.It also has an Automatic mode that controls the fan's operation until the desired temperature is reached. This feature is not ideal since it will have the fan starting and stopping every 2-3 minutes when the temperature rises back to above the desired temperature.Altogether, I am very satisfied with this fan, even though I do not use the Automatic feature. It is exceptionnaly quiet I find and the air flow features get the job done in no time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice fan with temp. glitch","review":"The fan does its job. Before we got it we did a lot of research, and it was hands down the best choice for the money. All the functions work pretty nicely EXCEPT the digital thermostat, but not to worry - half of us don't even set it up. For the other half you can do the same thing as I did, like I said we read the reviews on it and every one said that the thermostat is the main draw back but some one actually took it apart and supplied the detailed instructions how to move the thermo wire away from the board, I did it in 20 min., so if you are a handy man then there is nothing to it. Overall we are happy with this fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bionaire Twin Window Fan","review":"This is an excellent fan.

They told me to keep checking with them after few weeks, so I told how will I know if they have the stock. They told me to keep sending them email every week to know if they have any stock available.

Poor customer service!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Exchange means in/out runs at same time.","review":"The exchange air feature means that while one fan draws outside air in, the other draws inside air out. But since the edges of the fans are about 2 inches apart, some portion of the air just drawn in is immediately pulled out. I could not feel much air movement 8 inches from the front on the fan blowing in. Alas, the best automatic operation I can get is to exhaust air when inside temp is above a certain temperature during the day.

I would recommend it for light to medium exhaust fan applications."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marginal","review":"Cons: The amount of air it pushes is pathetic, especially for the price. The fan housing developed a huge 14 inch crack on the FIRST day I used it.It wasn't cracked when I unpacked it. The plastic is just very cheap. I'm guessing the quick change in air temperature is what caused the cracking.Seriously... why would an engineer design an object that was designed to change the air temperature, and build it with plastic that's so cheap it can't withstand temperature change?Pros: It's a fan. It blows air. It has electronic functions that work as advertised. It still runs as advertised even with the cracked housing."},{"rating":"1","title":"False advertising","review":"The description specifically states that the fan fits windows up to 37\\". It does not. You must PURCHASE an additional $6 item to make it extend to 37\\" windows, and you can only do that IF the company happens to have the extenders in stock that month. Otherwise you're left with a useless product. This is textbook bait & switch, and people should not patronize Bionaire."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fan so far!!!","review":"I bought this fan to air out my house of cooking fumes and cooling off during fall season. There is a little lip (1\\" tall) to keep the fan from falling but I had to cut to .15\\" to create a tight seal in the window. My window is a typical double pane and double hung from Lowes. When you close the window on the fan, it will hit the lip in middle of it. It works better now. Electric consumption is 1.5 watts during idle. It runs from 65w to 85w from low to high speed. Remote works great (you don't need line of sight to use), just bounce of the wall. This is a fantastic fan for the price.I will update the review for ambient noise level later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great fan - but you can't clean it!","review":"I bought this fan several years ago. I would give it four stars as it really cools down a workspace if the temperature outside is below 90 degrees. Above 90 - forget it. It's time for the AC. One more thing, if it's a very hot and humid day and the sun is baking down on the unit, it also won't be much help.I don't find the other complaints about the temperature gauge not working all that important. For me, it's the problem with cleaning the unit. You can't open it completely in order to clean the fans. (If you can, please post how to do it here). I called Bionare and I was amazed when the representative told me you can't open the unit!Bionaire is supposed to be THE company as far as allergy helping products are concerned, and yet they manufacture a unit that can't be cleaned! The fans are covered with soot, as are the plastic vents.If someone has discovered a way to completely clean this unit properly, please post it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very quiet","review":"There is nothing I can complain about this fan. It is very quiet, it looks good, it comes with a remote control, the price is good. So far I have very good experience with Bionaire products. I live in southern California. Although it can be a little bit hot in summer (I know, it's nothing compared to most other places in US...), here at night it's always cool outside. I don't like to turn on A/C as it is expensive. A window fan is perfect for me.Some people talked about the temperature sensor inside fan is positioned incorrectly, causing temperature reading higher than it should be. I just opened the fan and saw the temperature sensor is away from the circuit board now. The problem should already be fixed in the latest model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything you need in a fan!","review":"This fan is quiet, it reverses to pull in air, or push air out. Or one side of the fan pulling air in, and one side pushing the air out, add a remote and it is a great product. I am getting one for the guest room, as I put this one in when we have guests and we take the old style one. I can not be w/o this fan even for a night. It also saves you on a/c, as it really cools off and you do not need a/c. Plus the ability to see the air temp is a great feature. Run do not walk to get this fan, no other fan comes close."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent fan","review":"I decided to purchase this fan even though a lot of people seemed to have trouble with the thermostat. I purchased because all of the reviews also indicated that it was so quiet. I am very pleased that it is in fact so quiet I can actually fall asleep at night. In addition I am one of the lucky ones with a working thermostat. I definitely recommend this fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another window fan that will not fit modern windows","review":"I posted this review for the Holmes HAWF3095-U last year. This year I tried the Bioaire BW2300 with the EXACT same result.I have windows that the inside of the channel is 2 inches from the screen. It is a modern manufactured window unit widely used in the building industry. This fan needs about 2 3/4 inches clearance, minimum. If I removed the screen, bugs would swarm in through the fan grates. If I leave the screen in, the fan sits on the sill and there is no clean way of attaching it.Another thing I noticed was that the electrical cord exits from the bottom and if I could have fit it in the window channel, it would have been inside it and would have to loop over the channel. Not a huge deal but further evidence of a strange design.Basically, fairly flat on the inside, bulbous on the outside.

It is great for the measurement of exact board widths in the setup of the fence on my table saw. I've used it to mark cuts on ceramic tiles, and so many other uses that I don't have time to itemize.

It does, however, seem to have a a slightly funkier, house-y sound, laced with an electro vibe. Perfect combination in my opinion. I was lucky enough to see him for a second time, at Sky for Halloween this weekend - wow. He blew my mind. I can think of a bunch of great DJs who are great at making studio/behind-the-scenes productions, but much fewer can really consistently please a live audience (which seems ironic to me, when talking about DJs).

Yet, if you think about the price of this lens, it's not really that bad. The material used feels and looks like a toy. If you really want a good wide angle lens, I recommend Canon 10-22mm or if you want something cheaper, a Sigma 10-20mm will give you the best result."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got my money's worth","review":"As a new photographer I struggled about buying a lens that was both inexpensive and a brand that was not very well known to me. I needed a wide angle lens on short notice (to take pictures of a very expensive house) so I didn't have a lot of time to research and not a lot of money either. I took a leap of faith and it has paid off. Even though I know there are much better lenses out there I am very pleased with the results. My only regret was not purchasing a filter to go with the lens but all of my indoor shots came out great. The outdoor shots came out good but would have been better with a polarized filter. I would recommend this lens to anyone like me that is struggling with money and digital knowledge. I am very pleased and not shopping for anything better at the moment. The photo's I sold the first time out more than paid the cost of the lens."},{"rating":"2","title":"for the price, it's worth it!","review":"At such a low price you get a decent lens. It is not the sharpest but what do you expect for 80 bucks? However it is sharp enough for the work I do. The Vignetting is nice also! If you do more creative photography work and your concerns are other then the sharpest lens, you'll really enjoy this for the value! only complaint the lens cap fits a bit flimsy-definitely get a 72mm filter to go with it to protect it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Clunky & not-so-wide for 1.6 crop factor cameras like the XT & XTi","review":"The autofocus is slow, loud and clunky...the \\"wide angle\\" isn't so wide on my Canon XT or on other 1.6x crop factor cameras."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap price but does the trick","review":"Very decent lense for the Canon Eos, does the trick, shipped promptly.Vignetting is very low, while there is some, it is much better outside than inside.

Tobias is forced to witness his friends suffer like he once did, and will do anything he can to save them. But a mysterious love from his past has just entered the scene. Tobias knows that the concept of love can't intermix with war right now as the Animorphs try to save everything they've ever known, but this person has a place deep down in Tobias's heart. Can the Animorphs save themseves -- and the ones they love -- before destruction occurs at an extraordinary pace ?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The secret is out - and now everything's changed....","review":"Ever since the war with the Yeerks began to heat up, things have gotten really close for the Animorphs - but they've always managed, just barely, to survive, and to keep their identities a secret. But now it seems as if the Yeerks have finally discovered that the \\"Andalite bandits\\" are really a group of humans. This new discovery puts the resistance, and the future of Earth, at risk. The Animorphs must protect themselves and their families at all costs. But to do that, they've got to do the unthinkable - reveal their secret. And along the way, Tobias will make a discovery that changes everything. This was the best of all of the recent Animorphs books - I can't even think of one in recent memory that tops it. It had drama, humor, sadness, and emotional depth all in one. It made me laugh and cry at the same time.

In reading through the different chapters, it is hard to find a complete separation in their writing between one deadly sin described and another - perhaps there isn't any, but perhaps that is where the discussion could lead. As a result it seems that the surface is skimmed repeatedly, but the real meat of the matter remains where it was before the workbook! As a workbook for discussion groups studying seven deadly sins, this workbook would probably create the same exact discussion for every session. Another result of the authors' bias would probably create a trail of condemnation versus a pathway for enlightenment concerning these sins. In conclusion, this work falls short of what it could have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality, good customer service.","review":"I bought this router table at a tool show, it included a powerful router.

But if a book is opinionated, it should at least be an fun read. O'Neil's volume fails on both counts - it is blatantly subjective and painfully boring, in addition to being rambly. The author includes a lot of detail where a brief summary would surfice, and brushes over important issues, leaving a reader with pages of generalities. The chapter on minority discrimination, for exapmle, is perfunctory, and shot through with anachronic assumptions, providing little insight into the issue beyond the (selective) listing of facts. The technicalities of descriptions of military operations will quickly put you to sleep.

Really I don't have any favorite tracks because I like them all, but some tracks that stand out are \\"Mask 2 My Face\\", \\"They Don't Love Me\\", and \\"I Faked It Last Night\\". One tight track is \\"Same Block\\", which has a tight scratching sound in the background.

Well written with just enough reality to possibly be a real explanation for things of the past.Don't know about the rest of you, but wish ABC would bring this back and make it into a series with life. I'm sick and tired of all the ethnic shows, reality shows and have had my fill of CSI. Give us a break and give us some good action and adventure that makes you think. The Veritas Quest did that for me... You don't have to have cops, rapists, court cases or ethnic stereotyping to make a good show.

This show, and Miracles which was aired and pulled at the same time, gave me a break from all the police dramas. I am sick of police dramas.

It is not about serial killers however,and that may be a fresh change in his books. Or refreshed whichever way you look at it since it has been rereleased. That aside, I found this book to be very fast paced and exciting. While some things are predictable (unlike his current works which leave you with the feeling that you will never know what will happen) this book is still very much worth the read. Arch Carroll ( the main character) is not as deeply defined as Alex Cross but this never takes away from a great story that will move you along nicely. I am a fan of great \\"national security\\" type books and found this one very satisfying but if one is in the market for a serial escapade then this is not the book for you. If you are in the mood for an abridged Clancy type book then by all means have at it.

There are only 4-5 of his books that I don't like; (in order of my least favorite) Thomas Berryman Number, The Lake House (although I did like When the Wind Blows), Black Friday, and Season of the Machete.The story did have promise, but I didn't like the final direction that he choose to go with it. And I had figured out who the \\"bad guy\\" was about 1/2 way through. I had to force myself to finish this book, which is not something I'm used to with James Patterson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book I've read by Patterson!","review":"I can't believe I would ever be saying that Patterson wrote a bad book, but I have to. I've read A LOT of Patterson books and this is the first one that took me more than a week to finish. It too me almost a month. It was terrible. I couldn't get into it and it was just weird. Too slow! I still recommend Patterson, because I've loved all the other books I've read, but will not recommend this one! Awful!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"While this isn't the best Patterson book I've ever read it was overshadowed by the horrible editing of the kindle edition. This is by far the worst edited book I've read since I got my kindle a year ago and I've read a lot. At times it was difficult to read because words were wrong and punctuation was terrible. If I was Mr. Patterson I would be ashamed to have my name attached to such a poor quality book. I downloaded this book from my local library, I'm glad I didn't pay for it or I would have been very unhappy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Black Friday more like Lousy Friday","review":"One of the worst \\"Paterson\\" books ever. Did he really write it?. Silly plot, poorly drawn characters, dopey dialogue, incredibly poor ending. Somewhere above an adventure version of Dick and Jane and quite a bit below a good Hardy Boys book. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so much","review":"I am such.........SUCH.......a Patterson fan. I love the reads and I love the drama......but when there isn't a personal connection.....a bite to sink into that connects a story to another story........not so much. Single stories just don't seem to be the forte. The series books, yes.........the singles.......not so much. I read it out of respect for the author.......but I was not impressed. I need more nail biting........more anticipation.....more familiarity........this just didn't do it for me and I'm thankful that I didn't pick it for a \\"summer read\\". Sorry.........truly do love Patterson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of date, not so interesting, not credible","review":"This book was pretty bad. It might have been decent when it came out, but it is hopelessly out of date. The situations seem either hackneyed or just plain unbelievable. The financial markets have changed so much since this book was written that much of it sounds unintentionally silly. Also the characters seem like stock characters - uninteresting - a policeman - who is Irish (shock!) and drinks too much (even bigger shock!) - how stereotypical can this book get? I saw the film of Kiss the Girls and I was expecting much more. I hope his later books are better and he was just learning the ropes here, but I won't pay good money to find out after this clunker!"},{"rating":"1","title":"GARBAGE","review":"I PREVIOUSLY READ ONE BOOK BY PATTERSON (ALONG CAME A SPIDER) AND IT WAS A FAIR BOOK, SO I TRIED ANOTHER.

HORRIBLE BOOK."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHY?????","review":"Why would an until now good author re-edit, re-title and the re-release a 'not to good to begin with' book?? For faithful fans that will buy whatever he writes, this was a slap in the face. I thought I was getting a new Patterson novel, boy was I wrong. I will think twice before buying anything with Pattersons name again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Check your work","review":"I am a huge fan of Patterson. This was yet another great story. However, there are so many typos in the Kindle version, at times one needs to use the imagination to suppose what is meant to be said. After reading more than 60 of Patterson's novels, I am switching authors. Not interested in buying more junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"E book conversion badly done","review":"I read black friday on my Kindle Fire and was so frustrated by the lack of punctuation, poor wording, spelling errors and leaving out words needed to finish a sentence. Some words contained spaces between the letters and some phrases were badly misspelled. I can't imagine this was a direct reproduction of the book. It seems to have been translated into E book by writers not fluent in English. Don't download, you will be greatly disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Patterson book","review":"I'm probably overrating this book a bit, since I read it after the dreadful London Bridges, and was pleasantly surprised at how good this book was. My expectations were low since this book was written in the mid 80s, and I was expecting it to be very dated. Also, I wasn't sure what to expect from a pre-Along Came a Spider Patterson book.The story revolves around a mass terrorist plot concocted by bitter Vietnam War veterans who want vengeance against the U.S. government and society in general. The way to hit them where it really hurts is by attempting to strike a severe blow towards the U.S. Stock Market, and thus, causing a crash that would severely hurt the U.S. economy. An interesting Pre 9/11 terrorist plot that I very much enjoyed reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why I feel ripped off by this book","review":"OK, let's list the reasons that I feel ripped off by both the author and Amazon.com with this book.1. I bought this book from Amazon.com because I didn't recognize the title and, I assumed, (stupid me) from the copyright date (April 2000) that this was a new title. This book was originally published as Black Market in 1986 and later in 1994. Of course I couldn't tell that from the Amazon.com reviews.2. The book just wasn't that good. It was in no way up to Patterson's usual standard. So, why does the author change the name and copyright date? Hard to tell but it seems to me it is to get us a ploy to buy a poorly written book.The fact that I already own this book makes buying this book under the new title doubly irritating. I won't buy another Patterson novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patterson's Black Friday--a weak retread","review":"I would not recommend this book. It represents the publishers' greediness--that is, an attempt to cash in on the authors' recent sucess. This book was clearly an early publication reject and the author has still not solved the problems for the earlier rejection--i.e., a nothing ending, poor plot development and a weak cast of characters. It's too bad the author allowed this to happen. This is not the first time for Patterson--another of his recent releases is also a retread. He's in it for the bucks, readers...be shy of his retreads..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dragging","review":"I don't want to trash the book completely cos I am not sure whether you have to work on wall street to enjoy the book or be into the stock market.I read books by Grisham and I am not a lawyer or a criminal justice person and I still enjoy it. The book was kind of slow and boring to me. I had to force myself to finish it cos I needed to satisfy my suspicion about the mystery person and I was right. Apart from that it was somewhat graphic and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst book I've ever tried to get though","review":"I have read 24 Patterson Books including all the Cross and Boxer series. I usually get through a book in a week. Well I've progress for 2 + weeks and have just reach page 300. Where is this book going? I am struggling to keep my attention on what I am reading. It is totally boring. Thank God that this book was not the first Patterson book I read as I would not have read the others that were terrific. I cannot believe this pathetic trash was ever published!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugg","review":"James Patterson is one of my favorite authors, but I'm sorry to say, this book really isn't one of his best. It's awfully boring and the characters really aren't very interesting. I've had a hard time even finishing it. Usually, I can't stand to put one of his books down!For action adventure, I'd suggest reading any of his books with (one of his best characters) Alex Cross in them, or When The Wind Blows and continuation of this story with The Lake House. Suzanne's Diary for Nicolas for a really great, touching story too. Everyone who I've lent it too loves it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete waste of time","review":"This book had some potential at the beginning but bombed about half way through..I am surprised at the favorable reviews here..The story is very weak and almost eerie considering it was published pre-911..I am amazed that J.P.'s publisher didn't hand the manuscript back to him and tell him to rewrite the ending..The ending was probably the worst I have ever read..In fact, if you decide to read this book, skip the last 10 chapters and write your own ending..I'm positive you'll do better than Patterson did!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Black friday","review":"Numerous spelling and grammar errors. Good story but it's really distracting with run on sentences misspelled words etc. At least run spell check . That would have prevented some of the misspelled words and grammar errors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst edited book I've ever read","review":"Although the story was interesting I have never seen a book with so many misspellings, poor punctuation, typos. It was funny when they called the ny Times the ny tunes. I can't imagine the actual paper book being this bad, but we e readers deserve quality workmanship also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many typos","review":"It was a pretty good book, however, it was very slow reading because there were so many typographical errors. If you need a proofreader, I'm available for hire."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"I made myself finish this book, but not because I was enjoying it. I just kept thinking it would get better....sadly, it didnt. This was not the James Petterson that I know and love. The kindle version was also frustrating to read because it was so filled with mistakes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not typical James Patterson","review":"I have to say I love most of James Patterson's books. I love the Alex Cross Series and The Women's Murder Series, but this book was a complete disappointment for me. If your looking for a book that will take a month to read, this is the one for you. It did not catch your interest, as most of his books do. I have to say it was the worst book I've read by him. I'm looking forward to the release of the new Alex Cross book in November!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure junk","review":"This was the first (and last) book I read by this author. I could hardly finish this book.

Boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"FOR ALL THOSE INTERESTED IN MATHEMATICS","review":"This is 'the book' the typical high school student in America needs to read in order to see what Geometry is really all about. Geometry can be fun and engaging. Unfortunately it has taken a back seat in the high school curriculum. This is unfortunate considering the beauty that the subject has to offer. Many topics are covered in this book: The extended law of cosines, Ptolemy's theorem, transformational geometry, conics, and many, many, many more. This is also a book that is essential for mathematical problem solvers-- particularly for those interested in competing. All that is needed to follow along is the basic geometry learned at the high school level. This book is a must have for any mathematical library.A++ Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Savvy and Literate","review":"I'm a skeptic about astrology, but I was fascinated by Renstrom's book. It's psychologically perceptive, witty, sophisticated, and wonderfully written. It's a visual treat. The art alone is worth the price. And the historical juxtapositions give food for thought for days."},{"rating":"1","title":"missing pages??","review":"This book would be great except it leaves out some descriptions for Mercury and Venus. If one is going to write an astrology book there shouldn't be anything left out. And then the author doesn't give any explanation as to why these are left out. I find that puzzling and a bit unprofessional for book purposes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kinda sketchy","review":"First of all, some pages, in the Child of Moon....Moon in Pisces or whatever combo section, are missing. I couldn't reference one of my relatives - Child of Mercury....Mercury in Pisces. Then I found some of the celebrity/historical figures for each 'Child of' hilarious. Oh yeah, I have much in common with Venus children Rita Hayworth and Pol Pot. Guess that explains my flair for dancing and genocidal tendencies. Whew! And all this time I thought it was just me. The good part is the artwork. It's a pretty book if a little vapid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ruling Planets","review":"First of all, the review about missing pages is correct. Sadly there does seem to be pages missing and that seriously flaws any book obviously. The author should offer either a refund or replacement for putting out a book with missing pages. It's the least they could do.Further, I have read that your ruling planet of your chart is the sign, and it's planet, of the first house. Maybe astrologers differ in what planet actually runs the show. Knowing something about the planets of all signs is important but there is one that is suppose to rule the chart itself. Unfortunately this looks to be more for entertainment or the coffee table than anything you could really learn something from."},{"rating":"1","title":"Airy Fairy at Best","review":"Much too simplistic and general.

I would only be echoing the many positive reviews of this product with my own review. It does what they say, and does it well.

I like it so much, I have ordered the 8\\" as well, replacing my old nonstick omelet skillet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Buy and speedy delivery","review":"I got just what I wanted at a price I thought was reasonable.

Now I have a great skillet but no lid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skillet","review":"I have always liked Cuisinart products and this one is no exception. It is a heavy stainless and heats evenly.

I did so based on a recommendation [...]. Our nonstick pans had deteriorated to a point I did not feel was safe. These pans work fine and will probably not require replacement. Two points. The handles are not as comfortable as I was led to believe, a minor point. I cook a lot with olive oil, and you have to be careful to use low heat, much lower than with nonstick, or a lacquer-like residue will form on the pan requiring diligent scrubbing with Bon-Ami to remove.By the way, check out other cookware and you will find that you can not beat the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought it's time.....","review":"Thought it's time to rate my products as I ALWAYS read the reviews before purchasing. In short, LOVE MY PAN! You don't have to worry about the teflon coating peeling as I've heard that this can cause cancer. These pans will eventually become heirlooms because they NEVER wear out. Well worth the money (and cheaper on Amazon.com)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than expected","review":"Ordered the Cuisinart MCP22-30H Pan using PRIME. The delivery was fast and packaging was more than enough.The Skillet is heavy as others have said, but this seems to be its advantage. The heating required for frying is somewhat less than what I used on other units.My only complaint is it does not have a lid. As the unit I purchased is a 12-inch skillet my glass lids for other pans does not fit it. Clean up is easy. I follow the directions of Cuisinart in preheating the pan to prevent sticking, and that also makes the cleanup a breeze."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warped within 2 weeks","review":"This is my first experience with a stainless steel pan, and overall I love working with this pan. However, the bottom was become warped after only 2 weeks of use. I have never put cold water into it when it was hot and followed all the included care instructions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skillet is awesome, Delivery was horrible!!!","review":"Bought the MCP set and love it. But, it doesn't include a 12 inch skillet, which is essential. Cooks great, love the helper on the front. It makes cooking so easy and the tapered edge makes pouring grease spill free. Now, the bad part. First, this does not reflect on Amazon in any way. That experience was positve. I am a Prime member and paid a little extra to get the skillet next day. I order, it ships, and I wait. I hear the FEDEX driver pull up in the parking lot, (I live in a complex) and I wait by the door. Next thing I know, I hear the driver pulling off! WHERE IS MY SKILLET?!?!?!?!? Long story short, the driver neglected to capture a signature and just dropped off my package at a random apartment, which resulted, not only in me receiving my package THREE days later, but I spent numerous phone calls with FEDEX to try to get this handled."},{"rating":"2","title":"cookware","review":"this cookware seems to be very well made. As with all stainless one must use a good amount of oil to keep food from sticking, but they do clean up well if filled with water directly after use. Given the choice between olive oil and plastic, well I'd rather have a bit extra oil in my diet. The only reason not to give five stars at this point is I want to see how it holds up. In the past I've been very disapointed with Cuisinart's Teflon cookware, it did not live up to it's name. We have a gas cooktop and the cookware seems to be preforming well."},{"rating":"2","title":"The pan is needed for set","review":"If you purchased the cuisinart set, you need this piece.

Most of my older pans were Cuisinart classic stainless and would not work on my new stove.First impressions: Skillet is aesthetically appeasing, appears to be solidly constructed and substantial.Cooking: Even heat. No hot spots on my induction cooktop. Handle stays cool. Bottom is flat and does not buzz at high power. This pan is a significant upgrade from the classic line.Cleaning: Cleaned easily. If you want to maintain the like new shine, use Barkeepers Friend or any commercial calcium lime and rust remover spray, wipe and rinse."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite skillet","review":"Perfect for my favorite way to cook most meats: pan-sear and oven-finish.

From the moment I took it out of the box, this thing exudes an aura of excellent craftsmanship."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOOOO Disappointed","review":"This 12\\" skillet was NOT flat. It rocked and was definitely defective. I really could not believe it! This is the most expensive cookware I have ever purchased, and all my cheap thin skillets were at least flat! I am amazed at this kind of defect in a $59 pan! (It is now down to $44.53, I see - still not cheap!) Amazon customer service was great, however, and I did get my money back. I am now looking at the 5.5 qt casserole as a replacement, but I see reviews that that pan is not flat either! What's going on? Does anyone have a good review for the flatness on a FLAT cooktop stove of the 5.5 qt casserole or saute pan??? I hope so. The similar in size All Clad saute pan is much too expensive. I don't know what to do. Why is it so hard to find quality within an affordable price anymore???"},{"rating":"1","title":"unhappy","review":"This pan is not flat on the bottom and thus will spin on the stove and therefore can be dangerous if the handle is hit by accident.

It is not a good product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pan lacks a lid","review":"The 12.5 inch Cuisinart Stainless Steel Skillet is a good product. However, both Amazon and Cuisinart rate a big fat zero when for help in finding a lid to fit it.You would think, either or both of them, should be able to help on this problem.Amazon should find out what lid will work, It would help their sales.Cuisinart gave me, eventually, a ridiculous price of some $60, as much as the pan."},{"rating":"1","title":"10\\" isn't made from stainless steel.","review":"I was astonished to find out that 10\\" skillet doesn't work on induction stove. This means that it isn't made from stainless steel, since SS is magnetic material and 100% compatible with induction.

It's not the best quality and is thin, she wore leggings and a long sleeve black tee underneath when going trick or treating. Also, the collar does not stand up on its own at all, but we took two safety pins and pinned it to the back of her hair and it looked perfect, lol. We did her hair just like the girl in the photo. Those are the things that mommy would notice, but as for my daughter she absolutely loved it and still enjoys wearing it around the house every now and then :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Vampiress Costume","review":"For this price, this costume is a real bargain. The fabric is not of the best quality, but it's not in any way worse then other Halloween costumes (in my opinion, all Halloween costumes are of dreadful quality) - so why overpay? My daughter was delighted with it. The collar on it stays up nicely, and it's very easy to get the dress on. We used it with the matching red cloak she had from the last year, and those glow in the dark vampire teeth. This costume has only two items - the dress and the collar. I would definitely recommend it, especially for a child who made up her mind on a vampire costume."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes a great evil queen costume, like in sleeping beauty","review":"Comfy item, the front tie could be longer.

You have no clue what you are about to read, and you have low expectations for the novel. I went into Slimer expecting just that, instead I got a shock. Slimer is great!! The little novel(156 pages) opens up to 6 people floating on a raft in the middle of the ocean, cold, hungry, and just waiting to die. Just as it seems there luck is about to run out, they find what appears to be a deserted oil rig, but instead is a secret labratory that was harboring a half shark-half \\"Phoenix\\". As they desperatly try to figure why the lab is abandoned, they just might find something horrific first... The book isn't really scary, and the monster is only very briefly in the form of what is looks like on the cover, but overall it's great, expecially the ending, which has to be the best last few chapters of a book I've ever read.

What is crucial to understanding the station of slaves in all societies, African: the various tribal slave systems, European: Roman,Greek,French,Dutch and English;Asian: Jewish, Islam,Indian, Korean etc is that the slave is defined by the absence of power. The slave is compelled to forgo his or her rights and concede to the domination of the owner. The slave is powerless before his or her master.This absence of power on the part of the slave was common to all slave societies, least of all the American slave society who had embraced the Aristotlean notions of slavery and discarded the Romans' who saw slavery as an outcome of fate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Walker side bag","review":"Clamps to side of walker and works as advertised very well.

Cleaning the filters helps a bit, but who wants to clean the filters every time you use the vacuum. My previous vacuum was a Dirt Devil Featherlight Vision and it was the best I ever had.

I must have watched at least 2 hours of extras that night. The cast is great at coming up with alternate lines in the show. The first season is really well written with great doctor/patient and doctor/doctor relationships. If you've never seen Scrubs, watch it once and you'll be hooked! This is a must have for the true Scrubs fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally!","review":"FINALLY is all I can say for the release of Scrubs on DVD. It is the best show on television and NBC was in the wrong to wait so long to begin releasing the seasons. Can't wait for the second season!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SCRUBS is a must see TV show, if there ever was one!","review":"I don't have time for a long review, but I just wanted to say that I was a late comer to this show. I greatly regret that. This show would have to be a rival for one of the best comedy shows of all time.I cannot wait to see the first season straight through from start to finish, nor the next ones, including the ones that I have now watched when they debuted.Unless you have an extremely poor sense of humor (you all know who you are) I would strongly advise anybody whom wishes to get a good laugh to buy this series, every season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarity","review":"I love this show. I watch even the repeats almost religiously. If you aren't looking for a serious medical drama than this is for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great First Season for a SitCom","review":"I never watched this show because it was a TV SitCom.This spring I caught a snippet from the show as I was channel surfing.I was rolling on the floor. I watched several syndicated episodes and laughed.I bought it for my wife for Valentines Day. We both enjoy this series.It beat flowers and chocolate.If you never saw the series this is the only place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Umm... an AMAZING show!","review":"Give Scrubs a chance! Once I started watching it I was completely hooked. It can make you laugh and cry in the same episode. Scrubs has the uncanny ability to make serious, socially-conscious points, but also provide hilarious comic-relief. This show makes me really happy and I bet it'll make you happy too!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy a bundled set.","review":"If you are fairly sure you will like this, then you will probably love it. It is truly hilarious. Seriously consider buying a multi-season bundled set because if you don't, you'll probably end up buying the seasons one at a time and spending more money to do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This show is hilarious","review":"I love \\"Scrubs\\" and think I'll be getting more seasons of it. If you have never watched it, you need to! It's hilarious!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ordering season 2 in a second!","review":"This is a really funny show.The cast is very good (nobody could have done it better than Zach Braff).Jokes are never repeated, situations change all the time.We cannot wait for the season 2 to arrive."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the BEST","review":"I don't think I've watched a series that's been more clever, and kept me as interested as Scrubs. Season 1 does a wonderful job introducing and building the characters with an amazing storyline and a great dialog that makes you wish you worked with them.A great buy, and one of the few that's actually worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best sitcoms ever","review":"Easily one of the best sitcoms ever produced, and definitely the best these days where all you can find is canned, trying-to-hard acting and slapstick or distasteful comedy. Scrubs offers up smart, subtle humor expertly manuevered alongside moments of real emotion and believable situations. The cast is amazing - each one adds something totally unique and complimentary to the others. The music is also great. I borrowed season 1 dvds and ended up watching episode after episode until it was done. It's addictive!"},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as Seinfeld","review":"Scrubs is so clever and original. The show is so funny and so much fun to watch. These are great dvds to own because you can watch them over and over and still laugh as hard as the first time. Also the bonus scenes and interviews are good. I don't find too many other people who are as devoted to Scrubs as my husband and I are and I can't understand it. I rate it and Seinfeld as the best comedies on network tv during the last 15 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny","review":"The only show on television that can consistently make me laugh out loud, even when I'm the only one in the room; and all the jokes are just as funny the 10th time. Its a shame this show has been treated so badly by NBC. TONS of awesome extras, behind the scenes, bloopers, etc. Even if you've only been able to catch the show a few times and enjoyed it you should definately purchase this DVD. It can cheer you up and make you laugh on the suckiest of days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wished I watched this show on TV","review":"Ordered through Amazon and it arrived in about 5-6 days after placing order. Great show, never watched it while it was on TV but have become hooked on it via re-runs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Change of Pace","review":"I love the medical dramas, but still enjoyed this nice break in pace. If you're looking for a serious show, this is not it. It's a nice change of pace from all the typical shows out there:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Never Saw the Show Until I Rented This DVD Set","review":"I took a gamble renting this 3 Disc DVD set. I heard it was a great comedy and I read some of the reviews on this site, but I didn't want to waste three rentals on something I might not enjoy. Now saying that, this show is one of the best comedies ever. The entire cast is fresh and funny, especially Zach Braff, Sarah Chalke, Ken Jenkins, and John C. McGinley. There wasn't a weak episode in the 24 here. I love how there is no laugh track, so you can decide for yourself what is funny (practically every joke hits its mark with this show). I hope the other seasons are as great as this one. This deserves to win a Best Comedy Emmy real soon if there is any justice in the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Total Classic.","review":"If you have ever found yourself asking \\"Where have all the good TV shows gone?\\" Then look right here."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have","review":"If you like Scrubs - you have to get this. It shows just how far the characters have evolved. You will laugh out loud."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRILLIANT","review":"This is just the BEST!!!!! A have to see and own forever! PLEASE do not miss this. Scrubs is the best ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"A funny Daydream in reality","review":"It's so funny because you don't have to be a doctor to relate to does first day's at a new job. Plus the daydream secuences are hilarious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why isn't everyone watching this show?!!!","review":"I became a fan of Scrubs halfway through the first season. The show is amazing. Everything is beautifully acted, written, and directed. It's not only a show about people learning to be doctors but also about coming of age. There are episodes where I am laughing so hard I'm crying and even a couple where I'm crying because I'm just plain touched."},{"rating":"2","title":"best medical show ever","review":"As a graduating resident physician, I must say that this show really captures what it's like to go through residency. And many of my colleagues agree that for being as strange and silly as it is, _Scrubs_ is in many ways the most realistic show about medicine that we have ever seen.Aside from our perspective, this program is utterly hilarious. The characters are all well-developed, and all of them have the opportunity to shine. The chemistry between the actors/characters is quite obviously there, and you will easily become drawn into the stories.Even after four years, the poignant, somewhat didactic wrap-ups to each episode have gotten neither old nor trite. I always catch myself smiling and nodding at the end of each episode.Long live this unrecognized beauty of a series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FINALLY!!!","review":"I have been waiting for the past couple of years for Scrubs to come out on DVD. I missed much of the first season, but fell in love with it during the second and the following seasons. After seeing so many crappy sitcoms on network television, I look forward to plopping in front on the TV on Tuesdays and knowing I'm going to get a good laugh. This show is so smart and thoughtful. The characters are well-developed and it doesn't condescend to its audience. If only the execs at NBC would quit trying to tank the show. It so rightly deserved its place on must-see Thursdays last season. It could have been the next \\"Friends\\" or \\"Seinfeld\\". Instead, NBC switched it to make room for poor reality TV. I have made it a mission to get anyone I know who hasn't seen this quirky, intelligent comedy to watch. This program and \\"Arrested Development\\" are the last hope for smart and sharp TV comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series!","review":"This was a great season. However the later seasons like the 5'th and sixth season in my opinion are better than the first. However the first season I would still give 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alright","review":"The case was pretty scratched up and the DVD's are very scratched. I've only watched 1 DVD and it worked alright but the other 2 disc's are worse off but I haven't watched those as of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scrubalicious","review":"I think this is the BEST t.v. series ever!!!! I have bought all of the Seasons and they just get better and better. And thats ironic because I had never seen the show until recently when my Mom was watching it with my daughter. I always thought it was something like E.R. never really knowing all the humor it had. The Cast and Crew are amazing and have such a great chemistry. If you buy this you will become addicted. I'm a Scrubbie for life. I will always come back to Amazon, they are really great at sending stuff really quick, and for free too if you dont mind waiting a couple extra days."},{"rating":"2","title":"After 4 longs seasons.......","review":"Scrubs is a medical comedy, somehwat of a parady of E.R. The show successfully places comedy into one of the worlds most serious professions, and in the process creates one of the most underated tv shows to hit the air. Nominated for several awards, including Golden Globes and Emmy's, it's about time NBC allowed the DVD to come out."},{"rating":"2","title":"SCRUBS - season 1","review":"I watch these episodes when there's nothing on television - which is quite often. Even though I practically know them all by heart, I still laugh at least once during every episode. I can't wait for the second season to go on sale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scrubs is Braf-tastic!","review":"What an awesome show. I've never bought DVDs of any other TV show, but this is a must-have for every season. Love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The DVD brought me to the series!","review":"I started watching the show when I got this DVD set for my birthday. I have to say that I love it, I am now a weekly watcher and I can't wait till the second season's DVD comes out. I recommend the series to all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"This is a fabulous first season collection from this WONDERFUL show! I had started watching scrubs during part of the second season, so it was nice to see how the show began. This is one of the best shows on television!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken and melting","review":"The package arrived in a ripped envelope.I had hoped to use for part of wedding favors. They arrived broken and melted.You would think they would know how to package."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great Latin American big band","review":"Somewhere along the tracks of Ray Anthony, Glenn Miller and even Billy May, the sound of Luis Arcaraz emerges as good as theirs but also as personal and unique. This splendid band whose original recordings are so well captured in the present collection, representative of the late 50's and early 60's music, is a must for those of us who enjoyed that epoch and for those who love and admire their magic melodies and rhythms. Arcaraz is able to produce a perfect homage to Glenn Miller in sound and brilliance, but not a single American band could do the same for Luis: They would lack his Latin touch, his crooner voice and the inspiration that gave us songs as Viajera (Traveler) or Munequita de Squire (Squire Little Doll). If you like big band sound, Latin American music or both, this album is perfect. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"In times like these.","review":"Arlo did well with a full orchestra behind him. Not to exciting though, he hasn't written anything new since the 80's. My wife enjoyed it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it promises . . . well.","review":"The RH200 is really well made. Steel with a cool black crinkle finish and comfortable grips. It comes with a wrench in a convenient storage pocketfor changing heads. It doesn't say in the description, but it can rivet with both aluminum and steel pop rivets. Arrow sells both. Be careful because a few of Arrow's stainless steel rivets are not intended for manual riveters. I have only used aluminum 5/32 x 1/4\\" so far, but I like the way the tool cuts the stem off cleanly. An added bonus: This product also appears to be made in the USA. The package is reusable if you want for storing the RH200 to hang on a hook. Overall, I think it's a great tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plotino and philosophy as a spiritual discipline","review":"Pierre Hadot, who has insisted in classical philosophy being mor a spiritual discipline than a doctrinal body, offers a wonderfully suggestive and loving introduction to Plotino's thougt. A must read"},{"rating":"2","title":"Light","review":"Another fine Hadot book, this one more or less his specialization. It is a lyrical summary of Plotinus. If you want a detailed history or philosophical analysis, other books are perhaps worthier (Rist, Gerson, for example); but for a feel of what made Plotinus so influential, this is lovely and easy to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average and Inch only","review":"I had foolishly not considered that a US made rule would only have inch measures. I'm used to both inch and metric, I use both.The rule flexes, but does not flex back flat. It arrived flexed ... bit dissapointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty decent book.","review":"I bought this book as an idiom review and I do like the way it is structured. There are enough exercises to reinforce the message without it becoming exhaustive and each chapter varies from the last. The puzzles and word games are a nice addition. One thing I find distracting, however, is the phonetic spelling that attempts to get people to pronounce things the way they would be heard by a native speaker. The idea behind this is sound, but, in any language, correct diction is always the best way to make oneself understood if a non-native speaker is communicating with a native. If you spend any length of time in France, the local diction will automatically become a part of your manner of speaking. In trying to force this you risk phonetic errors that make you sound like an amateur."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short stories not Agatha Christie's forte","review":"Murder in the Mews is made up of three mystery short stories. The first is \\"ok\\"; the second is really lame. The third I didn't finish, due to the fact that the disc was badly scratched (I got this from the library). Usually when that happens, I will repair the disc so as to continue; however, based upon the lackluster quality of these stories, and the lackluster quality of another collection of Agatha Christie's short stories that I listened to, I figured that the third story would not be worth the effort of repairing the disc.I suppose that mystery short stories are a difficult form to write; at any rate, even the masterful Agatha Christie could not master them."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"This package has everything and a hot tub.

The pictures are good, giving the reader a visual for what is being explained. The book is dated, but I have not found anything to compare it too. It is a great resource for anyone looking to get into inline or ice skating. I use the drills frequently to improve my form."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inline Speed Skating","review":"From the background I had during my competitive years in the sport of inline speedskating, I believe the book is a complete and technical guide to the basic terminology, strategy, and mechanics that are involved with speedskating; both on ice and inline skates. There is heavy usage on photographs to show you the correct way to skate to reach your potential but to achieve what is seen in the picture typically takes years of training with coaches to show you the ways to train your body to achieve the form and stride of an effecient inline skater.I also believe that some of the material is dated regarding the current face of the sport but the book is a staple in the sport and is a worthy look for outsiders and internally at the facets of the sport of inline and ice speedskating. For anyone interested in speedskating either on ice skates or inline skates, this book is the most comprehensive guide from a champion speedskater that covers most facets of the sport."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helped me speed up on my own","review":"This book is like a personal trainer for inline (roller skating). I started reading this book in July 2006 and by August 2006 I was so much faster in inline skating. This is from someone who has never taken any lessons and started to skate on his own. I did the Northshore Inline (Duluth) half marathon later in Sept 2006 in 1 hour 6 mts (pretty impressive by my own standards). I keep referrring to it once in a while to keep up my training and speed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Introduction through comprehensive reference","review":"I don't do any inline racing, and only got this book to help with my ice speedskating. While the book covers both, it very clearly delineates the technique and position differences between the two. A tremendous effort is put into covering biomechanics - not only where each body part is supposed to be at each stage of the stroke, but also the most common reasons for a specific misalignments.The drills are straightforward and build step by step. They take you all the way from gliding with feet parallel in basic position, to a full push and recovery stroke. Don't expect to get the book and start flying around the track or down the road. The emphasis is on building fundamentals, one skill on top of the other, with a lot of hard work.Bottom line, this is the single best book on speedskating technique that I have read."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best blend of afro-cuban, highlife, reggae, soukous","review":"I enjoyed this album tremendously.

Every song is good, catchy, and have great lyrics and stucture. After hearing \\"Room's Too Cold\\", their debut LP, I was extremely disappointed. With the exception of track 4, and sometimes 2 and 3 (depending on what mood I am in) the songs on this record aren't even worth listening to all the way through. Dont get me wrong, this cd isnt horrible (not to be confused with Courtney Love's record), but it isnt good. It is trapped somewhere in the middle in an area I like to call \\"bland.\\" If you really want to know what Early November is capable of, pick up their EP, \\"For all of this\\" and forget that they even have an LP."},{"rating":"2","title":"let's not kid ourselves. it's basically today's emo.","review":"c'mon. let's be honest. it is what it is. but it also is the first \\"modern\\"(?) emo band that i have ever truly loved. it's emotionally charged full and luscious emo music like i've never heard from anyone else. they obviously take their cue from earlier emo-before-it-was-emo bands like mock orange and sunny day real estate. they even took the piano part from sunny day real estate's song \\"Pheurton Skeurto\\" and threw it in somewhere as a between track filler as well as give a shout out to the get up kids.the best tracks for me are \\"baby blue\\" and \\"exchanging two hundred\\" which are fantastically powerful and moving.if you like emo or whatever the hell you want to call it. or if you're into anything that's pretty good. check these guys out. also do yourself a favor and check out the guy's other project I Can Make A Mess Like Nobody's Business."},{"rating":"2","title":"Room's Too Cold is amazing!","review":"This cd is amazing!!! i listen to it constantly and it never gets old. theres a song for every kind of mood your in and everyone will love it! i highly reccommend it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An \\"Ever So Sweet\\" Album","review":"I would give it 4.5 stars if I could. It's not one of my favorite CDs, which is why I didn't give it 5 stars. But still, some of my favorite songs are on this CD. After I heard a few songs from their EP, I knew I had to get \\"The Room's Too Cold\\".The first two songs, \\"Ever So Sweet\\" and \\"Something That Produces Results\\" are my favorites from the CD. The lead singer's voice reminds me of Taking Back Sunday or The Starting Line, and the lyrics of the songs really hit home. This is a good CD for anyone who likes emo, punk, or rock music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Without A doubt........This is the Best Cd Ever.","review":"The Early Novembers latest album \\"The Room's Too Cold\\" is definately worth checking out.

The problem with this album is that i have heard it done (and done well) by the afforementioned artists, this album would have been okay in 95' when the midwestern 'emo' wave was at it/s peak, but to release this now is just a disgrace.The band is definatly talented, both musically and lyrically, but it/s just very boring stuff, go out and buy a boy/s life or christie front drive record if you want 'emo', what kind of musical era are we in when bands are quoting The Get Up Kids in their songs (see Baby Blue \\"I don/t want you to love me anymore); it/s just sad really.Do yourself a favor, stop listening to all the bands you see in the 'similar artists' section, and go buy yourself a Rites of Spring or Embrace record, at least if you/re going to listen to whinny crap, it will be stuff that can actually pass for 'emo'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be better","review":"Well another failure for Drive-Thru Records. Can they bring any more? This album had mediocre lyrics with yet ANOTHER punk voice that sounds like a 13 yr old. If you took 98% of the bands on this record label and played each of their voices back to back I think you will think they all sound the same, which they do. I guess now thats the popular thing to do, instead of imitating Pearl Jam, now every band wants to sound like pop punk.

Their cd \\"For All of This\\" was very, very good. But for some reason I'm more drawn to this cd. I'm a sucker for heartfelt songs and breath-taking lyrics, and this is what \\"Rooms Too Cold\\" has to offer to everyone. If you're going to get one of their albums, check this one out first. The cd starts off with \\"Ever so Sweet\\" which drew me into the band completely, and ends with \\"Everything's too cold...but you're so hot.\\" From start to finish you'll be completely captivated into the lyrics, placing yourself in the position of being a hopeless romantic, heartbroken, or crying to yourself because you know EXACTLY what theyre talking about in each song. Definetly the cd for somebody who knows what love is really all about. So take my word for it, and go out and buy this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderfully produced","review":"I don't really know if i think this band is exceedigly good, but, i love this album and the singer has a very good voice. tracks 2,3,4 are incredible and will make you love the album instantaneously and the rest of the album maintains. so, it is a good chlled out rockin emo album."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 1/2","review":"This cd is good...but there's some intentional flaws that just shouldn't happen. First off, I'm sorry, but this guys vocals are terrible. He needs to do more than one cut, and even though I don't like them, put some harmonized vocals behind him, like in FAOT. However, the songs are great, besides number 1. Number 6, 8, and 10 are stand-out tracks to me. I'm not saying this is a bad cd, but I feel they kind of went backwards from FAOT. Good job though, and try to focus on the faster side."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ditto Below","review":"Can't do a better job than the review below which was superb and I agree with the 4 out of 5 stars.It is a very good album just not quite a classic of this genre and I'm a bit Beatles phobic as well. I bought this album on the strength of the previous review and the fact that I had \\"Maryanne Lightly\\" on one of Little Steven's \\"Coolest Songs in the World\\" Compilations. Very interesting to note what extra money at recording time can do as the compilation version is far superior, louder and crunchier than the version on this album. Perhaps the band re-recorded the song for Wicked Cool Records and if that is the case it should be interesting to hear what the next record sounds like."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll be swept away . . .","review":"I thoroughly enjoy playing this game over and over. Picking out the various shells and other ocean items is challenging, especially when trying to beat the time before the next wave comes in. Lots of additional bonuses to help you find the shells makes the game less tedious to play. Seeing the special effects of the waves coming in along with the sound is practically realistic. It has a great story line and one can look forward to moving from one island beach to the next. I enjoyed finding the pieces to \\"building\\" the statues and then figuring out a puzzle to move on to the next beach. You have to pick out shells from the pictures, silhouettes and question marks the game gives you to make points and move on in the game. The only part I didn't like was the very end of the story. That's why I gave this game an overall score of 4 stars. Without giving away the ending--because the game is just a delight to play over and over--I wish it would have been more creative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mystery Of Shark Island","review":"Did not care too much for this game.

This stapler reaches places hammer-and-hard-staple cannot, although sometimes you just have to resort to screwing in a UF strap, if the clearance is too small for either.Up there with the Klein 14/2 // 12/2 NM-B jacket stripping wire strippers, I rank this among the indispensable hand-tools of the residential electrician."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for a few staples","review":"I bought this product because I needed to do a low voltage lighting job in trees, The product arrived quick so I very happy about that.

The idea is you hook the bar under a closed door then do sit-ups/crunches...the problem is that the nylon strap doesn't actually hold your feet down. I wanted a product that would hold my feet down and allow me to use it in the middle of the room. Negative on both accounts. You need a good sturdy door to implement this product, and then it still doesn't truly hold your feet down.Looks like I'll break down and buy one of the bars that actually clamps to the bottom of a door to hold your feet down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Knew?","review":"When I ordered this I thought all harmonica performances were alike.

But it wa so carefully edited you started feeling that no one, and I mean no one, can be that bad. Also, I got a distinct feeling that too many of Bush's speeches were taken out of context in an attempt to ridicule him.I was also slighlty disturbed by some images shown in this movie. I have major problems with anyone using human pain to further his own cause, something that was done repeatedly and effectively in this movie. For instance, the images frm 9/11 were meant to channel your anger towards a carefully presented target-Bush.This is an imformative movie, so long as you think for youurself and realize that this is just about as biased as it gets."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Unbiased\\"","review":"A documentary should be an unbiased FULL look at the truth.

And for the people that say, don't believe what you see on this movie, well, Michael Moore doesn't use special effects. The footage of Bush IS actual footage. This may be propaganda but it is also and eye opener for the public, as to say that not everything is hunky-dory behind the scenes. There are things that are happening that you don't know about, and Michael Moore at least tries to make people see that. You don't have to agree with it, but there does need to be more awarness of what is actually happening with everyone on this planet. You may think that it doesn't affect you, but when Billions of dollars(your money) are going towards things that you might not even know about, then there is a problem.

This movie was MADE to polarise the nation even more- makes Bush haters more hateful and thereby making Bush lovers love him more. I mean, if so many people who were actually interviewed by him feel betrayed by his fat ass because he twisted what they said, I think that speaks for itself. He's a liar. He's fat. And c'mon- he looks like the geek from High school that everyone beat on- and now he's getting his laughs because a lot of people believe his $20 pack of lies.If you buy this movie do yourself a favor and buy FarenHYPE 9/11 as well because then you will probably be more on the right track, since both movies are to the extremes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scandalous","review":"Michael Moore should join the Army and go to jump school, like i did.

He has a good eye for drama, and that must be commended. However, one must remember that this film is drama, not a documentary. It is filled with misrepresentations, and outright lies. Moore frequently takes words out of context to promote his cause: deframing the President.If you are really compelled to find out the actual facts, please check out David Kopel's, a lifelong Democrat, website which chronicles the inaccuracies in Moore's film. www.davekopel.com as this will present to you the deceits in \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\".

However, Hussein baited us by deliberately withholding materials and not allowing UN inspectors to do what he promised they would be allowed to do.

F9/11 was a refreshing film that finally gave a voice to the people who have been seeing through these lies for years now.

Whereas any chief executive I would be willing to vote for would leap to the aid of a city under attack, Moore shows that Bush nervously sat by, perhaps wondering whether his connections to the Bin Laden family would come to light.With this film, they have. Whether it is Halliburton, Enron, or Unocal, Bush seems to have a hand in every company that becomes famous for malfeasance.The film was particularly effective in showing the lack of a connection between the September 11 hijackers and Iraq. It was continually surprising how Moore used the film medium to portray underlying truths that are so easily lost in a haze of jingoisting reporting and isolated bits of information.This movie is a triumph, and it seems to open new avenues of creative and journalistic expression for filmmakers."},{"rating":"1","title":"garbage","review":"What a load of crap.

Interesting.Speaking of elections, my favorite part of this entire film was watching Vice President Al Gore telling the mostly black congresswomen protesting the election certification to sit down and shut-up unless they could get at least one Democratic Senator to agree with their protest. They couldn't. Gore seems almost contemptuous of their efforts to keep his presidential bid alive. He looks almost embarrassed.

For example you don't see Moore talking about how the pentagon was hit by something other than a plane and how the WTC and Oaklahoma buildings had more to their demolitions than the public is aware of. Those are the things that really matter.When Moore was asked by Alex Jones himself why he does not talk about any of the new worlder order issues, Moore said \\"it's unAmerican\\".

Finally end with some statistics showing that the German economy recovered dramatically during Hitler's rule.

It isn't against Michael Moore's constitutional rights to release such crap, but if any voters base their opinions off of such a movie, then America is in for a whole lot of trouble.

In the feel good atmosphere of the post-911 days, when everyone was an American it was the responsibility of the media to go beyond the ribbons, flags, pomp, and circumstance, and report the news.

As he did in a similar scenario in F 9/11's predecessor, Bowling for Columbine, Michael Moore attempts to pin the blame for the terrorist attacks on the WTC and Pentagon on everybody from President Bush to VP Dick Cheney and Halliburton through slickly edited interviews with people who lost loved loved ones in the 9/11 attacks and the war on terror in Iraq, as well as folks who just plain don't like Bush.Like a poor marksman, however, Moore keeps missing the real target he should be blaming: al Qaeda and other terrorist groups, as well as those in our own government who did not pass along the information alerting the President to this situation. THEY are the ones that should be blamed for 9/11, and yet Moore points the finger at the Bush administration, judging them for all the evil in the world.Nice try, Moore, but I'm not buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Masterpiece of Propaganda","review":"Michael Moore has elevated himself to the league of rarified propagandists, most notably Leni Riefenstahl (who tried to convince us that Adolf Hitler and the Nazi Party were the good guys). Moore has no use for the truth. He cobbles together unrelated sound bites to \\"prove\\" his viewpoint. Like most rich liberals, he doesn't allow the facts to interfere with his perceptions. In short, don't waste your time with this film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fair and balanced","review":"What I appreciated most about the documentary was its fairness, the fact that it presented both sides, and gave the conservative side all the representation it deserved. It was made in a very fair and balanced way. How shameful that even with this very balanced, unbiased approach, Bush and the Repugs came out looking so awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye Opening","review":"This brought a few heavy issues of the current administration and the current war and reasons for being there to the forefront.A few times I was shocked and even brought to near tears. The movie stayed with me for a long time afterwards, and I think everyone should see it to draw their own conclusions and opinions - certainly not have an opinion without seeing it - that just does not make sense. It is important to not let others form your opinion for you, form your own and see the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST SEE FOR EVERY AMERICAN","review":"Powerful and full of facts, this is a movie that every american should take the time out and see, no matter what side you're on.

Thanks to Michael Moore for such a brillant film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Let's wait and see","review":"It is very strange to witness the vitriol and condemnation against this film leveled by people who have not seen it, and proudly declare that they have no intention of seeing it. No contrary notions will mess with my concrete mindset!! One astute fellow even insists that this movie has no validity due to the fact that it was made by someone who was born in Canada. This is odd for two reasons: Moore was born in, and continues to reside in, USA, and the idea that any but homegrown perspectives should be ignored leads to insular idioicy. People who believe that blind acceptance of national policy equals patriotism are doing their best to wreck democracy, as democracy cannot function without open discussion and dissent. I challenge all members of the paranoid right to view the film, and perhaps think about it for five minutes or so, before offering their opinions of it. I'll do the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"A True American Film","review":"This thought provoking film should be required viewing for all Americans. It's factual and shocking.

Michael Moore does this in spades!He uses some facts and then turns them around for entertainment...not truth.An excellent DVD, if you've seen this picture, is \\"Fahrenhype 911\\". At least you will get more honest facts and not have them turned in a certain way to exploit your way of thinking with any regard for what's the truth.Michael Moore has a political agenda and he uses it to slant this film.If a film crew were to follow him around with their own agenda, they could make Michael out to be a right wing anorexic, with traditional values (using Michael Moores style of journalism)!If you look at this film for entertainment only...then it has some humorous moments and some shocking moments that could entertain...but that was not the goal of this film project and that is why this reviewer gives it one star at best!"},{"rating":"1","title":"How can we begin to believe those who exaggerate?","review":"Actual footage rearranged in a way that deviates from a real timeline.

Anyway, if U are a liberal or mindless, & want to blame Pres Bush for everything in the world that has gone wrong, this might be enjoyable for U?

This so-called documentary is a bag of lies that offers even fans of the X-files a conspiracy plot that is unconceivable. Moore should live with his US hating friends in Canada instead of benefiting in this country with your dollars supporting his dung."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Shots!!","review":"Moore has taken a lot of footage out of context and drawn some mighty conclusions based on scant and questionable input to make this movie. I highly recommend the rebuttal 'FarenHYPE 911' if you want to see why. The latter accuses Moore, and rightly so I believe, of purposely distorting the facts to make his own personal political statements.His extensive footage of grieving 911 families and Gulf War amputees as pawns for his political agenda was tasteless; nobody needs to be reminded of how horrific terrorism and war is. It was the cheapest of shots, but not the only cheap shot he took in the film; the film was loaded with them.Moore definately fails my would-you-buy-a-used-car-from-this-man test."},{"rating":"1","title":"A NO CLASS LIBERALISM PRESENTED BY A NO CLASS Individual.","review":"Blame everything mentality portrayed in a politically motivated propaganda. Moore tried to redeem himself to no avail to people who understand the true meaning of FREEDOM and RIGHT TO PROTECT IT when he publicly critisized President Bush on the Academy awards which is an ultimate show of disrespect to everybody that has lost their loved one fighting for our way of life."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Waste of time!!!","review":"A total waste of time and money. This movie is completely false and unsupported. Just him and his cronies views and no one else. The media, Hollywood and his views and antics are so far left, that as a Firefighter in the NYC area, I'm ashamed to call him a citizen! He should be referred to as Comrade. And now he's going after big business with his new movie. Hummm... I wonder if he'll disclose how much money he has made so far? I guess it's ok to go after capitalism, as long as you don't look at him and his cronies in Hollywood!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a documentary","review":"Michael Moore released this film to make more money for himself. If you want to see the truth, watch Celcius 41.11, which is available for free. If Michael Moore was truly just trying to get his message out, why do you have to pay for it? I watched Celcius 41.11 and the videos by the Swift Boat veterans because they were available for no cost. They also told the truth. Cable news is the only way to go. Shame on CBS and people like Michael Moore that distort the truth for their own selfish gains. I have not watched this movie because I will not pay to watch it and have Michael Moore profit from it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie, but get Both Sides of the Story","review":"Michael Moore always has a witty way to approach things such as his ice cream truck stunt (where he reads the PATRIOT act to congress through an ice cream truck's speakers because they didnt read it). It really get's you thinkin' which is good today because it seems that there is so much dribble on TV and in the movies, but his fight is very one-sided.I suggest that anyone, be you Republican, Democrat or Green, that see's this movie also read what the Republican-Conservative enemy has to say as well. Slander-By Ann Coulter is a pretty fierce Conservative book that combats many of the things people like Al Franken and Michael Moore say. Just do your own research as well as watch this movie and develop you own opinion to the topics it brings up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quit cryin you brainwashed conservatives...","review":"The only thing funnier about these \\"one star, I wish I could have given it no stars\\" reviews than the personal attacks on Michael Moore (Michael Moore is so fat...etc) is the number of typos.

Luckily, I never spent a dime to watch this movie; I went to the cinema, paid for a different movie, but walked into the one showing this movie, and only because so many Bush-haters talked about it. It really is a movie for people who hate Bush [...], people who want to believe (regardless of facts) all of Bush's doings being wrong. Apparently, the movie did not help Kerry win the election. Fortunately, many Americans realized what Bush is doing, is right. I am a Democrat, but after 9/11 I voted for Bush. If you like to watch a really good DVD, have a look at FahrenHYPE 9/11, the movie shows all the lies of Michael Moore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a documentary, too much bias obviously","review":"This is just a film by Michael Moore in what appears to be a vendetta against George W Bush. It is interesting to watch \\"Fahrenhype 9/11\\" after watching this movie. Why does Moore have a section about the Oregon State Police when it is funded by Oregon State and not the federal government? The most appalling thing about this obvious piece of propaganda is that Moore claims he is behind and supports the soldiers in Iraq %100. Why is there not one positive image of a soldier throughout the entire film? He depicts them as uneducated, brutal savages for his own gain."},{"rating":"1","title":"From Barnum to Moore to 100 million suckers . . .","review":"If a documentary can be judged by any journalistic standards of accuracy and integrity, this one fails miserably.

The information given within this film is very onesided and biased. It is also just a little piece of the whole story. If you believe everything you see in the news, in print and in movies, such as this one, you are very poorly informed. If you are really interested, look into things more deeply and find the pieces of information that are true while throwing the rest out. Most of this film could just be thrown out. I see the things that have happened, and are happing, over here on a daily basis for the past 3 years and things are just not as the media and Michael Moore show. In the end it is all about making money and controversy is one of the easiest ways to do this. In this point, Michael Moore did a great job, he made a lot of money using complete fallacy and personal bias."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please understand...","review":"...this is FICTION. Or at very least, it is a distortion of fact. Mr. Moore artfully splices together scenes and sound bites that do not belong together.

Bush, I'd sue Michael Moore for all the lies he told in that movie. In fact I demanded a refund at the movie theatre & they gave it to me because they were ashamed to even show that movie! Actually, that movie HURT Senator Kerry. I was going to vote for Kerry, just because I was disappointed in one thing that Pres.Bush did...which was forming the extra cabinet position for Homeland Security. The FBI could've been expanded to cover Homeland Security without enlarging our gov't & without adding bureaucracies. Now, of course, I'll definitely vote for Pres.

If you're a liberal you'll love it. If you're a conservative you'll hate it. If you don't care about politics, you'll probably be bored.You did know that the whole purpose of this film was to convince you to vote Kerry, right?

He manipulated the film shot there of actual war casualties who had body parts amputated to make it seem that they were against the war. In several interviews post Farenheit 9/11's debut these people in Walter Reed have been disgusted that they were used by Moore to further his own propaganda when they were proud of what they had accomplished over there and would have done it again.

Hell, I could use the same methods as Moore and make a documentary with film clips, and interviews, and make Adolf Hitler look like a philanthropist deserving the Nobel Peace Prize. Show the good and edit out the bad, or in Moore's case, make it look bad, and edit out the good.This fillm is not a true and fair representation of the Bush administration. That is what is polarizing this country, the half truths, and down right lies that are put forth as fact.Maybe the terrorists of 9/11 have already won.

Think vertical, think of the rich getting richer and the poor getting poorer, and the truth of what the government, and its fourth branch, the media, is telling you. We are deciding between to candidates for President that are both skull and bones members, and from very wealthy families.

It implies that there were only pathetically small non-US armies involved. With Britain and several smaller countries who do have army, navy and airforce, such as my own, Australia, I think you'll find that Bush did manage to drag together something resembling a coalition to share the blame.Otherwise it was a very moving film, even to someone who has heard most of the facts before. Seeing the families involved in the army speaking made me realise what it is sometimes easy to forget when you live outside of the US - most Americans aren't morons, some just seem to be being misled by all the Newspeak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie Sucked","review":"Saw it and wsa exactly what I thought it would be...

What Moore has done is taken bits and pieces of creditable news and chopped it down into very small pieces and tainted it. For example, during one point of the movie Bush is talking about how he doesn't think about \\"him,\\" very often. Moore implies that this is Osama BinLaden but, Bush never states that this is who he is talking about or implies it. Moore has created a movie that is very similiar to the type of propaganda the Soviet's used in their own country, or even the propaganda in Nazi Germany. This movie is filled with clips to stir emotions. He uses these emotions to try to lead one to a conclusion that has no fact. This movie is just meant to misinform Americans who do not keep themselves informed on a regular basis. Moore has created one of the greatest pieces of propaganda in Soviet history. Don't watch this movie, unless you want to waste two hours of your time on junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Propaganda","review":"This movie is not a documentary it is a piece of propanda.

He is perpetuating a deception on the American people through this movie. His distoraiton and outright lies of facts is deplorable. At a time when America is fighting for its survival as a free society, this movie is a serious disservice. For an honest appraisal read FARENHYPE9/11 or see the DVD by the same title. The light of truth always causes the lies to fall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"More lies, half-truths, and distortions from dysnfunctional, delusional sleazebag Michael Moore, and the gullible fools like the \\"Amazon.com reviewer\\" and most of the people (if that's the word for them) posting at these boards lap it up like mindless doggies. It's positively frightening to know that people like you actually get to vote, and will do it believing what Moore says about President Bush is true. If John Kerry, i.e. The Mortician, is elected, this country will look back on the Jimmy Carter era with nostalgia. You're a bunch of damn zombies. If Bush were the man Moore portrays in this amateurish piece of filth, Moore would have been shipped off to Bagdhad where he'd be beheaded. Then again, why behead a man whose head is useless, anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"High-Schoolish Fat-Ass Hypocrite Fundy-Thumps with a home video","review":"Moore makes only three points that I could ferret out of this homemade video: Bush's cousin was the decision-maker at Fox News for calling the winner in Florida, the Florida Secretary of State had connections to the voting machine company of that state, and politicians are unwilling to have their own kids fight in our wars.After those three points, the film digresses into a pity party for people with kids in the war, as if this was some kind of war crime, and why we just never would think they were supposed to be in a dangerous situation. After all, they're only in the armed forces, etc.So after reading Peter Schweizer's \\"Do As I Say (Not As I Do)\\" after seeing this sorry video, I invested in 1000 shares of Halliburton (just like Michael Moore did, only he purchased more shares), and went straight to the bar to hustle some liberals' daughters, all in the name of the left's Precious Relativism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop the propoganda.","review":"When are people going to get that you can edit things to make innuendos and appearances of impropriety's no matter which side of the fence you are on.

People on both sides of the fence do not practice what they preach. And I hope that the sheeple of this country one day will open their eyes and see how messed up this country is. But everyone keeps living in their little fantasy world instead of educating themselves. Whether you are left or right, don't waste your time with this garbage.

Many citizens of this country have become extremely complacent, allowing our government and the media to feed us our thoughts and needs.

Remember Forrest Gump's line about a box of chocolates? Presidential candidates are the same. If the movie only contains 10% of truth it's quite an indictment on the Bush Administration. Certainly the parts of the film that don't lie are clips of Bush himself. I always had the uneasy feeling that he was a person in over his head. The film obviously strikes a chord with the American people. If the chord didn't exist there wouldn't be any hype or controversy over this movie. There wouldn't be this movie.

I don't know how much validity to give to Moore's claims of Saudi connections to the Bushes, but it makes for a compelling conspiracy film.

Neither of these men are big Bush lovers.I spent the subsequent week researching their claims, and find their info to be much more accurate. Despite being more politically aligned with Mr. Moore than his detractors, I now believe that he purposely misled his audience in several sections of the movie.Deception is not an effective way to win people to our point of view, and despite Mr. Moore's success as a filmmaker, I don't think he is doing any good for the cause."},{"rating":"2","title":"profound","review":"I think every person in America should see this movie.

If you want to watch a bunch of half-truths, lies, and distortions, be my guest. A documentary is supposed to be based on facts. Michael Moore goes around the world spreading Anti-American sentiment and gets paid millions. What a creep!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Incapable of reason? Thinking hurts? Then this movie is for you!","review":"Moore's leaps of logic, blatant bias, deceptive/immoral business practices, gluttony, and most of all his blinding hypocrisy are all embraced by his devotees who undoubtably exhibit such traits themselves. If only it were possible that all who enjoyed this movie could have moved to peaceful, pre-war Iraq and happily communed together over there."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Fraud about Moore's Fraud","review":"The People's Choice Awards were this past week and, somehow, FAHRENHEIT 9/11 \\"won\\" an award for Favorite Film or something.One question: how could the 16th highest-grossing film of 2004 get voted as the best film of the year?(News stories abound about how this is the first year that voting for these awards was changed to Internet voting, a system obviously rife with corruption).Even the people I know who rabidly defended this thoroughly-discredited \\"documentary\\" have turned squeamish about Moore's obnoxious methods and arrogant attitude.You'd have to go back to Nazi Germany to find an equal when it comes to propaganda."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every redblood Neo-Nazi American \\"Ostrich\\" should be afraid!","review":"This is by far the best documentary on ANY subject that I have ever seen. It points out, not only the corruption, but the utter STUPIDITY of the Bush Administration and those who support them (Like those who have written negative reviews!). If anyone had any doubts of, or were looking for a definite reason as to why, they should leave this hypocrital country (As I will be) then this would be it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Documentary? NOT...Not even.","review":"If you see this film and feel you have been enlightened, you will feel even more enlightened after viewing the documentary Fahrenhype 911. The comments made in Fahrenhype by people who were included in Fahrenheit are especially powerful, particularly soldiers and their families. To see one film and not both is to be grossly misinformed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Using people's grief to make a movie","review":"I'm against the Iraq war as Michael Moore obviously is. However, I object to his using people's grief for its shock value. Doesn't he have any shame? I couldn't believe the way he exploited the poor woman who had lost her son. By the way, this doesn't even deserve one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"false editing","review":"We really liked \\"bowling for columbine\\", My husband and I watched this and were soooooo drawn in .......then right after we watched another docu. called FAREN\\"HYPE\\" 911. in which almost everyone from the original M. Moore film were interviewed. Most were angered by how their comments were edited and put in this film. I was blown away by how many of those interviewed were misrepresented in this film. Leading me to believe if Moore chip chopped and edited their interviews to suit his own viewpoint, how much else of the film was actually true? I am sure a lot but now I do not trust him and I am certainly second guessing the info he provided in B-F-COLUMBINE. SEE BOTH FILMS JUDGE FOR YOURSELF"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just adding my 5 stars","review":"I love how this movie gets either 5 or 1 star reviews. Sign of the times, I guess. Personally, I loved it. Will you like it? I have no idea. Just watch the movie and make up your own mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Call It Like It Is","review":"For this to be deemed a \\"documentary\\" is an absolute joke. It is a blending of fact, fiction, half-truths, and one-man's opinion. If Moore were any more desperate for the attention he is so clearly seeking, he'd strap a webcam on the bill of his cap and webcast himself ranting 24-7. Just because someone says it doesn't mean it's so, and this movie is no exception. If Moore told you that the gravel in his front yard was actually moon rocks, would you believe him? Based on box office figures, I hate to say that it looks like plenty of you would. Wake up, sheep. The mainstream media may not be telling the whole truth, the White House may not be telling the whole truth, but this blowhard sure isn't doing it either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage, senseless garbage","review":"Anybody who actually wastes their time seeing this film should realize after watching it just how stupid and petty it really is. I am sorry that Michael Moore calls himself an American. He is a bon-bon eating bleeding heart liberal who needs to wake up and shut up. It is interesting how much Moore wants to get the \\"facts\\" to the American people right before Election Day. The documentary is just as the filmmaker is, garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bias attempting to pass itself off as documentary","review":"While I can tolerate that Michael Moore has to right to express his opinion, I find it incredibly unethical for him to call this film a documentary. A documentary is typically made to be as objective as possible. In particular, you would not find many honest filmmakers intentionally including misleading films clips in a documentary. The only thing Moore documents is how fanatical he and others are with their hatred of Bush and his administration. Their treatment of this medium says more about them than it does about the president."},{"rating":"1","title":"A fictional movie ment to look like a documentry...","review":"If you want the hard facts, do yourself a favor and watch fahrenHYPE9/11. Some of Moore's conspiracies are just outragous."},{"rating":"1","title":"Manipulating Jerk","review":"This movie is a load of crap. All he does is distort the truth, and edits the movie to make it seem bad when it really isn't. For example when President Bush is playing golf and he says \\"We're going to get these terroists, now watch me hit this ball\\" Their is 19 minutes of him talking about other stuff between \\"We're going to get these terroists\\" and \\"Now watch me hit this ball\\". Oh the magic of editing. Don't give this lying fat piece of lard your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a joke","review":"This tripe is supposed to sway people's opinions? Right.

Otherwise save your $$."},{"rating":"1","title":"this film helped me vote for the right guy","review":"I was going to vote for John Kerry until about 2 months before the presidential election. After putting it off for some time, I finally watched this film and was disgusted by how contrived it is. Bowling for Columbine is interesting except for the parts where he uses fake camera angles and all. This is just a big pack of one-sided distortions. Like I said, I was all for Kerry, but it was a bunch of little things like the Michael Moores and all the other libs going nuts and pumping lies into the tv that really turned me off. I look forward to his next film. It'll push me to vote republican again probably."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even worth one star","review":"I saw this highly overrated piece of excrement the first week it came out. I truly wanted to see what all the hype was about and base an honest opinion on it. Now you know. The only credit I'll give big Mike is that he's good at editing and juxtaposing stock footage and narrating his viewpoint over it. That's so he can basically sell to the woefully uninformed masses his woefully ignorant and amateurish observations on what he perceives as the truth. He's the definition of a hypocrite and ignorant fool rolled into one big ugly hairball of a subhuman being. His pandering behaviour overseas is very shameful and insulting to all Americans. I've been in the military for over eighteen years and believe me, he does not speak for the troops. He only speaks for himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whats wrong with the US","review":"I've been sitting here reading the reviews of this movie and am sooo disapointed with my countrymen. The only group of people who could possibly fall for this piece of left wing propoganda are those who get the news from Hollywood. If you want to know whats going on in Iraq talk to the hero's who have fought there. In this war or the last. If you want to get all the \\"facts\\" dont go to the fools that live in Hollywood. Try watching more than just your local news. Watch all news programs CNN, FOX, BBC or for those out there who can read pick up some newspapers. Bush is'nt God but, Moore is'nt either. Please start using YOUR brains and stop buying into whats shown to you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real American","review":"Finally someone has said what everyone has been thinking,it is refreshing to hear what you already suspected was true."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good.","review":"Obviously slanted to fit Moore's far left ideas, but the information presented is quite interesting. It doesn't necessarily blame Bush for 9/11, but it shows his past connections and actions after 9/11. You have to take certain things with a grain of salt, but I thoroughly enjoyed the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do not be blinded by the messenger","review":"Once you get past the politics and mud throwing surrounding this documentary you will see a very good constructed piece. Served with humor and above all intended to challenge you. Bring out the spotlight and the magnifying glass and start questioning everything they serve you as \\"faith\\", \\"the truth\\", etc on a daily basis. Not the easiest way to go, but much more fulfilling. The fact that this Michael Moore feature at least inspires people to have an opinion is a plus. How much of the (dis) information you get each day do you remember the next day? Not the case here. By the way, sometimes a documentary is just a documentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crap","review":"This movie is nothing but fiction and trys discredit George Bush.

It's like if I were to make a movie about how little I get paid and then get rich off of it. I think if someone would like to see this movie it should be a bootleg version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anti-American Trash","review":"Moore is about as anti-American as it gets. His work is dangerous to the common public. He distorts and twists so many views and takes too many things out of context. Moore is self centered and money hungry. He cares nothing about this country or the people in it. If you are quick to jump on the band waggen with Moores views, then at least know the facts. Research both sides without bias. Then make your decision about what is closer to the truth. Extreamist on either side are close minded and blind to better good of the people."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want soemthing clsoe to the truth go buy Aladin","review":"This is a propeganda the images and clips are cut up and duplicated to be longer then usaual. like the part where the guy comes in to tell bush that the second tower is hit he makes it seem like bush didnt care by maknig it look like that he was still reading the book and didnt give a damn if you watch the REAL clip and look at pictures bush is listening with not reading. same with the golf scene clearley cut up. this movie seriouly didnt work for Moore i doubt it changed opinions as bush is now leading the polls"},{"rating":"1","title":"One Star Too Many","review":"See it with a barf bag...pure, factless fantasy!The only reason to give this film any star at all is for the producer's vivid imagination...he would have done well during the McCarthy era. If you have more than two I.Q. points to rub together don't waste your time with this drivel!Anyone remember that this country was savagely, mercilessly attacked by foreign elements on 9/11? These elements don't want to kill Liberals or Conservatives, Republicans or Democrats but Americans! Somebody out there better \\"get it\\" soon or the economy and all the rest of it simply won't be around to matter...and Mr. Moore won't be making any more Taliban films."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHILDISH","review":"Of course Republicans could make a movie about the libs but we don't need to.

It shows videos of American soldiers being executed. These soldiers made the ultimate sacrifice for their country. And yet instead of honoring and showing our utmost gratitude toward these sacrifices, Michael takes videos of their deaths in his film to help him lie and disrespect their Commander and Chief and our President.They died for their country not for Michael Moore\`s disrespectful film.And I don\`t understand why misinformation can be called lying. I mean if liberating Iraq and capturing terrorist is all a mistake it has to be one of the best mistakes I\`ve ever heard of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Film","review":"I cried the minute i got out of the theatres it was sooo... good it was the most beautiful film i have ever seen in my life! It was disturbing as anything though. It jut maks you wonder.....Most of the mean reviews were by people who never saw the movie.Those are so deep in bush's lies that they don't care if the richest people in our country make the wars and the poorest fight in them and die for no point at all but that bush is automatically put in the white house. This is a sad day in America."},{"rating":"1","title":"Michael Moore","review":"I just saw this and then Fahrenhype which shows how so much in this movie is positively untrue. The bin Ladens did not leave when the planes were grounded and they left on their own with no help from the government. Several people who seemed to be interviewed by Michael Moore were interviewed by someone else and had no idea the footage was being used for this movie. They were extremely indignant to think they could be put in a movie without their knowledge. All those who think this is great should watch Fahrenhype and then form an opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strictly propoganda from the left.","review":"Not worth the money.

It is your money to waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"The boy who cries \\"wolf\\"","review":"People keep paying for movies made by a person who has wasted his \\"talent\\" on partial truths to flat out lies. What type of a person would waste his life on lies? Oh, yeah...a person who wants to make money off of ignorant people(I say this with no intentions to insult).It is ashame that people, like Mr. Moore, are not held accountable for their deceit. Well, eventually they will be. I actually feel sorry for him and for those who believe that he is telling them the truth.People like Mr. Moore actually hold back the truth and belittle and attack those who hold truth and honor as being important."},{"rating":"1","title":"Michael Moore","review":"I think Michael Moore is a giant wuss whom is mad at the US for not giving him everything in life. To fat and overweight to do anything include going the military to comprehend how the world really works outside of his house and from behind him Television. I rate this 1 star because it was poorly put together and missing a lot of important information. Only a quarter of the information is presented to the viewer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Propoganda, not documentary","review":"This movie is a well made propaganda piece, similar to the infamous Triumph of the Will. It is intended for one purpose only, and that is to bring about the removal of President Bush from office. Given that goal, no low is too low for Moore.There are innumerable sources that show the factual errors in this movie. (...)Make no mistake, it is a powerful movie. It gets 1 star for its production and power. It gets -5 stars because it is not a documentary, but a work of fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the biggest PROPAGANDA movies of all time","review":"I wouldn't waste my money on either seeing this movie or buying it. My friend rented it and we thought it was a comedy. We can't believe the left wingers who believe this garbage. Moore sure knows who his audience is. Left wingers willing to spend their money and LINE HIS POCKETS on unsubstantiated trash. Moore will always be a millionaire if he continues to target the not too bright people who buy into this rubbish."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fat Boy Steals your Money!","review":"What a disgrace, how many lies can you pile in one movie? If you dont research your information, this movie is harmful. It has already been proven that the majority of the movie is lies, taken out of content, fabricated newspapers and documents, made to make our military and president look stupid. Michael Moore admits to being a communist. His movie is pushed to groups like Hamas as a anti American movie. This is harmful to every one, because if you think their were no democrats killed on 9/11 your a bigger fool than Michael Moore. Dont waste your money on this slob. He has been quoted over seas stating that the reason americans are walking around with smiles on their faces is because we are too stupid to know any better. Michael Moore has no dignity, and deserves a kick in the backside right out the country he thinks is so stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUST A SUGGESTION","review":"If you are going to watch FarenHEIT 911 then also do yourself a favor and rent FarenHYPE 911.

I hear this 'crokumentary' makes you think that bush, of all people, is responsible for the terror attack of 9-11, so i am here to rescue you from certain misinformation."},{"rating":"2","title":"highest grossing documentary ever","review":"Michael Moore's latest film won a standing ovation and top prize at the Cannes Film Festival (May 2004), then in its first week in American theaters became the highest grossing documentary of all time. It's hard to tell who was more worried about this rabidly anti-Bush film--conservatives who fear Moore's mudslinging will stick to the President, or liberals who fear that mainstream America will label his views as way out of bounds and associate them with Kerry. Time magazine rightly observed that Moore's method incorporates equal parts comedy, tragedy, infiltration, confrontation, and speculation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dishonest","review":"Let's get real.

But, alas, those who think through their cannabinoid receptors rather than through neurons will do nothing but cling to Moore's propaganda film as an actual factual documentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"True Crap","review":"This is so biased it's nothing but B.S. It gets one star because zero stars was not an option. This is so one-sided politically. People who had a different opinion, the truth, were edited out of this. Michael Moore is a big fat liar.

The reviewer then proceeded to give the film a good review.Excuse me,but what ever happened to truth in journalism?I find it interesting that the same people that slammed tabloid journalsim taking things out of context and distorting the truth turn around and embrace it when it suits their politics. What hypocrites they are.What we have here is left wing version of McCarthyism,this time seeing right wingers under the bed and showing a paranoid attitude to the US Government.This film just gives ammunition to terrorists and,let us not forget,was made by the same man that in the last election told people not to vote for Al Gore."},{"rating":"2","title":"What people don't want to hear-THE TRUTH","review":"Michael Moore is truly revolutionary. I was blessed to be able to see him live and to hear his message in person. He has a vision for our country and for our values. He sees that we have a problem. The problem is that we are killing and fighting for an unwinnable cause. That kids are dying for oil and big business. He also wants us to listen to what people are saying, Good and Bad, to be informed. We are living in times where the president is allowing ultra-conservative men on the supreme court who are only in their early 50's. Our president is making it so our core values of liberty and freedom and human rights are being dimminished daily. Michael askes us to fight with peace and with the power of the ballot.

I would implore everyone, regardless of where you sit, to at least watch it before you dare to trash it. Anyone who has seen Michael's documentaries knows that he takes some editorial liberties. However, watch only Bush's face as he sits in the elementary classroom, the minutes slowly ticking, after he is told that \\"America is under attack\\" by his aide. Then, watch the protesters at the inaugural parade. Then, ask yourself, \\"why didn't we see or read about any of this via our national media?\\" If nothing else, Moore gives us information that we, as free Americans, should have been given by our free press. Would that be the case, we wouldn't need the Michael Moores of this nation."},{"rating":"1","title":"A well-made film that should have stuck to the facts.","review":"Michael Moore's film style is solid and engaging, and Fahrenheit 9/11 is an excellent example of that style. Seeing this movie I was shocked, so I did some research to find out more. Instead of finding out more, though, I discovered that much of this movie is highly inaccurate and designed to decieve.

Moore admitted his bias up front, and people that were included in some of the scenes have complained that their viewpoints were totally distorted. The liberal Hollywood community pointedly failed to even nominate this turkey for anything such as a Golden Globe or an Oscar. The effect of this silly mish mash is to reduce Moore's credibility on his other projects rather than to say something real. Alhough he may look like the proverbial 800 pound gorilla, all he can produce is minor monkey shines."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A DOCUMENTARY","review":"This film is not factual, but merely over 90 minutes of Moore's take on things in his twisted viewpoints. This movie is complete crap! and should not influence anyone because it is an op/ed and NOT a documentary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Straight Outta Flint","review":"Michael Moore has said he made Fahrenheit 9/11 to force Americans to discuss the invasion of Iraq, and the greater war on terrorism, both of which which he felt had been rubber-stamped by Congress and rushed past the American people.It is impossible to argue that he has not reached that goal. If nothing else, note that there are nearly 700 reviews of this DVD on Amazon two months before it is to be released.Whether or not you agree with Moore's politics, you have to agree that he makes powerful films. I saw Fahrenheit 9/11 in the theater about a month after it's release, when the Bush administration had had plenty of time to do all they could to discredit Moore and his film. The audience by then was small, but they CHEERED at the end of the movie.Fahrenheit 9/11 may be the best finger-in-the-eye-of-the-powerful you will ever see. It's also great film making."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing, provocative, but devalued by going over the top.","review":"Moore introduces the audience to many disturbing facts, political deceptions, and horrific images. The story that he tells is sad and painful on many levels. The viewers follow the story of one families staunch support of the Iraqi invasion that terminates in a heartwrenching scene in our nation's capital.The one criticism I have of this documentary is that Moore's opinions, while well founded, are so blatant in excess that the story he came to tell is weakened and feels like so many sour grapes.That being said, the movie is well worth viewing. Everyone should understand and be made to follow the money trail that has led, ultimately, to the deaths of 1000 young Americans in the Middle East and over 3000 innocents on September 11th."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must See!","review":"EVERY American of voting age should see this film. It is not played with \\"actors\\" and fake scenes. This is real! Mr. Moore did a very credible job of exposing the truth in what we are not told that happens behind the scenes, and bringing it to the surface.Some don't like the film, but it sure opened my eyes to what's hsappening and what's NOT in Washington, DC. Hopefully, there will be honesty and surety in the voting this time, and ALL the votes will be counted.

Also, after all of his criticism of Bush, corporate society, etc shown here, where are Michael Moore's profits from this thing going?I heard somewhere that this film was actually shown in a classroom! Talk about scary. Think Michael Moore is the only Hollywood bozo involved with the Bush-bashing? Think again. Go pick up any recent issue of Rolling Stone and you'll see the same garbage. I am by no means a right-wing lunatic, but come on! This crap is just so trendy. Think for yourself people."},{"rating":"2","title":"An eye opener - Go see it, and then make up your mind!!!","review":"I watched Michael Moores Fahrenheit 9/11 yesterday and was shocked, moved, angry, saddened and in a state of disbelief.

What a stunning indictment of the Bush administration, and his heartless, conscience-less approach to promoting personal gain (the acquisition of oil and billions of dollars) hidden behind the banner of \\"protecting the world against weapons of mass destruction.\\" Moore clearly reveals the stark lie that Bush and associates have told. What great shame Bush has brought to America, and what immense suffering he has caused the world. He and his entourage of oil mongers, along with our pretend senate and house who have continously turned a blind eye to his behavior, all of these have reversed whatever good name America had, and now it is up to us, the people, to reverse this tragedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Most Important Film Of the Decade","review":"I know, I know... people always say this about their favorite films. But this is for real, people! I don't care if you are Democrat, Republican, Independent, Green, Yellow, Black, Red, White or Blue, this is a MUST SEE for anyone who lives in the U.S.A.! And for those of you who think that Mr. Moore is full of it, don't you owe it to yourself to see what the fuss is about and make up your own mind? This film is NOT anti-American; in fact, it is one of the most truly patriotic films ever made. Watching it gave me hope for America for the first time in a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bush won, Moore is rich, and you wasted 2hours","review":"There is a simple test to determine whether someone is to be taken seriously regarding this film. If they call it a \\"great film\\" or an \\"intriguing documentary,\\" then they are clearly incapable of distinguishing between fantasy and reality.This is a political attack. The truth, through an endless series of out-of-context shots and deceitful editing, is brushed aside for the most part. What this film is not, most definitely, is a documentary. Of course within the propaganda are \\"real\\" video clips, but without context they mean very little. It is, however, a megaphonic display of first amendment rights. God bless America - where else can you defame the President so overtly and be completely protected doing so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excrement","review":"Cinematic excrement from a man who loathes America. He makes Oliver Stone look like a historian. He makes Leni Riefenstahl look like a journalist. He makes D.W. Griffith look fair and balanced.

It shows vividly how fragile the line between \\"freedom\\" and \\"tyrany\\" is (to quote Bush's best loved terms). Who has freedom? Who is the tyrant? Does the US Patriot Act protect the freedom of ordinary Americans? Why did the Bush go against the majority of the UN to go into Iraq? Why do so many Americans still believe the infamous \\"Weapons of Mass Destruction\\" will still be found? Why do so many Americans still blindly follow a man like Bush, who most people outside the US despise (yes, including myself)?Michael Moore shows Bush at his worst, and shows why its so good not to be an American right now.The really scary thing about this movie is to read all the 1-star reviews here on Amazon. How can so many people be so blind to the truth? America is definately a great nation. What a pity it has evolved into what it is now."},{"rating":"2","title":"See before its too late!","review":"We have to get people to see the horrible job this incompetent president is doingThank you , Michael Moore.

Even though I had read about most of the topics covered in the film, it was shocking, highly disturbing to see, and left me seriously depressed and worried about the fate of our nation. What was perhaps more disturbing than anything in the movie was the fact that a filmmaker was needed to do the job that the media (\\"liberal\\" indeed!) failed to do. Anyone who thinks there were false facts or untruths in this film need only realize that not one single fact presented was disputed by anyone in the Bush administration or the rightwing talking heads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutly atrociuos","review":"To call something this biased a documentary is appalling.

I think michael moore is a terrible film maker. he was so funny in it. the movie was like \\"bush's family once owned an oil company soo the war must be about oil....dun dun dun!\\" it was hilarious. and the part where the arab guy was sayin that the reporters husband must have a hard time with you almost made me pee my pants.i am very conservative and rented this movie to to see what he had to say. but it was so ridiculous and it made me even more conservative...but this is what makes our country so great...being able to argue about such things...i also believe that this film disgraced and exploited our military men and women...and having 3 very close cousins in iraq (had four but he was killed)...i found that very offending...i would like to see michael moore go and interview my aunt...she wouldnt be none too kind to him...bottom line...if you're lookin for a good laugh...watch it"},{"rating":"1","title":"Liar, liar, liar!","review":"Nice try Michael Moore! \\"There's no terrorist threat!

Too bad most of the points in this movie were proven incorrect by the bipartisan 9-11 Commission report and the Senate Intellegence Committee and British security report that vindicated Tony Blair. This is far from a \\"documentary\\", as Moore twists the truth to his liking (ie. the misrepresented and inaccurate newspaper editorial date and headline and the bit about encouraging Congressmens' children to enlist...he cut out the one rep who wanted to help him, because his kid was in Iraq...he was a Republican).Despite the errors, it'll win an Oscar, because that's the way Hollywood is..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Man without a country","review":"Number one, drop any idea that this is a factual account of 9/11. moore is probably the holder for the most lies told in one film. If you treat it as a piece of fiction, it is still unviewable. I kept saying to myself - where on earth did he get his supposed facts? I gave up and decided that this film should be relegated to the trash heap and never see the light of day in my house. Words fail me at the disgust I feel for this man and hence the title of my review. He is not an American, I don't know what he or it is. I cannot begin to list the outright prevarications in the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Pandering to Anti-Bush Crowd","review":"This crockumentary just panders to the anti-bush crowd. I have to hand it to Michael Moore, he knows how to make a buck off of stupid people.There are so many dead-ends and lies in this movie.Read 59 Deceits of Fahrenhiet 9/11 and actually learn something instead of letting your brain atrophy to Moore's piece of garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"A propaganda film for the ages","review":"I'm giving this movie 1 star because Michael Moore presents this movie as fact. This it is not, Moore takes footage without the concent of the person hes interviewing on several occasions, and takes the footage out of context. A number of other things in the movie just arent true, and have been disproven by the 9/11 commission. Watch it if you want but do not take it all for fact, do your own research to form opinions on this country and administration. Dont take an extremists opinion"},{"rating":"1","title":"Propaganda Propaganda Propaganda","review":"Sadly most people will see this and go, \\"Oh Bush is horrible, how could I have been so blind?\\" But have you ever seen Moore(on) go on any show to debate what he tells his audience to be true? No most will just accept what he says to be the gospel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leni Riefenstahl In A Baseball Cap","review":"Michael Moore is Nazi film producer, Leni Riefenstahl in a baseball cap. He has essentially resurrected Joseph Goebbels' theory that if you tell a lie often enough it becomes the truth.Michael Moore is yet another example of the ultra-left who have already taken over the Democratic party, and are stopping at nothing in an effort to turn America into yet another experiment in socialism.Moore's grand deception is built upon a foundation of misrepresentations, excessive quote-editing, and taking quotes out of context - in a word, PROPAGANDA. But let's not be too harsh with Michael. After all, he can't help but lie. It's his native tongue.Unfortunately, Moore's lemmings don't seem to be able to discern truth from fabrication. They just want to focus their collective venom on George Bush. Is it any wonder that so many of them are joyfully swallowing the Kool-Aid of this nasty little man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ineffective","review":"Ah yes, I remember Moore's statements on how no one who saw his movie could vote for Bush. The bloated liar was so convinced that Bush would lose, and his film would have a hand in it. It appears that the American people are not as gullible as Moore thinks. In the movie Moore makes fun of and villifies Bush... a lot. But on this day after the election I have just one question for michael moore. Who is laughing now?"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you don't read the news daily, steer clear","review":"Although I was entertained by this film (though not to the tune of $9), I went into it with the belief that it would be more of a documentary-style film.Michael Moore has it in for the Bush administration, a position I personally respect. But my BIG fear now is that many who view this film coming from a like perspective will see it for something it isn't - an unbiased documentary (i.e., the whole truth).My advice: if you get your political \\"news\\" from the Daily Show and Late Night with David Letterman, stay away from this movie like the plague. You get just one side in this movie and anything that doesn't \\"fit\\" has clearly been edited out.3 stars as entertainment. 1 star for masquerading as a documentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why let us down?","review":"Michael, Michael, Michael. Who are you really? An overblown American icon who has figured out a lucrrative niche and exploits it to the max? A true believer who wants a better world? You hype one thing and do another.

You find a soft spot and make a big movie out of it while stuffing your belly and your pockets. I am so upset at you.You aren't sincere.

Moore hopes so.The Saudis leaving the US: Happened several hundred days after 9/11The \\"Watch me hit this drive\\" scene: Video was shot before 9/11The congressman that walks away: had family in the Middle East, Moore just edited him saying so out\\"(...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leftist opinions","review":"This film is based on Michael Moore's oppinion of President George Walker \\"Dubeau\\" Bush and nothing more. While it does have some truths in it, there are scenes in which he blames Bush for doing something that was all opinional. Example. It you asked five hundred people whether Bush should have stayed in the classroom for the time he did after he received the news that America was under attack, half the people would say that what he did was right, and and the other half will agree with Moore and say that he should have left immediatey because Richard Cheney can't run a country. It is purely a manner of oppinion, and because Bush stayed in the classroom doesn't make him a bad person (...).So, if you are a leftist who hates Bush and likes Michael Moore's oppinion of Bush, this is a great video to get. However, if you want a non biased view of the Bush administration, ask Ralph Nader."},{"rating":"1","title":"HALF TRUTH, AND CONSPIRACY HYPE","review":"There is a lot to dislike about Bush and his team, and the whole 9-11 cycle can be debated, but this is a lazy mans rant, the lies and cheap conspiracy stuff wasn't needed, I would have found this more interesting with facts, this should have been on MTV."},{"rating":"1","title":"America is in BIG trouble","review":"The USA is in for some very rough times as long as weak minded people continue to rely on propaganda and misinformation to make important decisions. The likes of Michael Moore and Sean Hannity pose the same threat, just from opposite directions. Here's a suggestion for you . . . if you'd truly like to know what happened on 9/11, read the 9/11 commission report. If you just want to see someone make fun of Bush, thereby propping up your self esteem, by all means, this movie is for you and the rest of the lazy masses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a \\"documentary\\" - Not good...","review":"This completely fraudulent attempt at a documentary is being dismantled piece-by-piece by those who are unearthing the REAL reasons behind this farce of a movie (boy, that was a crazy sentence...). Seriously, this is black helicopter kookiness at its worst, with some bald-faced lies and distortions sprinkled on top. This is a movie for sheeple who don't take the time find out about how the real world functions. Must be nice for MM to go around to colleges preaching his complete BS for $40,000 a pop.

A movie as horrible as this one, you should get a refund. I can't believe that there are morons in this country that no only think this piece of crap was good, but also believe all the BS in this movie.. I guess if he made a movie about how there really is an easter bunny those morons would believe it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deport Michael Moore!","review":"I am always surprised by what a gentleman Mr. Moore presents himself as when interviewed. Heck, I'd almost be willing to break bread with him if given the chance. Given that I have familial Hollywood connections, it's certainly not out of the question. I've been trying to contact Mr. Moore for an interview to appear in my company newsletter.Of course, much of the controversy surrounding Michael Moore and his films is due to the questionable status of his citizenship. I don't want to rehash the topic, as talk radio hosts have debated it to death. But whether or not he is able to legally work within the U.S. is neither here nor there. We know he lives in the States, and therefore he poses a danger to the country.The single-star rating is applicable if his film is taken as a serious documentary. As a fantasy/comedy film, I'd give it four billion stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"fahrenheit 9/11 aka lie after lie after lie after lie","review":"This film is the biggest pack of lies I have ever seen.

People like moore don't relize that they are going to get the people mad that would not vote and get them to the election and Bush will win.

They have been well documented and broadcast.This movie is brought to you by the same Anti-Bush folks who sponsor CBS/Dan Rather hate and bias. People who have taught us time and again it is OK to forge documents and edit film events no matter what the FACTS are. Contrary to Moore's belief system, things were not all kite-flying and wonderful with Saddam Hussein. Check out the book SADDAM: KING OF TERROR by Con Coughlin for a reality check. Coughlin did his research on Saddam Hussein before the war.Michael Moore is a lying hate-monger. Don't let him polute your mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"A movie of lies and absolute fiction","review":"This movie, if you could call this garbage that, is a fine example of liberal lies and spins of the ultimate degree!

Michael Moore is scum beyond description."},{"rating":"1","title":"Even the democrats are apalled by this movie!","review":"Michael Moore may be called many things, but one thing he is not is a DEMOCRAT! Moore likes democrats about as much he likes George W. Bush. And the democrats, the old fashioned ones from the John F. Kennedy tradition like Moore about as much as they liked Clinton's disgusting acts; as much as they like that cheater Al Gore and about as much as they like John Kerry or John Edwards.This movie is full of lies and propaganda. No facts. That is why the true democrats are as disgusted with this crap my Moore as we were with Whoopie Goldberg's disgusting act last week in New York City.Even if you hate George Bush, do not, do not, repeat, DO NOT think that Michael Moore is a democrat or that the true democrats support this jerk. Our recent history shows that we have had enough jerks in the democratic party. I even heard that some people think Whoopie Goldberg is a democrat. God forbid!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Michael Moore's latest documentary, Fahrenheit 9/11, is a film that everyone should see, liberal or conservative or moderate or whatever you may consider yourself. Even if you don't agree with everything that Moore says, it will really get you thinking about politics and the Bush administration, which a lot of us as Americans have not been doing.I'm 14, and I convinced my dad, who considers himself a conservative, to take me to this movie. When we walked out, and for the rest of the day, I could tell he was thinking about the movie, and although he doesn't exactly like Moore or what he had to say, F9/11 forced him to re-evaluate his opinions on many, many issues addressed in this movie.If there's one movie out right now that you should see, this is it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like it or not Fahrenheit 9/11 nails it!","review":"Any self-respecting person with a conscience who has done the research and studied the evidence and knows the facts also knows the truth about 9/11.

That was \\"movie magic\\" - one of those utterly gripping screen moments which grabs you by the throat.I suppose the greatest disppointment was...well...everthing after that opening scene. It could have been a compelling story...only the narrative hops around as if on a broken trampoline...tries too hard to do discredit the Bush administration, barely focuses on the back story (\\"Charlie Wilson's war\\"; the rise of the Taliban, the history of Al Qaeda, America's love-hate relationship with Saddam Hussein) and never once attempts to explain the mindsets of the hijackers.Moore should be ashamed of himself...I know I am ashamed for him."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real junk movie!","review":"A friend of mine said that the purchase of this \\"LYING, DISTORTING OF THE TRUTH, HUNK OF JUNK MOVIE WAS A MISTAKE\\" and after he showed it to me I could agree with him fully and I would never make the mistake of including this trash movie in my collection.To all who read this review I say don't waste your time or money on this {to put it nicely as possible} piece of crud movie!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I prefer a Documentary that presents the facts accurately","review":"The title sums, it up.

Michelle Moore harasses people in all of his documentaries. Everyone is upset at the Swift Boat veterans for running the ads trying to discredit John Kerry.

Was it my pointing how how Moore didn't show the responses of the congressmen he approached about signing their children up for the war? Was it my pointing out that Richard Clarke has contradicted Michael Moore regarding his portrayal of the bin laden family leaving America after 9/11/01?

I'm not looking forward to the end of this journey at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny, Sexy, Interesting","review":"Literally made me laugh out loud (and that hardly ever happens). I loved reading how Andrew McVie got acquainted with the future. The scene where he is discovering the bathroom is the greatest! I could literally picture him fiddling around with the faucets and flushing the toilet.Andrew is drawn so well that you can actually feel his strength of character. You are rooting for him the whole time. Rooting for him to find the love he's always wanted and rooting for him to find his purpose in life. Really a great read.I would love to have more of their story tho. How does Shannon fair in 1779? Do they have a child? Do they end up living near Rebekah, Emilie and Dakota? A follow up story with all these characters would be awesome!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Seems used!!","review":"To be honest, when I first saw this caliper it seemed used...it was in good shape but definitely seemed used... I then noticed it doesn't really fit in the plastic box it was sent in and the box was broken. Some may think the latter could have happened in the trip from the store to my hands but the box was fixed using transparent tape which makes me think it was fixed in the store. Its a hassle for me to return it because I'm far from the US so I guess I'll keep it (and it works after all...)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Light and forgettable","review":"This book is full of detail and description, but is somehow still flat and unsatisfying. It comes across as a fantasy view of small town life--which I don't think was intentional. The characters are varied and posessing a variety of personal problems, but the edges are all rounded and comfortable. There are obvious attempts at being quirky and keeping loose ends from being neatly trimmed, both of which get in the way of the story. I found myself thinking \\"I expect such and such to happen, but I know it won't because the author doesn't want to be predicatable.\\" In the end, very light and forgettable."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesomness","review":"ive been a fan of the show since i was 9, and now im 12...i love the show, its amazing...its not a fake show with a family thats skinny, rather large house and having enough money to be secure, its actually, an average family...they're down to earth, and while they tend to rude--you can see how loving the family is...it covers lessons, but tends to make it fun to learn them, just buy it...you'll see!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"This DVD is edited! How could some people just not care. If I'm never going to be able to watch Roseanne on television again in 2012, then I'm going to want to buy the DVD's, but if I'm going to buy them, I want to buy them if they're not unedited. I have written many complaints to AnchorBay about the edited episodes, and they said there is nothing thy can do. That is bullcrap. I just will not buy the set if the episodes are edited.Why would someone want to buy a DVD for $40 if the episodes are edited!? It's a waste of money, and if the sets are continuously edited, I will not buy, and I say that no one should buy to show Anchor bay and Carsey-Werner a lesson.I'm only a kid, and Roseanne is my all-time favorite show, but I still won't buy an edited Roseanne DVD, even if I willl never be able to see it again on Cable TV.ALso, I was just wondering if someone could tell me the email address for Carsey-Werner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good News, But An Awful Set","review":"I think the other reviewers have all said it very well. Roseanne is a queen of comedy and her show remains unriviled in quality, especially those brilliant first six seasons. If ever a show deserved a totally ultimate edition, way too many special features, UNCUT high def presentation, it's Roseanne.Well, as we all know by now, these episodes are totally cut, not uncut at all, which makes the title \\"Complete First Season\\" completely false. If material is edited out of an episode, it is not complete, and if two-three minutes of material are edited out of 23 episodes, that renders the whole set incomplete.Anyway, I do have good news. The fans have spoken and the company has listened. The next eight seasons are being planned for uncut releases. We can only hope that the first season is fixed sometime and returned to its proper form. Until that happens, I will never waste a single penny on this worthless, lazy set of a great show that deserves better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Edited? Not Worth A Single Penny","review":"What a cheap release. \\"Roseanne\\" is the number one show I've waited many years to own, like other fans.

That's not happening, so I'm not buying the set.I was so excited to spend lots of money collecting the show but it looks like I now have one less thing to do.All these one star reviews on page one should be enough to stop unsuspecting customers from blowing their cash on this cheap mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Five Stars for the Show, One Star for This Set","review":"I got some horrible news from the Roseanne board at SitcomsOnline.com. A poster e-mailed Anchor Bay and asked if this set will contain the syndicated prints, and they replied confirming that yes, the episodes will indeed be the SYNICATED prints.

Two first class shows getting third class treatment. Thanks for nothing, Carsey-Werner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Edited? What?","review":"How could they possibly make an edited Roseanne? I was just about to click the buy button until I read a few of the reviews and noticed that it was an edited version. How do you edit Roseanne?

An edited version of the Paris Hilton video perhaps..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Roseanne deserves better","review":"The studio that is releasing this must think we're completely stupid.

I have been waiting for this show for years, but what's the purpose of having a second-rate version?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware...EDITED/CUT episodes !!!","review":"It is getting ridiculous how often studios are released EDITED, CUT versions of TV shows instead of the full versions as seen on network TV. Why pay money for edited content? Each show is cut by 2 minutes or so, so you miss about 10% of the episode. If you think it isn't a big deal, feel free to send me 10% of your paycheck each week....AVOID this set, write a polite letter to the studio telling them why you won't buy it and maybe they'll get the message that consumers want the full version on DVD, not edited junk.

Sorry to the person that requested that people not write in to complain about this but maybe if the right people see how many sales they are losing, this will stop happening.Yes, the series itself is a good one! It was definitely on my 'buy' list but unfortunately no longer. Same goes for 3rd Rock and Cosby. There is no good excuse for this. I'm suspicious it's their way of trying to milk us even more in the future. Can you see it in a few years? \\"Roseanne Season One -first time ever with unedited episodes\\"!!!

I don't mind one or two syndicated versions in a season set, but not the entire season. Sorry. Anchor Bay and Carsey Werner messed up on this.

They made a big mistake in putting the edited versions of the episodes on the DVD. I, for one, will not be buying the DVD version. Just yesterday, they started airing Roseanne on a Canadian channel called CMT. I watched it, it was the pilot episode for the series, and it was the original UNCUT version, not the syndicated episodes they used to air on TBS. Any Roseanne lovers who are able to get this channel, do yourself a favor and tape these episodes instead of springing the $30 for the DVD. This is the only way they will learn their lesson and hopefully not make the same mistake of putting the edited versions of episodes in later season releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"How do we contact Carsey-Werner?","review":"Does anyone know how a person could contact Carsey-Werner to request that Roseanne be released on DVD?

I watch the show EVERY day...on TBS or Oxygen. I can't believe that you can buy \\"The Dukes of Hazard\\" on DVD...but not ROSEANNE!?! It makes NO sense at all!

Studios often re-release movies with \\"extra footage\\" or \\"director's cut\\" or \\"extended edition\\". How many do you think they would sell if they released a shortened version...like a Gone With the Wind that is only 2 hours long. I will no longer buy any DVD set with syndicated episodes.

All 23 episodes are missing at least 2 minutes of footage from the versions that originally aired on ABC. How in the world can a studio feel that there is nothing wrong with using syndication prints of television shows to put on a DVD box set that consumers are paying good money for? If we want to see the versions of these classic shows that have missing footage for more commercial time, we can catch them on umpteen independent satellite/cable stations! We have a right to expect that something WE (as opposed to sponsors) are paying for will be the original, complete and uncut network versions!

I can watch these on cable anytime!To cut 2-3 minutes out of an already 24 minute show is significant. And even if it is just music or shots with no dialogue, I want the show as it was concieved and directed and edited by the artists who created it, rather than the anonymous cuts made by local T.V. stations.Just think, 2 or 3 minutes out of 23 episodes is about AN HOUR of deleted footage from the season.

From sibling rivalry to holiday gatherings, the show captures a real family in its true light. The humor is relatively 'PG' and due to the almost non-existant bad language, Roseanne S1 can be viewed by the whole family.

Either they give us a decent release or charge the $5-$10 this is worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on Anchor Bay Entertainment - Carsey/Werner!","review":"This is my #1 most anticipated DVD release of all time. It pains me to say I will NOT be buying it. I have the syndication edits on DVD from television. The box says the COMPLETE first season and it is not. 2 minutes removed from 23 episodes = 46 minutes of deleted footage.

Watch the reruns on TV Land for free."},{"rating":"1","title":"Syndication = BAD","review":"The reason I find this set revolting (though i LOVE the show) is because of the syndicated episodes they used instead of the real ones. I discovered that when they got the rights to put this on DVD, they only got the rights for the syndicated episodes of first season, as well as season 2. Season 2 will be the same. The reason they are using syndicated episodes is not only copyrights, but the fact that they needed to beable to synch in other languages with the music and sound effects for other countries. This is sad I realize, but we deserve much more, and companies who do this are just revolting. If you put a show on DVD put the actual thing, not something that was syndicated and never shown on TV."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's all been said, but....","review":"I don't care.

If we keep lowering the average score people won't get ripped off. Look, if you don't care about it being edited, good, go buy it. I, however, think this trend is dispicable. It's just like the music industry - the people putting these things out are NOT FANS and don't even take the time to make sure they are putting out what the fans want. The more people who boycott this release, the better chance this ugly trend will cease to continue! I will, however, still rent this from Netflix, but sorry Anchor Bay, you will not be getting my money on this release.

That is unacceptable. I will not be buying this.I know the extent of the cuts since I was watching the reruns both on Canadian television, which aired the full episodes, and on ABC, which had the syndicated episodes. More often than not some of the best bits were left out. Whole scenes disappeared entirely.

In the meantime, this set is still just as bad and shouldn't be bought. You can save up your money for the uncut other eight seasons and wait for them to rerelease this.

The sets and lighting are moody and the performances are superb - notably Helen Morgan's. A member of the original Broadway cast, Morgan, in her decline here, is heartbreakingly tragic as the equally tragic Julie she plays, and it is impossible not to blink back a tear when she sings \\"Bill.\\" The black-and-white film has a theatrical, stagelike quality, unlike the 1951 version, when hollywood became obsessed with the \\"realism\\" of Technicolor and location, rather than studio, shooting, and one gets a sense of the \\"shabby gentility\\" that Edna Ferber conveyed in the original story.

Even if you don't like musicals this one is worth it to see Robeson sing and act. Once you've seen this version every other is a disappointment (except for them removing the black face, that needed doing). Robeson as Joe will give you chills. I only wish I could have seen and heard him live. Hattie McDaniel is always great to watch as well. The rest of the cast is good, although other versions are roughly comparable. This version does have a more authentic feel. This one is more like a musical on stage than the 50s version, which has a movie feel to it. The black face is a representation of a historical reality, but not defensible. However, this inclusion I hope does not keep people from seeing the quality of the music and the message of the play or missing the spectacular performance of Paul Robeson."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Unmentioned Point","review":"All the reviews here are excellent.

If it ever happens, I hope they will be able to include all the LD audio bonuses from the 1951 recording sessions and still photo galleries of the three films as contained in the Laser Disc set. If George Feltenstein is lurking about reading these posts, it would be really nice to get some of the Criterion content from their release, if they're willing. Could we also please have as much of the 1929 Ziegfeld Prologue as possible? And while I don't usually recommend this type of thing, the alternate stereo mix of the last LD issue of the 1951 film (with the Ava Gardner vocal tracks in place) would be a dream come true!In fact, after BEN-HUR and GWTW, an entire fourth disc of bonuses would not be out of the question."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best","review":"I play saxophone about 15 hours a week and vandoren ZZ reeds is the best reed that I have played with.

I have to say that I found this Album a bit of a let down. Same great voice, but the tracks do not do him any justice. I understand that this is a dance/club album. But I think it would be nice for a change for him to do a album that focuses on that great voice and the lyric a little more. I think Crazy is the high point of the album. But most of the rest of the tracks fall flat. I saw the Erasure tour last year, and thought Andy had develpoed as a singer, performer, and person. He had so much soul and style in every lyric. I also enjoyed the Erasure Night Bird Album. I just don't think this is his best work. Worth a listen though."},{"rating":"1","title":"A total disappointment","review":"My first complaint is that none of these badly written, whipped up songs showcase Andy's great voice. I can't believe this is the same guy who poured his heart and soul on nightbird (a fantastic album by the way.) This cd was purely made for the clubs with no real feel to it at all. Larsen and Smith can not compare to the genius known as Vince Clarke. Maybe I'm just spoiled with all of my erasure albums but I expected more from the one of the best singers in the world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Andy Bell's Delicious Fantasy","review":"Odlican debitantski disko pop album za Andy Bell.Duboko lican, sa pregrst emocija ovaj album vas zasipa svojom ritmicnosti i prosto tera na igru od samog pocetka.Na albumu Electric Blue gostuju Jake Shears (Scissor Sisters) u pesmi I Thought It Was You i Claudia Brucken (Propaganda) u cak dve pesme, Love Oneself i mozda najacoj pesmi na albumu Delicious kojoj je zaista tesko odoleti.Bez sumnje ovo je najbolji i najiskreniji pop album u 2005.Za svaku preporuku i obavezno za vasu kolekciju.Mnogo bolje i smelije nego poslednji album Erasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Future Disco","review":"My worst fear was that, without his Erasure partner Vince Clark, Andy Bell's album would be nothing more than Andy's beautiful tenor singing mediocre songs to generic dance beats. Thankfully, that is not the case. \\"Electric Blue\\" is, in fact, a dance album, but it's not only well-sung, but also filled with solid songwriting and excellent production. \\"Electric Blue\\", along with Madonna's \\"Confessions on a Dancefloor\\", might very well be the start of a \\"future disco\\" movement. Both CD's combine heartfelt, catchy pop songs with electronic music that is both futuristic and retro. My only criticism of Andy's album is that the two ballads seem tepid compared to the rest of the songs. Perhaps Andy might have been better off following Madonna's lead and sticking with the electrifying beats.Highlights: \\"Crazy\\", \\"Love Oneself\\", \\"Electric Blue\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good detail on Celtic history","review":"This book has a great deal of detail on roleplaying in the Celtic age. Most of the game specific stuff is relegated to the later half of the book. The modifications made to standard D20 look well balanced, with several new core classes and prestige classes to give your games a Celtic feel. There is also details on Celtic gods (although it's suggested that Cleric not be used as a class) and Celtic monsters (although not enough for my taste).The first half (or so) of the book gives a good background on Celtic history and society, such that no one should have trouble getting into character.All-in-all a good introduction to Celtic roleplaying, although I could have used more Celtic specific monsters."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"The video was too technical.

Register provides an honest account of her own parenting and sound advice for parents of young children. The book has many pearls of wisdom especially when it comes to race and culture, but is limited mainly to the author's experience of raising children from Korea.

From the beginning some of the sprayer openings were tweaked in random directions. It has a lifetime warrantee, but I was living with it because I didn't want to pay for another visit from my plumber. It was installed in January, and suddenly the pressure is poor. If there's a kink I can't find it, but it looks like I'm going to have to spring for the plumber. Feh. Now I have to find out if their warrantee service works better than this faucet."},{"rating":"1","title":"I can agree with most everyone in here","review":"My faucet came with the house, back in 2007 and worked wonderfully up until the day before yesterday... Out of nowhere, as I am using the faucet/sprayer, with water \\"full stream ahead\\" the hose falls off of the wand.... Water is shooting everywhere and the hose gets tightly lodged down into the hub assembly... I have spent the last day and a half trying to pull it out with needle nosed pliers and it won't budge... Not even able to push it up from underneath the sink. I then attempt to go at it from a different direction... By removing the handle, the cap, valve assembly, etc... That was an impossible task. I have now given up and am heading out right now to buy a new faucet and it sure as hell won't be another Delta. All I can say, is I have learned a lot, being a single female/homeowner. I will be replacing this faucet all by myself and have NO FEAR of doing so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic Clip broke free flooding cabinet after 13 months use.","review":"The faucet works fine, but the under-counter spray connection gave away after 13 months causing it to flood under the cabinet when the faucet is turned on. This is a small plastic clip that connects the under-handle brass threaded pipe to the flexible hose that runs up to the spray head. There is no movement at this point of the connection - yet it gave away. After re-inserting the clip, it pops free when full water pressure is on. The plastic seems to have weakend over time and cannot stay in place under pressure. All the good of this faucet is totally negated by the cheap connector breaking free and flooding the base cabinet. I cannot recommend this faucet to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the Kohler Instead","review":"I bought this because it had two attachment points to the sink and my installation was to a lopsided old stainless corner sink at my dad's house. Although it fit my application, my Kohler that's similar to it is made significantly better. The faucet is not very high, made rather cheaply and functions poorly with the pullout hose, which I had to jury-rig with more weight for it to function properly. I would never purchase it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"looks good, but is bad","review":"DO NOT BUY - this faucet looked good and seemed a bargain. The design is very nice to look at, but the mechanics are very poor. Within a few weeks it got harder and harder to turn it all the way off without drips. Then it started getting harder and harder to rotate. It's now a year old, and we are shopping for a replacement.The problem seems to be the design, where hot and cold are adjusted (diagonally side to side) in the same movement as water flow (forward and back). There is no defined position where the flow is reliably OFF. My office had these in all the break rooms and the bathrooms, and they all constantly drip. They had to replace every one of them.We are buying another brand, where hot and cold is a rotating movement INDEPENDENT from the flow control (front to back)."},{"rating":"2","title":"kitchen faucet","review":"This was purchased to replace a faucet whose finish had corroded. It works well, the finish seems to be of good quality. It was extremely easy to install. The only thing that is a little awkward is the spray to solid stream sliding button.

The pull-out sprayer faucet is comfortable and works smoothly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gates is confused.","review":"Shown throughout his book and video, Gates does not in any way understand the Afrikan experience, he blames Afrikan people for their past and as another reviewer stated the questions that he did ask were upsetting to the people and plainly 'stupid', his trip to Afrika was a waste of money, time and channel thirteen's airtime. I disagree, no black or white person should read his book or see his video, he is an Afrikan-American man with Afrikan ancestors and has totally forgotten this and has adapted to the 'hole' European world and its views."},{"rating":"1","title":"what a waste!","review":"Lynn Davis, I apologize. Your pictures are ok. Nothing outstanding, but surely good work. But Mr. Gates, how can a Harvard professor waste an opportunity of doing some real research about his subject. Everybody in REAL love for Africa was sighing: Another opportunity gone. Mr. Gates is superficial and has a touristic view, which is so often found in descriptions of \\"my africa\\" since centuries.

It focuses on architecture, but briefly discusses the cultures that built these jewels. The book could have used tighter editing in my opinion, since his discussions of this tribe's war on that tribe and then subsequent overthrow by the other tribe gets confusing. Can't tell the players apart without a crib sheet, since they often got no more mention than that. A minor quibble, though, since Gates brings us photographs and descriptions of places we've never heard of before, and gives us his on the spot impressions, which are likely what our impressions would be should we ever hop on a dhow to get there.

The Clash actually was the opening act on their first tour and got a bigger reception than the Pistols. Punk had its origins in bands such the Patty Smith Band and Television. The Pistols were a cynical creation of Malcolm McLaren and only ever released one decent album, \\"Never Mind the Bollocks\\". The Furs were a one of a handful of true punk bands including, the Clash, Ramones, etc. This is a great example of their early work."},{"rating":"2","title":"40 Minutes Of Doom","review":"Over their rather extensive recording career, the Psychedelic Furs have attempted to be all bands to all people, from proto-Goths to poppy synth stars. Most critics point to their debut release, which has its moments, but is a little dense overall. This, their second release, is much more accessable. It opens with \\"Pretty In Pink,\\" the original version, not the version heard on radio today that was cleaned up for the John Hughes movie of the same name. Other strong tracks are \\"Mr. Jones\\" (this ain't no Counting Crows here), \\"Into You Like A Train\\" and \\"It Goes On.\\" Their next release, \\"Forever Now,\\" was produced by Todd Rundgren, and started their slow-but-inevitable slide toward irrelevance. This one is different, catching them while they still had their initial vision intact."},{"rating":"2","title":"Remastered... Really?","review":"This is a great album. I saw the furs back in '84 and they were an incredible live band and put out some of the most unique music of the 80's. Richard Butler, with an unapologetic cockney accented singing style, combined with his tobacco soaked voice and backed by an awesome band with a... horn section!The problem I have with this (and the other furs reissues) is the sound quality. These have been remastered by Sony, and unlike their other reissues (The Clash, Cheap Trick), the sound quality is not all that much better than the old CD's and Epic albums I have from the 80's. I have a couple of their LP's on import British pressings, but I'd hoped that these CD's would sound better. I guess that the master tapes just weren't recorded all that well and they did the best that they could with what they had to work with. All in all, five stars for the music, three stars for sound quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic racket, but how did that horn get in there?","review":"This was the Furs' shining moment, when they cranked out screaming guitar commotion so dense it sounds like the tracks are falling on top of one another. Especially \\"Into You Like a Train\\", the all-time best anti-love love song. The vocals fit in perfectly, a sort of a relaxed Johnny Rotten effect that expressed perfect sardonic disdain. After this album, Todd Rundgren got ahold of them and started putting weird stuff like marimbas into the mix...but at least he got rid of the sax. The sax on this album is terrible--pointless noodling-around solos and a tone that sounds like a sick, but hesitant, goose. If only they could remix this album to wipe out the sax, it would be a 5-star product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"CH 2 Inch Nailer Fills a Big Need!","review":"I bought this to fill my need for a Brad Nail longer than the standard 1 1/4\\" Brad Nail.

Joe plays with the anger displayed on his first solo release,\\"LET THE MUSIC DO THE TALKING\\", but the songs are better. While Mr.Perry's guitar is screaming, with a fire it has rarely shown since, Charlie Farren's vocals are better than any on Joe's first disc. However, the record misses something. Few can come close to Steven Tyler's vocal presence for that kind of balls to the wall bluesy rock'n'roll. In my opinion, it still isn't quite an Aerosmith record.

So now I'm pursuing writing -- they can't see what I look like. Men in Hollywood have HUGE egos--they think it is their RIGHT to screw every attractive woman that they see. Sorry, this is crap, there are SOME men out there who love their wives and are faithful to them.

Also a women's desire is EXCLUSIVELY linked to a man's innocense and honesty. Anything less than immpeccable perfection in this area leads to zero desire in the female. Women all have to act. A man writing this just wants to excuse his behavior. Scientific fact is that a male cheats if he even accidentally glances at any female. Anything more is carrying out what has been allowed to begin. It is imperitive that a guy is not exposed. It is equivalent to his girl doing everything with another guy for a long period of time. Besides in reality, NO female is truly attracted to older guys. Guys that are like 18-22 which are fair, muscular, have nice voices, don't conceal information(lie), etc. are the most desired.

Some of us are actual human beings, and think and behave that way even when we're alone or at work or on vacation. And no, we're not all controlled by our sex drives. And yes, some of us do love the women we marry, and don't want to be with anyone else, even if offered. How egocentric to believe that just because you're a certain way, that all men are.

Because, according to his own bio on the dust jacket, one of them is a recovering sex addict with 4 (at last count) failed marriages.

She said she \\"felt alienated\\" and she stopped trusting me. After reading it myself, I was reminded of a previous experience with theories about men and sex. Freud believed that the desire to have sex with ones mother and kill one's father formed the \\"permanent stock of the psychic impulses which arise in early childhood.\\" When I first read Freud, I was completely baffled by his theory. I couldn't imagine where he came up with it, until I discovered that he himself had lustful dreams of his mother.

Although I guess a lot of people, whether they're knee-jerk feminists who believe that all women are good and all men are rotten, or men with over-inflated egos like yourselves, don't like to admit it.It's interesting that there are not more books written about women who stray on their husbands. I guess it's because they would destroy our society's idealized images of men as these unfeeling, insensitive, oversexed clods and women as these frustrated, long-suffering martyrs who stay home while their men have all the fun.Men - and women, too (gasp!) - have been cheating on their spouses since the world began.Wake up and smell the coffee,- Rosalind Lord"},{"rating":"1","title":"ALL MEN SHOULD BE ASHAMED BY THESE AUTHORS","review":"This book actually made me ill! Guys out there......... these two author wanna-a-be's (of course they were too ashamed to use their names)have given the name pig to all men. They claim that there is not one good man out there, and if there is, he's puts on a very good front. He has belittled men more than any male-bashing woman ever could. Ladies out there.......don't waste your money on this piece of pure garbage. This book was definitely written to ruin many good relationships. They state that no man can be trusted and that all men want nothing more than sex........ (even when their wives are in intensive care, they WILL stop to check out a girls cleavage, according to these two clowns).

Almost any man who denies this is either highly evolved or is lying. The fact is, a man's basic physiological makeup is geared toward sex, and sex drive does indeed impact a large portion of a man's thinking, decisions and behavior.My advice would be to grab a highlighter and HONESTLY mark every passage which applies to you or you know to be true. If you're truly honest, you're going to find you've highlighted more than one paragraph in this book.Some of the insights are disturbing, and I think that's why people refuse to accept these truths, but it's also important to note that not every detail applies to every man.

Lee displays none of the monk's wicked charisma or subtlety, and the result is a rather workmanlike narrative which portrays the central character as nothing more than a brutal charlatan. History, and the influence he achieved within the house of Romanov, seem to suggest there was more to Rasputin's character than this. A missed opportunity by Hammer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rasputin, the clever manipulator","review":"An attractive film by Hammer and a wonderfully powerful performance by Christopher Lee. Lee, an actor who always appears to put his \\"all\\" into his characters, doubly delights fans in this version of the Rasputin story. Rasputin is portrayed as an evil, manipulative, slick opportunist who delights in an over abundance of booze (just call him old pickle head!), sex (he can't have just one), and generally irresponsible behavior. He is deliciously amoral and \\"pig-like.\\" It is a bit odd that everyone in this part of the world sports a British dialect, but no matter -- it's fun!I do believe this demonstrates the great range of Christopher Lee -- an actor who has never been given ample credit for his tremendous acting talent and distinguished demeanor.

The Panasonic did surprisingly well considering the average size, lighter-than-usual weight and cost. It picked up quite a bit more dirt than my previous vacuum did.I don't think this Panasonic is the best vacuum available, which is why I'm giving it four stars.

And there are times when the resolution to problems seems too pat. But the plot twists are so durned hilarious that you can completely overlook it.My sole complaint with this series of books is directed at Humanoids Publishing. I would really prefer to see this whole series collected in a giant edition, like Marvel is doing with Grant Morrison's X-Men (usually also quite amusing) and Bendis's Spider-Man.

I've already gone through an entire roll. I used it to protect my mountain bike from rock chips and cable rub. You have to be patient with the application. I didn't use soapy water like some others.

It's really helping when it comes to thinking about painting.

I loved this film. True, it is confusing at times, but well worth seeing.Character actors Corbin and Gilliam are great, but this clearly is Brad Hunt's film, from the start. He's a remarkable talent and deserves recognition for it. Not for one second do you doubt that he's an empty shell of a man who's given up on searching for real meaning in his life. It's an incredible performance, and I only hope that he's destined for stardom, in the future.If you don't care for gritty, downbeat westerns, this one might not be your cup-of-tea (Unforgiven is a walk in the forest by comparison), but otherwise you need to see it for Brad Hunt's stunning performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusion on the Border","review":"The \\"Journeyman\\" is the most confusing Western I have ever seen, and I've seen hundreds and hundreds. Filmed along the border in the Big Bend Country of Texas the story is a complete mishmash to the point of sometimes being unable to determine which character is which. Don't be misled by Willie Nelson's name in the cast: he's killed off in the first minute. The writing, direction, and acting (except for Barry Corbin) are all abysmal. You will be disappointed in the film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kilgour's Most Accessible Recording","review":"Although I enjoyed the diversity and experimentalism of Kilgour's last release, Feather in the Engine, it wasn't solid like David Kilgour & the Heavy Eights, magical like Here Come the Cars or hummable like Sugar Mouth.But along comes Frozen Orange. This is the album that first-time listeners should start with. Frozen Orange has a cohesive, polished sound that leaves David's charm unfiltered. The album is an excellent listen from start to finish: ten of the eleven songs are winners, a ratio unattained in many of his previous recordings.Highly highly recommended. Frozen Orange offers a welcome marriage of the songcraft from Here Comes the Cars and the studio polish of later albums. If you familiar with DK or his work with The Clean, this recording should rejuvenate your enthusiasm for the artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"PLEASE, PLEASE, PLEASE!","review":"...and yes, I'm begging more than James Brown!This is one of the greatest movies that I have ever had a chance to see.

Beaded 4X8 paneling and pegboard would need small nails (or brads) to secure the material while the Liquid Nails was drying.I didn't want to buy a compressor and a pneumatic nailer so I looked for something that would serve my purposes and do other woodworking tasks that required finishing nails and brads. The Arrow Electric Nail Gun was exactly what I was looking for. Aside from being a little heavy it worked flawlessly as soon as it was plugged into the wall. No jamming, no kickback, no sweat! Fit and finish are outstanding too and I expect many useful years from this beauty. Best of all - the price was very reasonable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the money","review":"I bought this nailer at a clearence center for $25. I just finished using it and thought it was great. True, it doesn't sink the nails, but this is not a big deal IMHO. It's a nice, light weight unit that easily drove the brads into solid oak. For my first brad gun, I'm quite impressed. If you can get the updated version which addresses all the shortcomings of this one mentioned by others here, I'd say you've got a real winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUT IT DOESN'T SINK THE NAILS !","review":"C'mon - how can you give this tool a good rating when it doesn't do the job it is supposed to do? Would you give kudos to a vacuum that you had to follow with a broom & dustpan? Yes, it may be easier to use this gun than a hammer BUT how about getting another electric nailer that does what it is supposed to do? I am very annoyed at having bought this without doing any research. I was at the HD and wanted an inexpensive and simple nail driver just for installing those cheap pre-finished baseboards in one room. It wasn't even worth it for that. The reviewer who wrote that the newer model \\"corrects\\" the problem proves this tool wasn't worth the few bucks I paid for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nail Gun","review":"Although the concept is great, the nail gun just doesn't have enough power to sink the nail even in drywall. It was a waste of time and money for me, and thankfully amazons return policy is very generous because this was of no use for me. Save up a bit more and get a better electric nailer or a compressor/nailer combo kit. I recommend porter cables 3 gun combo compressor set on amazon, great stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great but unavailable","review":"I agree with the raves of previous reviewers for this extraordinarily clever comedy. Unfortunately, it almost qualifies as a \\"lost movie.\\" It has only rarely been aired on TV and the VHS version released a few years back can now only be obtained at hugely inflated prices.

Olive Films, DON'T EVER DO THIS AGAIN!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Misses","review":"I'm a huge Walter Matthau fan, and I thought I had seen all his movies, but I had never even heard of this one. And I was disappointed. It does try to be funny, but it misses by a long shot.

Boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very dated, thin plot, not funny","review":"I know that everyone's funny bone varies but this movie isjust NOT very funny.

I was enchanted, and taped it once when it was on PBS until I found it in video. Now I understand that what I have may have been edited, but even today, thirty years later, it holds up as one of the funniest, most enjoyable films I have ever seen. I show it to everyone who will watch and never tire of it. Matthau and May are perfect. I will never understand why this wonderful film was so sadly neglected."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"I was SO excited to see this finally out on dvd. This is a sightly dark comedy and a bit subtle, no over-the-top slapstick, instead real interesting characters. Elaine May wrote this (I believe with her then-husband Mike Nichols). The story is wonderful and her performance as the befuddled botanist is sheer genius. If you appreciate a good comedy like 'Enchanted April', 'Chocolat' or the early Neil Simon stuff buy this one. I promise you will like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It changed my life","review":"I saw this movie in the theater while I was in the last year of college.

It's got truly hilarious performances from Walter Matthau and Elaine May, as well as from a number of great 60's character actors you're sure to recognize. Literally a HUNDRED laugh out loud moments! This is one of those comedies they don't make anymore, with a lot of perfect observational humor and character studies. This is truly a lost classic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Comedy!!!

Elaine May is wonderderful, but Walter Matthau is perfect. I envy anyone seeing it for the first time. I think an appreciation of interesting character types may be an important personal preference of those who find that they just love this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a terrific, but still relevent movie","review":"Of all of Elaine May's work in my humble opinion this is by far and away the best. Ms. May wrote and directed this satire about a narcissistic, hedonistic middle aged man who faces poverty after grossly abusing the trust fund left to him. In desperation he decides to solve his problems by marrying a rich woman. The rest of the movie is about his journey to find love in unexpected places and how he comes to live a very different life than ever considered.Walther Mathau and Elaine May are outstanding and very believable. The rest of the cast are excellent as well. The dialogue is spot on, the performances are so well well done it is difficult not to get drawn in right away.This one is well worth the watch. It is humorous, sad, poignant, and subtle, with an ending that surprises us all."},{"rating":"2","title":"A New Convert","review":"I first saw this film at a friend's home several months ago and was an immediate convert.

A lazy spoilt dandy found himself pennyless due to his prodigality and lack of the most elementary financial skills. His Jeeves-like butler suggests marriage whit a rich woman... and fom here we go in a delightfully funny story,brilliantly acted and written, whit many unguessable turns.The scene of the marriage proposal whit goofy but gentle heiress is histerically funny.

I had no idea that she wrote and directed this film as well. I have been a longtime fan of Nichols and May, and of course Walter Matthau. Some great characters performed admirably by George Rose, Jack Weston and James Coco as well. Clearly this film was written with such great NY talent in mind. I only wish Ms. May had done more films in her career, she has such a gift in presenting such memorable characters. It is one of the warmest dark comedies I have in my film collection. . . enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"its nothing at all like harold and maude","review":"not that ive seen harold and maude: to me this is a great love story with some very funny bits in between:i love the way elaine may's character prevails at the end despite matthau's attempts to knock her off through most of the film: and the last scene (?) is priceless: they both sit, grading essays in their luxurious study: elaine may has transformed matthau from a playboy to a professor. The irony."},{"rating":"2","title":"Elaine May is Adorable","review":"This movie is subtly hysterical (which sounds like a contradiction in terms, but it's not.)

Tender and sweet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent forgotten gem.","review":"Elaine May's \\"A New Leaf\\" is a hilarious dark comedy from the early seventies. Matthau and May are a perfect team here: he's a self-centered gold-digger and she's an unrepentant nerd. It's a love story--a romantic comedy, but in a very dark, wry way. Every scene feels original and new. It's beautifully shot as well. The film deserves a place among the other \\"auteur generation\\" films of the early 70s, next to the films of Robert Altman, Hal Ashby, Francis Ford Coppola, and Arthur Penn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Used one for over 40 years.

I add to it now, but if you are looking for a great way to easily improve the taste of your meals, you only need to use this seasoning.Large amounts for meat, chicken and seafood, but smaller amounts, trial and error, for other things.
