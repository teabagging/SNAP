Reasonably priced, compact, very easy to use and accurate. First tested the unit on myself as my BP and pulse are consistent and easy obtain. Then tested the unit on my wife who's BP is very difficult to get. We were very skeptical of the unit at first because she normally requires a trained nurse to get BP using a large cuff with a stethescope and pulse taken manually. But the Omron HEM629 BP Monitor was so easy that my wife placed it on her own wrist, placed it up high by her heart while in a relaxed state, pressed the button (unit has amazing power!) and got accurate readings which were VERY close to those take in the doctors offices.

I told them that this is a defective unit (manufacturer's defect), they should not charge customer for return postage.I feel that Omron who shipped the defective product should have the courtesy to paid for their own postage. The fault is with them and not consumers, thus we should NOT have to paid for their mistakes.This is the first and last for me, I do not recommend buying any unit from Omron.

But, if BP is not at a risky level, this is acceptable.

Hurting from the ordeal, he heads off to Paris to forget about Jane. Wow, the Apeman in the City of Lights! So he spends time in Paris, almost has an affair with a Russian noblewoman, whups on her brother(an evil Russian spy), hangs out in art galleries and operas and eventually joins the French Secret Service out of boredom. All this is just the set-up for the rest of the novel. The book does seem to end too quickly but I think that has more to do with the serial/pulp nature of the story's publication deadline than any fault of the author. Tarzan and The Return of... are an entertaining 0ne-Two punch. Anyone who reads #1 should finish the experience by reading #2.

Being strictly 1st Foundation myself, I used to get 99% of what I needed from the Llama, but curiosity drove me into the Panther's clutches and I was amazed at how much I managed to pick up. I did struggle from Chapter 17 onwards, where it gets a bit hairy, but this is because of my failings, not those of the author. From what I can make out, if you do manage to overcome Chapters 17 to 20, you will almost certainly be able to join the 2nd Foundation's noble rank of Perl Porters. Good Luck.

I really appreciate the author's mastery of the language.I've read through 3 quarters of the book but the only thing that I couldn't stand was the author's usage of the English language. He seems to have concentrated on the English part of the book as much as the perl part of it. :( Usage of words/phrases like \\"kosher\\", \\"syntactic sugar\\" are irritating and convey the impression that the author wants to show off his command of English.Nevertheless, this is, as far as I can think, one of the most essential perl reference books for the serious programmer.

A solid hard-rocking album highlighted by \\"One Shot\\", \\"If There is Something\\" and \\"Stateside\\", it delivers 13 songs, most of them good-to-exceptional, with great musical variety. Either of the first two of those could have been a hit single, as Reeves Gabrels shines in \\"If There Is Something\\" with terrific soloing. This is a great addition, however anonymous, to any rock-fan's collection, and worth every cent of the 10-to-20 dollars one would pay for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great album","review":"Tin Machine II is good (not as good as the first Tin Machine cd, but still...good). The editorial reviewer that you see above is a nerd who obviously can't recognize good music if it slapped him in the face. Tin Machine was a great band and I like this cd. Tin Machine's first cd is one that I instantly loved, but this one grew on me over time. The songs are a lot different on here than on Tin Machine's first cd. My favorite song on here is definately \\"Betty Wrong\\". It's such a cool song . \\"Goodbye Mr. Ed\\" has some great lyrics in it and it's a great closing tune, but unfortunately Tin Machine II has a bonus track at the end. It's an instrumental track and it's about a minute long.

After purchasing the book, I discovered that most of the same information was available, organized in much the same way, on the TechNet section of Microsoft's web site.

B: the \\"God-fearing\\" Puritans, following the King Philip's War, proudly displayed Phillip's (Metacom) head on a stave at the entrance to Plymouth.

The problem with this mug is that although it is stainless steel, it only keeps the coffee hot for about an hour. I am currently using a plastic Starbucks mug that keeps coffee hot for about the same amount of time.Another thing I do not like the that the coffee has to pass through the valve apparatus, which affects the taste and limits the flow. Keep in mind I often like to gulp my coffee. Even though I clean the valve often, it seems to get dirty and affect the flavor.A spill-proof mug is not an important aspect for me, but the Trudeau did fare well in this regard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks after a couple of weeks of use","review":"This mug is great for about a month, then it LEAKS everywhere.

What I don't like:-The mug dribbles coffee from the lid seam onto your lap as you try to sip your coffee.-The mug is difficult to wash properly because of the lid design, and also because when you immerse the body in water, water goes into the bottom of the mug and gets stuck inside sloshing around and leaking water all over you the next time you try to use the mug.-The inside of the mug is coated with some sort of polymer that gives off a neverending disagreeable smell. You cannot wash this smell away. It's still there after all this time, and it ruins the taste of the coffee.I don't understand all the reviews that say this mug is leak-proof.

The Twist-top lock prevents any ADDITIONAL liquid from escaping; however after you've taken a sip, residual liquid sits in the 360 degree slits. Even when locked that portion will spill everytime. This mug does NOT hold its contents Hot as long as my Starbucks version; although it does outlast the plastic travel mugs. With so many holes to drink out of, when you get to the bottom of your cup and tip it up, your coffee starts to pour out too many holes and ends up going around your mouth and down your chin. I work in a dusty environment and like the flip top mugs because it actually protects the drinking area from getting dirty. The twist top locks the drink from under the lid, so any dirt or dust sits on the entire drinking area and is always exposed. This will do the job, but there's many other options that I would prefer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I bought two for my husband to take to work.

It does seem to be constructed well and the inside is stainless, however it has some significant draw backs. The most significant is that because the lid pours from a complete circle all the way around as opposed to a single opening, if you tilt the cup too much the liquid will come out from everywhere and end up running down your face and onto your clothes (easy to do when driving). Also, the handle comes down so far that it does not fit into most car cup holders well because the handle hits the center console and it doesn't sit flat. Lastly, (very minor complaint) when I first got the cup no liquid would come out because the screw controlling the flow was way too tight and I had to loosen it to be able to drink anything.I guess I'll keep searching for a good all stainless travel mug....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hand wash only.","review":"It's possible I missed it in other people's reviews, but this is a hand-wash only mug. Additionally, the whole open/close knob on the lid doesn't really perform as one would want. In my case, the darn thing just always stays closed. Yet again, I've been beat down by \\"improvements\\".

(My other favorite readings include Chung and Rozhdestvensky.) In other symphonies like the 4th, Vanska tends toward a blustery and overly fast and vehement treatment that really fails to capture the scale, depth, and majesty of the music. Here, however, his tempos are perfectly judged, and even the \\"pastoral\\" dreaminess of the second movement comes through. Arguably some of the tympani playing in the first movement is overly vehement, but this performance nevertheless is first rate and I listen to it often, as the 1st is one of my favorite Nielsen symphonies."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Enter Ye\\" and watch a great Christmas movie!","review":"I first saw this film back in the 90's on A&E.

I think we babyboomers could all enjoy some tunes that can relax the soul in this hectic, fast paced world in which we live.

It's hard to believe such finicky, over-pointed phrasing is really sincere. Maybe Rattle's trying to bring Schubert into the canon of clipped, shallow period Beethoven. Whatever the intention, this is charmless conducting and playing, without an ounce of relaxation or joyful high spirits. Absent those qualities--so perfecttly captured by Beehcam's recordings of the early symphonies--it's pointless to fiddle while Schubert burns. Many other conductors have given us memorable Ninths--my favorites are Bernstein on Sony, Klemperer on EMI, and Sinopoli on DG--but this is far from adding to the list."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy unless you want an expensive, basic install guide","review":"This book is no different from RedHat installation manuals/information that can be read on the web for free. Horrid as a reference manual. Buy 'Running Linux' instead. ISBN 156592469X. Regret that I ever bought this book. In addition it is old (RedHat 7.2 and not 8.0)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Introduction to Linux","review":"My only mistake about buying this book is it wasn't my first one. I really think it does an awesome job of taking you thru most of the questions you'd have as a new user of Red Hat Linux, and explains things fully enough for now. When you're finished with this, getting O'Reilly's Running Linux is definitely a good follow-up purchase. It seems every question i went crazy trying to figure out with all of my advanced books, was right here in Learning Red Hat Linux. If you're new to the game, get this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Dummies !","review":"I'm really disappointed, the contents are just full of steps for installations. Many screenshots of installation screens. I think this's book is just for dummies which use linux just for the first time and for fun. Too short descriptions, not clear enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Learning Red Hat Linux","review":"This book's target audience is obviously the Linux newbie, not just Red Hat newbies. For someone experienced in using Linux, this probably is not a book you would want to purchase. The book does, however, go into some decent newbie level tutorials. What I found to be less desirable was the amount of reliance this book had on linuxconf which, as an experienced Linux user, I prefer not to use. Best I can tell, linuxconf is generally not the admin tool of choice. The book did go into other options, but not to the extent that I had hoped."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking for a shallow spot to wade into Linux?","review":"This book is an excellent primer book for beginners jumping into Linux. More specifically, Red Hat Linux version 7.2 though they are currently working on 7.4 beta. The author presents the chapters logically beginning with step-by-step installation and leading into familiarizing you with the more useful applications available. I would have wished for a more thorough look into Samba and Apache but that may have been out of the target audience they were aiming for. There is information dealing with setting up networking, DHCP service and modem configuration. By the way, you might as well toss out your winmodem and obtain a hardware modem (external is the best) as the author does not mention the difficulty when trying to get one to work. You also get one full chapter dealing with shell commands which should wet anyone's appetite to learn more. Overall, not a bad book to begin with. Seasoned Linux professionals need not apply."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for beginers!","review":"With so many books about Linux on the market, it is really a difficult to know which books are good and which are not. Learning Red Hat Linux, published by O'Reilly at their famous book series, shows the basic steps at the Linux world, based on the Red Hat distribution. This book doesn't show Linux's advanced configurations, but this is the greatest point of this work: it is a very easy, quick and pratical guide for all those who need to quickly learn this new operating system and doesn't want to spend time reading complicated and hard to understand books."},{"rating":"2","title":"New to Linux","review":"I am from the world of Windows, but felt that my career was suffering by putting off learning any kind of Unix/Linux. So I bought this book and in less than two hours I was dual booting my Win2k laptop with Linux. Incredible. Now having read this book, in less than a week I now know the command line utilities and how to get around the shell. The install found all my drivers on my Sony Viao and I was surfing the net from my cable modem without a problem. I highly recommend this book for anybody wanting to break into the world of Linux. Bill McCarty did an excellent job in giving the newbie the confidence to tackle a new OS. Great job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very basic introduction to Linux","review":"I did not like this book. I found all of what was in book just on the Linux website. I was hoping for a detailed introduction to Linux. For instance, it covered the steps involved with installing red hat linux by describing the options you had at each point, but not what each option means. A list of options I can get from the screen, I need help on what those options mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything Jack Does Is Right","review":"This recording is just as amazing as all of the other recordings Jack has made.

This was one of them and was easily the worst of the lot.I am rating it 2 stars but it really was a one-star experience. Repetitive without being cleverly so, unsophisticated without guffaws, neither subtle nor over-the-top... I am amazed to find that so many people before me actually enjoyed this. I wasn't offended, confused, or alienated by the content. I was bored. To give you an idea: If a joke like \\"I tried smoking mushrooms once but couldn't keep the pizza lit\\" followed by the non-infectious chuckling of the comedian himself... if hearing a comedian try to commiserate with you on how everybody's sisters just barge into the bathroom and put on makeup while you are taking a dump... If these are your cup of tea, then by all means drink this. You are in for a full CD of this kind of stuff. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Funny once in awhile","review":"This cd is funny once in awhile. Listening to once a week is deadly.

It's the first book of his I've bought and the last. He is verbose. I needed steak - not sizzle.Further, I don't believe the author really knows what he's talking about. I needed help on hooking up an ethernet printer on a peer-to-peer network. This doesn't strike me as rocket science. Instead, I get pages of the history of networking. Who cares.I then needed help on an ODBC issue. No coverage is this \\"Complete Guide\\".I wanted quick, bulletized text on issues that a user would expect to find in a complete guide. If I had a fire place - this would be in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"When you need to know, it's here.","review":"Despite the fact that Millenium and Win2K have been released, for support folks the version of Windows we most often encounter is still Win98. This book has just about everything you need to know about Windows 98 right there between the covers.Unlike one of the other previous reviewers, I found the background and theory portions of the book to be incredibly useful in figuring out just what has gotten out of whack with a system that is giving me fits. The explanations of memory usage, peripheral drivers, and FAT32 should be required reading for anyone who does more than word processing on their computer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unevenly written and dangerous book","review":"I bought this book because of the Peter Norton name. Now I am starting to wonder whether he has much familiarity with Windows98. The book is rather superficially written, and does not go into specifics if you are actually trying to fix something, or get something to work. If you wish to get Direct Cable Connection to work, for example, I would look elsewhere. Some things in this book are just dangerous. The authors suggest that the reader run a utility called LFNBK.EXE from the Windows CD. I did as they suggested and my computer was rendered unusable! The proper utility that performs what they describe is SULFNBK in the Windows\\\\Command directory. Anyway, after that experience, I have lost all confidence in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy money for the authors.","review":"If you own the book \\"Peter Norton's Complete Guide to Windows 95\\" 1998 edition, then you don't need this one.

I am really disappointed with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Power cables make a difference","review":"I purchase the Monster Cable Powerline 200 to replace the stock power cord that came with my 200 watt B&K amplifer. It did just that improving the image quality and cohesiveness of the sound. I found it to be a relatively inexpensive way to improve the overall sound of my amplifier. Ultimately, the Powerline 200 was replaced by a PS Audio power cord, which proved to make an even bigger improvement in sound, especially in the bass department. All in all, the Powerline 200 is a good product though and I think it is worth a try. I now use it on my surround sound receiver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I had in mind!","review":"It's a nice heavy power wire and that's it. It's being used to power my hometheater sub. Cant tell if there's a difference. But one thing that is Anoying is that the pluging that gos to the sub is is to big for the cord. Along with a different sub as well. So it dosnt stay in very good. Overall I wouldn't recommend it. Especially the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"ok but it's not all that","review":"I was very disappointed with this game.

It is fun seeing characters from the cartoon, but when you get to the 1930's world, and the Martians world, you get fists of fury. I recommend renting the game before buying it. But don't think of it as the worst game on the planet either. Hey, I liked it! Don't give it to 5-year-old gamers that are way too used to stuff like Spyro and Crash, because it gets frustratingly hard in some places.

This one concerns two families on different sides of religious and political disputes in England. Of course the son of one family and the daughter of the other are in love - kind of like Romeo and Juliet in England without the death at the end. There is action and romance, evil plotting and violence, and just when you think the bad guys are all black they do things that surprise you. Not only a good history lesson but a thumping good read.

All was well until I reached \\"Bech Noir\\" in which our hero takes murderous (yet flippant) revenge on his literary enemies. This was so ludicrously out of character that I kept waiting for the authorial signal that it was just the protagonist's fantasy. Unfortunately, it never came. I don't know whether Updike was being contemptuous or just plain stupid. But not only did his trashing of my suspension-of-disbelief ruin this book for me, it cast a retrospective pall over the previous ones.Ironically, a new first-rate Bech story appeared in The New Yorker some time later. Presumably, it will be included in the omnibus Bech edition being published in 2001. I only pray that Updike, who is known for his post-publication tinkering, will come to his senses and leave \\"Bech Noir\\" out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed First Experience With Updike","review":"John Updike is one of those names I had always heard of but had never checked out. Finally, a few weeks ago, I decided that it was time for me to get acquainted with Mr. Updike. I must say that the first work I chose to read of his did not disappoint me.Bech at Bay is the last in a series of books that feature Henry Beck, and aged writer who still manages to find himself in precarious adventures. Bech at Bay is a series of short stories that loosely make up a larger story. At times hilarious, at times insightful, and at times rather disturbing, I found myself quite pleased with Mr. Updike's work. I look forward to reading more of it.~Scott William Foley, author of Souls Triumphant"},{"rating":"1","title":"James Markus, you are a dolt","review":"John Updike is NOT Nabokov's equal in any sense, let alone in the realm of the metaphysical novel, in which Nabokov is and will forever remain God. Updike, unlike Nabokov, is constantly begging the reader to pity his nasty, dull protagonists. Everything seems to go right for them, despite their best efforts to fail and feel sorry for themselves, yet we're expected to cheer them allong and cry for them when they experience minor setbacks? No thanks. Nabokov's multi-layored gems offer no easy heroes and no simple-minded moral messages. That said, I think Updike can be really good. The Centaur is a wonderfull book, and some of his short fiction is great. His serially-destributed fiction is, however, far to long-winded and thick-headed and self-serving to be compared to anything by Nabokov. If Nabokov has an American successor, it's Pynchon or Barth, not Updike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Great product, good price! There are a whole lot of paper towels in this box!

I am so tired of grudging through 3 or 4 chapters of unnecessary detail just to get something installed and working. Don't get me wrong. Detail is good but if your a Linux book author, simplify the install and configuration so we can get whatever it is working, then go into the detail.Go ahead and get this one for DNS. You don't really have a choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"The bible of BIND","review":"I work as DNS Administrator for a ccTLD registry.

This book does a great job of that. The book is accurate and well organized and it holds a reserved spot on my shelf of regular reference guides. I recommend a little bit of basic knowledge of DNS when starting this book and then re-read the first chapter or two, but it does a great job of explaining DNS so that even Microsoft-centric people like me can understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"raw reaction","review":"Heavy. Heavy heavy heavy. This is a very psychedelic and psychological record. Phenomenal. Tim and Todd Tobias make great weird music here, and Pollards vocals are at times beautiful, at times demented, and always lyrically brilliant.Act 2 is the weirder of the two sides.

And here, Robert Pollard and the Tobias Bros channel their inner Chrome-ness. As with much of the music released from The Pollard trust in the last five years, it is for the open minded or devoted listener. While not as focused as that superior head fest \\"The Harold Pig Memorial\\" , it is not as bad as the tiresome Ringworm Interiors. The band has the sense to space out such endurance tests as Plasma and Raw Reaction with tracks like \\"Gargoyle City\\", \\"Glass Boots\\", \\"Sick Color\\" and \\"Don't Be Late\\". This is as close to an Amp Rep record as Pollard has ever gotten. And that makes it a unique album in his formidable discography. Not an entry point for all but that most outre listener.

So little of that is done, it makes a classic tv show hard to follow, think of the new Perry Mason , with Monte Markham. Well done only had short run , I quess to cerebal for younger audiences ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Show But Terrible Transfer","review":"The original Mission Impossible was a great show and the 1988 revival of the show that lasted only two seasons was also great. The concept of taking the original star Peter Graves and surrounding him with a new young group of agents was brilliant. My only disappointment is the quality of the video transfer. It looks like the source material was a VHS, Super VHS, or 3/4\\" copy. It is the worst quality I have ever seen for a major studio release of a network tv series. Either pristine source material has been lost or they just didn't care enough to take the effort to do this the right way. Very disappointing they didn't show more respect to this show when bringing it to DVD. I have the 1989 season ordered now and it is in transit. I am hoping it is better quality video transfer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as good as the original series...","review":"Just finished watching the \\"88\\" season even thought some of the episodes are retreads from the original series the updated technology of the 80's make the \\"new\\" episodes fresh & exciting, such as holograms, laser thumb print reader etc. Now, about the discs themselves, the image is not as sharp as the 70's series, judging from the promo line \\"in stereo where available\\" it appears that this set was transferred from a vhs master rather than from the original film element. Since the series was filmed in Australia, it could be CBS/Paramount was not able to track down the original film source. Any fans out there can fill me in on this one? I still give it 5 stars just because it is available in dvd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mission Impossible-The 88 TV season","review":"Outstanding. Peter Graves did not lose any of his abilities to keep us on the edge of our seat with age. I hope they come out with the 89 TV series. The suspense is just like it was in the old series. I liked the old series and this one JUST as much. Thanks, Paul"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good and bad","review":"As with any series, especially as long running a series as the original \\"Mission\\", there are some very good and some not so good episodes in this collection. I agree with some of the other reviewers in saying that I found the casting to be a little strange, but not all that bad. For one thing, in this series one of the cast has her character killed off, something that never happened in the original series. I found a couple of the episodes actually more entertaining than some of the originals. If you have never seen the original Mission Impossible (and I am not talking about the over-done movies) you will have no problem with this series. If you are familiar with the original team then you cannot help but make comparisons. Still, there is enough of the old \\"Mission Impossible\\" flavor to make this a welcome addition to any collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea...too much errata","review":"I got this book thinking it would be a great start on ASP programing with Visual Interdev.Although I have learned alot, it has taken a lot longer due to, as other reviewers have pointed out, poor layout, poor coding (errata all over the place) and no coding standards.

If you are interested in how hard it would be to port the gui of an app from another OS to Be, this may help. But don't expect help on developing for Be much beyond an overview of the basic UI components. Heck, this doesn't even cover how to create your own components...just use the pre-defined ones.

I have to admit that its a bit of a disappointment now that I've gotten through a good portion of the book.While what it does cover is explained fairly well, the book is quite weak in many areas. While it gives a fairly good introduction into programming for Be, it doesn't go into detail where it really matters. The book lacks depth when introducing the reader to the ways of the Be API. No attempt is made at explaing how to create custom controls, not to mention that the book doesn't even cover all the controls made available in the Be API. While it does offer a fairly decent explaination of some of the Interface Kit, I'd say shy away from this one and spend your money on the other BeBooks by O'Reilly.Here's to some better beginner's documentation!"},{"rating":"1","title":"not deserved $40 bucks","review":"The sheet looks terible after washing the first time.

Ricky and David aren't even in most of the episodes, which involve an aging Ozzie bonding with neighborhood kids.

But I have to say that it has been a great disappointment.The quality of these two DVD's are the worst I've seen on DVD. The picture is at times blurred and there are skips in the sound. In one episode entitled, \\"Kris And The Queen\\" the sound is lost half way thru the show.Many of the original TV commericals have been included as a \\"Bonus\\" but the quality is so bad I could not even make out the picture on some.

Sophisticates see it as hokey saccharin family comedy (despite the fact that most American families were two parent households for the time period of the series). What O&H is is a simple, wholesome family sit com that was enormously popular for over a decade - and with good reason. It is warm, family-friendly, amusing (though rarely hilarious - the laugh track is over the top), and people could relate to the situations that still seem familiar to most people. It is too bad that this box set concentrates on the last few years - O&H was at its best when Ricky and David were kids and not married.

How these two lives from far different backgrounds and histories came to impact on each other makes for very interesing reading. As a physician, I particularly found the trials and tribulations of Dr. Schatz, as well as his dedication to science and humanity a refreshing reaffirmation of what dedicating one's life to science and truth is all about. Although vindicated and recognized eventually as the co-discoverer of Streptomycin it is at the same time a sad commentary on the greed and jealousy that exists in the scientific community. I recommend this clearly written engrossing story to all who enjoy reading a true story that is just as interesting as any fiction ever written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Audiobook was good content, marginal audio","review":"I listened to the audiobook version, and this review pertains to that. The material was pretty good, and the examples - like the airline industry and auto repair - bring lean into a perspective that every listener could understand and relate to. It was easy to see how lean methods could be applied - and also the examples went beyond the obvious to things like point to point private jet service, and redesign of planes to permit faster turn times, as examples tpo stretch the imagination.The audio, which was James Womack himself, was a little slow paced and done in a monotone. It was tough to keep my attention while listening in the car - and it wasn't because of the content. I've listened to some great audiobooks done by professional readers who can bring material to life - and would have recommended that these guys do the same thing next time. Womack is arguably the genius behind US lean thinking, but he's not well suited to be a recording artist..."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was dissappointed","review":"I was expecting real life, in depth case studies. Instead I got a rather simplistic view of lean. A lot of the content in the book is real common sense. There is no doubt that lean processes are a must for the company. The book tends to spend 3/4 of its time trying to make that statement, with some high level strategic content thrown about.If you are expecting content such as how companies do VSM, and tactical challenges in doing VSMs you are reading the wrong book. But if you are interested in knowing what is a VSM, and high level overview of how VSMs are done, then this may be the book for you. ***DONT EXPECT TO BE IN A POSITION OF LEADING A LEAN INITIATIVE AFTER READING THIS BOOK***Good book for getting introduced to lean concepts. Not much for those looking beyond concepts."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of British Drama","review":"Simply put, TSTAMD is 11 hours of riveting drama, being without a doubt one of the best mini-series ever produced by the BBC. I first saw it on TV in 1980/81, and have been waiting ever since for it to be released either on tape or DVD. And now it's here, and well worth the wait. The acting is superb. The story is always interesting. Such is the exceptional level of production that you actually feel like you are really there; the characters and story being so well portrayed.The DVD picture quality is superb; however the sound is only average by today's standards but quite acceptable.If you love fine acting, deep character development and a great story this is a must see.BUY 'TO SERVE THEM ALL MY DAYS' TODAY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AT LONG LAST!!!!!!!","review":"I taped this miniseries when it first aired on Masterpiece Theatre many years ago. I have replayed those tapes many times in the intervening years and wondered if and when the series would be available on DVD. Now, just before those tapes wear out, here it is! As Mr. Fetzer says in the synopsis, the acting is impeccable, the story draws your interest quickly and holds you through the entire 13 hours. This is a must for any DVD library. This is well worth the investment in money and time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delderfield Forever","review":"Although this keeps somewhat to the plot in the written version, there are at least three things which were not which could have added to the enjoyment. (1) One of Powlett-Jones' daughters survived the car crash and this would have added some human interest to the plot. (2) Howarth's off-campus relationship would have also contributed to an understanding of the closeness of he and PJ. (3)The ceremony for the dog Towser, the hero of an early dorm fire, upon his death would have been charming. In spite of these omissions, this picture of prep school life, in general, and the recovery from the war experience and personal development of PJ is well worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great and realistic \\"Teachers\\" Movie","review":"Most Teaching movies I avoid like the plague.

Wonderful characters and a resonant plot! The central character is a history teacher, and just as that discipline gives one much to reflect upon--so does this well-paced drama about a schoolmaster at an English public school in the inter war period. As the episodes unfolded, I found myself thinking deeply about the measure of words such as altruism, narcissism, feminism, class, charity, generosity of spirit and a a host of other ponderables, including the elusive meanings of the verb, \\"to love.\\"The concluding episodes left me blubbering over what it means to live a \\"life worth living\\"--a theme raised at the beginning of each episode as they all commence with the singing of the Bamfylde school song, \\"Look Ahead to A Life Worth Living.\\" The series' over riding question for me? What is the cost of a life worth living?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Bit Hammy","review":"Based on Disc 1, this production is a tiny bit on the hammy side, but otherwise very inspiring and uplifiting, with superior acting, plot and character development.

The viewing experience is therefore kind of odd and distracting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother With This Tripe","review":"I am stunned that this series got five stars!!

Such pure heart and yearning for the ideal cannot exist in the world of our everyday life. As you watch the series unfold and allow the characters and story to carry you to that rare place, you are given a sense that life can be so precious and replete with meaning.

Best value for your money","review":"The best and best known of Cyndi Lauper is here (except She Bop). It also has all the B-Side that so far were only on very hard to find and expensive used singles.The packaging is not great but for the price you can hardly ask for more. The quality of the tracks is great. If you are pressed to find info on any of the songs you can get it at cyndilauper.com along with just about everything you need to know about Cyndi. That website is always up-to-date and very accurate."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love Cyndi Lauper","review":"An amazing talent, unrivaled. Well, that's my opinion. The less than stellar review is for the package, not the music.Three CDs in a double CD case I haven't seen since the mid 80s. I thought these CD cases were extinct! Very cheap!There is NO CD book included. All we get is three CDs and a list of tracks. It might as well be a CD-R burned in someone's basement.That being said, there are a few gems that I didn't previously own; this is a good thing. Thanks to the miserable packaging, however, for songs that are new to me I know nothing more than their title. I have no clue when they were recorded or where they first appeared (on the B side of this or that, etc.).For [the price] I think someone somewhere could have put some effort into creating a nice CD package. Cyndi deserves better. When the CD arrived, I was VERY disappointed.No matter what... nothing will ever change the bottom line - I love Cyndi Lauper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomplete","review":"I felt that as far as I got, 30+ pages, the book appeared to be well written. However in the process of going through the installation I encountered a \\"PARTATION NOT LINUX NATIVE FORMATTED\\" notice. So I started over again and encountered the same thing. I then took some time and went through the index, table of contents and paged through each chapter and to no avail did I encounter anything on \\"LINUX NATIVE FORMATTING\\". So I started the installation over again. Same problem. I stopped and went out and bought a different book. In short it was a waste of $ + tax and my time. Aside from this major roadblock, the writing is very clear and concise. I wish all technical books were written with this clearity and format."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book","review":"Our family thought this book was wonderful. My mother grew up in the Cumberland area while the dam was being built and we still have relatives there to this day.

It also gives an accurate depiction of the pain that progress may cause for those in it's path."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thermometer","review":"I like this thermometer very much.

No problem with refund though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Springfield Patio Thermometer","review":"I bought this because it is easier to see than the mercury 'bar' thermometer when on the deck.The problems are several: first, it is inaccurate, it reads about 7 degrees hotter than the actual ambient temperature. Second, it has no good system for hanging. Finally, while it is dirt cheap, we get what we pay for and I should have had no surprise when the plastic cover fell off in about a week.Search around some more and buy a better product - - this is, at best, an indicator."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't go below 40 degrees; inaccurate","review":"Well I guess the quality of these is hit-and-miss, because the one I bought at a local L home improvement store does not register temperatures below 40. There is frost all over the grass, birdfeeders, cars, etc, and our other 2 thermometers read 31 degrees, but this one still says 40. This thermometer has not dropped below 40 degrees once this whole winter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thermometer doesn't work but Amazon does!","review":"This thermometer didn't work. Like another reviewer wrote - it stays at 40-45 degrees all the time. I wish I could give the product a zero but Amazon 5 stars! The refund/return was so easy and Amazon even provides the shipping label so I don't have to pay to return it. I got free super saver shipping to begin with so I'm out $0.

We hung ours on a tree in the back yard that can be easily seen from our dining room but where it is not affected by heat from the house or direct sunlight. We haven't had it long so can't testify to its durability, but we really enjoy the features we have been able to observe: accuracy, ease of viewing and installation and attractiveness. We previously had a digital with wireless remote which seldom worked, so it is a pleasure to see any kind of results at a reasonable price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like others said, this is cheap and doesn't work","review":"Unfortunately, I did not listen to the other two reviewers who stated that this was a very cheaply made product that doesn't work.

It is \\"lightweight\\" so it is shaky to secured and the bimetal spring is not protected .I have had to move it from the place for where I wanted it to a place that was my 3rd star choice for accuracy.

So I added a star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy something decent instead","review":"Don't waste your money. Its not accurate and if it was, its too cheaply made to last.

It is off by as much as 5 degrees. It does not pay to send it back because the shipping cost makes it prohibitive. But Amazon had the best prices for this product that I saw anywhere. Again too bad that the product is defective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap and inaccurate","review":"I bought this large outdoor themometer because it had graduaions for temperatures that can be seen from a distance. I mounted it approximately 75-80 away on the outside of a wood shed in an area not in direct sunlight. I read the reviews before I purchased it, some were good, some bad, so I took a chance. It is cheaply made, doubt if it will last one season of cold and hot temps, but the worst is that it was reading 6 degrees higher than the acutal temp. I put a smaller outdoor themometer, bulb style, which i knew to be accurate. I have been able to twist the metal coil in back and got it down to 4 degree lower, twisted it again to read the same temp as the smaller guage. Don't know if this will work, but worth a try. Recommendations, keep looking for a better build and more accurate themometer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an accurate thermometer.","review":"Nice large numbers = yes.

The last one (same style & brand) held up for 8 years. That's why I bought another one. The last one had a cover over the thermo-coil, but this one doesn't. I hope it doesn't get rusty of cloged with bug nests."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pretty Good Collection","review":"I enjoyed this boxed collection of rock appearances by different groups, mostly in the 60s with a few 50s appearances. I was a little annoyed that some of the songs appeared on more than one disk, so there are repeated songs. Still, there are several disks worth of music, with quite a cross section of artists. Motown is strongly represented here and if you like that music, you'll love this collection. There is a disk devoted to the British invasion artists also. I would have liked to see more of the Beatles appearances; the only one I saw was the initial one. Overall a fine collection, but it could have been a bit better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money.","review":"While this is a nicely packaged set the contents are disappointing. Sure, you get a 144 performances but they are edited. For the price I was expecting the complete performance by an artist. And it's not because of lack of space on the DVD. I also question the choices of artists/songs or artists omitted. Do we really need two songs by Dino, Desi and Billy? What about the Dave Clark Five? A group so well liked by Ed Sullivan that they had an open invitation to appear on his show. Why were they absent from the British Invasion discs? As Herman's Hermits once sang, this is \\"A Must To Avoid\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on Rhino!","review":"What other reviewers have noted is correct: the various performances on these DVDs are not necessarily complete, and, for a $143.99 price tag, there should be a LOT more material! Only 9 DVDs for that price is alone insane, but in addition the individual DVDs are lacking in terms of minutes/hours presented. The only way this set even manages a one-star rating from me is because there are some great and historical performances included, incomplete or otherwise. A fair price for this set would probably be in the $10-$20 range. Unfortunately, Rhino's price on this item is the epitomy of price-gouging."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great trip back in time","review":"First the negatives,as other reviewers have pointed out:Too much repetition, this could have easily been a 5 or 6 disc set and the fact many of the songs are heavily edited. That said, I did enjoy this package..a wide variety of music including shows devoted to Elvis,the Supremes and the Temptations..by shows I mean the half hour syndicated shows that make up this collection.I enjoyed the background information along with the historical clips and the narration by Jay Thomas..same guy from Murphy Brown and Cheers and a very good disc jockey.This is probably the most comprehensive music set put together and those Sullivan intros are priceless. He once forgot the Supremes name and said \\"here are the girls!\\" There are a lot of great artists represted and goes back to 1955 right through the end of the show in 1971/The asking price is a bit steepbut if you can find it for under $100..go for it. A better rock and roll time capsule you won t find."},{"rating":"1","title":"buyer beware","review":"just wanted to chime in here and say that this box really is a tremendous [disappointment]. steer clear of it. as mentioned the performances are heavily edited. i thought the beatles had deliberately omitted the solo on \\"from me to you\\" until i looked at the same performance on the \\"first visit\\" dvd. there it was. total misrepresentation. really a disservice to the artists and to the consumer. if that's not enough the whole thing is ridiculously arranged with an annoying theme played throughout. and as everyone's mentioned you're paying for 9 discs when you should be paying for 4 or 5. by all means pass on this box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money!!!","review":"Save your money!!! Have the 12 DVD set Rock n' Roll Classics Complete Collection. Performances are shortened versions of full songs. Performances are clipped! Some videos start immediately without any intro and end before the last notes of the song are completed. Some performances are duplicated. Video quality sucks in some performances and should have been digitally remastered. All video is in 4:3 aspect ratio as expected. Audio is mono, but sounds OK. All performances could probably fit on 6-8 DVDs instead of 12. Rhino / Sofa Entertainment blew it on this one. Too expensive at $149."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing set!!!!","review":"Buyers beware! Most of the performances on this Ed Sullivan DVD box set have been cut. How in the world can you take a 2 minute song and cut it? Well, Rhino found a way. This would have been a great set if all 144 songs were complete. Surely they had enough space on each DVD (60 minutes per disc? Come on). I'm sending my set back for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT'S JUST OK !!!","review":"The reviews on this box seem to vary from great to rotten. Yes, I agree that it's got some value due to its historic content. But make no mistake, these performances are chopped. The thing that burns me up, is that its not just long jams that are cut, but very short songs also. To end all confusion with artists doing shortened versions on purpose, I ask you to view the DVD of The Beatles: First U.S. Visit. Compare the same songs, played on the same night back in 1964. This is a dececptive product that tries to fool the unsuspecting buyer. It took me several viewings to figure it out. Shame on you Rhino!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SAVE YOUR MONEY!!!","review":"I know there seems to be an ongoing debate whetherthese performances are full-length or not, but takeit from someone who watched this show faithfullyevery week, and then later saw the chopped-up,syndicated versions. THESE PERFORMANCES ARE NOTCOMPLETE. Some of them end just as they are pick-ing up steam. It's a shame the way Rhino orwhoever has butchered this legacy. This set is a HUGE disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"In short, the value you get out of this box set is worth rubbish.Each of the nine DVD's had only 60 minutes on each, which could of easily been cut down to 3 or 4 DVD's. In addition they cut down each song even though they are short enough in the full versions. I'm warning you: do not buy. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coincidental","review":"I was browsing in Amazon and saw the perfect mateto the simple rain gauge that I received two or three Christmases ago and which I use after every rain.

Other books of the stories of Krishna would inspire me and melt my heart. This book just gave me a headache. For a devotee of Krishna, he is completely cerebral. This book is so heady that there is little room in it for heart. He tries to be from the heart. His language is from the heart. But the feeling from the book is dry and heady.

I have become more critical of their content in the process. This is my second audio tape from this author and I must admit that he is among my least favorites.Mr Waitley stlye is similar to that of a football coach with too many 'one liners' we have all heard while someone humms 'America the Beautiful' in the background. It became irritating and difficult to maintain attention to his words. He is also too wordy to get his point across.I am sure there are people who appreciate this man's style and may find him dynamic. I found him less knowledgable and making up for it with his cheerleading analogies.I won't buy any more of his tapes. I prefer Brian Tracy for the same subject matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Outdated Book That Never Gets To The Point","review":"This 1970's book is a low quality printing.

The piano instruction portions are sound, however, and the CD provides a lot of jazzed up guidance and hints without being too overbearing. I'm not real sure that a pure beginner could learn to play from this book, but an advanced beginner to intermediate student would surely glean some useful hints from this book and have fun while doing so. I loved the author's section on how to improvise and improve a song ending. All in all, useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time or money.","review":"I tried to read this book. I really did try, but I gave up on page 52 because I couldn't take Mr. Neely's pathetic attempts at being amusing. He seems to feel that he has to be 'cute' because a straight book on playing the piano wouldn't be interesting enough. Or perhaps he didn't have enough to say and had to pad the book somehow. The one bright spot is that I took this book out of the library instead of wasting money on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste you time","review":"I liked the book up to page 83.

As just one example; no explanation is given as to why the whole notes are written both on lines and also then in between lines,and how to read them in relation to middle \\"C\\". The rest of Chapter six then begins to speed up and like a starship and it moves into lightning speed making the book worthless past page 83. Feel like I wasted my money. P.S.

He enjoyed the book and it came before his b day and it was new and well packed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good on the Fundamentals","review":"I enjoyed this book. It's written in the breezy, irreverant style of the Dummies series, which can annoy or ease depending on the author; in this case ease. It filled in many of the holes in my musical education (I was taught by computer).Still, I would say not to expect miracles. A book (or a computer) is no substitute for a qualified human instructor. It is only an aid, but a good one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now I can play","review":"I bought the book the other day and breezed right thru it. It's great in that you can skip around the book to the sections you NEED to read (or refresh yourself on). I keep it handy because I often refer to it. It is thorough in explaining various aspects of reading music, playing, etc. The humor interspersed makes it enjoyable to read rather than boring but the humor doesn't detract from the content and lesson. Glad I bought it and you should buy it, too, if you want to teach yourself how to play!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Condecending, patronising, badly edited, impossible to read.","review":"This book is aimed at the LOWEST possible common demoninator. I certainly won't be purchasing any more dummies books. Filled with pathetic one-liners and bad analogies, any useful content is obliterated by forced gags and the consistent ending of every paragraph with a bad pun. This is not only the worst edited book I've ever seen, but it also failed to introduce all musical notation before presenting it on a score, leaving me wondering what I'm supposed to do when I reached certain symbols (ie: the rest symbol). Not reccomended at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"piano lessons","review":"Checked this out from the library and realized that I would enjoy having this on my shelf.

Come on people, is the same people in Miami, with the same brainless arrangements, the foolish and silly lyrics, the overproduced Casio quality recordings, and the poor artistic vision of its musicians. When is it going to end? No more good music comes from Latin America; it's all monopolized by the same people in the Estefan network. These individuals must be pushed away from the music scene. Latin America won't be able to grow into one big nation because the big media and entertainment companies are ruled by poor, unimaginative, uninspired, unoriginal, untalented, ignorant, illiterate, and uneducated low class professionals."},{"rating":"1","title":"defective","review":"I ordered the smoker for my son for Christmas, when he tried to use it the lid was too little and just fell down in the smoker.

The base unit was out of round and I struggled to get the top packaged in it out. The top was perfectly round and the base could never be \\"squeezed\\" just right to allow a proper fit. There was always a gap of at least 3/8\\" on one side. I took it back to the store and because of my time putting it together, they offered me an upgrade for the same price. Same problem on two more so I said forget it got a refund. Poor workmanship and quality control."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not functional as is.","review":"I purchased this smoker a year ago, to start cooking out some ribs for a family gathering. I had a long time ago the electric version of this cooker, and since getting into charcoal with my grill -- thought that I might as well go Charcoal with the smoker as well (Charcoal + Wood is a heck of a lot of fun for me).Well, this thing could not keep temps up no matter what. The ash would choke out the fire, and I was constantly tending it. The end result was fine -- it just was a TON of work! Threw it out a few months ago, and got a Weber Bullet Smoker.I'm running it now, and it has been maintaining a temperature of 235 degrees (+/- 5 degrees) for the last 4 hours! It's a bit more expensive ($200 compared to $35) but if you want something that will last you and you can afford it, I completely recommend that smoker."},{"rating":"1","title":"It does work, just not very well...","review":"I actually didnt purchase this smoker, luckily, but I borrowed it from a friend to try out. I've had about 10 successful smokes on it, but it is not as easy as it should be. In order to even get the thermometer to read in the ideal range, I've found that not filling the water pan at all is the key. Otherwise it gets stuck on the cool/ideal line. My smokes have taken 3-4 hours longer then expected due to the ashes choking the fire out. I would have to stir the coals and knock ash off every 30 min to retain a decent temperature. As soon as I have the money, I will buy the Weber Smokey Mountain and give this smoker back to my friend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tasty and cheap","review":"Pros: Cheap smoker, easy to modify, tasty bbq, good first-time smoker purchase, capacity feeds 10 peopleCons: Needs modification (drilling holes) for air flow, need to keep an eye on it b/c it doesn't hold a steady temp."},{"rating":"1","title":"very dissapointed","review":"i broke a piece putting it together and cannot order a new part because char-broil does not answer the phone and you cannot order a new part online been 3 weeks everyday calling and no answer.

Now it's been tested good...","review":"I left a review after we tested it once. Well, we have used it a lot and we just think it's one heck of a smoker and one heck of a buy. We have smoked fish after catching them ourselves. WOW what a treat. We now have fresh salmon and tuna to smoke. My son wants to do a turkey soon. Don't pass this one up. You can learn how to do it after the first try. It's worth it. By the way, the CABERNET WOODS CHIPS made that fish just perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Get What You Pay For...","review":"The problem with this smoker is that it is very difficult to achieve and maintain a high enough temperature to hot smoke foods. After I performed the usual modifications it worked better, but it was still no great shakes. That said, it works pretty well for cold smoking (below 150 degrees). So if your main focus is curing bacon or pastrami say, this will probably be serviceable and I've gotten a lot of use out of mine in that application. But I think most people would be better served by skipping this product and getting a higher quality unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design","review":"This smoker is impossible to add fuel to once the water pan is in place, so maintaining sufficient heat is also impossible. Also, no \\"user\\" manual came with the smoker, so it takes a lot of experimenting for a new user to figure out how to use it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fundamentally defective","review":"I agree with most of the criticisms already stated. It is literally impossible to add additional coals. Also, the grate/water pan supports are garbage -- difficult to place the bowl with the fire hot, and then it will frequently tip. Maybe my technique isnt perfect, but I have had only two successful uses of this thing. I may make additional changes, e.g. removing one grate and mounting the water bowl higher. Maybe that will open up an area to load coals more easily. In addition, my father has a two-piece smoker that lifts to add the coals -- FAR better for the same price. AVOID this smoker, IMO."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for people with skin allergies!","review":"I have numerous skin allergies and have never been able to use ANY sunblocker before this product.

People tell him stories, then completely contradict themselves mere moments later. It happens again and again. Are they lying? Whose memory is affected?

The Tops did a surprisingly short medley of three of their hits. They looked great up there and there were some humorous parts (I thought). The Supremes looked wonderful as well and Diana primped and sang her heart out, but \\"My World is Empty Without You\\" was a little too happy for the song's mood and I've yet to figure out what the happening of \\"The Happening\\" is.

This is one movie which I gave a lower rating to than Jeepers Creepers. I never thought I would see a movie that would accomplish that feat.

Adrian Brody seemed like he'd rather be back in Dresden, and although Naomi Watts showed some flashes and looked like she was ready to do some real acting at a moment's notice, she eventually succumbed to poor writing and directing.After a solid hour of tedious and unsuccessful character development, this indulgent movie spent another hour trying to decide if it was Jurassic Park or Lord of the Rings. Even the spectacular climax, with its peerless and amazing animation, became so dragged-out that by the time the beast was done in by the beauty, boredom had killed the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another remake of another dull movie","review":"King Kong was three hours of unbelievable, boring, plotless, nonstop, predictable cliche action.

The special effects were terrible here and you can tell the actors don't know where to look cause they don't know where the CGI's are supposed to be.Minus 1 star for the whole Jimmy character/subplot. He has this special bond with some black dude and tries to prove himself by being brave. He can also shoot bugs that are crawling on someone, while shaking holding a gun, no problem. Jimmy should have been cut into deleted scenes.I also disliked: when a man swings on a vine with a gun, Kong shaking the girl violently and she has not a scratch, the girl walks like an egyption/juggles...wtf?

At first I thought the awful acting was a parody. Then I realized the movie was trying to take itself seriously. A pardoy could've been done in 90 minutes. At 90 minutes, this painful experience was just getting warmed up. Terrible acting, terrible believability (ok, maybe that's my fault - expecting plausible stories in a giant gorilla movie), boring pace, and awful execution.

Love this movie filled with Drama and action. Thanks, John"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great movie. This is a remake that's worth it!","review":"I have watched this movie about 10 times now. Just like when I was a kid and could not get enough of the original King Kong I can't get enough of this one. Peter Jackson did a superb job on every level in this film. From the re-creation of the era to the actors and the special effects it can't be beat.The extended version is even better if you like long movies like I do. I can only hope that Peter Jackson will continue to make films like this. They seem to be getting few and far between these days. The hd-dvd version is really nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great special effects, poor actor choices.","review":"Jack Black is about as easy to take serious as a drunk monkey with down syndrome. The effects in the movie are sweet though, and most of the other actors are good enough. If I had to choose between watching this movie and getting a Blumpkin.....I'd watch this movie while getting a Blumpkin. Extension cords help out a great deal when one is testing the limits of their own sexuality. Good flick though. I guess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful love story - and horror film.","review":"No doubt this King Kong is more realistic than any of the preceding ones. He is more fierce, and this version has considerably more horror than any of the others, having goulish natives and grusome monsters. The score is spine-tingling, and the acting is superb. I dropped one star for the aspect ratio. The black bars in the wide-screen version take something away from the movie. All in all - a great film, but I still prefer the 1976 version with Jeff Bridges for the widescreen format and score in that one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull","review":"Despite all it's criticism over the years, I've always been fond of the 1976 remake of \\"King Kong\\" and Peter Jackson's version doesn't better it, in my opinion. Obviously the special effects in Jackson's version far surpass those of De Laurentis', but I find the '76 version to be more realistic and less heavy handed. You can actually feel Jackson pulling at your heart strings with his \\"Kong,\\" and it is is over-played. Additionally, the film is far too long, with a great deal of repetitive and boring scenes. None of the characters, barring Kong, are particularly well-developed. The characterisation of Kong though, is a marvel."},{"rating":"2","title":"The original is still the best","review":"Not to take anything away from the new CGI enhanced version. I actually enjoyed the usually obnoxious Jack Black as Carl Denim and Adrien Brody looks like he belongs in the 1930's. (He could be Ray Bolger's (the scarecrow in Wizard of Oz) double. Are they related? Ann Darrow was ok. I loved the 30's look of the movie and the old New York flavor. The only problem with this movie is the length, too l o n g. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"coulda been great","review":"Its too bad because this film could have been great. The special effects were awesome but as VanHelsing proved , it takes more than that to make a good film. There was just too many scenes that were over the top and unrealistic, like the Brontosaurus scene with our actors running between their legs but incredibly never getting hurt. Cmon guys. In the end You never really care enough about Kong to get sad because there were too many scenes that were ridiculous. The most important element to the film was the romance between woman and beast, and this could have worked, in fact I was praying it would, but it failed because there were too many implausible scenes earlier on, too many ridiculous scenes involoving humans outrunning dinosaurs and what not. Worth seeing, but Ive got to give it a thumbs down. More than anything I was disappointed. The synopsis of the film was: ape meets girl ,ape loses girl, ape tries to get girl back but falls off big building."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful","review":"One of the greatest masterpieces of our time.

Incredible picture on the blu-ray and the sound is equally amazing.The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is some of the juvenile dialogue and the CGI juggling was just strange."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pete Jackson Has A Problem","review":"This movie has some really good acting in it.I would watch it just to see Naomi Watts. She is a baby doll.That said: Peter Jackson could screw up a wet dream. Everything that he touches is WAY too long. This movie could have been shortened by a LOT. Many of the scenes are dragged out way too far, and some of the stuff going on in the jungle is just ridiculous.The Lord of The Rings trilogy is a great example. i loved those three movies, but I fast forwarded through at least a third of them. Who in hell wants to watch three little guys walking around all the time and the sentimental music playing in the background as they smile stupidly.The man has a problem. He may be tying to compensate for something that isn't quite long enough. :p"},{"rating":"2","title":"Peter Jackson is King!","review":"King Kong cements Peter Jackson as our generation's premiere maker of fantasy films. We all know the story of King Kong, especially the infamous final scene, but this film kept me on the edge of my seat the whole time. The rewrite of the story incorporates era specific dialogue and scenes and events left out of the original. It manages to stay faithful to the original intent, while modernizing it at the same time. The special effects are absolutely fantastic. This movie is a must see and an instant classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"This film should have been put out of it's misery!","review":"I almost walked out of this ridiculous remake...and now they are making it longer!!

No pun intended... This Movie was a drag. I found myself looking at my watch every fifteen minutes. As I notice and hour and Ten minutes went by with no signs of King Kong yet. Save your money and time. Not worth it at all!!! The story line nearly hold your attention. The acting all good but for Jack Black with every scene same impression on his face. You could see the roll was a stretch for him better stick to Comedy and stay out of Action/Adventure films. The digital effects were not that good at all. New York City looked like a big model set with cars. Not to Impressive of the times. In fact the 1976 King Kong to me was more realistic and had better effects."},{"rating":"1","title":"OMG","review":"Nightmare. The first thing Kong touches is her (blond) hair? Please. Sex, violence and thinly veiled fear and hatred? That's all these people have and all they want to tell and hear stories about.

Tarentino is one and Peter Jackson is now added to the list.

Shame on you Amazon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been better","review":"THe most exciting part of this movie is the middle when they are looking for Kong. The cinematography and the \\"new\\" creatures were interesting. OTher than that they blew it. The beginning was slow and few new things were added to the story to make it interesting. The ending was bad, all I remember is a whole bunch of people running in the steets in broad daylight. There was so much more they could have done to make the story more interesting, this was a half-hearted effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless, really","review":"This version of King Kong is so similar to the original, it was pretty much pointless to go to all the trouble of remaking it. Peter Jackson, by all means, is a decent director. But with his previous films, there was something ultimately no other director could capture, like with Dead/Alive and Heavenly Creatures. Even the Lord of the Rings trilogy will be really hard to surpass by directors fifty years from now.But King Kong is a bunch of fancier scenes and lines from the original movie, then a ton of extra nonsense just to make it seem a whole lot different and original. This version would have been good if time on the boat, on the island, and in New York afterwards would have been cut in half. It's a drag to watch.I did give it two stars, though, for the special effects and some of the action scenes were pretty cool. I also like Jack Black, so seeing his face in the midst of this was refreshing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls flat","review":"Peter Jackson is a talented filmmaker and I was excited to delve into this extended edition of King Kong. Unfortunately, this film has been overhyped and falls flat when all is said and done. There is no doubt that some of the action scenes are outstanding and the cinematography is nice. What brings the film down is the fact that it is needlessly long. The first hour is boring at times and could have been easily condensed. While the action scenes are done well, they sometimes drag on to the point they are not as exciting as they should have been. By the end of the film I was honestly hoping the film would just end."},{"rating":"2","title":"lovely tale of beauty and the beast","review":"A beautifully filmed tragic fantasy of a force of nature finding a little solace before its inescapable demise. The film seems to take a long time to get started and Jack Black muggs more than he acts. But once on Skull island the movie just takes off. It would have been great to learn why the natives turn blonde white girls over to Kong and what happened to the other girls. But when a film is this good I'm willing to forget logic for a couple of hours."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of worst movies I have ever seen","review":"Where do I begin? This over-the-top heavy handed movie weighs in at a laborious three hours. It should have been helpfully trimmed to an hour. They could have saved thirty minutes by cutting out the long loving looks between the ape and the dame. Wow - that got old.The dialogue attempts in a few places to be \\"meaningful\\", or maybe even pretentiously \\"philosophical\\", instead it comes off sounding like...well, it just sounds like the drivel it is.Now, obviously most people liked this movie. Which further reaffirms my pessimism about the world's taste. Not that I am even much for taste. I like lots of trashy action packed guilty pleasures. But not this one. It was just painful to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plays like a parody","review":"With Jack Black, everything plays like a comedy, a parody. He is forever arching his eyebrows and bugging his eyes, foreshadowing the evil about to hit. I'm not sure that was the intention. It makes this third version of Kong the most hokey by far. Also, the movie is a real drag until Skull Island, and that's about 45 minutes in, way too long to wait for the action to start. Most of the movie looks like digital special effects. Was anything real at all? The end is agonizing, but not in a good way. This should have been cut to two hours or less."},{"rating":"1","title":"King Kong should have been left on the island","review":"I am a big King Kong fan since the original with Fay Wray. I've even made a point of catching reruns of \\"King Kong vs. Godzilla\\" (King Kong wins by the way). The remake with Jeff Bridges was OK. Special effects much improved. Not even the special effects could save this movie with Jack Black who seemed like he was asleep for most of it. I have not been able to sit through the entire movie even once. I fast forward to where I left off. Don't waste your money. Wait for it to come on free TV, if ever. If not, no big loss. I would give this zero stars if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to squeeze an entertaining 90 minutes into 3 hours...","review":"Mildly entertaining, but what a shame that the director didn't exercise some self-control while editing this somewhat bloated movie. Perhaps my expectations were too high after what Jackson had accomplished with his Tolkien trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lord of the Rings Part IV","review":"Peter Jackson simply decided to do another Lord of the Rings movie. Every element found here is found in Lord of the Rings.They travel by boat quite a bit. The characters are on a long journey to a far off land: sound like The Fellowship of the Ring?Skull Island is Mordor.The island's natives are just like the orcs.The dinosaurs and other creatures are just like the Nazgul creatures.'King Kong is the just like the ring; he's deadly, but you feel lured in by him in some way.Like the Ring, people are captivated by him, but they know deep down he has to be destroyed.Just a retread of Jackson's earlier work.The CGI? It looks like CGI, and not very good at that.This kind of computer animation is a throwback to films from the 1980s, like the Disney film TRON.A definite thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's only good for the last two hours!","review":"I was bored out of my mind for the first hour but it didn't get good till the last two hours. The King Kong vs. T-Rex fighting was amazing. The special effects were great but still I was disappointed. I did like the Ice Dance and Kong on the Empire State Building trying to catch helicopters but you will be disappointed with the first hour. They don't mention about Kong at all. The acting is not bad. Jack Black has a good performance. Main reason why I give this movie one star because I thought it sucked. Only the last two hours are good you probably want to skip through the first hour and just watch the last two. Nothing good goes on with the first hour. Wait till it comes on cable if you really want to watch it. I was just bored!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This soooooo lame-o sucks!","review":"I unexpectedly watch this piece of bug!

I love Jackson, but it seems we always have to wait through this inferior release for the director's cut. The nonsense of the situation is that so many customers have already purchased the DVD of this movie (many bought both the Theatrical and Extended DVD cuts). I mean...how many times are we supposed to buy it. The moral approach would have been to skip straight to the extended cut for the Blu-Ray, but as it was so eloquently put in \\"Wall Street\\"...\\"Greed Is Good\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you liked \\"The Hulk\\" you will like this movie...","review":"That sums it up. Instead of a big green guy, you have a giant ape. Endless fight scenes and none of them even close to being physically possible. The computer animation was probably done by bunch of young guys who grew up playing video games, don't even drive cars and know very little of how objects move in the real physical world or simply don't care because they want it to be as exciting as the video game worlds they grew up in. In the old days, they made over-the-top musicals and these days it's over-the-top animation. Also, the CGI just doesn't look real (it never does) but the whole thing is processed in a kind of drab blueish hue to try and meld reality with the CGI world and it just looks murky to me. Honestly, if you find movies like the Hulk basically stupid, you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Long, Too Hollywood, Too Slow!!","review":"I'd looked forward to seeing the remake of this 1933 Classic Movie, but was SORELY DISAPPOINTED with when I watched it DVD yesterday.King Kong was too slow in parts and the slow parts of this movie made it feel six hours long instead of 3 hours long! I think that the filmmakers could have shortened this movie by an hour and had a better film.This movie was way too Hollywood and the overuse of predictable action sequences was very distracting to the movie.The perks of this movie were the story/plot twists that were different from the 1933 King Kong Classic. The acting was great and I was amazed at how realistic the computer animation was in creating King Kong and other creatures on Skull Island.However, I still find the the 1933 King Kong film version to be better than than this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy it - rent it!","review":"This movie was alright to watch with friends at a theatre, but I must admit that I really do not want to see it again.It is long. VERY LONG. Some of the parts couldve been taken out, eventhough they might have been interesting, but it was just too long.This is definately more a commercial movie than a literal or entertaining movie.But still, I liked watching it once. But do not buy it. You wont watch it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad acting, Bad cast, Way Too Long!!!!!","review":"This has been remade too many times. Why can't they leave a good movie alone? 3 hours is way too long. The original was only an hour and a half or so, which is long enough to watch an overgrown gorilla go haywire. And what was with Naomi Watts' goofy dance? Was that necessary? I thought she was supposed to be afraid of the beast. Instead, she's juggling and making him laugh. Unbelievably sexist and stupid. And the trampling of the dinosaurs?! HELLO!!!! Way too long!!!!! The acting and the script was just plain awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good movie","review":"I love this movies very nice and interest. I recommend this for everyone to see.

Simply superb!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth watching","review":"Waited a while to check this film out, but I am not disappointed. Jack Black is great and the lovely Naomi Watts is the perfect damsel in distress. The oceanic voyage coupled with all of the fierce escape and adventure type action on Skull Island was excellent! The theme of \\"beauty killed the beast\\" sometimes fell short with me, particularly during the last half hour of the film when it was quickly layered on and then suddenly became something of an irregularity compared to what had just happened. Overall great performances by Black and Watts and I really must tell you, if you want some adventure, this one takes Indiana Jones and Jurassic Park to a whole new level. The bonus features on the widescreen edition are just okay, but I think I enjoy this enough to pick up the better set that includes multiple discs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kong Rules!! if you have the time","review":"Peter Jackson's King Kong is pure entertainment (so cliche, I know) but a viewer must to know how much doses of it can handle. I've never complained about the amount of spectacle the director put into the movie but only in the running time in it. The writers were some kind of iresponsable I think. Some characters were developed in a rough way, not all of them but some of the actors were wasted. Clear ideas! Clear ideas! not script changes while filming. But what can I say? I liked after all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie","review":"Great Movie. The picture quality of this HD DVD is unbelievable.

Jackson stretches it out to 3 hours and adds very little to the story. The native were scary. The quiet scenes with Kong were welcome additions, they actually made him into a character...something that can't be said for any of the human characters.The insect scenes are ridiculous!! The dinosaur stampede was idiotic. Anything with the young cabin boy almost seemed like it was clipped out of another movie.

From the moment they reached King Kong's island the movie quickly spiraled to a painful viewing experience. I felt no sympathy for the big stupid ape. How can anyone feel anything for King Kong? He keeps a village hostage to a tiny part of an island, forces them to provide him sacrificial women, and tortures the female star of the movie. It seems so ridiculous that she ends up liking King Kong. The villains of the movie were my heroes.

Unfortunately paired with my 120-Hz TV and PS3 player it turned out to be too good! I haven't seen such a false looking movie until now. I could almost see the green screen behind the actors. I must say that Jack Black in HD was not something I needed to see in my lifetime. The disparity between live action and CG was much too obvious. KONG ended up in my local used store and I will most likely stick to Animated (Pixar) movies for my Blu-Ray experience.

The film is best shown in blu-ray."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jackson should have watched the original","review":"All the special effects, technological advances and 70+ years of movie making progress and Peter Jackson can't hold a candle to the original. Someone should have told him he was remaking King Kong - not Mighty Joe Young. Ann Darrow is not supposed to fall in love with Kong, Kong's supposed to fall in love with her.I could cut about 1 hour out of this movie and make it better, but it would still take a distant back seat to the original.I could go on and on, but suffice to say this was a huge dissappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love long movies","review":"I see complaints that this movie was to long.I think it's great that it was long.As a matter of fact i wish it was a little longer so more detail would be shown.Like the extended lord of the rings movies show alot more footage which helps explain more of what's going on.Everyone that went to see this movie new ahead of time how long the show was. So if you don't like watching long movies don't go so you can complain about it later and ruin it for others that do.The movie industry will see your complaints and start shortening the films to the point they make no sense and look chopped up.So for now on look for the feature length and if it's to long don't go or watch something else.Other than that the movie was great.I love the fact this movie has been moderinized.Now i will collect it as i wouldn't buy the original for it was to primative for todays special effects.I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Peter Jackson has done it again.

I expected much better visual effects, there was nothing new here. When I first saw Jurassic Park, I was blown away by the dinosaurs, but now it's been there, done that. Even Kong didn't scare me this time around, I would have prefered a scarier and more gigantic looking ape. The original can't be beat and even the Delaurentis version was more edge-of-your-seat. Digital, smidgital, no improvement of importance here. My two stars are for the jungle sounds, that I liked."},{"rating":"1","title":"GARBAGE!!!","review":"Given the level of creativity and the seamless implementation of WETA's effects, I expected much more from this movie than a long overdrawn saga. The story was okay, but hindered badly by the poor integration of live-action and cg. I mean, the compositing was just plain lousy and the movements of the large creatures weren't scaled well at all. I was so distracted during the scene in which the characters are running from the herd of brachiosaurs (or whatever they were) by the obvious fakery of the images that I couldn't see past it. Better effects were achieved in the original King Kong. I don't expect to see this kind of crap on screen when it comes from the same people who were behind LOTR.In short, King Kong was overhyped, overbudgeted, underproduced and overall underwhelming. The best example of integrated cg in a film is still the first film to use the technology: Jurassic Park. Let's hope that Peter Jackson decides to take on something less classic and less demanding on the audience."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is the Point of this Movie","review":"I have seen all the versions of Kong and still wonder what the point is. The theme is...???? Does it really come down to that stupid line at the end of the movie - Beauty killed the Beast? SO WHAT! And why wasn't Denham arrested for so recklessly putting the city in harm's way?????This latest version was perhaps the most excessive, resembling a caricature of all the super-technological special effects movies to hit the modern screen, a combination of Jurassic Park, Raiders of the Lost Ark, and a host of others that pack of wallop in visual effect but lack a true theme. Maybe now all the remakes will finally end. Go riddance!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Now if only the other actors were CGI too...","review":"I'm not quite sure what Peter Jackson was going for with the performances. I understand the film is a throwback to the original but I don't think having the actor's perform the way they did in 1933 helped the picture in any way, shape or form.The relationship between Ann Darrow and Brody's character is non-existent, forced, stupid, with absolutely no real human connection. Jack Black is atrocious- moving your eyebrows a lot is not good acting, in case he didn't know.The sort of pederastic relationship between Jimmy and his big friend was weird and absurd.The writing... an insult to anyone's intelligence.If special effects could make a movie, I would give it five stars, but it can't, so I won't. At least Peter lost a lot of weight making it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge ape, huge dissapointment","review":"Some other reviewers who realized this film is as bad as it is pointed out its many, many flaws, so I won't reiterate them. Suffice it to say, it's not the real King Kong story (girl *loves* ape? Right. . .) And the cartoon physics were so over the top as to make the movie into a true cartoon (except it wasn't funny -- at least not intentially so -- well, perhaps the whole film was a bad joke). Sad. Lord of the Rings was truly exceptional. This film is a parody at best. To recap: little characterization (at least that made sense), no depth, unbelievable motives (again, girl *loves* ape? Sheesh!), and no attempt to make the action scenes believable. What a disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST MOVIE MADE !!!","review":"Oh my god !! i just saw this king kong movie and i was....i am spechless this movie is really really bad !!! jackson's king kong is as bad as spaceballs or even worst. giant Bugs?? huge bats that you can fly on them?? make king kong laugh. i read some reviwes !!!! a master piece ???? i would give this movie cero stars if i could. dont waste your time whathincg this movie, instead apreciate jackson's lord of thr rings.. now that is a master piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS MY JAM, DOG!","review":"OH' MY GOODNESS--THE BIG BUGS WERE SOOOO AWESOME I COULDN'T HANDLE IT--ESPECIALLY SINCE THERE WERE OVER 18 HOURS OF GIANT STUPID BUGS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Try","review":"I love Peter Jackson's movies, but this one is largely an over-produced bomb. It's more about his ego than good film making.Many of the details added to the backstory are interesting, but the Skull Island (Mordor,anyone?) sequences drag on and on and on and on... There are some great moments, but, for instance the scene with Kong and the three t-rexes is waaaaaaaay too long, as is the \\"bug\\" scene; and does every single nasty creature have to have big teeth? The only reason to see this film to see how a great director can go so terribly wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't Believe Reviews until Dec. 14th.","review":"This Movie's release date has not happened yet.

Did really Peter Jackson direct this movie? Is the same Peter Jackson that directed Heavenly Creatures and Lord of the Rings? My God it looked like one of those cheap videos in youtube. The dialogs were so cheesy. Again, Is Adrien Brody an actor? Jack Black is a good comedian, but here is out of place. His face is just so funny, when he wants to be serious in a scene you can avoid to laugh as hell. Naomi Watts looks like a rookie driver in his first day driving the beltway. The character is too much for her. Being the first King Kong a classic, even the second is much better than this and yes, Jessica Lange is way more enjoyable to watch than Naomi"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I think this is the worst movie I have ever seen.

It was way to long and boring, I think the worst part was you already knew how it was going to end, so I felt I wasted the three hours watching it. I have to admit though the scenery was great, and I did like it when they fought the big bugs.I was mostly desappointed because I figured Peter Jackson would do a great job with this movie, but maybe he should stick with directing fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"....other then that its perfect.","review":"This movie looks like a videogame. The musical score is boring and forgettable. Naomi Watts is far too old for the role. Jack Black is a horrible actor who does nothing but bug his eyes out and whisper all the time. Several extranious characters are added early in the film and then just vanish for no reason at all. Several sequences were so corney I almost laughed out loud wile others were simply mean spirited. The dinosaur sequences were imitations of those boring Jurassic Park films. The hero looks like one of the Ritz brothers. The characters were so poorly developed I'm still not sure if they were good, evil or just misguided and even the good guys were basically unlikable. The plot strayed too far from the original on several occasions. The movie ran way too long and was boring at times (\\"if you shake it an hour will fall out\\"). Oh and did I mention that Kong was way to small. Other than thatits perfect."},{"rating":"1","title":"TOOOOO drawn out Long","review":"Are these reviewers kidding - the \\"best movie?!?\\" Special effects were excellent, but that's about it - yet, TOO much it it. Really, enough was enough. It was a \\"B\\" movie that my family really looked forward to & was sorry to have missed on the big screen. My children (8, 10 & 22 years old) asked 3x in the 1st 1/2 hour \\"Are you sure this is King Kong?\\" then later, \\"Is it over soon?\\" though they knew it wasn't by a long shot. Nothing beats the original, as corny as it might have been. The acting was better for some characters, but I felt like I was waiting in a doctor's office for most of the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The ultimate King Kong","review":"This is it!

I feel the movie did not benefit from using foul language but then we feel this way across the board. I assumed the rating was due to violence or little scary for young children."},{"rating":"1","title":"3 hours too long","review":"I was really looking forword to this movie.

It's a bad movie.Some of the CGI is great - and some is surprisngly bad.Kong 2005 is badly written and directed by a self-indulgent movie-maker.The 1933 and 1976 versions of King Kong were better by far.Life is too short to waste watching stuff like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome movie, unbelievable effects, very sad, but sooo long!","review":"The director out did himself with this one, so amazing effects, kept me glued but was boring the first 49 minutes into it, after that the rest of the 3hrs was AWESOME"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Remake","review":"Wishing all along to see this, I was pleasantly surprised to discover that this adaptation of the classic horror movie is quite noteworthy. I have been a fan of Naomi Watts since \\"The Ring\\". Here she is wonderful as the the beauty who tames the savage beast.The special effects are of the highest caliber though I admit I grew a little weary of the fight scenes betwee the computer generated animals/monsters. Thankfully, the movie did not descend into a special effects extravaganza, usually to hide the fact that the writing was less than stellar. Though not a big fan of Jack Black, he was most competent as the director whose priorities left much to be desired.It is certainly a worthy addition to anyone's collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"A clean miss","review":"Watch the 1933 original -- great movie, right? Now sit down and watch this one. Who the @#$% cast Jack Black? Let me make this brief, this movie was an enormous disappointment WITH THE EXCEPTION of the brilliantly acted and shot scenes on the ship as it arrives at the island and gets hung up on the rocks -- I loved it! The actor who played the captain was excellent. I also thought the visuals of the biplanes at the end were extraordinary, but I'd turn the air blue if I described what I thought about the rest of the movie. WAY off target, not worth viewing, honestly, and I expected a terrific movie. I left the theatre really genuinely angry, it's not as bad as \\"Alien 3\\" but it's in that league, when even little kids were leaving the theatre talking about how they'd have told the story... better."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Obsessed Over King Kong","review":"I love this movie a lot!

I was actually obsessed about this movie for a while it was so good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome in Bluray!","review":"The ultimate HD movie, fantactic picture and sound. Great family movie for those with older (over 13?) kids. Only objection is that it's a bit L O N G, and that's the theatrical version--not the extended one which is 14 minutes L O N G E R.

I found this film one of the best films of 2005. It's a great action adventure epic that they dont make anymore. The acting was great the story was great and the directing was great everythign about this movie was great. The special effects where excellent and looked life like.

Superb special effects bring Kong to life but I didn't need 3 hours to admire it. Mingled in between for what seemed like eternity was a bit lifted right out of Jurassic Park replete with horrible special effects looking like they were from a cheap Japanese Godzilla film years ago (they obviously spent all of the effects budget on the ape). And... someone PLEASE tell Jack Black to take some acting classes. How a marginal talent like this guy lands a gig like this movie is beyond me. Completely mis-cast with that dopey half smirk on his face the whole 3 hours. If you want to see King Kong, the original is still by far the best. ** BnB Beatles Depot **"},{"rating":"2","title":"Should u buy the 2-disc Special Edition or not?","review":"The DVD is exceptional. The 2-Disc edition is worth it - I am only half-way through the Production Diaries on disc 2 and am so glad I sprung for it - can't wait to see the NY & Skull Island documentaries which are also on the disc. I don't think the Trailer is on either disc tho - too bad. If you're not a fan of the digital \\"process\\", get the single-disc edition. But I am absolutely amazed at how they did it all: just like the special features on the 1933 re-release DVD had me in awe of how the original film was created (that's a must-buy as well). I was worried that knowing how they did \\"things\\" would spoil the film, but the actors (except for Naomi Watts) already did that (haha). Kong is so real and convincing...the ending will break your heart everytime. No real spoiler here, but when Naomi walks into Brophy's arms at the end, I'm like No! Thelma! Jump off after Kong instead! Don't settle for a chimp! What an ending that would have been, huh?"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good fantasy movie","review":"I knew the movie was three hours long before I saw it, and I still went to see it anyway. I'm glad I did, because it was an incredible spectacle. I won't go into the plot, it's pretty basic, but I think a good job was done setting up the plot so you could understand why the characters were there, what everyone's motivation was, etc. I thought the scenes where they arrived at Skull Island were incredible, realistic and scary. Some people are noting the fact that Naomi Watt's character, Ann Darrow, was never scratched up or hurt after her many ordeals (something my husband and I also noted), but this is a fantasy adventure, and if you can believe in a 25-foot ape and dinosaurs, why is it a stretch to believe her character was unhurt through everything? It was a smidge long, but I found it enjoyable. Why analyze?"},{"rating":"2","title":"best in theathers","review":"This was an incredible movie with awesome effects and great acting.

I was mesmerized at what Peter Jackson can really create when his mind is set on something. I was specualate on the whole remake of King Kong Idea and never watched it in theatres while it was out I opted to go watch Chronicles of Narnia..(also good...different review) however when I got the DVD and ousted the 28 dollars for the Special edition DVD, the movie rocked me with greatness, They just film and perform everything to beyond standards, its quite phenomenal so if you got the time for a 3 hour epic this is what you want to use your time for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good in parts, but too long.","review":"The 2005 version of King Kong started out great, with a good flavor of New York during the depression. Eventually it gets too long: dinosaurs and people getting killed or injured all over the place, over and over again. And the Empire State Building scenes also drawn out at the end. And why were those guys in the planes shooting at Kong when Ann was up there too in bullet range. Maybe he was such a menace that they had to sacrifice her in order to bring him down? I wonder why I never thought about that when I viewed the original 1933 version.So this new version shows a relationship between Ann and Kong. Cool. They could have cut the film down by at least a half hour and accomplished the same thing. When we watch the extras on other DVDs, we see those good deleted scenes that were taken out because they were dragging out the film or parts of it too long. How come nobody thought about that here?As at least one other reviewer said, I won't be watching this again."},{"rating":"2","title":"KING KONG 2005 - -- One of the greatest adventure/accion movies in years!","review":"Last night a saw this movie, and why can i say, its much much better than the original..

The special effects were so obviously inauthentic that they were almost laughable.The first hour was fine, and was comedic.

Yes, I did think it was a little long but I think the 2h 57m was worth it. It is a really fun movie and at some points touching. Once they get on the island it is non stop action from the Dinasuar stampede to Kong fighting the T-Rex's to the crew fighting really gross bugs to Kong running around old time New York. Overall I gave it a B+ check it out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overblown Hype: Big-time Disappointment Here","review":"First of all let me say I really wanted to like PJ's KK. It saddens me to say this thing was just overdone in every conceivable way. NY opening, boat trip, Skull Island, Back to NY...all way too long. Dinosaur fight scenes go on forever (and why did Jackson think three T-Rexes would be better than one??? because they ain't). Spider-pit scene is just plain gross and, once again, goes on too long. This film suffers what I'm calling the 'Matrix' effect. Like the Matrix sequels what would have made a decent, no more than 2hr film, becomes an overlong snoozer. Give a director creative carte blanche and a blank check and you get an overblown mess. Someone should have made Jackson deliver a movie an hour shorter. Save the version I was subjected to theatrically for the 4 disc DVD you know is coming in time for Christmas this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Long and Too Slow!","review":"I fell asleep ten minutes into this film.

The insect part was great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eye candy with not much depth","review":"I was kind of dragged to this movie, and have to say that had I been alone, I would have left halfway through. The special effects were ridiculous (come on, the girl was flung around like a rag doll and not one bruise on her body? And don't get me started on the dinosaur stampede...). Most of the special effects besides Kong were very obvious, and there was an overabundance of huge, creepy creatures that would only attack once the actors woke up. The only redeeming quality of this movie was the relationship between King Kong and Naomi Watts' character."},{"rating":"2","title":"3-Disc Extended vs. 2-Disc Theatrical","review":"I just wanted to clarify to potential buyers that the 3-disc version includes an entirely different set of special features than those included in the 2-disc version as well as a longer cut of the film. So if you are a die-hard fan, and willing, there is good reason to dish out $ for both versions. If you'd prefer only one version and are not interested in the special features, I recommend the extended cut as the scenes added back in are definately worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"It is the extended cut. GOD","review":"For the people complaining about this not being the extended cut, the official press release has already stated over 2 months ago that the blu ray release will have the extended cut of the film. It also will have uncompressed audio. Check highdefdigest.com or blu-ray.com for info."},{"rating":"1","title":"A solid C grade for this one","review":"For the amazing special effects, which is Peter Jackson's forte, I give it an A+. For the long, silent, emotive looks from Naomi Watts, I give it a B-. But for the ridiculous last line of Jack Black (as well as his bad acting), I give it an F. Average that together, and you get a solid C grade. The creepy giant insect scene make your skin crawl for days."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do away with the ice pond and it's 5 stars","review":"This film delivers what it is suppose to deliver: FUN. This isn't serious drama, this is cartoon type fun. Jack Black was terrific as Carl Denham, Adrien Brody was okay as the hero and Naomi Watts was great as Ann, the beauty loved by the beast. That said, the star of this film is the giant ape and a wonderful job they did bring the beast to life. I did not care for the scene on the frozen pond in New York. That really was dull and contrived, but the rest of the movie moved along well and it did not seem three hours long. The supporting actors were also very good, including the cameraman, the captain and of course the male movie star. Was it better than the original? Well, I loved the original and I was prepared to be disapointed by a remake. I was not however. If only all remakes could live up to this standard."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Progress in 73 years.","review":"First and foremost, the original 1933 version of King Kong stillstands as the quintessential monster movie. The special effectsare still unsurpassed, realistic and wrenching. The cast is perfect, especially Fay Wray who by herself invented the movie scream. the fact that the original is seen in glorious black and white adds to the films moodiness and mystery. In short, it is an unequaled work of art that required no further rendition.Now to the recent remake. I titled this review No Progress because as soon as I saw the action on Skull Island I realized that the CGI looked cartoonish, unrealistic, phony and remarkedthat 73 years later, film making took a giant step backward.This remake, like many others is a classic example of subtraction by addition. The sad fact is that many young peoplewill only know this colorized version and not appreciate theextraordinary vision and achievement of the original.No, it wasn't the airplanes. it was CGI killed the beast"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Returned the product as it did not work. Tried this video on 2 HD TVs, one small flat screen and a new computer, and it did not load and play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Konged Out","review":"This is in a nut shell a long, loosely connected, hog-pog of random non-stop action and melodrama; yet there is still much merit to it.If Peter Jackson proved anything with Lord of the Rings, he proved he could create perfect fantasy worlds. In this CG master-piece we get to see Dinosaurs in far better quality than Lord of the Rings and ruins in far greater beauty than Indiana Jones. Even the old world of New York city was captured with a supreme beauty.That said everything is down hill from there. The action is so wild and so over played and so ridiculous people were laughing in the theater just because it was so over done.Story Line, I think Peter Jackson's work with Lord of the Rings should speak for itself. What story there was, was laughable, and so loosely connected it seemed as if it were just a board author rambling to himself.The movie was entertaining, but that's about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried to like it, I really did.","review":"I wasn't going to watch KING KONG but with all the great reviews from everyone I said what the hell I will go and watch this so called \\"instant classic\\". Man was I disappointed. First of all the movie started out way to slow. They spent to much time on the boat just trying to get to Skull Island. I gave it 2 stars because once they did make it there the special effects were great. The movie had some good action scenes in it with Kong fighting the T-Rex and when he was in New York on top of the Empire State Building. But the movie just dragged on for an hour to long. There were a lot of scenes that could have been cut or shorten and the viewer would not have lost anything from the story line. Overall I did not walk out of the theater last night thinking man I just saw a classic. If you are wanting to watch a classic go pick up Lonesome Dove."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hated this movie.","review":"I can't even find the words, nor do I have the time, to explain how much I hated this movie.

Dumped the DVD (along with \\"Love actually\\" for good measure).Rather the prewar original version."},{"rating":"1","title":"Jackson's amazing ignorance","review":"Through all the hype for this movie, you constantly hear about Peter Jackson's encyclopedic knowledge and love of the original 1933 classic film. That's why it's amazing to see how much he didn't learn from the original Kong. In 1933, the producers and screenwriters worked very hard to eliminate anything from the script that proved superfluous or impeded the flow of the action. (That's the primary reason why the legendary \\"spider sequence\\" was removed from the original King Kong.) The tight pace of the action is what makes the original Kong so great. This new film is loaded with unnecessary bloat -- and lots of overdone effects just to please the people who like that sort of thing. In short, this film is a big disappointment and I was expecting much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remake Of A Remake","review":"This version of King Kong is basically a remake of the 1976 Jessica Lange disaster while mocking the 1933 film at the same time.The special effects are poor.Especially during the scene were the sailors are being chased by a herd of Brontosaurus.Jack Black is obviously mis-cast.The film on the whole is just way too long.Call the 1933 film CORNY if you like but it is still the best film of it's kind.To make things worse, this DVD release is not true Widescreen.Looks like the film was cut at the top and bottom to give the appearance of widescreen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This movie is pure entertainment from start to finish.

You could tell the people were placed into the film later with the CGI insects. It is like watching 2 different movies clumsily spliced together...When Kong is carrying the girl around, sometimes she looks like a fake doll.Jack Black's over-exaggerated facial expressions were annoying. I doubt I will ever be able to watch him again.The woman, Namoi Watts or whoever she is, does her best to imitate Nicole Kidman.There is no soul to this film. Just an excuse to do FX. I am astounded that people describe this as \\"breath taking\\" and \\"brilliant\\"I really do wonder about those folks.This movie was so bad I cannot believe it."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME KONG!!","review":"AWESOME KONG!! more than a movie this is an experience! The acting is what really kept me in awe. Now, im not saying this is shakespearean stuff or anything like that. NO. the thing is that i went to see this movie with my expectations a tad low. I mean Jack Black? when in the world would you expect good acting from him (and his role was pivotal) but it was such a surprise to see him become the role. it was great. Naomi Watts was great. Adrien Brody (although i dont like him at all) was great as well. Supporting cast was spot on.Yeah the movie is long, but for filmmaking like this is what going to the movies is all about.Bummer on the extras department. NOTHING!my recommendation... buy it! dont think. Buy it! every decent collection should have peter jackson in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUST A REVIVAL","review":"I thought it was gonna be a very much more interesting movie. The Plot It's Ok in general, just Ok. Don't get me wrong, there are many parts as intense as the movie really deserves it, but please dinosours??? Giant insects? Smart Insects? Giant Bats? Big Iguanas? But the worst of all, is to see Naomi Watts dancing as a fool in order to get rid of KK. Not to say that watching KK lought at her did not made me lough at all.The effects are great, what ever... but I can see why it has no Oscar in hands, just as Peter got for TLOTR.It has to much o many things that do not belong there.In general it's just entertaining, but it does not do more than that. It was a just one time to see movie.I do not pretend to have reality, I undestand it's fantasy, but come one... PJ just went off the normal.The rest it's just what made theother KK movies cruel...But asa movie, it's just better than the other because it's newer, more modern... that's all.It's your choise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Naomi Watts is the only good thing in this boring movie","review":"This movie is completely empty and boring, but because Naomi Watts is in it so I bought the DVD. She's so gorgeous. Too bad the 3 hours is a complete waste of time. Teh special effects -- which make up 95% of the movie -- are laughable. You can almost see the wires and rendering frames. Complete trash -- save for Naomi."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cinematic Nonsense","review":"This film is utter nonsense; there is no novelty with the special effect as there was back in 1933 - the 1933 movie is greatness personified ; the acting is poor and Jack Black made it feel like a stupid comedy instead of an adventure of even remotely epic pro portions.If you like long movie u can go and buy it ...if you like good movie you can buy the 1933 version.NOT RECOMMENDED"},{"rating":"1","title":"What was the purpose?","review":"I first saw King Kong back in the early 50's when i was a kid. Then i saw the 1933 version again back in the 70's at a revival on the big screen. That was impressive. But this new version with it's special effects totally take away from the story line and is way over done. I'll never understand what and why Hollywood has this obsession with special effects. I much rather see a film for it's acting and who can beat the old way of special effects before computers. You call computers creative? Anyone can do this type of thing but in the older films it took TALENT to make a film like \\"King Kong\\" something that Hollywood doesn't believe in anymore. Save your money and get the newly restored 1933 version. Much much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Than It Should Have Been","review":"Peter Jackson is an impressive filmmaker indeed. The King Kong story is not a very involving one, at least I never thought it really was, not until now. Jackson's new film is vastly superior to the original and the crummy 70's remake. This film has a heart which is rare to find in a popcorn film such as this. The acting is very impressive and the special effects are astounding. The films length didn't bother me really, I didn't find it boring at all. A good movie for some great adventure scenes and for a surprisingly emotional relationship between Kong and Watts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too long, too sentimental, over-acted","review":"Sorry, but this was a big disappointment... I had to split the viewing over too evenings to even get through it. The special effects are cool but the acting is over-done, the film is too long (said by someone who usually hesitates to buy a film that's under two hours) and several overly long and sentimental scenes and the music just kills whatever suspense they manage to build up. I couldn't wait for the anticipated fall of the ape so I could go to bed and read a good book instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"For the love of Kong.","review":"Director Peter Jackson's epic King Kong is a masterpiece. Yes this movie is 3 hours in length but it is worth your time and patience. I saw it in the movie theatre and was very impressed by this classic tale. Naomi Watts is brilliant and cute as Ann Darow She is good in every role she is in, such a talented actress! The movie is a bit slow in the beginning but by the time King Kong arrives on screen, the action quickly picks up and never stops til the end. Great cinematography and art direction. I am not much for action movies but this is the best one I have ever seen. Big kudos to the cast and director, I give you Kong!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What? No commentary?!","review":"I absolutely LOVED this remake. I was a little dissappointed at how fake the CGI looked. But then I realized this was done by Universal and we all know how abyssmal Hulk was. But King Kong (the origianl 1933 version) was the movie that put the moviemaking bug into Peter Jackson's head. So this movie was a lifelong dream-come-true for him.The ONLY complaint I have about this DVD is the fact that it does not include a director commentary. I don't know about anyone else, but I love hearing a director's comments and thoughts. I love hearing what was going through his head when he made a particular scene. That's the only thing that would have made me give this DVD 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Long but heartbreaking","review":"Peter Jackson could have told this story in less than 3 hours and there are certainly scenes that go too long, but some scenes are so heartbreaking and so beautiful that you are happy that he let you in for the whole thing. I'm talking about the scenes where Naomi Watts and King Kong are alone together - both on Skull Island and in Central Park - which just make up for the rest of the movie. Sure Adrian Brody and Jack Black are great (especially towards the end when Jack Black is in full Orson Welles mode) but this is Naomi Watts' movie.Also props for giving Andy Serkis a human character as well as the Kong movement. Now I wish that Peter Jackson would cast Serkis as MacBeth with Kate Winslet as Lady MacBeth and Vigo Mortensson as MacDuff - well one can hope."},{"rating":"2","title":"King of the Kongs","review":"This is a masterpiece of the cinema. I found the casting perfect, including Jack Black. Yes, Naomi Watts screams a lot but man, wouldn't you scream if a giant ape were staring you in the face? And the creatures only get worse from there. The \\"relationship\\" Ann Darrow has to have with the ape is touching, as much as it can be. She is, afterall, totally dependent on him for survival. Many people have wondered what the ape is gonna do with the \\"bride\\" and clearly to Kong, his brides are his toys, novelties. I won't give a synopsis of the story because everyone knows it & I don't understand why people do that on here and on IMDB but this is a must see for movie lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Visually stunning HD DVD with a so-so plot.","review":"This HD DVD is arguably the king of HD DVD demo material right now. The colors are sharp and vibrant, and the film is crystal clear. The audio is just as good. The only reason I took a star off is because the actual movie script is decent at best. Adrian Brody does a pretty good job, but overall the movie's plot is average. Luckily, I bought this movie for the stunning visual experience, so I'm not disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great! Simply put.","review":"Ok there are movies that get bad reviews that I just dont get, this is one of the movies. This is a great action/adventure movie. I had my doubts about Jack Black, but he really does deliver as does the rest of the cast. Kong was a lot fun.

With the CGI alone, the story would have been as shallow as the 70s version of King Kong, which is quite lame. This was fun and took us to another level of CGI Dinos even after the Jurassic Park franchise.

To anyone else who has noticed this about the movie, I have this small reminder to issue:Peter Jackson's \\"King Kong\\" contains a giant, 2-story gorilla, large man-eating worms, AND DINOSAURS!!. Normally, after seeing such things in a film, ones 'suspension of disbelief' should have been asked to leave the theater.The 'realistic question' you should all be asking yourselves is this: Why didn't Ann wet herself after standing on the very TIPPY FRIGGING TOP of the Empire State Building?!

I laughed,I cried,I ate a whole 3 boxes of popcorn because this movie is a roller coaster. Go see it now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"king kong","review":"Is nothing sacred anymore!!!! I understand that this was peter Jackson's inspiration to become a director. Yet, he couldn't leave it alone. He had a long and very successful period doing the LOTR Trilogies, and the extended versions. He had to get caught up in the spotlight, and remake nothing but a capitolist CG attempt of an extremely boring computer game on screen. It doesn't matter that he stuck to the story, this is an example of how unoriginal Hollywood and mainstream movies in general have become. They've ran out of ideas - so they make hybrid parodies. This was depressing, if you love King Kong stick to the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Jackson's best work","review":"I felt that King Kong did not live up to Peter Jackson's previous works, Creatures, Frighteners, LOTR, and was at times filled with too long of V Rex fight scenes as well as death and looking scenes. The pacing was slow after the first hour and it became less interesting until the end of the film. Although the energy of the first hour was building it up, it failed to deliver what was promised from the strength of the opening of the film. It would be a good film to sit at home with on a rainy day when you have a lot of free time that you don't know what to do with, but it is very different than what he has done before."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Deleted Scenes !?!","review":"Look closely before purchasing. There are NO deleted scenes on this 2-Disc Widescreen set. Just another load of decent, but redundant documentaries. And on Disc One, the movie has car commercials and previews right up alongside the film in the menu. Very shoddy and shameless. For this amount of money, there should be no ads. And in this day and age, putting out an \\"Exclusive 2-Disc Special Edition\\" with no deleted scenes is highway robbery and flim flam. I'm assuming that PJ will be back to the well for some hideous Extended Edition months from now. But until then, he now outdoes only George Lucas for holding us hostage for deleted scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overlong, slack and indulgent","review":"Some thoughts:- It is possible for a movie to have too many dinosaurs. Who would have thought?- Jackson's command of spectacle is immature. He got away with it in the first two LORD OF THE RINGS films because Tolkien's story and characters were so powerful. But cracks of obvious indulgence appeared in RETURN OF THE KING, and they open into a yawning chasm in KONG. (Literally, yawning.) Spielberg fell into the same trap with 1941.- Digital special effects have lost their magic. This isn't entirely Jackson's fault, but KONG makes it painfully obvious. Anything that can be imagined can be now shown. The question is, who has the talent to imagine something fresh and new?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I am a big fan of the original King Kong, and maybe that's the problem. The new version of King Kong follows the original very closely ( maybe too closely ). Other than the special effects, there was nothing really very original to be found in the remake.I saw the remake in the theatre, and all I could think of by the time he climbed the empire state building was, can you hurry up and kill the ape so I can go home. Sorry, it was a real bore, and a big let down, not unlike the remake of the fog."},{"rating":"1","title":"I cant really give this film a rating beacuse I never finished watching it.","review":"What were you thinking Peter Jackson? Well, Peter Jackson had the chance of a life time and he blew it! I think. Anyway, I walk into the theater so exited right. I had heard about this film a few years ago and was so exited to watch it, beacuse I am the biggest Kong fan. Well, the first disapiontment, was when Jack Black said the Lords name in vien. Come on Jackson, whats the need? Anyway, when I decided to walk out of the theater is when the natives appeared. Jackson made them look satanic, and not at all like human beings. So I think Jackson is a total loser for ruining a great film. It has lost every ounce of innosence. It is a true disapiontment. Maybe the whole film was done well enough to get a lot more than one star, but I think it Sucked.Review by Michael Peters.

Their show put a set of stock characters into the most ludicrous situations, and let mayhem run wild. It was creative, witty, insane, raucous, and all done before a live audience.This CD compiles some of the wacky songs they wrote and performed on the show. For those who do not know the Goons, it will seem bizarre. But for those familiar with the show, it is a treasure not to be missed.

Her debut, as far as literature is concerned, was about as great a collection as any published that year: Plainwater. But here, in her fourth collection, the follow-up to the woefully over-hyped \\"Autobiography of Red,\\" Carson is struggling to \\"make\\" poetry--out of appropriated texts, out of nonsense, out of little precious epigramatical sayings. . .it's a hodge-podge that makes little sense as a collection, and whose individual poems make even less of an impression.If I have my math right, Carson has averaged about a book every other years since the mid-nineties. I think she needs to take a break. I think she needs an editor. I think she needs to stop paying attention to the folks who so eagerly want to claim her as the late twentieth-century's answer to the American tendency to love the unknown writer late discovered in his or her life, a la Dickinson, Clampitt, etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Slip-Up","review":"I don't know what happened here but Carson's last two books have really gone down hill.

There are poems in here that first appeared in prose elsewhere and now are in lines!

Bing Crosby, Danny Kay, and Rosemary Clooney can brighten anyone's Christmas in this movie. The plot revolves around Crosby and Kay, old army buddies who make it big in show business after the WWII. They meet two sisters who are going to a Vermont Inn for a Christmas show. The Inn is not in good financial shape, and it turns out to be owned by the general who was in charge of Crosby and Kay during WWII. The musical score is provided by Irving Berlin, and includes such songs as \\"Count Your Blessings,\\" \\"Blue Skies,\\" and its namesake, \\"White Christmas.\\" Most of the dances are well choreographed. There is one that is in the middle of the movie that isn't entertaning, but overall, the dances are great. I am a big fan of both Bing Crosby and Danny Kay, so this movie is right up my alley. If you like light comedy, good music, and great actor chemistry, this is the movie for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why White Christmas is one of the best movies around","review":"I would just like to say that I absolutely love this movie. Not only is it a quintessential Christmas movie, but it stars famous names like Bing Crosby and Rosemarie Clooney. Now, people my age might not remember these names anymore, but regardless, everyone of all ages should still watch this movie. My favorite part about it is that it required pure talent; there was nothing fake or phony about the elegance of their dancing or the pure sounds of their voices. I wish there were more movies today that weren't just awed because of their special effects or computer graphics. Everyone should see this movie to know what real talent is and to just enjoy the wit and romance of this movie in general!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL","review":"I LOOK FORWARD TO THIS CLASSIC EVERY YEAR!I JUST CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE MOVIE.

This DVD must be a real low for Paramount Home Video! Not only is the image far too dark, but the colors are so horribly weak and cold. I took out the latest Laser Disc version from my shelf and immediately saw much warmer and richer hues all through the film! And a lighter image with better contrasts! Of course, the DVD looks quite a lot sharper with less chroma noise on all those red Santa outfits, and I love the added participation of Ms. Clooney. But the only thing that looks great colorwise on the DVD, is the green ivy on the credits. Come on Paramount - almost ten years have passed since the release of the Laser. This 1991 Disc was far from perfect, so what's the point of making the DVD appear decidedly worse? Is this technical progress? Paramount should recall the DVD quickly and check out the original negative in their vaults, or at least create a new transfer from the same source as the Laser Disc. My DVD goes back to the shop tomorrow!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Movies ok, but....","review":"The movies were great and what I wanted, with one exception...

I have been trying for several months to get a copy of the colorized version of \\"It's A Wonderful Life\\". I saw this advertized as color and ordered it.

I'm dating myself as being old, because when I first saw this, we had an old black and white RCA television.Now they've remastered the video, and it's just beautiful. The color is so spectacular, especially the red of Rosemary Clooney's and Vera Ellen's dresses near the end of the movie.The movie always makes me cry near the end when they open the big outside door and show the snow.The music is great and I still watch it every year. Now I have it on video, I watch it about ten times every year.

What a difference! It's something that we watch every Christmas season."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epitomizes the Christmas Spirit","review":"\\"White Christmas\\" has been my favorite Christmas movie since I was a little girl. This is about a group of people who overcome their own human foibles (Judy faking a letter from Benny; Emma misinterpreting Bob's phone conversation with Ed Harrison) to show someone how much they care. The song \\"We'll Follow the Old Man\\" is about the camaraderie and loyalty that occurs in a unit that has served and seen battle together. Meanwhile there's a double love story and great singing and dancing. The sets are bigger than life and the costumes are glamorous in a way we don't see anymore. I strongly disagree with Leonard Matlin's cynical review."},{"rating":"2","title":"George Clooney's Aunt Rosie with Der Bingle","review":"This movie has been as annual a tradition with me as it is with the networks, I'm not going to just repeat the plot and stars as given above, and it was the source of a number of pop songs of the mid-fifties (I'm not going to repeat the list as given above either). Except they left out what I feel is the best song in whole the thing: \\"Love, You Didn't Do Right By Me\\", the solo number Auntie Rosie did in a club gig after walking out on Bing and \\"sister\\" Vera Ellen. That one didn't even get airplay like so many of the others. It was the one song that displayed Clooney at what she was best at--the torch song. It must have been that side of Clooney that inspired later stars like Streisand.

However, this wasn't even a very good musical in my opinion. Danny Kaye is brilliant in anything he does, and Rosemary Clooney was charming as always, but it seemed like the entire second half of the movie was dedicated to Vera Ellen's unremarkable dancing skills. The songs were kind of boring, and the dancing sequences in the second half are only mildly less interesting than a drum solo. The story itself could have been interesting, but they chose to spend more time on the dancing and singing than the actual story, so it felt like a lot was missing in the overall feel of the movie. I have not yet seen \\"Holiday Inn,\\" this movie's precursor (and from what I understand, pretty much the same movie), but I think I would still recommend that one over this, which seems more like a A-list sketch comedy than an actual movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointing!!!!!!!","review":"The sound was screwed up!

The music is great (though some appears in other places). The love story is predicatable (as in most movies of this era) but still enjoyable. The ending may be predictable (how many of these type of movies really had a surprise ending?) but still brings a lump to my throat every time I see it.

Don't wait until next Christmas to see it."},{"rating":"2","title":"OK movie but a wonderful blu ray disk","review":"The movie is a bit derivative though it is still enjoyable.

Aside from some great musical numbers (esp. thedance sequences) this was an overlong snore. The plot was so convolutedfor such little payoff -- all that secrecy/misunderstanding for theGeneral's surprise party. And nothing says \\"Christmas cheer and warmth\\"better than a stage recreation of a bombed-out European landscape! Bycontrast, HOLIDAY INN, had a nicely paced inherent structure in itstelling of an inn open only on holidays and some truly memorable tunesand musical numbers. That film's atmosphere and warmth seemed genuineand not wrapped up in the false sentimentality and schmaltz of theremake. The only reason to buy a DVD of WHITE Christmas would be tohave the ability to skip to the dance scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAY OVERRATED...How is it so popular?","review":"I really have no idea how people consider this a \\"holiday classic\\". The photo on the cover is the best part of the movie. Really.Hard to follow storyline, I forgot it was a Christmas movie at all. It is mostly about glorifying the Army and war. I heard it was based on \\"Holiday Inn\\", a MUCH better movie and musical. I wouldn't waste my time on White Christmas.Idk if it was originally in BnW-the version I watched was \\"update\\" in color--but still was awfully dark and kinda depressing. There was no chemistry between the males and females, as there was in Holiday Inn, and most of the singing and dancing was solos done by one woman (and wasn't entertaining in the slightest), while Crosby and partner barely got screen time! What a waste!I can't help but wonder if there are fake reviews on this movie just to keep the rating high..for some reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly singing","review":"This movie is hardly a movie, just a lot of singing and dancing with no actual storyline."},{"rating":"1","title":"What, no blu-ray???","review":"I bought a copy of White Christmas on DVD several years ago and the whole family loves this movie.

It has an easy-going appeal that should make most viewers happy they spent the time seeing it. I would have liked to see the film deal more with the issue of black female and male educational disparity. This is the main reason why so many educated African-American women cannot find a suitable partner within their community. From a sociological standpoint African-American women were given more access to power and resources, because they were viewed as less of a threat, in a society that was segregated until a relatively late date. As a result a yawning chasm has opened up between African-American men and women. The percentage of unmarried African-American women is a major theme and it would have been interesting to explore it roots.

Nonetheless, Kenya does find him attractive but is she willing to give in to temptation and what will her friends and priviledged family say when they find out she's dating a white man? I highly recommend checking this film out, one of the best and under-rated films of 2006. The film also stars Alfre Woodward and Donald Faison.

But she has to go becuse he has to do a book report on dinosaurs, and she goes to the library for three day's in a row. Henry tries to suggest things for Beatrice to do but supprisingly she doesn't want to.I like this book because I read it to my daughter and she enjoys it. It is a good book to read to her because it shows her how she can act sometimes when she \\"doesn't want to.\\" The book helps her see that even though she may think that something is bad because she doesn't like it, doesn't mean that it's bad at all.

Two of the knives were rusted when we got them. When you wash them, you must be very diligent to wipe dry ASAP or they will rust.

They are not too bright (as with some night lights, especially LED), and I really appreciate the auto on/off feature. The only downsides (which haven't made much of a difference to me) are that the difference between high and low light is almost not detectable, and the light sensor is sensitive so it can go on and off during the day when the light is low. Not a big deal.

I did not expect it to light up since the room I plugged it into was lit. It seems you have to have direct light shining on the nightlight for it to turn off - it would be nice to be able to adjust the sensitivity of the light sensor.The bigger issue is that after the first night of use one of lights stopped working. After unplugging and plugging the nightlight back in, it flickered on for a split second and stayed off (in a dark area).With that being said, the light they give off is bright but muted and would have worked well in our hallway had one not stopped working.

They are very energy efficient. After running both lights every evening, they are photosensitive, I noticed no difference at all in my electric bill. These lights receive four stars from me only because the \\"dimmer\\" switch has no noticeable effect.

I like these the best, except that the switch on one of them is not working. It now will not turn on unless you are actively pressing the switch. I would return it, but I doubt it's worth the time and money.I like these best because the others don't have a light diffuser to provide a gentle light. The others expose the LED and are actually too bright at night when walking down the hallway. Since these are not so bright and intense, I put them in my girls bedroom.The sensor is not as sensitive as I would like. The area must be well lit from multiple windowns at mid-day before the sensor will turn the light off. Mine typically stay on for most of the day because of this.

Among Kelley's insights is that a person must have a \\"courageous conscience\\" to be an exemplary follower. By that he means, the integrity to know right from wrong and the courage to speak up at appropriate times even at personal cost. Kelley makes clear that a strong personal support system and a strong financial foundation are both essential to permit an \\"exemplary follower\\" to have a \\"courageous conscience.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many pages, so little subject.","review":"It seems that the authors put things in this book only to make the book thicker.

There are a few bugs that get annoying such as games locking up during some challenges, etc, but nothing major.

This was obvious when the main character did not notify the proper chain of command after he theorized correctly that a terrorist-lead, nuclear-missile armed ship is headed straight toward them. After the initial meeting with the sub's Captain (not the Commander) who sends an arrest team after a culprit, he never issues orders to protect his crew or sub. Another poor decision was made to surface the sub to send a message about a new murder not about the nuclear missile threat. This made the sub a sitting-duck waiting to be attacked. What sub Captain or Commander would make dumb decisions like this? Even after the torpedos hit, the NCIS team ask each other what is happening. The whole book was strange. I felt no real attachment to any of the characters. But I'm very glad our real life military functions better than this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"TRITE","review":"I started to order all three books in the series and I am glad I decided to read the lead off book first. As a Navy and USMC Vet I can see errors in this book that amazed me. The US Navy has never given regular command of major combat vessel to a Commander. Command of aircraft carriers go to very senior four stripe Captains, usually the ships navagator is also a Full Captain and the Exec Officer of the USS Kennedy would have been a four stripe captain.As a former Police Officer I can also see errors of juristiction. The NCIS may have full juristiction on a Military Base but their authority does not extend beyond those limits. An off base Homicide investigation would still fall under the juristiction of the local authorites. Those authoraties might or might not agree to NCIS participatation but they would not relenquish the entire case.

Dave asserts that all the cool rock bands were the Rolling Stones and the Beach boys and the stuff his son listens to is garbage (he also asserts that his son listens to bands with names such as \\"Heave\\" and \\"Squatting Turnips\\"). This just goes to show you that Dave is old, but he doesn't mind making fun of the fact that he's old.

I would give this zero stars if I could, only because of the narration. As usualy, Dave Barry is very funny, but it doesn't come through in this version because it's impossible to get past the narrator's reading. In a word, he is AWFUL. He sounds like a combination between a bad Paul Harvey impersonator and the adult voice of Ralphie in \\"A Christmas Story.\\" His timing and inflection are totally wrong for the material and he completely ruins the whole book. I couldn't get through one of the five CDs before I wanted to throw the thing out the window. It would have been great if they had used someone like Harry Anderson (who played a fictionalized version of Dave on TV a few years ago) to read this, and then perhaps Barry's humor would have come through.

I received my item within 3 days after placing the order. Kudos to BikerHiway. Now for the review.The black reflective tape works as good as can be expected. It is BLACK, therefore it will not reflecte as much light as does white reflective tape. The same holds true for the Red reflective tape and any other non-white colors. I digress. The black tape does reflect light and is virtually unseen on black items. I have a black motorcycle and placed a few strips of this material at key spots and to the novice, would go unnoticed during the day. I used this on fiberglass and metal and the the material was easiy to apply...just clean the spot first.

It doesnt look like much material in the package but its enough to cover any minimalist job.Now for the color that I was expecting to recieve, a stealth black reflective tape that is visible with light but nearly invisible during the day. Well, it's not as advertised the reflective side is more like a shiny gunmetal color and the backing is what you get that is stealth black.I recommend purchase to anyone who wants a other than white or red reflective material, but don't waist your time with this product if you truly want a stealth black look."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"Placed this on the sides of my truck bed & lower frame of my Harley & I cannot believe how well they reflect light."},{"rating":"2","title":"reflective tape","review":"This stuff is awesome,as far as reflective tape goes.I especially like the 4\\" wide- I cut out patterns and put them on the back of my saddlebags and riding jacket."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great addition to our homeschooling items!","review":"My 3 year old LOVES these cubes!

It's for those who have been turned off because of something evil a priest or a minister has done (whether it be molest children, preach hatred, have affairs, etc.). Chapter five adresses the issue of people who claim to be Christian, but who don't live it. It tells you not to let those people ruin Christianity for you.

Differential equations and advanced math models are used to discuss the issues of diving decompression. The author presents an overview of the models used for decompression, then advocates changes in our model configuration. He convincingly argues for a change to what he calls a \\"Thermodynamic\\" model. (Seems a bit miss-named to me, it is really about phase changes and the energy of bubble formation- not thermodynamics). The text is long on discussion of the aspects of the Thermodynamic model, but fails in providing specifics . . . the author even acknowledges not rushing to print with a specific decompression schedule. There is enough information in the book for an advanced reader to derive the basis of a Thermodynamic model, but the author never puts it all together in a conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another rushed title to milk more out of the Linux bandwagon","review":"If you have more than 10 minutes Net experience and say, ooh, 3 minutes of coding html you can skip the first 200 or so pages.

But my favorite new feature is the Home City, a place that gives you forts, factories,etc. The economy has been dumbed down, but the battles ALMOST make up for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinker","review":"Well to say I was disappointed is quite understating what I felt about for this game. I was expecting Age of Empires 3 not Empire Earth without the bombers. The game has none of the feeling of its predecessors, it has small cramped maps not the sweeping expanses of AoE 1+2, the AI is retarded, there is little logic in advancement, the battle tactics non existent, you can't even set formations. No surprises at all if you have played Empire Earth. In fact EE (which is a really poor game in itself) is much more engrossing than this simplistic, albeit very pretty, direct port of Empire Earth. My kids, whose pocket money was spent on this wasted effort, were even more disappointed than I was.It is not Age of Empires 3, it has neither the feel, game play nor charm of the Age of Empires games series and I look forward to Microsoft & Ensemble Studios actually bringing out the proper Age of Empires 3."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great graphics - lame game play","review":"Microsoft should have just spent the time making a nice graphics upgrade to AOE2. AOE3 graphics are great but the game play is not. First off, the top civilization is Imperial - yuck. Secondly, the introduction of the 'card' system for building a home city is really boring. In addition, the unit selection is HORRIBLE, the combat units are WAY over powered when it comes to attacking walls. What's the point of a wall when a handfull of Indians chunking spears can take out a section of the wall in a couple of minutes. Also, where on EARTH is the formation selection? There are a LOT of simple 'actions' missing from AOE3 that are (in my opinion) fundamentals and are present in all the other games (AOE2, EE, RON, etc.) This game kept my interested for about 2 hours.Overall this game is just more of the same - not worth the $50.

Somebody was asleep at the switch during packing because I'm missing both bags of hardware (screws, nuts, etc...), the grill top handle, the grill leg handle, all parts for the ignitor, the burner, and the grease cup and clip. I called the manufacturer's 800 number to get the missing pieces and they told me I should receive them in two days. We'll see... I'm a little worried at what I'll receive because the part numbers listed in my installation manual did not match the part numbers shown on the operators screen. It's probably just a substitution issue but I don't have a warm and fuzzy feeling. More to come..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its not a Webber . . .","review":"Alright, I admit that I'm a BBQ snob, if there is such a thing. This grill just doesnt quite measure up in terms of build quality or performance. The box arrived from amazon and the interior was filthy. The brickette bag opened up and the ashes were everywhere. It wasnt difficult to assemble, but its not the most solid structure ever. The fit of the top/cover is awkward. The flame inside the grill comes from a single contact point, which is located beneath a heating plate. Usually, this disperses heat adequately, but not when its windy. Also, as the grill ages, Im sure the flame will be less and less evenly dispersed, making for hot spots in the grill. Ill keep this grill for two years and then go back to a Webber."},{"rating":"1","title":"nice size grill, but paint issues","review":"I was excited to find a grill that was not huge and you could easily wheel around. When I lit it for the first time to make sure it worked and after about ten minutes of heating up, it started making a popping noise. I noticed that the paint was starting to chip off in places. This occurred both outside and inside the grill in several spots. I am not sure if it was just this unit that had the defective paint or not, but I decided to return it and not try another model like this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to Assemble - Poor Instructions","review":"While this unit is compact and serves its purpose, the Start switch (for igniting the burner) has never worked properly, so the burner has to be lit manually with a match. As for the assembly, dozens of parts were included and the instructions were poorly presented and hard to follow. Unless you're highly skilled at this sort of thing, you'll likely find assembly of this unit frustrating and time-consuming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy if you need high heat for grilling","review":"First, do not pay attention to the older reviews that say it comes with a propane tank and ceramic briquettes. It does not.That said, this is a decent product that works as described. Its construction is comensurate with the price - A plastic base, thin sheet metal for the legs, a plastic handle - but the fire bowl is thick steel, the grid as others have said is high quality. The lighter works flawlessly.My problem with it is that it won't get hot enough for true grilling. Hot dogs took 20 minutes to cook on this, chicken almost an hour, and I can't imagine doing hamburgers on it.It's OK if you want to do slow cooking with the cover on, but my style is to build big fire and sear the meat so fast the juices don't have a chance to escape. For slow cooking I have an oven. This one went back to the big box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, patio 'warmer'","review":"I bought one of these as it is compact and yet not a table top unit. There is one primary flaw with the unit which is that it simply doesn't get hot. If you want to sear something, you need to get a propane torch or something because the grill of the unit can't be lowered closer to the flame. This means that the food is always at least 10+ inches away from the heat. Because the heat is so weak, as soon as you remove the lid to check on the food, the temperature of the unit drops severely and doesn't recover for several minutes.Terrible, terrible, terrible grill.Really, it's terrible.Looks nice though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok","review":"I had purchased the patio caddie 3 years ago and loved it. I would bbq about 4x a week, it was that great and convenient.Unfortunately I needed to replace the bbq, and ordered another one.The new model is much less quality. And I paid $60 more on Amazon than I did the first one. The control know does not regulate the heat to HIGH, heats up the grill to MEDIUM at best.Also having spanish translation on all the controls is annoying.It is a great fit for a small patio, and the previous one was GREAT!!! I was hoping for the same quality and enjoyment, but have been extremly disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad but some cheap parts","review":"This isn't bad for a small place like my deck. Doesn't get super hot but with cover on and high heat works fine. The heavy duty enamel grill plate is nice and the metal kettle is attractive. Unfortunately the plastic handle on top gets very hot and broke with a small bump after only a couple of weeks. A labyrinth of customer service makes my replacing it unlikely. Don't really recommend although their aren't many small gas grills out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great grill, need a new gas tank...","review":"I LOVE this grill! Although it is limited in size and you can't adjust the grill height as with larger gas grills, it is perfect for one or two people. I have always been a charcoal fan, but I have to say it's nice to come home and grill up some chicken or fish for one, without waiting for coals!Does anyone know where I can get a replacement gas tank in the small size that comes with the grill? I recently moved from CA to MA and the movers wouldn't take even an empty tank...I can't find that size in the NorthEast...hey Amazon, do you sell just the replacement tank?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great grill for single mom!!","review":"As a single mom I HATED doing the charcoal thing in order to barbeque....it took too long, it was messy and just a pain. So when we were on vacation and the condo had this little gem, we barbequed every night. It is small enough to keep on my patio without hogging all the room, and easy to use. Kinda a pain to assemble, but now that it is done, I am home free for easy meals and fun outdoors. A great deal at $139 too!"},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISAPPOINTING","review":"This was my third patio caddy. The idea is great. Small gas grill perfect for cooking for 1-4 people, dome top makes it possible to grill a whole chicken. Unfortunately, the quality of construction seriously declined - and now these are discontinued items from Charbroiler. I don't have a suggestion for another grill, but if you find one floating around out there on the market, save your money. The new design has the legs in 2 pieces that need to be screwed together (and are wobbly no matter how tight the screws), the grill used to be nice flat bars, now thin wire, and the enamel finish has already started chipping of in a big way. I am so disappointed in the quality of this grill, I doubt the next one will even be a Charbroil brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damaged in Shipping","review":"Everything was fine with the grill except the lid had a quarter-sized piece of enamel missing during shipping. Charbroil said they would not replace the lid because it didn't affect the grilling. I sent them a photo indicating the damage to the lid and they decided it would be covered under warranty. It's been two weeks and I have not received the new lid. I called Charbroil and am getting the runaround...hopefully the cover will be shipped soon. Otherwise, it's a very nice looking grill for a small patio."},{"rating":"2","title":"CHAR-BROIL PATIO GAS GRILL","review":"GREAT PRODUCT. DONT HESITATE IF YOU HAVE A SMALL PATIO.

When I called CharBroil customer support they had no help for me other than to MAIL me the manual (which obviously doesn't help me grill dinner tonight). I went on their website and while they offer a list of ~100 manuals \\"in case you lost yours\\", the one for this grill is not available. I'm beginning to wonder if they actually have a manual.

Read before buying.","review":"I got this at a great price in my gold box and was ecstatic as I have been looking for a gas grill for some time. When I unpacked it there were two large chips out of the thin enamel coating on the bottom half of the cooking chamber. When I called Char-Broil about a possible replacement, they said that this model has been discontinued, so that is something to be aware of.As I was getting near the end of assembly I realized that there were no flame diffusers like all other gas grills I've seen. The flame comes up through one tube and heats a round, five inch diameter cast iron plate. The heat then radiates from there. NOT at all what I call a grill. I call that an oven. If you are looking to cook over flame, look elsewhere. Also, the quality of the product is mediocre at best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grill Parts","review":"I live in a sub-tropical climate, and after a year the enamel grill kettle is holding up well. It is kept covered most of the time. The problem with this grill so far has been the rapid deterioration of the cast iron heat plate inside. It has already rusted about half way through. For the price I paid for this small grill, I expected a much longer life span for it's parts. Now I have to pay for a new plate, if I can find one."},{"rating":"1","title":"BIG waste to time and effort","review":"I ordered this item based on favorable reviews from friends. The grill was not available in stores in the SF Bay Area so I ordered from Amazon. It was not immediately available so I waited 4-6 weeks and it arrived on the promised date. However, the connection on the igniter cable was the wrong size. I called Charbroil customer service and was told they could not provide a new one because this grill is discontinued and no longer supported by them. (Huh? I said). Since I had the whole thing assembled anyway, I attempted a test using manual lighting and it didn't work at all.

The only reason I bought this one is that I got it for 48 bucks.Its not really even worth that in my book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good grilling but poor design","review":"The grill does a fine job of cooking. Design leaves a lot to be desired. The top of the grill is not hinged and designed to fit on the side of the bottom section, putting a 500 degree top next to your cooking movements - really bad idea!!! Where do I place this hot top, out of the way, when turning meat so not to get dirt or other stuff on it? Also with the wheels located, NOT opposite the handle, it is difficult to move with a tank attached (which will be most of the time). Definitely would not purchase again.

It is theoretically a nice little grill however I have been very disappointed in the overall quality. The supports are flimsy to say the least and the gas valve (controller) has never really worked.

If I pre-heat it with the top on, it'll get up to 500F or so, but opening it up to put on food or flip things causes the heat to drop to about 375F pretty quickly (even on high)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patio Caddie gas grill","review":"This is the best grill that anyone can find for the price and the space it takes up on the deck!

I ordered it as a Christmas gift for my mother and received free shipping which was great as well. The lid handle was broken in the box upon its arrival (I did not discover this until about two days before Christmas when I was assembling the grill). I called Char Broil and they were very helpful. They sent out a new handle at no charge to me. I did not receive the handle in time for Christmas, but it arrived the next week. They have not used the grill yet, but the customer service is great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Patio Caddy is junk","review":"We had several gas and then electric caddies--for a beach house with high winds making gas impractical. They once were great and now are absolute junk, and they shortened the warranty from 5 years to 90 days. Even so, I was able to make a warranty claim on our last one (AND I MEAN LAST ONE)because the burner unit and the regulator/plug-in burned out in 60 days! Then the handle broke in half. Just after I duct-taped it, the entire handle came off. And everything else, the legs, the grate, all are thin and cheap. They have sold their last unit to me. P.S. If you look at the favorable and unfavorable reviews, the favorable are generally old and the unfavorable are new--doubtless coinciding with their switch to manufacturing in China."},{"rating":"2","title":"great grill, fits anywhere!","review":"compact, simple, it does the job and tucks away. For those with small patios or who don't want a monstrous thing outside this is perfect. It took me a couple of hours to assemble but was only somewhat difficult.

It cooks just like a big grill, without the bulk. The smaller than standard gas tank is a bit of a problem, as you have to find a place that fills them.

Needless to say, there's not a lot of room. All of the grills we found were monstrous! Some friends suggested looking on the web-- and that's what brought us to Amazon and the Patio Caddie! We are quite happy with it: it suits our needs perfectly. It heats up quickly and cooks up the steaks and the turkey burgers just great. We, too, got the larger sized gas canister-- that's working well. We've been warned not to get the intended cover, so we're trying to figure out what we should get to cover it up -- at least during the harsh Chicago winter. In the meantime, we're happy grillers and our neighbors are thrilled too! (The other downside would be the lid issue-- where to put it..? The clips are awkward to use.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Long Time Owner","review":"Having owned this grill now for at least 4 years, I think it is the best grill I've ever owned (I've owned at least 20-30).

Best flavor, least flare-up, easiest to clean, usually just scape grill with puddy knife, and uses the least amount of fuel. Fuel usage is unbelievable, about 150 usages to 20 lb tank.

Its shipped in a little box and has lots of parts, and takes a couple of hours to assemble. Parts are cheep and don't always line up or fit together very well. Once the grill is in one piece it take up very little space, so its good for a small space. I was disappointed with the flame adjustment, it's basically on or off. It's very hard to position the meat anywhere on the grill that is not directly over the flame, so the meat burns on the outside before it is done on the inside. The lid does not open on a hinge like most grills, you must completely remove the lid and put it somewhere to get at the meat. I wish they made a really high end gas grill for a small space. Not everyone with an outside balcony wants to slum it with their gas grill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I had previous Patio Caddie and was delighted.

Established artists Travis, Coldplay, Beta Band, Dandy Warhols, and Badly Drawn Boy put in appearances with lesser-knowns and soon-to-be-knowns that are just as good. The collection of indie pop mixes upbeat and downer songs in just the right balance to fit any mood and any day. The Dandy Warhols Bohemian Like You rocks you and Beta Band shines in Broken Up A Ding Dong, my two favorite cuts.

So why bother to have a thermometer if it doesn't tell you the truth or something reasonably close to it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job as advertised","review":"Great tool for monitoring the min/max temps in an area. I use it in my brew closet so I know what kind of temps my fermentor is getting throughout the day/night. The min/max hands are a bit twitchy and can stick or jump pretty easily when resetting them but this isn't a huge inconvenience. Once reset it seems to accurately read the min/mix range without slippage or sticking.The provided hardware is great for mounting the thermometer and the swing arm style is handy for putting it somewhere out of the way but still being able to get to it to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"I bought this solely for its min/max display, and put it in the garden. The min or max (I forget which) never worked; the pointer got hung up on something internal and could never do what it was supposed to do. The design was obviously shoddy.

I felt that there was enough outside conflict to take away the problems with the main characters' inability to talk about their feelings. After awhile, it became so emotionally draining to read about how miserable they were when all they would have to do is talk to each other!

You will note that those who have given positive reviews were all reasonably accomplished in XML and happy for the reference material. However, as someone that had never even seen any XML, I found the tutorial incomprehensible. The author seems to have a terrible grasp of English, uses it sloppily, and makes errors to boot. As even those that gave a positive review seem to agree, if you want a book to learn XML give this book a wide berth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid this one","review":"This is the worst XML documentation I've run across, online or on paper. I am not a total beginner with XML, I didn't expect this book to be a tutorial, and I picked up this book because it seemed like it would get to the point quickly. At first it seemed promising because of its brevity; then I realized that it was written very sloppily. In the Overview (chapter 1), the first mention of a DTD (with no explanation of what it's an abbreviation of), states \\"XML supports but does not require DTDs\\". Great. Good thing I knew what a DTD was, because this book wasn't going to tell me. Four pages later, the book tells me, \\"As you have already learned, a DTD defines rules for document contents.\\" Well, I sure didn't \\"already learn\\" it from this book! Amazing that it references prior material that it doesn't contain! The rest of the book is more of the same. Very poor."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a reference guide, not XML in plain English","review":"You would think a book entitled \\"...in Plain English\\" would be about explaining a complicated subject in easily understandable terms. However, this book only gives a brief and very lame introduction to XML. Almost the entire book is a reference guide to the XML and XML related syntax. Since this information can be obtained over the Internet for free it is questionable why this book even exists (maybe that's why they didn't name it more appropriately \\"Another XML Reference Guide\\")."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, if you know what to expect...","review":"Think of this book like you would think of a dictionary -- not great reading material, but good to look stuff up in. Please do not think that this is a book for beginners. Like a dictionary, you need to have some idea of the language in order to get any use of it.

It's only leak proof if you get the cover on perfectly wich wouldn't be a big deal except it's almost impossible to align the inside threads of the cover once hot liquid is poured into the cup. Don't seem to have the problem when the cup is empty. So I would say if the cup is empty, it's leak proof. The handle is ackward to hold, and drinking from the bevel shaped lid is a challenge not to let it spill from the lower sides. The lever used to close the drinking spouts is difficult to use especialy after it's wet from sitting in coffee while you drink. On a positive note it does seem to keep the coffee hot longer than the cheaper plastic travel mug."},{"rating":"2","title":"Travel Mug","review":"Does not leak, just as advertised. The top of the cover is not one level. It has two higher sides and two lower sides, sort of like a wave around the top of the mug. This makes drinking a bit tricky. I actually poured coffee all over myself at work last week. But the liquid does flow well when the stopper is in the open position. When the stopper is closed it does not leak. When the top is screwed on the two higher sides are not in position to offer a good drinking position, thus the spillage as described before. If yours tightens with the higher side in the correct drinking position you should have no problem. I typically drink the entire contents in about 3 hrs, and the coffee stays warm for about 1 hour of that time, and that's with pre-heating the inside of the mug with hot water before adding my coffee.

The 360 degree drinking (meaning you can drink from any side) is a good feature. The mug needs to be opened with two hands so not good for people who want to open and close it while driving.

When they say leakproof lid, however, they really mean it. Even in the open position NOTHING comes out!!! Can't figure out if it is possible to adjust the lid. We have to drink our beverages with the lid off which defies to whole purpose of \\"travel mugs\\". I took advantage of the 5 year warrenty and the replacements had the same problem.

I have never grilled fish though, because unlike gas, i can't burn off the smell, and I'm too afraid to turn it all the way up. I usually cook at 350-400 degrees. Convenience wise, the only complaints are very minor. It does cool VERY quickly when you remove the lid, so you must be prepared and work quickly.

The reason this part normally overheats is because of the heating element inside the grill. As this element starts to go out, it will actually overheat and cause the connection of the extension cord to melt. We advise that any time you replace your extension cord, you also would want to replace the heating element.\\"First I've heard about that.

The connector's metal to metal contact appears very flimsy -it's jsut a very thing piece of metal that rests against the conductors on the resistive heater- and this part of the unit almost disintegrated with the amount of current that passed through. Now we have a $200 3.5 foot tall paper paper weight on our balcony.I'm not sure how this could happen, the unit is only supposed to draw as much current as it needs.

They were originally fantastic and would get very, very hot - great for searing steaks or fish and also perfect for low, slow smoking a brisket or medium-roasting a whole chicken. Then, charbroil went for the \\"gold\\" and started getting the product made in China - downgrading everything - including the most important heating element. That is when the \\"wheels came off the wagon\\".

While assembling it, the porcelain coating on the body cracked off in most places where a fastener contacted it. I contacted the manufacturer and they agreed to replace the lower bowl (bottom half). They sent, instead, an aluminum liner which I didn't need. Char Broil has not replied to my four subsequent attempts to contact them.The grill will only get to 400 degrees instead of the necessary 600 that they recommend in their cooking instructions. Meat gets done, but you don't get that charred effect. I might as well cook it in the oven. I am very disappointed.Update: I finally got tired of buying replacement controllers and heating elements and bought another brand. The Char Broil went to the garbage where it belongs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat disappointed","review":"The grill is nice and certainly serves the purpose since I cannot have a gas grill on my lanai. One problem with assembly - namely the insulation basket for the top is too small to fit as it should. Other than that the grill is easy to assemble.Main gripe is grill will not get over 400 degrees F. Left it on for a long time and the hottest it will go is about 420, which drops when food is put on. Not the best temp. for searing or real grilling.UPDATEIt gets worse - after 5 or so uses the grill now only gets to 300 F, by next week I won't be able to boil water.

The fact that the lid needed to be lifted off and hand no hinges was a minor annoyance. But when the plastic parts on the dial started to melt and the grill began to malfunction, I was impelled to write this bad review. A product should be suitable for the purpose for which it was intended --- grilling food --- and it should function for a reasonable amount of time considering the cost. I have a 35 year old electric grill at our camp that cost less than $40 when new that is still working brilliantly. This grill failed in 75 days! The quality of this grill is simply unacceptable.

Thankfully I knew to just put the cover on and shut it off and let it burn itself off or I could have burned my face off! Part of the reason is I have a large family so the aluminum foil like pan lining the bottom of the grill had some gunk on it. I knew it had to be cleaned, but I thought I'd get three meals out of the grill before having to dismantle it and clean it. I bucked the system and bought another gas grill instead. In my condo complex we are not supposed to have gas grills on the deck, so I'll have to move it. Ironic because in all the YEARS of cooking on gas grills, the food has never caught fire like in the charbroil grill. I think it would be a good grill for a smaller family with someone who doesn't mind taking it apart and cleaning the aluminum foil like bowl like liner on the bottom of the unit.

A neighbors got this grill and after borrowing it one time bought my own. Cooks evenly, looks nice. The assembly is a little tricky and the unit doesn't feel all that sturdy. I've had to tighten the bolts after a few uses but the grilling is great. I also got a cover for it and I'm glad I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Product Quality Not As Good As It Used To Be","review":"The Patio Caddie that we received was slightly damaged in shipping (although not badly enough to deal with the hassle of mailing back a return...just some denting). The bad thing about this grill is that it takes forever to heat past 400 degrees and no longer has a grate area to place little ceramic briquets, therefore, the insides will wear out in record time. This will be our last Patio Caddie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The first char-broil patio grill I purchased worked quite well and lasted for several years. The replacement I purchased was very disappointing. In general, the quality of the second grill was not as good. But the bigger problem has been the thermostat. The first one burned out after less than 1 year and the replacement thermostate I purchased for $50 lasted less than 2 months. I am not investing any more money in this grill. I have since purchased another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plug it in","review":"I was very excited to purchase this grill, thinking that it would be perfect for my small patio. Alas, the instructions say that you have to plug it into an OUTDOOR outlet, and it should not be plugged into an indoor circuit.How many apartment complexes bother to put outdoor plugs on their patios? That certainly makes the grill a lot less useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"burned and melted plug","review":"after using it only 5-6 times the power plug at the top of the grill melted, whole grill overheated, was a big safety issue, there was no way to unplug it due to heat and possible shock hazard, stay away from this, it can burn your house"},{"rating":"2","title":"char-broil patio caddie electric grill","review":"this is the best electric grill. it is simple to operate and the has that bar-b-cue flavor and look. would recommend this product highly."},{"rating":"1","title":"not recommended","review":"within the first few months I had to have the porcelain grate replaced (do not use metal tools on it) and had to fight Char-broil to get it. It never got very hot so not useful in the winter. The latest is the cord melted or burned up. They want 60 bucks for a new one. Not going to happen.

If your a serious cook, go with charcoal or gas. Remember the phrase, if it sounds to good to be true it probably is. The grill never heats up high enough to sear meat.

The first lasted about 3 years and worked great. The next one lasted a shorter time. The most recent purchase lasted less than one year. In each case, the problem is the same - it will not heat fully and therefore won't sear the meat leaving it dry and tasteless. It also takes 2-3 times as long to cook anything compared to when it was new. When we first started using these, the warranty was 1 year. It is now only 90 days - I guess to reflect the fact they know it is not built to last. Ashame because their original product was a good one.

The story follows no logical sequence. Author talks about how he drives while drinking beer with his buddies, slaughters pet rabbits for meat and tells his kids they \\"ran away\\", ran over his kitty accidently with his car, and relates some experiences in passing from the fire department. I felt it was an insult to professional fire service personnel. I would prefer that Mr. Brown not be one of the responders if I needed help, unless no other units were available. This book was a complete waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fire Fighter's Life","review":"Brown wrote several excellent novels such as \\"Joe\\" and \\"Dirty Work\\" before he passed away a few years ago. Gone too soon, like many great ones. This book, however, is a memoir of his days as a firefighter in Oxford, Mississippi, before he gave up his firehose and axe for pen and paper. More than a book about fighting fires and rescuing people from gruesome highway auto accidents, Brown also writes about life in small town Mississippi and his family. Just like in his novels, Brown can write about matters as mundane as drinking beer or riding around in pickup trucks and still sustain the reader's interest. The man had a way with words. If you've read any of his novels and enjoyed them, you should like these essays too."},{"rating":"1","title":"On Fire? Barely.","review":"Only 20% of this book is related to the fire service and it is adequately written at best. The rest is a rambling bore. Akin to a teenager's journal, it is witless, slipshod prose about the author's pets, drunk driving, raising rabbits, hunting, fishing, and the like. Mind you, I would be delighted to read about firefighter's off-duty life if it was interesting and well-written. This is neither."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"I don't know how this book ever got published. It was a rudderless account of unrelated stories about nothing.

He shares more about his dog not being able to produce puppies than he does about the various accidents and fires he has been a part of. I was shocked by how much he digresses, over and over again he talks about animals which have absolutely nothing to do with firefighting or even his life!

Mr. Brown is a poor representative of the typical firefighter. He lacks the pride associated with this profession - both on and off duty.

Some of the songs are strangely amusing but for the most part it's just a bunch of abstract sound with some beats thrown in. Which by it's self could be all right, but combined with the cleaned up vocals and lack of aggression it just left me disappointed.

But it sure makes Mr. Popper Famous and it makes his Dream come true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapponting","review":"Without reading it first, I chose this book to be part of my son's summer book club, because I thought it would be fun for the kids to read the book and then go see the movie. I read the book on the way to and from a SF Giant's game (Go Giants!) and was extremely disappointed. The story was dry and lacking in character development. The book zipped through events with very little detail. I honestly think that if this book were submitted to a publisher now, that it would be rejected. It's a cute idea for a book, but the writing was not what I expected for a story that was made into a movie and praised so highly by so many people."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memories","review":"This was my favorite book in second grade.

It never held any of the kid's attention, nor the parent's. At first the kids would be quiet hoping it would be great, but then 1 Chapter through they got restless asd started talking. It was only because the book wasn't good. I had to agree that the book is dull, boring, and the plot just isn't written well. I know this is fiction and all, I LOVE fiction and fantasy, but this just didn't make any sense. The idea was good, but it was just written out of order, cluttered, and dull. Maybe an adult MIGHT like this, but kids, NO WAY. Don't get this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too good","review":"Unfortunately, when the books arrived, a couple were not in the best of shape.

Soon one turns into 12, and he and his family are traveling the country with their show.In addition to the recommended age group, this is an excellent choice for younger children who are advanced readers. The chapters are short and somewhat self-contained, keeping up interest.The biggest downfall of this story is probably the inevitable desire children will feel for a troop of penguins of their own."},{"rating":"2","title":"A laugh out loud book, enjoyable for everyone.","review":"A house painter who loves the Arctic is in for the surprise of his life. He receives a penguin from the famous Admiral Drake and his life changes forever. The penguin gets lonely and sick so Mr. Popper must get him another to help his buddy. The the fun starts when the other penguin has the little penguins. This book touched my every emotion. It would make you laugh on one page then scare you on the next. It would keep you on the edge of your seat in supense and ease you with laughter. I was intrigued by the way that one event led into the next. If comedy is what you like along with the drama then Mr. Popper's Penguins would make a great choice for your next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Book Ever","review":"Get this book!

The wording in this book contains a lot of mistakes and if you don't have intermediate skills in the program, you will have a hard time understanding it. Secondly, some of the examples are very cheezy. I was expecting some really cool stuff, but that's not what I found. They're just intermediate how to's that don't impress me. Maybe I was looking for something different and bought the wrong book. I only bought this book because of the other reviews. Shouldn't have trusted them. Finally, the disc in my book is missing the entire chapter 3 samples. I can't do any of the tutorials. Someone needs to teach these people more coherent writing skills."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely Mistitled","review":"I expected to find, at least, nutritional suggestions, examples of \\"mental exercises\\" one can perform, etc. The authors get your attention with the title, and then [ruin] your expectations because the content is, quite simply, useless.

A smart lady, this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could return this one","review":"but I made the mistake of reading it at the beach. On the plus side, it won't take much of your time. On the (far more significant) minus side, it feels both ill-conceived/tossed together and over-worked ... if that is possible. A dreadfully disappointing book: I expected and hoped for an evocative exploration of marriage -- its joys and sadnesses. Apparently Ms. Carson conceives of marriage as a long-distance, sporadic \\"relationship\\" between a static, if not paralyzed, woman and a beautiful (we are told, not shown) cad. Skip it, skip it, skip it!Re-read the book after reading some of these positive reviews ... I thought maybe I'd missed something. I didn't. Will try some of her other work to see why so many are giving her so much credit ... Meanwhile, the emperor is in clear danger of an indecency citation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ouch!","review":"Unfortunately, this is not her greatest book. It is possibly her worst book, in fact. Aimless & formless, it lacks the weridness that excited us all about Autobiography of Red, and instead is just dull. It feel more like a long poem that someone convinced her to turn into a book. The epigraphs by Keates are pointless, many of them not even epigraphs but mere notations, and really seem like just filler. Check out Autobiography of Red to see this Canadian at her best!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Just In","review":"Yes, it's official: the buzz around Carson was just a fluke. This book is sloppy, self-serving, uninspired and a bore. Add to that the fact that she hasn't a clue what poetry is and you've got one of the worst poetry collections published in past few years."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excrementally bad. Carson just keeps getting worse.","review":"At its best poetry should break your heart, while simultaneously filling it with joy. In this excremental collection Anne Carson does neither. It is truly amazing that in the highly competitive world of poetry this can get published.After reading this book you may need to read Neruda and Rumi just to get the smell out of your mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come Back to Poetry, Ms Carson, Please!","review":"My friend told me recently that after reading Men in the Off Hours she couldn't even stand having the book in her house. She gave it to me and I read it immediately because I couldn't immagine what would cause her, or anyone, to react so strongly and negatively to a book. I see now, I have to admit, where that distate comes from. The book is weak. It's sense of the line is nearly nonexistent, and the story seems to have been recycled from two previous books (there are references made to her own earlier work in Plainwater and Men in the Off Hours, which I find tacky and a little self-obsessed.) On the bright side, I still have faith in Anne Carson's work. She's written some great poems in the past, so I know there's talent there that can reemerge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drivel for the Masses","review":"Anne's Carson's last three books--and most especially this last one, Beauty of the Husband--are books of poetry for people who seem to hate poetry. The lines and forms employed are anti-poetic, the subject matters wholly engaging if you are a middle-aged-plus woman who has felt in some way at some time wronged by the world. And in this way the poetry is greatly popular. And in this way it is also garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Unique Talent","review":"Anne Carson's poetry reflects an unusual intelligence. Her coruscating language combined with a sensitive nature make for a truly unusual book of poetry."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried to like it. I really did!","review":"My roommate is obsessed with this guy, so I decided that I would give him a listen. I tried to find what was appealing. I've listened to it numerous times. Sometimes it takes a few listens to get to like some artists for me, but it never came with Kweller.First of all, Kweller can't sing at all. He can't hold a note, and when he tries to change notes, it's the most sour and displeasing noise. It literally made me cringe!Second, the music itself is nothing special. It's all been done so many times before. It's just a rehash of generic pop/punk/emo. (I'm not bashing punk and emo. I like a bit of it.)Last, the lyrics are ridiculous!! I found myself blurting out laughter that seemed to insult my roommate. I just couldn't hold it back. It's that ridiculous.My recommendation: don't get this unless you have bought every other album on earth and are in desperation for one more."},{"rating":"2","title":"yay?!","review":"Finally, something that kicks butt. This cd is amazing. Ben Kweller shows amazing talent at just barely twenty. His range is great; from folky love songs (\\"Lizzy\\") to tongue-in-cheek pop (\\"Wasted and Ready\\") to piano ballads (\\"In Other Words\\") this guy does it all. And has fun. It's light listening, easy-going, but also intelligent. It's an awesome debut, and finally Ben Kweller seems to be getting the recognition he deserves."},{"rating":"2","title":"BK's back!!","review":"I had never heard of BK but then saw him open for a mediocre Jeff Tweedy. BK was awesome and made the show worthwhile. I bought his \\"Freak Out, It's Ben Kweller\\" demo CD on the way out and what a gem it is. \\"Walk on Me\\" is a favorite, but the closing line to the first song says it all, \\"Dr. Dre ain't got nothin' on me, nor the Snoop D.O. double G.\\" Classic!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid First Solo Outing","review":"Saw BK last night for the first time (as part of \\"The Bens\\" with Ben Folds and Ben Lee), and he really overshadowed his bandmates. I bought the CD at the gig and listened to it twice last night. It's a little raw around the edges, and lyrically he's still got a little way to go, but this is a strong first outing in the Ben Folds mould. Tight instrumental arrangements and good lyrical imagery, if lacking Folds' storytelling ability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Young and talented and completely overlooked","review":"This is an excellent pop/antipop masterpiece. Every song is catchy and hummable but they are also deep enough to avoid the repetitive sound so common with today's music. This cd is damn good..I can only imagine what he will become as his songwriting matures even more. My favorite song is \\"In Other Words\\" Not the loudest or catchiest but perfect in composition. I had the fortune of seeing Ben in concert 2 days ago and it was great. He related well to the audience and played his songs with vigor...not to mention a couple of great covers like \\"Ice Ice Baby\\" and \\"Let me roll it\\" by McCartney...my only wish is that he jammed more than he did. Still, I know we can expect great things to come from BK"},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated","review":"Ben came to my hometown for a show and my friend wanted to go so I went along. I listened to the album before going, and had heard \\"Wasted and Ready\\" on mtv2. The first time I heard Wasted I thought it was pretty catchy but I couldn't get past the damn lyrics. There's a big difference between fun and effortless writing, and writing that's just plain stupid. After hearing the rest of the album I felt the same way about most of the songs. I think he'd be better of having someone else write his lyrics for him. He tries to sound deep at times but ends up sounding like an 8th grade creating writing student.As far as the live show, it was pretty poor. The opener, a somewhat local band, did a much better job grabbing the audience's attention, and everyone, minus a handful of people, was there to see Kweller. His backing musicians just stood there the whole time...it was like they hated him. Ben attempted talking to the audience a couple times but always acted too afraid to say anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Destroyer of Rock Music.","review":"Along with bands such as The Hives,and The White Stripes,this man is destroying rock music with his lame lyrics.Just listen to Wasted and Ready,because when he sang these songs,he was wasted but he never was ready.Avoid these bands at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD Sucks","review":"This is probably the worst CD I have ever owned, well I don't own it anymore. (thank god for record exchange). Sure, he's young and he has a full career ahead of him. He does have a talent but the music itself is just flat out dumb. Everything about this album was just annoying especially the cover. I hated it, and everyone who owns this album and can actually sit through it from start to finish has got some issues. It reminds me of the Partridge Family breaking up, going seperate ways and each of them releasing solo albums. Wait I think that already happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bollocks","review":"Are album reviewers really so desperate that they think this is good????? It's bad, the lyrics are forced, the pop is forced, it's indie pop constipation.

I promise :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is How It Should Be","review":"Take one part Beck, one part Pavement, and one part Ben Folds, mix together with liberal doses of good songwriting, and you have Ben Kweller's \\"Sha Sha.\\" Highlights from this disc include the oddly syncopated \\"How It Should Be (Sha Sha),\\" the country-esque \\"Family Tree,\\" the tongue-in-cheek \\"Commerce, TX,\\" rocker \\"Harriet's Got a Song,\\" and the beautifully elegant closing track, \\"Falling.\\" Ben comfortably alternates between guitar and piano as lead instrument of choice - even more testament to his skills. Take it from a listener who doesn't blindly follow the rest of the pack (see my review of Big Star's \\"Third/Sister Lovers\\"), the music on \\"Sha Sha\\" is immensely enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mini gems inside averageness","review":"I am sure in many years to come Mr Kweller will look back to this album and say \\" well it had a few good points but it was not the best I did\\"There are a few great tracks- the rest so so. Its either a shame someone didn't have the balls to point this out before he released it as when its good its great and he might just have an unbelievable album inside him. I honestly believe if he takes more time and gets better at picking the good tunes he will be a household name. until then its hit or miss on each track. There's no in between.Save your cash as you will buy ity and not play it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ben really does rawk.","review":"Ben Kweller is one of the finest muscians of his time.

His new album (On My Way) will be out real soon so buy Sha Sha now so you can see this awesome awesome man in concert when he comes to your area and be a proud fan. If you like Ben's solo work but think it could be better if it was rockier, check out Radish, Ben's old band, they rock more than Ben solo. Have fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 years and still lovin' this CD!","review":"There are so many highlights of this CD that if I were to name them all, I'd pretty much be listing every song on the album. \\"Sha Sha\\" is the album that introduced me to Ben Kweller and he has since become one of my favorite artists. My review does his music no justice - just listen to songs like \\"Falling,\\" \\"Commerce, TX,\\" \\"In Other Words,\\" and \\"Walk on Me.\\" This man is amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Non stop listening enjoyment","review":"I caught Ben Kweller one night on Austin City Limits. Was immediately interested but procrastinated in buying the CD. A few months later I couldn't pass up a used copy. It was the best $5 I ever spent. I listened to it non-stop for about 3 weeks. Could not keep away from it. From start to finish this is an amazing CD. Who cares if I may never listen to it again. For those 3 weeks Ben Kweller was the man."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than just a 'Lil Ben Folds'","review":"Quite possibly the best CD I've purchased this year, Ben Kweller's \\"Sha sha\\" hasn't spent much time on the outside of my CD player since buying it a month and a half ago. The lyrics are smart, and the production isn't lacking either. Kweller flexes his songwriting muscle throughout this LP, but the brightest of the highlights are 'Commerce, TX' 'Wasted and Ready' and 'Falling'. The disc is driven by emotion without being whiny, which is very crucial as far as replay value is concerned. It's very similar to Ben Folds' newer stuff without being a carbon copy of it. In short, it's simply an excellent CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"masterpiece","review":"I've waited 5 years for another album, and finally the wish has been granted and it's been worth it. great escape from the plastic, cookie cutter dime a dozen music acts that infest the charts... i love this album. great mix of acoustic folk rock, head bobbing rock, and don't forget the piano songs. masterful. i think i might be about ready to cast my vote for best album of the year"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not about Indie revival nerd guy stuff...","review":"He doesn't really pack a punch with his music, he's sort of playing it safe. I mean, is there actually an underground Punk audience any longer? Who is this young gentleman trying to please? The music strikes me as guarded, as if Ben is leaving a lot to be desired for fear of saying the wrong thing...or maybe I'm just reading too much into this album. Wasted And Ready is just an awful tune, worthy of Weezer at their worst. Anyhow, hopefully he'll stop biting his influences on his next release..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sha Sha","review":"Wow, I love this album. I first heard Ben Kweller not too long ago in my sister's car. After hearing \\"Wasted and Ready\\", I had to listen to more of Ben Kweller. So I borrrowed the album, and I haven't stopped listening to it sinse. This music reminds me of Ben Folds crossed with Weezer (does anyone esle think he sounds like Rivers?) Anyway, I would recommend this album to anyone that enjoys good music. In my opinion, the best tracks are Wasted and Ready, In Other Words, and Falling. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best \\"new\\" artist.","review":"Ben Kweller is a genius. Who else can rhyme like it's cool anymore? Who has the splendid magical pop trippy hooks that is familiar to the Beatles? His name is Ben Kweller, and he is a master at his craft.BK is not a new artist, no no. He has been churning out records since he was about 13, and hasn't stopped. This is his first major-labeled debut, and what a debut it is. All of the songs are adorable and catchy, with a few heartwarming songs that can captivate the most stone-faced of listeners. \\"Lizzy\\", an ode to his wife (sigh...) is a gorgeous love song that can be played again and again. With the most charming accent, Ben with make you wish you knew about him long before he became famous. I know for a fact that \\"Sha Sha\\" will delight the young & old alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"The value of a good live show","review":"I saw BK open for Kings Of Leon a couple of days ago, at Rock City, here in Nottingham, England, and I thought he was excellent.

The main characters are still there: Mistress Shirer (the black dominatrix who runs the Institute) and JK her cross-dressing maid, but I missed some of the other chracters from the first book.Still, it rates very highly compared to most SM writing.

I'm also a big fan of more recent bands like Primus and QOTSA. If your tastes are ONLY in these types of music you may or may not love this album.

And if you enjoy the original Carmina Burana, this will be a pleasant experience.I really enjoy it because I like most of Carmina Burana versions, but also because it brings memories of my mother that used to play this particular version when I was a kid back in the 80's.

As far as the other accessories, I don't know because I can't seem to get past the hair. The head has quite of bit of hair that seems to be everywhere. I'm still finding it's hair around my daughters room.When I first started to comb the hear I was thinking I couldn't comb through it because they didn't use the best hair because of the styling head not being the caucasian version.

It looked sturdy and was made of steel, so I hoped it would not crack, as most other graters had. And I hoped it would remain sharp.

They will fall off in time. Hopefully not while you are boarding a boat. Both my handles have broken of from light carful use..2/ All the padding inside the case will drop off. It is just a matter of time.3/It is far too expensive for the piece of crap it is.4/Pelican cases are less expensive, tougher and waterproof.5/The low grade metal hinge WILL rust.You have spent far too much investing in a great lens.

Some of her poetry cannot help but resound with the complaint of an aged woman watching young men and remembering death, though the sound of her poems does say something else. They reveal her sheer talent, uncovering a music often missing from a good deal of contemporary poetry. Ms. Dove's true power, however, lies in her shorter poems which are tight concentrations of tied back emotion. They allow the reader to experience the fearful language with his or her own awareness that the subdued grace of sadness lies just a stroke away for each of us in our own lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grit","review":"Can you say \\"Chris Rea, The Road to Hell, 1989\\"?

But he then is magically transported to a wonderful land called Christmastown and is fascinated about it! He then convinces his fellow town to celebrate Christmas, and kidnap Santa Claus! But everything doesn't go according to plan.NIGHTMARE, like any animated movie, has great songs, and also has a spooky atmosphere with scary characters from Halloweentown, including the rag-doll Sally, who is vying for Jack's affections, and Oogie-Boogie, the tormented entity.This film is rated PG because it may scare some little kids with its adult humor, but they will eat it up anyway! This film is mostly recommended to people with an imagination!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the true 'classics' of all-time!!","review":"What else can be said of this wonderful movie, it is simply awesome.

If it were properly handled, an anamorphic transfer would blow the image to fill most of the screen except for small black vertical bars along the sides of the screen. If you play this back on a standard 4:3 television it won't matter - it will look just fine. Aside from that, the dvd has an excellent collection of materials. Luckily, I own the HUGE deluxe CAV LaserDisc boxed special edition and it looks like they managed to port all of it to dvd (except for the companion book by Frank Thompson).

Tim Burton outdid himself with the creation of these characters who reach out and touch the audiences souls much more than most movies starring live actors. Danny Elfman's soundtrack is by far the best movie score I've ever heard. His compositions flow perfectly with the the tone of the movie, and they help to tell the story even better, something only one other musical (South Park:Bigger, Longer, and Uncut) has ever been able to do.This movie is such a joy for Halloween, Christmas, or the year round.

The story line--Halloween creatures taking over the holiday of Christmas--has, from what I know, never been carried out before. Jack Skellington is the lead character who attempts to take over Christmas. The irony of this story is that the lead villian turns out to also be a hero. That, again, is a display of sheer brilliance and creativity. And it is true -- almost everyone in our modern era loathes musicals. I do too. But there is something quite masterful and creative about the way it is presented in this film.Although the movie is 10 years old, it will likely be quite timeless. There is nothing about the story that indicates the time period. The graphics are still of very high quality -- to the point that it is somewhat like \\"eye candy.\\" I was mesmorized by the graphics. Yes, me--an adult.-- Michael Gordon"},{"rating":"2","title":"Our new Holiday favorite","review":"Move over Rudolph & Santa Clause is Coming to Town. We Love Nightmare Before Christmas.

IT ROCKS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"spectacular movie","review":"This film is quite possibly on of the most creative movies ever. dazziling songs just add to the effect of this wonderful story. Danny Elfman is one of the most talented people around, not only did he do the voice of jack but he also did all of the music as well as some other minor roles in the film. Over all i will give this film ***** it deserved every one of them and will be a classic holiday movie for years to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome on vhs, dvd, laserdisc,","review":"if it's sitting in a giant theater with hundreds of people, or watching it on dvd with some friends. Just watching the model making skills along with the lyrics of danny elfman bring the story to life. This movie isnt for kids anymore even the movie reviewer has to look at this movie very closely.And since seeing it in theaters since i was a mere lad to the new 3d apperance, i have followed tim burton's idea for years. and if it's that good on dvd, vhs, laserdisc, 16mm, they i would be really awesome if it was on psp. plus your psp can double as a dvd player. so it's almost like buying the dvd if you have the right hookups and such. excellenct movie, and i would suggest buying cause i'm pretty sure it's outta print"},{"rating":"2","title":"Tim Burton's classic cult movie","review":"I finally found this movie to purchase on e-bay and have enjoyed watching it ever since.

Amazon still has the original Blu-Ray 2-Disc pack listed at $24, so paying 7 extra to include a 3D version is alright I guess. Especially in my case, I'm a bit ashamed to admit that I've NEVER watched this movie and it's only just recently that I've finally jumped on the HD bandwagon, so this movie's Blu-Ray re-release is pretty good timing."},{"rating":"2","title":"No offense, buddy... but this is an awesome movie.","review":"I recall a viewer from Edmond who thought this movie was \\"to\\" violent; it scared his/her little brother. This observation shows not only his/her lack of respect for cimena, but also his/her apparent inability to pay attention to simple grammar. Listen, man: I know that Edmond may be a sheltered Oklahoma town, but you've got to realize that your little brother is no film critic. If he's scared by it, so what? I don't mean to sound like a jerk, but what did you yourself think of the film? Eh? Why didn't you write something positive, like \\"Wonderful animation\\", before trashing it like it were \\"Best of the Best, part 2\\" or something? I loved the film. It inspired me. I like to think that I can never change who I am and that whatever happens to me is what happens. This film gave me respect for myself and my surroundings. I used to think poorly of Oklahoma.

Hate the case...I had to come back and say that I just saw this in the store in a regular size plastic dvd case that looks just like the one pictured... BUT the one I purchased a while back also looks like this in a picture but actually is the thick cardboard case that I hate so much. Mine is what I would call 3d --Jack's face is puffed out of the background with the square (acting like a window) being cut out of the front cover flap.Not sure what case it will come in if you buy here.But no matter what you'll enjoy the movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Nightmare before Christmas","review":"I loved it!

Many more extra's also such as an art gallery with over 400 stills, and of course the commentary which I never bother to listen to on any DVD. Now the movie itself is brillaint. The animation is superb and the plot is just amazing. My only complaint being that at many points the film is lacking and just moves so slow, hence the missing star.

All of you 90s kids, such as me, will really appreciate this movie's witty humor, classic word play, beautiful music. Danny Elfman did a very good job with the music in this movie. It was also the first full length movie of it's kind, I believe... Tim Burton utilizes Stop-Motion Animation, giving this classic it's own unique style.

I'm not going to describe it. I want you to experience this movie for yourself. I first saw \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\" in theaters during October of 1993. I began watching this movie knowing absolutely nothing about it. In fact, I made an effort not to learn anything about it. This was an advantage, because what I saw and heard was unlike anything I had ever seen before.The only thing I will say about this film is the music. It's by Danny Elfman--Tim Burton's film composer and the former lead singer of Oingo Boingo. I've been a Danny Elfman fan for years. He has done some fantastic songs and motion picture scores. For \\"The Nightmare Before Christmas\\" he also created and performed several songs. It was a real joy to hear Danny Elfman sing again.Trust me on this one. This film is a real treat for the eyes, and a visually imaginative piece of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible Film, So-so DVD","review":"Don't get me wrong, NMBC is one of the greatest films of all time. It is beautifully shot, wonderfully dark, and Danny Elfman's beautiful singing voice makes Jack come alive. My one complaint is with the DVD transfer. While they have included great extras like \\"vincent,\\" and the picture quality is wonderful, there is a sound defect. The Mayor's line, \\"Wait, we haven't given out the prizes yet,\\" is MISSING.

I do love the 'This is HALLOWEEN' song, and the revamped version done by Marilyn Manson. It's awesome that they combine HALLOWEEN and Christmas. In case you are new to the world of Tim Burton's depressing gothic/emo films, I'll give a brief synopsis; Jack Skellington is the King of HALLOWEEN Town, and he is getting tired of it. After the HALLOWEEN bash, he accidentally stumbles into Christmas Town and wants to bring it all back to his world. The creatures of HALLOWEEN Town begin to help Jack with his dream. Will Jack's dream go the way he plans? Can he save Santa Claus from Oogie Boogie.

Because of the negative comments posted to my original review, I decided to watch the movie again, on Showtime, in HD-Big screen. I thought that maybe I missed something. My opinion has not changed. I think it's an absolutely terrible movie, and I was a little too generous giving it a second star. By the way, in this class of movie, I like Coraline the best.Original review: I watched this via streaming. The detail was outstanding. The problem was that as much as I liked Corpse Bride, I disliked this movie. In Corpse Bride, the characters seemed genuine, and I really sympathized with the two brides. Loved the dog. In Nightmare, all the characters were shallow, not developed, and not lovable at all. Even the dog failed to give me any emotion. Totally bored throughout. Waited for it to get better, and it never did. Corpse Bride gave us a detestable evil character, and a surprise ending, Nightmare gave us neither."},{"rating":"2","title":"NEW NIGHTMARE BEFORE CHRISTMAS BETTER THAN THE 1ST!","review":"I absolutely LOVED this Nightmare Before Christmas Collector's Edition!

Also, for all the people who said Santa got 'tortured,' please define the word \\"torture.\\" When I think of torture, I think of bleeding and screaming and death, not rubbing a feather to someones foot. I hated the Batman movies. I loathed Edward Scissor-Hands. I abhored the Nightmare Before Christmas. If you have an ounce of intelligence in your brain, then use it to NOT buy-or watch-this movie.

It is not a tourist guide, but recommended for prospective visitors who want to understand the culture and politics of Ecuador, and understand it quickly. It is especially valuable for its summary of the destructive effects of the petroleum industry on the ecology and economy of the country, and for its its brief but accurate introduction to the country's powerful indigenous movement.

First, it has far fewer works than its competitor, the Penguin Guide 2000. Also, several features from earlier Gramophone guides have been dropped. There are no longer \\"alternative selections\\" -- just the 2 or 3 that the Gramophone editors prefer. So, if you want to know whether a certain recording is a well regarded one, you're out of luck unless its one of the 2 or 3 Gramophone lists. So, there's nothing to help you differentiate most excellent recordings from the rest (and there are far more than 2-3 excellent recordings of most classical music peices). Also, there are no \\"G\\" ratings. In previous editions, recordings would also be given 1, 2, or 3 \\"G\\"s in order to indicate the level of regard the authors held a good recording in. Finally, the \\"Gramophone 100\\" listings are gone.

I mentioned to a few people that I have been sick more in the past 6 months than I have been in the prior 3 years.

Since the water adjustment they have been good. I don't wake up with the headaches I used to wake up with. We both use CPAP machines and continue to struggle with the nose apparatus slipping when we turn over. But over all, I am mostly satisfied with the pillow purchase.

As far as my husband goes.... He filled the pillow up with more water than the max recommendation guide says. Then he added even more water. The point is, the pillow is not thick enough for him. He is only 6'2\\" and average shoulder width/build but his head is still angled down towards the back of the bed with this pillow. We didn't want to risk bursting the reservoir by adding more water.

The Americans with red hoods etc. Even with makeup Franco Nero looks a little young for the role. The movie has a great deal of plot holes and jumps some. The dub job was the worst I've seen in an Italian Western. I watched the movie in Italian with the subtitles, it was much more enjoyable. A good see once film but nothing to call great. I did think the ear cutting was original. The extra disc on DVD, \\"The Last Pistolero\\" was a slick little short."},{"rating":"1","title":"Heard it was one of the best","review":"I'd recently read on the EMPIRE film magazine web site that it rated Django as #2 in the best spaghetti westerns. I have to disagree with that. I wouldn't even have it in my top 20. The dubbing is outright awful, like they didn't even try to get some semblance of lip syncronization. The dialogue god-awful. Just listen to when Django is explaining to the prostitute who'd fallen in love with him why it wouldn't work. I think maybe George Lucas must have been in on the dialogue.There are some good scenes, however. The beginning where Django is on foot, pulling a coffin behind him was an image I'll long remember. Also when he guns down five bad guys in the saloon-very slick. All in all though, it just didn't work for me, and could only recommend it to someone interested in increasing their knowledge of the Italian western genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stylish But Vacant","review":"Just your run-of-the-mill spaghetti western also-ran, complete with a joltingly simple plot, one-dimensional characters and the worst dubbed dialog this side of Pulp Fiction's basic cable edit. Django himself, an opportunist without much in the way of personality, is only likable in direct comparison to the cookie-cutter roster of villainy he mercilessly cuts down at every opportunity. Even the scenery, which normally delivers a heaping portion of a western's aura and mystique, falls flat in Django. Here the wide-open promise of a broad, sweeping landscape is reduced to dreary patch of mud, a fistful of thin, trail-weary horses and four pathetic, lifeless wooden shacks. If a steady diet of ricocheting bullets, heavy drinking and utterly pointless double-crossery is what you're hungry for, by all means chow down - this is ninety solid minutes of just that with little variation. Those with an appetite for more filling material, on the other hand, should just keep on walking."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good movie","review":"i am more of an horror movie fan then western but since i love italian horror movies so much i taught it would be fair to give this movie a chance (+ im a big big fan of sergio leone movies) and i was not disapoited . alot of action, gun fight, bar fight etc . nice sets and Franco Nero is very good. you wont beleave wath is in the coffin......i highly recommend this movie to any western spaghetti fan, you wont regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I expected","review":"no really a good old western but then againClint Eastwood ruined it for everybody elsecheck it out I thought naw"},{"rating":"2","title":"This rocks: Amazon @ $2.99","review":"A seminal film, haunting hero, scorching damsel, despicable villians, scenery to die for.

The story takes a back seat to all the cruel, unusual and gratuitous violence. I don't mind violent movies but I'd at least like to have an interesting story to go with them. I kept trying to like this show. After reading reviews what I imagined sure had the real thing beat. I mean c'mon, a guy who drags a coffin around through the desert to some God forsaken mud hole of a town, just to waste about 300 or 400 guys who go up against him? Why it all matters I don't know.

I had contemplated buying the Anchor Bay DVD, and upon viewing, I'm so glad I didn't. Franco Nero is absolutely dreadful -- i'm not sure if he or the dubbing is to blame but the delivery and dialogue are some of the worst I've ever witnessed. The character is such a goody goody with lines like, \\"You shouldn't treat women like that\\" and \\"That's not right.\\" To compare this to Leone is to reduce Leone's interesting characters and cinematography into cardboard gunfights.

I would have liked to see more on creating forms (what the author calls \\"user forms\\" - what we think of as VB forms) but at least there is some information.

Later works found them cranking up the Marshalls and getting a bit more shouty.Destination Universe is a rarity in this evolution: plenty of rawk but plenty of hooks, harmony-laced choruses and memorable lyrics. It's less quirky than International Pop Overthrow and less bombastic than Freak City Soundtrack. Jim Ellison seems to be relatively free of the demons that would later lead him to take his own life.It's a shame that this is currently out of print, but if you can find a copy it's the best place to start with MI and one of the best power pop albums you'll hear from any band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective Product","review":"I have previously bought a lot of these shirts.

Me, My Baby & My Cadillac plus it's prelude were on the Got Purp! 2 album, and I Can't Wait was from Barbershop II. I have also known about Margaritas since a Rock the Vote Mixtape from '04. So that's where my 4 stars comes in. It seems as if this album was pieced together and not created.Buy this album anyway and support good music!4 Stars!Personal Favorites:1.

As such, it is an excellent study of the subject. I am reading it a second time, and this time around I am more aware that one area is dark: the complicity of corporations in the Holocaust. She does, however, discuss the failure of churches and NGOs to aid the Jews in their time of need, which amounts to a gross complicity. Corporations in the US and elsewhere were making Holorinth machine cards,selling the Germans autos, trucks, etc. But given the area of focus the author sets out in the beginning, it is an excellent study of its kind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Immediate Results","review":"I read the hit or miss reviews on this product and decided to give it a try, especially on the advice from a SoCal person (I'm in NorCal) who said it works great for meat bees.

I put it up about 10 minutes ago and several are already trapped. It's amazing how quickly it worked, it started with the few that were around and then all the sudden there's a ton of them and most of them are going into the trap.It seems like it is hit or miss but with me it was a hit!

I went out every day since then to see if these disposable traps were doing their job & catching any of the nasty hornets that were taking over my property. After 2 weeks of being setup, only one hornet was caught & trapped in one these worthless traps.I would not recommend the (Rescue Yellow Jacket Control Trap) for trapping & getting rid of hornets because apparently the hornets are not attracted or interested in this kind of trap for some reason.

It was so effective that we stopped seeing yellow jackets in our yard. We used them successfully for two years in a row.The next year we ordered them online, and never had good result. We had a huge nest by one of our windows. We placed one of the traps far away (about 25-30 yards) and one very close to the nest (about 2 feet away), and the most we trapped were fruit flies.The design is great, and it is very practical to toss the whole thing, wasps and all, instead of trying to wash them (like some of the other models), but if the attractant doesn't work, wasps will never get in the trap, defeating the whole purpose.Please bring back the old attractant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for us","review":"We hung the trap 2 feet away from a large wasps nest.

That's life. But to use the same old vinyl rip that Spalax released and not even a fresh one after all these years? On top of that, I cannot hear a thing that is different about this version.

This author draws on remarkable and broad fluency with text--from Shakespeare and Sartre to Harold Bloom, the Bible itself from Genesis to Chronicles, and rabbinic literature from the Tanhuma to Rashi to R. David Hutner. What pervades this textual fluency is a marvelous attention to language, to the words with which worlds are created.This book is no easy read. I recommend reading each chapter twice and highlighting or underlining, writing notes in the margins and discussing passages with a partner as you go. Active reading is required, but isn't that just what \\"midrash,\\" literally to \\"search\\" for the meanings of a text, is all about?This is a study of the book of Genesis but it is also a study of rabbinic midrashic exploration of the book of Genesis.

I couldn't finish the book after starting to read it and being caught up in the unrealistic and down right hokey situations. In the first chapter there is enough cursing to please the crustiest sailor. There are editorial mistakes, grammar and comma errors which anyone with a basic understanding of the english language will find annoying.

There is a briefly entertaining cameo by Will Smith, but it is over all too quickly. The finale, where father and daughter do a duet from the musical 'Sweeney Todd' at the school pageant, causing the headmistress to faint with shock, raises a faint smile, though one couldn't help wondering, where was she when rehearsals were going on?

It's a great story, with witty dialogue by the Master of dialogue, a teriffic script.

But it was just so awful, trust me - skip on this one, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Insult to All","review":"This movie was equally demeaning to the actors and the audience. Start with Working Girl, substitute New jersey for Staten Island, then take away the plot, the character development and just about everything else and you're left with the big hair and a plotless love story. Jamie Gertz has had much better material to work with and Dylan McDermott's primary mode of expression in this role is a lazy smile. Give the actor some dialogue! The ending was so contrived that there's no reward for sticking with this movie to the end. You know how it will turn out just from reading the marquis."},{"rating":"1","title":"The story was awsome the acting was not","review":"This movie had the what it took to be a big block buster I believe. The story is beautiful and i was amazed. The acting how ever did not hold up to the story. I think it is a shame they didn't pick people who could make this movie big. There are parts that you know if they had the right actor would have been halarious. But they were not because of the actors. I have nothing against ben or liv it was just not their movie. I have seen others with them and have enjoyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crazy girl is more like it!","review":"An obnoxious attempt to make a screwball comedy: a deranged girl plots to get a guy by literally running into him. She decides on the spot he's the one for her, based solely on superficial appearances, and then she begins stalking him! That she succeeds in getting this guy is something that could only happen in a movie as dopey as this.Jami Gertz's performance was one long screech while Dylan McDermott's was based solely on his ability to smile and look good. This was no Cinderella story; this is why they have restraining orders!Not a keeper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet, funny, and heartwarming","review":"I almost didn't go to this movie because of the negative reviews, but I'm really glad I did. I went with two friends, and we're all fairly picky viewers, but we all loved it. It was sweet and funny, and I was sorry to see it end.

Despite many of the critics disliking it, I loved it! I'm not normally the biggest Ben Affleck fan, but he was great. I always knew Kevin Smith could make me laugh, but I didn't know he could make me cry. This was a great movie. The dialogue smacked of Smith's unique style. I don't hesitate to recommend this movie to anyone. I look forward to seeing it again and can't wait for the DVD!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Heartwarmer","review":"This was one of the best movies my wife and I have seen for awhile. The casting director did an excellent job matching actors to their parts. Ben Affleck did a credible job as Ollie Trinke, a single father, after the death of his wife. Liv Taylor, who did a wonderful portrayal of the beautiful Arwen in \\"The Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy, successfully pulled of the impish Maya injected into the Trinke family. But the two actors who stole the show were George Carlin in his best part ever as Bert Trinke, the down to earth Ollie's father, and Raquel Castro as Ollie's beautiful daughter. She seemed a perfect match as a child who could have been conceived by the actors chosen as her parents. The movie could have been a family movie but there was too much profanity which my wife and I found distracting from the otherwise heart of the movie. For this I am giving it four stars instead of the five the story itself would have earned. This review is based on a rental DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALL THE WAY WITH LIV","review":"This was one of the movies that originated from the first Bennifer relationship. Its not as terrible as Gigli because of the lovely Liv Tyler turns in a wonderful performance as Maya. Thank God Lopez's character Gertrude dies in the begining of the movie so we don't have to we bored with her for long. George Carlin is wonderful as Bart, and Raquel Castro is such a sweetheart as little Gertie. The chemistry between Affleck & Tyler is wonderful. The only reason I don't think this deserves 5 stars is because Lopez can't act and the director could've cast somebody better. Its only because she was engaged to Ben at the the time that she got the part."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely beautiful!!!!!!","review":"It was totally fantastic. The dialogue was classic Kevin Smith. He has a unique style, and it shines through right from the beginning. (\\"They're all just coked-up whores!\\") Then the acting was absolutely INCREDIBLE. George Carlin, Liv Tyler, and Racquel Castro could not have possibly been any better. Then top it off with a nicely picked soundtrack (maybe not QUITE a Tarantino movie soundtrack, but hey, what is?), and it just makes for a really well done, really enjoyable movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful,wacky and romantic.","review":"This movie is the best generic movie I have ever seen in my life!A love story about a sweet and beautiful loud mouth from New Jersey.The beautiful and tacky young woman purposely seeks a rich man with class and style from New York.

I don't own the followup, but if this is any indication, E's solo work previous to the eels had that same characteristic smart bitter, funny and sad all at once songwriting style to it, but with much more of a one dimensional singer-songwriter kind of feel to it that occasionally spoiled the proceedings by making things sound too samey. Aside from the cute instrumental \\"symphony for toy piano...\\", on every song he's backed up by an acoustic guitar, a keyboard, and a percussion track that may or may not be a drum machine, all of which sound like they're produced and mixed the same way in every song. It's probably not a coincidence that one of the key reasons E formed the eels was to get more of a full sound. Still, the songwriting is very strong as evidenced by tracks like \\"hello cruel world\\", \\"mockingbird franklin\\", and especially \\"you'll be the scarecrow\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this really the same E I'm thinking about?","review":"Being a big Eels fan, I was quite excited to finally find A Man Called E today.

Then he threw in Symphony For Toy Piano In G Minor, and I thought \\"That's more like it.\\" Then there were about 5 more useless tunes, and it's done. I'm sorry, but A Man Called E just can't compete with the originality of Beautiful Freak, and the beauty of Electro-Shock Blues (which can only be described as a masterpiece).

Somehow, all of the various tracks blend into a seamless album that transports you to another world.I don't speak a word of Yiddish, but I don't need to. Some of the tracks are instrumentals, some are in English, and all of the Yiddish lyrics are translated in the beautiful liner notes. (They also include a really great essay that provides a quick, entertaining history of Yiddish radio.)I'd recommend this album to everyone: for music lovers it's a joy; for aficionados of radio history it's a treasure trove; and for ANYONE interested in American Jewish culture it's a must.

It's nice and deep, and has a range of tones depending on where you strike it with your fingers and the way in which you strike it. It seems to sustain a good bit of pressure, so there's no fear of breaking the skin accidentally.I put a string through the provided holes, so now I can play it while standing up as well, hanging the drum from around my neck, and the sound is even better this way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely fabulous!","review":"This is the best price I found on a drum like this.

We used a camcorder that their parents owned, and used their back yard as our set. Ketchup was blood. Ikari is several orders of magnitude better than what we produced. That does not mean that this is a good film, however. The narrative is not bad. The rest is. I am a fan of anime, and in the context of anime, this doesn't measure up, despite the creators' best intentions. I feel like I could have done something better with the eighty or so minutes I spent watching. Sorry, I had high hopes. Fans of anime looking for a live action approach should try the subtitled version of Kung Fu Hustle. Yes, it's produced by a big studio with a lot of money, not a noble indie film maker.

The back cover promises Afro-centric electro grooves - and it's quite accurate. The tracks don't stray far from their African roots, which results in some fascinating combinations. The Son of Scientist, for instance, invite Eska to provide vocals to the dubbed out \\"The Drum,\\" while the Cinematic Orchestra makes \\"Brotherhood\\" a piano- and rhythm-driven track, which gets progressively frenzied. Several artists here -- Boozoo Bajou and Jeff Sharel, for instance -- are known for their adaptation of African music so it comes as no surprise that they contribute tracks. But there are a few surprises: the Troublemakers doing a dark and jazzy soundscape, or Kirk Degiorgio's Off-World Ensemble doing tech-funk.

At first, I was amazed at how many flies it caught and I thought this was a great product. However, after two weeks of using it, my small fly problem became a BIG fly problem. It seemed like every fly in the neighborhood (including giant flies that I've never seen in my backyard before) came to the fly party in my backyard.

This 'rescue' one is re-usable if you do not get it filled with flies. just keep filling it with water. Dont let it dry out.I use the stinkiest powder for my reusables. I also put a dead fish head in my reusables.Word of CAUTION ! do not cut OUTSIDE the line that rescue says to cut- in the top of the plastic bag. Also Do not hang these anywhere you intend to spend a lot of time. I hang mine in trees near the kennel.Dogs love this product and will tear it down, roll in it and eat the flies.

Hang then about 20 feet or so down wind and away from porch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great, smells terrible","review":"I live near a dairy farm, so flies are abundant in my back yard. This trap is amazing. It attracts and traps countless flies. Read and follow the instructions, cut carefully, extend cylinder, fill with water, and hang. You will be amazed and very likely disgusted at how many flies it will catch.Due to the horrible smell, I like to hang this trap away from seating areas and out of direct traffic. Do not hang it near windows. Flies seem to love the stench, but if you have anyone visiting, I recommend moving it to a distant location. I temporarily tie it to the dumpster on the other side of the yard if we have guests; keeps from having to toss it when it is still useful.Be very careful when you dispose of this.

Even without the fanbase this album would of sold because the quality of the songs are top class.

This album is worth having as it reminds you why you liked Ash in the first place"},{"rating":"2","title":"wow...a surprise","review":"I bought this CD for a very low price (noting that it ALSO included a free DVD of the band). I knew the band was British and I am a huge fan of Travis (and a number of other current British groups, on a lesser level). I figured I'd get a few listens out of it, maybe enjoy it a bit.What an enjoyable CD. Lots of different types of songs on here...some are almost FOLKY, while others are pop-punk type rave-ups, while some are earnest, string-laden ballads. The songs are almost all very catchy and they really grow on you. Some of it is kind of adolescent, but isn't that the point?Some major influences I heard in the music included the Beach Boys, Smashing Pumpkins (very much), the Ramones, Iggy Pop...it's an interesting blend of different styles, but again, the songs remain the main point. They're all catchy, well-written, and worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ear-to-ear-grin-inducing bouncy-surfy-punky-pop blast!","review":"I've been dying for this album to come out. Having heard the track \\"Shining Light\\" and loving it I wanted to get the whole album but didn't want to take the plunge on an import version. (Glad I waited in terms of the bonus DVD and extra track). THis whole album is superb: a huge, fizzy-pop, sonic-thrill-ride. Really superb songs, energy, texture and musicianship. If Burn Baby Burn becomes the massive single in the US that it should maybe it will herald in a new era of fun, relevant music and give the whole scene a kick-up-the-arse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Burn Baby Burn!","review":"On their third studio album, the irish pop rock act Ash find their own voice. Soft and sweet melodies can be found on the songs \\"shining light\\", \\"candy\\" and \\"someday\\" while the energy lies over their smash hit \\"burn baby burn\\" , \\"cherry bomb\\" follows with playful guitars and stories about the teen years. Their most powerful set to date \\"Free All Angels\\" may not find big audiences or radio play in the US, but watch out, it may take a while for your average rock fan to take them seriously. They topped european and asian charts with this album a year ago, and the DVD included in the Limited Ed. demonstrates just that.

The mixing software included on the Cd is also a nice treat!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't even bother","review":"I have an older Saab and decided to get a repair manual for it. This one was a major dissapointment. All electrical and vacuum diagrams are left out. Their reasoning for this is that there is too much to list. However, Chilton incorporates this information into their books on newer cars (such as the Chevy Lumina) that are far more complicated. Some of the pictures are also very vague. I found myself guessing at some of the torque specs, since I have a 16-valve engine and this is written mainly for the 8-valve. This book also tends to over-complicate some items, while over-simplifying others. I don't recommend this book unless all you want to do is change your oil and spark plugs. Anything more complicated, and you're better off going with the Bentley manual (if you can find one) or the offical Saab manual."},{"rating":"2","title":"I swear by these!","review":"I'm a 28 year old woman and probably go through as many Wet Ones as my friends with kids.

When Zelazny returned to writing Amber stories based on Merlin I had high hopes, but with each new book I found that the magic was slipping further and further away.In this final book it feels like Zelazny had written himself into a corner and just wanted to end it. There is no true conclusion here, only dangling plots that we will never see resolved.For the Amber completist, get it from the library and slog through it. Otherwise stick to the first five books of Corwin for that is where the true magic is held.

Brogden also covers EJBs and shows you how to create your own custom JSP tag library. Overall, a high quality, objective book on building web apps with Java, that is not biased toward a particular tool or server. The Appendix serves as a nice reference to the core classes in the JSP and Servlet API. This is the 2nd java book by Brogden that I highly recommend. The other is Java 2 Exam Prep."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book for the number of pages","review":"I was lucky enough to have the opportunity to read this book. Overall the book succeeded in explaining the main concepts relating to JSP and Servlets. There was also a relatively good discussion of related topics such as XML, JNDI, LDAP and JDBC. The example were OK but could have gone into more depth. Given the number of pages in this book I dont think you can expect to have as much coverage and examples are books with twice as many pages, nor can you expect for it to cover every topic even remotely related to Servlets and JSP. Although I havent read other books my associates also spoke well of CORE JSP and Web Development with Java Servlet PagesWorking knowledge in XML, HTML and JAVA definitely increased my ability to pick up the topics quite easily.

It catches the eye of a TV executive, who thinks it will tie in perfectly with a prospective sponsor, \\"Noah's Arcade\\". Wayne and Garth, who are a bit strapped for cash, jump at the contract, but soon discover that it is full of compromises. Will Wayne and Garth sell out? Will Wayne be able to escape his deluded ex?

Wayne's World is truly a comic masterpiece. Sure some of the comedy is dumb, but that's what makes it great.

Unplayable at release.","review":"I could only give this game 1 star as I've still not been able to play it for more than 10 minutes without it locking up, crashing, losing sound or mouse controls. After owning it for a month, I have yet to finish and scenario or skirmish because it's simply unplayable as it is right now. If you read the Microsoft AoE3 forums, you can get more information. The game was poorly tested and nearly everyone is having issues. A patch is expected sometime (no word for ES on when though) so I would strongly suggest waiting to purchase this game to save yourself frustration and disappointment. It does look promising, as long as they can fix all the bugs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it!!!","review":"This game is still full of bugs and is totally unplayable. Check the forum at (agecommunity.com) and see for yourself how many people are having problems with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit of a disappointing bore...","review":"While this novel was well written, I still often found myself bored silly reading it.The tale of Tarzan, Lord Greystroke, was wonderfully told and concluded within the first two novels (\\"Tarzan of the Apes\\" and \\"The Return of Tarzan\\")...but in all honesty, I really felt it should have ended there. A third novel (and I'm sure the 20 or so sequels that followed this one) was not needed at all.As mentioned in the title, I found this third novel really disappointing. I stopped reading it a couple of times because I found it so tedious and dull (which was never the case with the first two novels), and was glad it was over when I finally finished it!Honestly, the only good part about it was seeing Tarzan's determination to save his family, and the long over-due conclusion to a particular character. Other than that...I really felt it was a waste of my time.Which is a shame, because Mr. Rice Burroughs is quite a fine writer, and the first two books were fantastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read","review":"This is as addictive as previous Tarzan's stories.

I am sure the book would deserve 5 stars if I could read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written- Very Confusing.","review":"Not only this book is poorly written but in fact its also written in a very confusing manner. Dr. Kreinin does not provide us with adequate examples for the topic he discusses and furthermore there is not glossary in the textbook, which is crucial for the students to get some quick facts without memorizing the entire terminology used in the book. I was surprised to find this book as part of the required readings for classes at Michigan State University and Northern Michigan University. I recommend that this bok may not be used as part of the curriculum for the students. It is not helpful and its over-priced relative to its limited use."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better places to spend your money.","review":"The author claims to be MCSD. I don't believe that. No way you could pass 70-016 using this book. They tried to cover every aspect of the test, but there is virtually no in-depth coverage whatsoever.The other book for exam 70-015 has practically the same content. Very little new stuff.Too many times the author does not know what he is talking about. There are numerious errors, typos excluded! For example, event sink maps are called sync maps, for God's sake.It is definitely not worthy the money. I will never buy another book from this author or this publisher. They quickly throw in a book just trying to take advantage of the situation. I don't believe they have the customer in mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"I read the book and passed the test - NOT related events!","review":"While the book does a good job of cleaning up the extraneous test details (contents of different VC++ editions, formal titles of the debugging stages) it is useless for core competenices (COM and Active X). Here are a couple of my favorites:\\"Source code is the programming code you write that makes your program actually do things\\". A review bullet ... on page 95!35 pages about SourceSafe, MS's source code control tool. 1 paragrpaph about how to use sockets (I guess networks are just a fad).With assorted extraneous errors ('CHttpInternetConnection is the base class for internet connections') and code samples that don't work (pretty much everything from Chapter 7 \\"Creating a COM component\\") this book will certainly keep you on your feet.BOTTOM LINE - Don't depend on this book! I learned A LOT more from 'teach yourself VC++ in 21 days'. This book is nice if you have a lot of extra time to learn trivial VC++ details."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent Exam Prep.","review":"This is actually a farily good exam prep- there are a few errors, bu they seem to be identified well on the publishers website.

The study itself is complete in that the Bible section needed to complete each lesson is reprinted in this book itself.

However I do have the bonus disk. Being a newcomer to Rouse, I wasn't quite sure what to expect. This is in two words, \\"laid back\\". Something you would put on while driving along on a summer day with sandy beaches on one side and your hot girlfriend sleeping in the passenger seat next to you. This is the type of feeling Rouse's album evokes, and his ability to craft well-written tunes in the vein of talented singer/songwriter's like Paul Simon, Cat Stevens, etc is top notch.

However, these pods do not really fit right. Consequently, sometimes you get a full cup that is mostly water -- then you might get half a cup. There is NO consistency in how much coffee will actually come out -- or how strong/weak the coffee will be. I can't tell if it's manufacturing irregularities or whether the pods are just poorly designed. In any event, only about one in five pods actually produces a drinkable full cup of coffee. I emailed Aloha Island Coffee Company with my concerns and asking for advice, but have not yet received an answer after two weeks.I'm going back the the Douwe Egberts pods -- at least they are consistent and A LOT less expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Messed up my senseo","review":"I have to agree with the guy who complained about consistency. I have wasted two very expensive pods so far. The first time I used a Kona pod the machine jammed and I could not open it for 24 hours,(caused a steam lock), about 5 tablespoons of undrinkable crap came out of my senseo. The next time I tried a Kona pod I got a quarter amount of what should have been a two cup try. I am not very impressed so far.

Jenny has never looked worse as an actress. To even call her an \\"actress\\" does a disservice to the word. I am not exaggerating when I say that a High School Drama Club making an unscripted home movie with their videocamera would've made a better movie than this one. Jenny and her husband (the director) should never be allowed to appear on film again.

I do like Jenny McCarthy; I think she is a very good slapstick actress (read: Lucille Ball). Why does toilet humor have to dominate the scripts these days? The dumbing down of America? Probably so. The actress who played her roomate was sort of good in that Jayne Mansfield/Carol Wayne kind of character. Carmen Electra --- stick to posing in nudie magazines and helping to open new supermarkets. This movie is one of the worst ever. Not as awful as \\"Soul Plane,\\" but close."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the Worst Movies Ever!","review":"The only reason I watched this movie all the way through is because I got it on pay-per-view, and I wanted to get at least *something* for my money.

The movie sucked from the begging to the end, Jenny McCarthy was annoying and Carmen was acting like typical ghetto hispanic women which I didn't like to much, but still gotta give her credit cause she was good at it. Atleast Eddie Kaye (Amercian Pie) lucky son of a gun got payed to do this crappy movie and got to make out with Jenny. One Lucky dude that's all I got to say.

If this resonates with you then you will love this.I really have a whole new respect for Jenny now and not just because she is hot.

She proceeds to have a very public but not very funny nervous breakdown. She enlists the aid of some friends, headed up by Carmen Electra in a borderline offensive role, and Eddie Kaye Thomas of American Pie fame, who is very good in spite of his surroundings. He pines for Rebecca, but she only sees him as a friend. How original.The fact that the plot is very thin would be forgivable if there were some good laughs. I couldn't even muster a chuckle.

Furthermore, her acting is over the top. It is difficult to empathize with her character, who comes across as shallow and completely self-involved. Carmen Elektra is atrocious in her part.

Its best to watch this movie when you are somewhat inebriated in order to enjoy the humor. I was stone sober and got 1 or 2 laughs out of it.

The DVD commentary also includes some other storiesthat are also pretty funny and explain some of the pitfalls of an underfundedmovie, which explains some of the end product here, I would think.Of course, I had seen the Ebert&Roeper; review of this movie beforehandso I was not expecting much.

She meets a number of odd characters, such as the odd neighbor; her \\"friend\\"'s cousin, who is a world-famous artist with a dark secret; a New Zealander who is an archeologist; and a strange invalid \\"child\\". The heroine is taken under the artist's wing, and bad stuff starts to happen. Is someone out to get her?

I really like the red dot that tells you when the pan is adequately preheated. Cooking with gas is new to me and the red dot helps with that.The sizes are good, but I did add a jumbo 5 quart pan for cooking chili and stovetop meals.The lids are great as the glass lets you see what's going on with the food as it cooks. They have deep edges so you can't accidentally knock them off. Especially helpful is the small and large holes in the lid edges to let out some steam or drain off water. The pots have a pour spout too.I wish the pans had lids also, but I bought one of those univeral lids that will work with several pan sizes.The whole set works well, having the non-stick finish that I wanted and having a good heft when you pick them up. These aren't likely to warp. They look good too with their blue exterior."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE these pans!","review":"I really love these pans! I received mine for a wedding gift 14 years ago and unfortunately, just tossed the last one. They're not made to last forever, but they cook so very well, very evenly, and I even have the high-end \\"chef\\" named pans and they don't even compare to these! The only hint I can pass on regarding these pans is don't ever put them in the dishwasher. Even though they say you can, it only makes the teflon come off sooner and you'll have to toss them like I did. I about cried when I finally had to toss the dutch oven. Used that thing for EVERYTHING! I've been lost without it and I'm on here now looking for it's replacement. Plus, my other family members have this set and are still using it after 17 years!

I listened to this CD four times and I swear not one song sticks in my mind. Wait, I lied. \\"Don't You Never Leave Me\\" is good. Yes, you read that correctly.

Five years have passed, and it's coming to DVD in the next couple weeks!

When she sees classes at the local community college which capture her fancy, she decides to set out on a journey to better her life. This also involves discovering a sexual attraction to her best friend (Courtney Love, great actress and musician extraordinaire!).The film features the late Spalding Gray as her teacher, and THE OC's Mischa Barton (don't remember her from 5 years ago!). It's a heartwarming, uplifting and emotionally charged tale of following ones dreams in the face of adversity and judgement. This is a brilliant film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring film.","review":"If you are looking for a good lesbian movie then do not pick this one. The movie covers a woman who wants to leave her husband to pursue a career in computers. Her best friend is Courtney love and she too leaves her husband.

OF course one should read up on the major problems the British and French had in getting to the Crimea. All the actors did a great Job. The arrogance of the true Characters who were in the Crimea and in the War were portrayed with great accuracy by the actors. Couldn't have picked a better bunch of actors to bring this disaster to the screen. I recommend this movie to help understand what happen in the Crimean War.

Chaaaaaaaaaaarge!!!","review":"A prideful vendetta between bullying English Lord Cardigan and a talented but hot-tempered junior officer is set against the disasterous British rout at the hands of Russia during the Crimean War. I can't speak to the supposed historical innaccuracies of this Tony Richardson film, since most of what I know about the infamous Charge I've learned from either Tennyson's rah-rah romantic poem, or Douglas Frasier's sardonic Flashman novels (with which it shares a certain mordant, antiauthoritarian darkness), but I did find it pretty entertaining and well-produced. It's also quite similar to Peter Wier's \\"Gallipoli,\\" although this is more bluntly class-conscious and hysterical in tone. Richard William's animated sequences, used in the titles and interludes, are wry spinoffs of Gilded Age cartoons, and prefigure Terry Gilliam's animation in the \\"Monty Python\\" series. The closing battle is a bit muddled, but the drama of the first half is engaging."},{"rating":"2","title":"MOST REALISTIC WAR FILM I'VE EVER SEEN","review":"First of all let's say that this is the most realistic war film I have ever seen. The sets and costumes are simply marvelous. One cannot but believe we are viewing a cinema verite of the Crimean War and not a commercial film production. Who cares about the story? Just look at the cavalrymen in their tight red pants and blue blouses with four vertical rows of buttons and the red caps with the chin straps. Think of the research that went into giving us such magificent period detail. Yes, there is Trevor Howard, John Gielgud, David Hemmings and Vanessa Redgrave all fine actors who who give excellent performances off a good script but the real star of this film is the stunning camerawork by David Watkin (Chariots of Fire) and the person(s) in charge of the costumes and sets.

Gives us a taste of the arrogance of some fighting forces and the frailty of life among cavalry men."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blurriest Movie Ever. For Shame, Amazon.","review":"This movie is worth seeing if you are a fan of long movies about military history (don't bother if you aren't) but you won't see a thing on Amazon's version, which is sufficiently blurry so as to be unwatchable. I strongly advise renting the HD version on iTunes instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad cinema","review":"This version (1968) of The Charge of the Light Brigade, is perhaps one of the worst movies it has been my misfortune to watch. The cinematography is bad, the plot line is non-existent, the acting is poor to awful. It doesn't even deserve one star, but that's the least I can give it. If you plan to buy The Charge of the Light Brigade, buy the original 1936 version with Errol Flynn.It starts off slow and terrible and quickly goes downhill. This is one dvd that was a complete waste of money. I don't say that about very many movies, as I can usually find something redeeming about most movies. This is one that has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. I've never written a review before, but this movie was so bad, I felt I had to warn people off so they didn't waste their money, as I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Fake One's Better","review":"I was surely looking forward to another version of this film.

With a film like this, you anxiously wait for the climax which is of course the charge of all those British into the history books. Save your money and your time. The charge in this version is the biggest dud since Madonna's film career. You sit there and ask yourself what everyone got so excited about. At least in the version with Errol Flynn you had some semblance of men blindly (if herocally and stupidly) charging to their deaths. You don't even see much here though. The charge itself is a dull cantor with awful editing and by the time its over all you feel is a great let-down. There's no grand sweep which we expect in films like this and nothing that even comes close to the historic feel the poem about the 600 inspires. Buy the Flynn movie. It may not be history but it's awfully exciting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"This is one of the stupidest \\"war\\" movies ever made. Cheesy character acting, unnecessary side plots that make up 80% of the movie. They finally get to the Crimea about the last 30 minutes of the movie and show about 20% of the actual events during that battle in which the Turks fought well but the British floundered. Watch the history channel special on this event and save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"History meets Monty Python","review":"War is a serious business, but not to the makers of this film who every so often inserted an animation sequence most certainly inspired by those done by Monty Python. Except this is not a comedy. Made in 1968 the anti Vietnam war influence is also in evidence.

Fortunately, Amazon was able to get us a copy in time so we were still able to enjoy our yearly reading. This book is a fun read for the whole family. The kids will love the rhyming & pictures.

The only reason I gave it 4 stars was because it is not the best movie I have ever seen. But when I go away with a great feeling after a movie it gets pretty close!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FAMILY REUNION","review":"Although diabetics should approach this film cautiously, one can't help but be enamored with this family film focusing on two youngsters who want their divorced parents to reunite for Christmas. There are no real surprises here and the ending is unavoidable, and there is even a schmaltzy ballad by Stephen Bishop. BUT ALL I WANT FOR CHRISTMAS is entertaining and the relationship between the brother and sister is refreshingly real and touching. Ethan Randall (soon to be Ethan Embry) and Thora Birch are delightful as the kids, and Harley Jane Kozak and Jamey Sheridan gamely flesh out the stereotypical parents. Lauren Bacall is added for class value and an uncredited Leslie Nielsen appears as a jolly Macy's Santa. It's sweet and sentimental but still a Christmas movie the whole family should enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feel-good, quality, family entertainment.","review":"Granted, it's not Oscar material, it ain't gonna win a Golden Globe Award.

I had never seen it before, but judging from the reviews I guess I expected more. I can think of so many holiday movies with more interesting storylines and more appealing characters. I can see that it would be appealing to preteens. I guess I've grown tired of scheming kids in movies and though I had no sympathy for the mother's boyfriend, I was not really entertained by their plot that hijacked him in an ice cream truck and had his car towed away. I love a great holiday comedy, but when I think of the really great ones, I can't say that this one comes close. I would have given it 2 1/2 stars if I could, because I like Lauren Bacall.I just watched it again this week to see if it was any better than I thought it was last year.

It is said that Malcolm X was given a copy of this book and it had a great effect on him brining him towards Sunni Islam.It should be pointed out that the author was an Arab nationalist and so there are without doubt points in the book which are not shall we say, orthodox.

I looked at the star ranking, but didn't read the reviews. I should have, because it would have helped me much better after reading the reviews. I am somewhat savy, but I was disappointed by this book because it didn't talk to me on a level of what type of product (or brands) would be best for me depending on my budget. For example, besides price, what makes the difference in components I pick? Is it speed? Will they work better? Some products that I buy might not work better if I buy the wrong companion component... this book didn't tell me that.His writing leaves much to be desired. I should have never strayed from Upgrading and Repairing PC's by Scott Mueller.

The story is told with low expressed emotion built on the premise that still waters run deep and what is felt does not always have to be communicated.There are several plot lines in this book. A family deals with loss after their son dies in a tragic accident. Years later, their oldest child gets ready to leave for college and these wounds open again. Meanwhile, a truly gross holier-than-thou nymphomaniac professor enters their lives and 'adopts' them. The mother for some reason is unable to set limits or boundaries with this woman. The woman soon drags the son into a preposterous affair. Superimposed on this is dad's attempt to make peace with the young man responsible for their son's death.It all doesn't quite work but it was thought-provoking, very tender at times, and definitely worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible product","review":"i bought this for my home.

It smells when filling the trap and smells when emptying it. As days pass, the smell gets stronger. This is what attracts the flies, the smell. This won't be something you would want to use indoors.

After a month it was looking pretty full and it stunk to heck and back. So, time to empty it. (I'm retching just thinking about the words to write here) I unscrewed the base and left the lid attached to the wire I had hung it on - expecting to take it over to my compost pile and empty it. I couldn't walk more than two steps with it without having to dump it right away and get as far away from that horrifying scene as soon as possible, in an effort to preserve my sanity. Vile. So very very unimaginable. It was crawling with tiny maggots and the quantity of dead flies in the liquid had become the most repulsive substance ever imaginable. I have a black mark on my soul from having lived through this experience.

After a week in my apartment I noticed no difference in the number of fruit flies (and none were visible inside it) so I am going to declare it not to work for fruit flies at all. It may work for normal, big flies, but not for fruit flies.The bigger issue is that it smells INSANELY bad. Like, it's hard to believe how bad it smells. It nearly triggered my gag reflex both filling it and emptying it. During normal, sitting still usage, it still smells awful. You'd come in the apartment and smell it immediately, even after a few days of it sitting still.Definitely avoid this for indoor use, and don't get you hopes up about it catching fruit flies."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT buy this product. Nastiest experience ever.","review":"DO NOT BUY THIS PRODUCT.I was absolutely in love with this product when I purchased it. It did what it said it would and actually exceeded my expectations. The problem was with what to do AFTER the trap was full.Cleaning the trap was likely one of the most disgusting things I've ever had to do in my life. It was full of dead flies (obviously), but also maggots. The smell was something out of a Steve King novel. I used 5 (read: five) thick, plastic bags and it still didn't mask the smell. My trash can now smells like dead flies. Can you believe that? Five trash bags didn't do the trick...This company makes a product that works MUCH better and doesn't have the mess. It simply hangs somewhere and when you're done, you push down on a plastic piece and it's self contained. DO NOT purchase this.

But it also attracts more flies than it captures. Pretty sure it's luring all the flies in our neighborhood to our yard. The point was to be able to sit outside without having flies land on us and our food. We put the bag just far enough away from our patio that we couldn't smell it, but its not that easy for a fly to figure out how to get inside it, so they swarm around it and then come find easier food sources like our meal. The fly problem is just as bad if not worse with the trap. Won't be buying again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fly Genocide","review":"This really works. Trapped hundreds of flies in 2 days!

The space between the seal and the top of the lid was absolutely disgusting, even though I had cleaned it regularly with a brush.

Unfortunately, the mug lids are ineffective. The opening where the liquid is supposed to flow through (so you can drink it) is so small it's impossible to get a sip. I tried returning them and had 1 successful return transaction but now have 2 mugs which are not usable. I've tried using a screwdriver to create a larger opening and I've tried stretching it with various utensils but the lids end up the way they started: not functional.In defense of the mug, the one that works is great.

Which is great since I have no cup holders in my car, I can close the lid and toss it in the passenger seat and not worry about any dribbles. Only draw back is that it does not keep beverages hot as long as I would like, but since most of the time I use it for Iced tea that's not a huge problem for me, it does keep things cold for quite a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This cup doesn't leak. Unfortunately, you can't sip from it either (unless you have the patience to drink your beverage at the rate of 4-5 drops per minute). There is barely any difference between the open and closed positions.Unfortunately I couldn't return it since I mangled the cup by removing a large o-ring, hoping it would allow the contents to flow more freely. It did, but now there is no difference between the open and closed positions. My suggestion is not to waste your money on this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible, Terrible, Terrible!!!","review":"I think I could get more coffee from a swizel stick.

I'm so glad I didnt spend money on this product. It doesnt do what it's supposed to do. The area where the lid closes with the mug leaks so when you're drinking on the top, the bottom is leaking liquid onto your clothes. Thank God I use all my mugs to drink hot water only or else this mug would ruin a lot of clothes.Also, I dont know if I got a defective product or what but the lid doesnt \\"close\\" ... when I turn the knob and \\"close\\" the top... I can still pour water out of it. When it's in the \\"open\\" position... I can also pour water but just a lot more water than the \\"close\\" position. So basically the lid is useless.Lastly, keeping the drink warm? Dont even think about it.

The whole premise of the show is violated. That and maybe there were 6 Buck Henry style jokes in the whole movie (which was too long).I'm sure 'The Rock' is a nice guy, but he is overexposed at this point.Steve Carell does a pretty good job as Max, he is just not written as a blundering incompetent. I do miss Don Adams voice though. Anne Hathaway is beautiful and has a smokin' hot body and looks great modeling retro fashion, but she doesn't shine in the part of 99, maybe because Max written this way doesn't need a straight wo(man).To sum it up, its just not funny, and it's not trying to be funny, its trying to be a vanilla action film using an established brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hate Warner Brothers, Love Get Smart","review":"This is a cute movie, but if you bought the Get Smart BluRay hoping to use the digital copy it comes with, you're out of luck.

Carrel made the role his own and was very good. Hathaway as 99 worked pretty well. Arkin's role as the chief was good. The physical comedy was good. The romance worked. The relationship between Max and the chief worked. The cone of silence and the other gadgets were excellent. Some of the scenes fell flat. The homage to the car and the shoe phone of the original show was good.In summary, the movie was good.

The duo, handicapped by Maxwell's antics, will eventually have their identities compromised, and may be chalked up as casualties while back in America their attackers have already planted a bomb that is set-up to explode in a concert.

I've since read some reviews that said \\"Hey it's really not that bad\\". YES IT REALLY IS THAT BAD. It's so bad that if you looked up \\"Bad Movie\\" in the dictionary they'd say \\"See Movie: Get Smart\\". It's really that bad. Is it worth a 99 cent rental? Not even. What a disappointment, and I love Steve Carrel and especially the Rock. But this movie is totally stupid. If you read this and still rent it, you'll later kick yourself for not taking my advice. Wait until TBS is showing it in a weekend marathon or something."},{"rating":"2","title":"I expected silly / dumb, but it was well done.","review":"1.

However, they were now out of the movie I ordered. I got to keep THE WEDDING SINGER and got a refund pretty quickly. My family really likes THE WEDDING SINGER so I guess it all turned out okay (BUT I REALLY WANTED GET SMART!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get Smart-Steve Carell was perfect","review":"Get Smart was an excellent five star comedy starring Steve Carell who was absolutely perfect for the role.

His nuances and mannerisms due justice to Agent Smart, enough to bring some familiarity to the movie which is sometimes offset by the parts that are \\"updated\\", such as the cones of silence, which did not quite work as well.All in all enteraining if not quite the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Remake - Worth the Time","review":"This is a great remake on the old series, Get Smart. It holds just true enough to the series while bringing it up to date. It has a plot with enough humor to keep you involved and still manages to bring back the childhood memories of watching the series each week.I saw it once and really enjoyed it...enough to put it on my wish list.

Many times it appears they are making up their lines as they go, but they can't come up with anything funny.There are some funny scenes in the movie, not hilarious, because the scenes are not pushed far enough to make it hilarious.example: The dance battle between the two main characters was poorly choreographed, too slow, and not silly enough to make it funny.example: Laser room scene, again not pushed far enough to make it really funny.example: lady in bakery coming on to the main characterBasically that's the problem with the movie, it's just not pushed far enough to make it truly hilarious. Most of the jokes were just lazy and come across as very cheesy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Bloody horrible.Generally love Steve Carrell, The Rock & the rest. But this film is right up there with the biggest piles of crap ever shot. Stunned & confused as to how people actually like this.???? Somebody? .... Pfft.... Anyway...... Maybe they were all dropped on the head prior to watching this? Only explanation really...Anyone with any taste, avoid this like the plague. Up there with \\"North\\", \\"Jingle All The Way\\" & \\"League Of Extraordinary Gentlemen\\" as the worst films ever.P.S. I wanted to give this zero stars, but for some reason it would not let me."},{"rating":"1","title":"GET...something else","review":"There will never be a sequel to this movie, you know why? Because it sucked. Steve Carell is perfect on his T.V. show and as a 40 year old virgin, but in general he is not a strong lead in movies. This movie would of been more entertaining back 1999, but now it's insulting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty Lame","review":"A read a review that called Get Smart \\"Staggeringly Bad\\". Now, although I won't go that far, it was pretty bad, and not very funny at all. I watched it thinking that I might enjoy it if i tried to seperate it from the TV series, but it was still bad. The movie gave only passing reference to the players and comic genius of the original series. It seemed as though they were just trying to get those catch phrases and support characters out of the way so they could continue with whatever it was they were trying to do here.I would suggest browsing around Amazon and buying the original series on DVD if you want some real humor. The original series is even relevant today with its use of humor. That's the true sign of real comedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"CAN'T WATCH IT!!!!!","review":"Listen to this old saying and remember it: Never Trust Anything digital from Amazon.I paid money to watch it online and I can't watch it. Horrible, absolutely horrible. Now I know some of you gonna criticize me and tell me things like \\"then don't rate it\\" or \\"this review is irrelevant\\". My response is how is it irrelevant?

It was also played in The Son's Room."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feeling It","review":"Most soundtracks don't stand out in a movie. This particular soundtrack had my eyes and ears plugged in. All the songs on it are amazing. A Bildungsroman (coming of age) of captivating memories and eloquently narrated.

The book is then held shut with a slipcover. The discs are identical to those from the individual volumes, so basically you get the 9 volumes in a gorgeous set for a very affordable price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fantastic show - horrid price =(","review":"Everything about Cardcaptor Sakura is wonderful as it truly is an enchanting and captivating series that most people will fall in love with - but the last price this second dvd set was at was around 800$ which is like ridiculous!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent","review":"Although for Millencolin this is medicore.

But as soon as I listened to Millencolin, I began to believe that this will be a unique brand of music. I was right! Home from Home brings hit after hit of upbeat, fastpaced, hardrockin' tunes that gets better every time I listen to it! I don't know what \\"ska\\" is or what really defines \\"punk\\", but I like what I know and I know what i like! Don't hesitate to pick this CD up!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It's OK...","review":"I recently got this CD, and I have been a Millencolin fan for years now. I really liked Pennybridge Pioneers, and I was really excited about the new direction the band was going in. But I have to say \\"Home From Home\\" is mediocre at best. The song \\"Kemp\\" is the best song, and \\"Happiness For Dogs\\" is good but sounds like something right off Pennybridge. But the rest is pretty bland and weak. If I were you I would pass on this album, stick to the older material. Life on a Plate, For Monkeys, and Pennybridge is Millencolin at their best!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another One Bites The Dust!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"NNNOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!!!!!!!!!!! not another band that I love geos soft. I don't even know what to say i am so mad... This deosn't even sound like Millencolin, except for songs 2 and 8. He changed his voice on this record... i dont know why.

This albums just dont have the old millencolin punkspirit from the first albums. Its not even punk/ska any longer.

Millencolin have been my idols since i heard there ep use yor nose 1993 but the albums Home to Home and Pennybridge pioneers make me cry."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible","review":"Im sooo dissapointed if your not a millencolin fan buy an older album and if your a millencolin fan don't ever listen to this album, such sellouts"},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed this one...","review":"I really dug this album. I think it's my favorite Millencolin album, as said before...it is \\"softer\\" ...but I have less dispairaging comments about the softness of it. Songs like \\"Battery Check\\" and \\"Fingers Crossed\\" are the ones I enjoyed most thoroughly even on repeat listens.The repitition of the album is just a matter of the \\"feel\\" of the album as far as I am concerned. Pennybridge's strengths are essentially just brought through as a whole album. To me, No Cigar and Penguins and Polarbears=Nine out of Eleven songs on this. It is their newer sound as opposed to plainer pop punk of old... definetly evolved from the days of \\"Boring Planet\\" ...a song I enjoy plenty, but I have to give this album a solid 5 for simply being the best CD I've stuck in my player all year. It could have benefitted from a very \\"The Ballad\\"esque song though.\\"When will I live my life for me? When will do what I want to? When will I let myself be free...\\"-Battery Check"},{"rating":"2","title":"More Amazing than the North American Version!","review":"As Millencolin became harder and harder in music, they became slower and slower. Home From Home was an amazing album with really catchy tunes but seemed a little slow. The 2 bonus tracks on the Japanese version were just as hard as the North American, and featured the fast-paced beats we heard in \\"No Cigar\\" and \\"Bullion\\". \\"Absolute Zero\\" and \\"The Downhill Walk\\" are great reasons to shell out a couple extra dollars for this import!"},{"rating":"2","title":"AwEsOmE","review":"This CD is awesome and I love it so much.

We are living overseas (not in Thailand) so I am happy to see that it is available on Amazon!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I really wanted to love this but...","review":"I had really high hopes for this brand. I used to use Thai Kitchen Green Curry Paste (check my review of it) but they changed something so I've been on the look-out for a substitute. This had great reviews and a decent price so of course I gave it a try. I've only used it once, but it was MEGA-salty. Now, I'm a person who puts salt on bacon. It's actually rare that I think something is too salty. I also made it with boxed chicken broth so maybe that added salt put it over the top?I'm gonna try this again soon using less paste and a reduced- or no-sodium broth to see if maybe that reduces the saltiness. I'll write a follow-up at that point. I REALLY want this to work!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"yellow jacket 3 month attractant for traps","review":"BEST item they came out with, next to the trap it self, that these goes into. Used 5 of them this summer, putting out last April for the queens, and have found, like the old liquid attractant, you can add a little water through the top opening and it just keeps on working all summer long.

I have to empty my traps on a weekly basis even now!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"New 10 week bait ineffective","review":"I have been using these traps for many years, and have had great success capturing the Queens early on in the season. This year, the old liquid packets were not in any store in my area, nor on Amazon. I ordered 3 of the new units, and installed them in my traps. I have not captured the first bee, and now have several nests in my yard and lawn. IF found, I will purchase the old liquid form for the cotton balls, and use in the future. It was the only trap I have had work for me. My exterminator enjoys his $50 visits!

We had a hot dry summer in Atlanta last year and were simply swarmed with the mean beasties. I figured that putting out the lure would snag the queens out flying around and prevent nests in my yard this year. The trap (rebaited) has been out for 3 weeks and hasn't attracted a single queen... or even a wasp for that matter. I got tons of yellow-jackets with hotdog pieces last summer and I can guarantee that hot dog pieces were a LOT cheaper than this lure. I will leave it out with this bait (said to be good for 10 weeks) and then go back to my tried and true hot dog bits. At this point, it looks like I wasted my money. I will update this at the end of the 10 weeks and see if things improve."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great product - Don't buy here!","review":"Don't get fleeced by their shipping charges ($45 shipping on a $50 order)!

If you really like Anti-Flag and their lyrics, then maybe you might like actual punk. This band is ok but there are THOUSANDS of bands just like them that you know-nothings have never heard of. Most people that listen to these big bands that use to be good before they sold out like Blink are probably ignorant preps or jocks. I knew Blink and liked them since Chershire Cat.

They used to be a band called Reset and were on a undergroung label in canada. While they were reset they actually were ok. They were much more technical, had decent non-recycled lyrics, and played more than three power chords. They decided to \\"sell out\\". They \\"sold out\\" because they decided to change there music style to favor the mass of people that enjoy recycled, major lable, poppy, easy to listen to music that has destroyed music these days. Music for people that know nothing about musci and listed to music because dont take time or effort to look for great bands that are not fed to you by radio and mtv.

A vice? The \\"Perfect\\" song comes out of my speakers, and I remember why XM or MP3 mixes are vital to my listening experience...I can shut all the crap out and listen to what I want. So I will avoid making personal attacks on this band. They have an audience...they fill a need. They may suck in my eyes (and many others) but I know a lot of people who find the Beatles archaic and Hendrix unexciting. I don't agree, but that's their, um, interesting opinion. I hate MTV now anyway (and have for about seven years), so as long as bands like Simple Plan get their videos played on TRL and at 4:00 in the morning or spun on the local \\"music mix\\" radio stations, I will hear very little of them anyway. If you like these kids, buy the album and help them through college in a few years when the novelty has worn thinner than the tepid lyrics and whiny voice on these songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"No","review":"Why did these guys get popular? Their not nearly as good as other pop-punk acts out there, that have humor, meaning, emotion, and good, fast guitar riffs. Simple Plan does all those things mediocre at best. Okay, they have light humor in some songs, but not the kind that would make you burst out laughing like Blink-182. They touch on emotion in a way in Perfect, but the singers voice is so laughable that you cant take it seriously. If you want pop-punk with emotion try New Found Glory. They cant write good, varied songs either. All their songs are about love or them whining about something. If you want a band that writes about lots of topics and has some meaning, try Good Charlotte (their not nearly as bad as alot of people think). If you want pop-punk with quick guitar riffs and good solos, try Sum 41. Some songs on here are okay, but like I said, SP is just a mediocre version of all those bands I mentioned before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"I liked Simple Plan back in June. Now that they are getting famous, it seems like it isn't the same. The cd is still good though. The tunes are catchy and so are the words.

Anyway, no matter what all of these haters are saying SP will keep on rocking because of those people who love them that much more. I believe that they are one of the best bands out right now..and they don't let all of the fame go to their heads, whcih is very rare among celebrities. I'll admit that their sound is more punk-pop, but it is a good transition from bubble gum pop to punk rock..for those who are thinking of coverting their tastes to Billy Talent and Death By Stereo.

I can see they were trying to go for some creativity there, but it obviously backfired.I suggest not buying this cd unless you are a real fan of pop-rock bands such as Sum 41, Blink-182 and Good Charlotte..If you are looking for a more punk cd, I reccomend The Distillers, Anti-Flag, Finch and Thursday"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good at first but way too much POP to hold me for long","review":"Simple Plan is not Blink 182.

And I'm not being sarcastic at all when I say I have both their CD's, a poster, and a T-shirt. And I have a Rolemodel-brand shirt on the way...

Better yet, I think 99% of Simple Plan fans listen to these guys just because it's \\"cool\\" since everyone else does. Using Simple Plan as an excuse to be accepted by society is pathetic and the lowest the American pop listener has ever gone.

Just record companies puking out the same band over and over and over again. I first saw Simple Plan on T.V. and thought Blink knock offs and they would'nt last, but then I saw them on Nickoloden, NICKOLODEN, then on Disney and I got bored with them. But then when I saw them appearing in the Mary Kate&Ashely Olsen movie now I wish they were dead. Since the 90's ended music has sucked. MTV and the radio suck. You guys who are all 14,15,16 don't listen to this you want Punk listen to SUM-41, MINOR THREAT, BLACK FLAG, GREEN DAY, RAMONES, DEAD KENNEDYS, SEX PISTOLS,AFI, BAD BRAINS, AND THE CLASH. Even Offspring is better than is.

With great songs like \\"I'm Just A Kid\\" and \\"The Worst Day Ever\\" they clearly define teenage angst without being angry and they're so upbeat that you can't help but jump up and down to them. All in all it's a fun and upbeat album and it's a must to add to any punk/pop fan's CD collection. Good if you like Blink 182, Sum 41, Sugar Ray, Good Charlotte."},{"rating":"2","title":"RIGHT ON!!!!","review":"...this is one of my favorite cds!

Only because they came across as pop-punk and they were an \\"at the moment\\" band. But after listening to some of their songs, I decided to buy the CD. It's a pretty good CD. I'm more into the harder punk, like Sum 41, but this is good for when you want to just have fun. I noticed some of the songs were kind of the same. I like the song \\"You Don't Mean Anything,\\" it's really catchy and gets stuck in your head. I like basically all of the songs, this is good since it's their first, but I'm expecting some different topics the next time around."},{"rating":"1","title":"this album is rubbish by it and laugh.","review":"This album takes everything bad about punk and puts it in a album."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Band Out There","review":"Simple Plan is one of the greatest punk rock bands out there.

On top of that I have got to meet them in person and they are the sweetest guys out there, especially Pierre! YOU MUST BUY THIS CD!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Punk/Pop CD","review":"I first heard of Simple Plan when I bought my MTV TRL Christmas CD. Their song, \\"My Christmas List\\" was really awesome. It sounded great and the lyrics were cool, funny, and catchy. I looked on the net for information on the band but I couldn't find any. But finally, a few months later I saw the video for Simple Plan's single, \\"I'm Just a Kid\\". I knew that I would have to get their CD. I got the CD right away and I can say that I've been really happy with it. Punk is my favorite music and Simple Plan is an awesome punk band. SP's music definently has to be some of the best pop/punk music I have ever heard. Every song on the CD is good. I've listened to this CD A LOT but I'm still not bored of it. I could easily listen to this CD the whole way through. I couldn't pick a favorite song off the CD but I can promise that every single one is awesome. I have three words left to say: Go buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"#2 FAN of SIMPLE PLAN!!!","review":"ok ok...it's because my daughter swears she's their #1 fan. I'm a little old to be reviewing 'punk' music, but they are WAY better than any punk I've ever heard. (I'm not that crazy about punk to begin with.) What THIS is, is the best, most creative and talented band to come around in decades. They don't make noise...they make music. And UPBEAT music at that! A day without Simple Plan is a day without sunshine. Every song on the CD is great...not a bad one on it! I've had the privilege of seeing them twice in concert...both times, they blew me away. And the way they mix with the crowd and are so nice...what a special group! Don't miss out on this CD, and tell EVERYONE you know about it. No Pads, No Helmets...just Balls == No noise, no vulgarity...just pure PLEASURE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest CD","review":"This CD rocks!

This CD does not even come close to punk. These songs are aimed at kids? I'm 12 and I know a sellout when I see it. This band has nothing behind their corporate masks. You want punk? do NOT look to blink 182, sum 41, simple plan, good charlotte or NOFX to get it. if you want real punk with substance, look to The Stooges, Ramones, Dead Kennedys, Black Flag or, if your a moderner look to The Distillers or The Lot Six. These bands are real. Simple Plan has nothing. trust me. Unless your a kid whose selling yourself out big time, or an adult who already has, steer clear of this sh**t."},{"rating":"1","title":"How simple is this plan?","review":"This plan must not be that easy to solve.

I would reccomend this cd tho anyone who is into New Found Glory, Midtown, and all the other great punk bands.. SO WHAT ARE YOU WAITING FOR buy the cd alreay! ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"No Pads, No Helmets,.........and unfortunately No Balls","review":"This band is a mockery of the punk rock genre. I know people say their songs are catchy and infectious but they really aren't. Blink-182 were making goofball records for years until their most recent, more mature, new album was released. Even they know that they had to get out of the gutter before every teenager around the world became obsessed with fart jokes and midgits. Other bands like Sum 41 and The Starting Line at least have the gusto in their live show to make up for their lack of studio prowess. Unfortunately, Simple Plan aim way low on maturity scale lyrically and musically. Songs range from irritating to flat out obnoxious. C'mon people. Get your head out of your asses. Buy a Buzzcocks or Clash album. Hell, just buy an Offspring album over this piece of crap. I'm only one man with an opinion. But music like this is destined only to fade away and never be remembered again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland, unoriginal pop music.","review":"I'm not exaggerating when I say that this CD is one of the worst I've heard this year. While their music is fine from a technical point, it's all very ... samey. It's like they took the same three chords and played them over and over again, just in a different order.Their lyrics are incredibly immature. They must be, what, early-mid 20s? Why on earth are they singing stupid songs about how much their parents hate them?If you're into Good Charlotte and the wave of faux-punk music that's sweeping the world, you'll love this. If you're into something a little more deeper, stay away and look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"HOW ARE THEY FAMOUS! 0 STARS","review":"SERIOUSLY!- if anyone knows why is this band famous? They're got awful they are probably the most untalented band I have ever heard in my life! The guitar riffs seem as though they were written by a four year old. And the music is as creative as \\"when your happy and you know it clap your hands\\". There is no complexity at all to this. And I mean sometimes simplicity is great! But in this case NO! The vocals are atrocious too! I SWEAR THEY'RE CHILDREN! Okay I get it POP-PUNK is great! Just bury me in a hole until this fade dies and maturity once again is somewhere lyrically in our music.AH..."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont buy this","review":"simple plan are a band like anyother trying to make it big. but with the gay lyrics and crap vocals, they shouldnt even be a band..i definatly recomend this for ppl really into the whole POP punk, thing if you want it more like nsync.download id do anything, and youll be fine. nothing else on this cd is worth money!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"this is NOT real music","review":"I admit that I was drawn to this band by their first single played repeatedly on the radio and my pops offered to buy the CD for me because he liked it too, and was probably hoping that he could borrow it from me some of the time. After hearing it for the first time, I just let him keep the fricking CD. I have never heard such a poor excuse for punk in my life. The worst part by far is how this CD has horrible, horrible, extremely childish lyrics. It's sickening to listen to, literally and physically sickening. An Alien girlfriend? Good God, please. That is by far the worst song on the CD. Nothing against the guys in Simple Plan, they're just another pop punk bnd trying to make it big, but this cd is truly awful. If you're totally into \\"pop\\" punk, then by all means get this CD because clearly you'll like it. If you are a devoted emo/punk fan who enjoys real music....then I guaruntee you will not enjoy this CD. Sorry guys, try again. Or maybe....don't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boy band!","review":"This may be the worst cd out there, what is really the difference between them and the backstreet boys or N'Sync. Both are willing to do anything to get on MTV and play the most commercial brand of Music. Both have legions of teenage girls who sing along to there lame music. They even both wear makeup! Take a look at the album cover, O' they are so cute! I guarentee that these guys where never into Punk Rock 3-4 years ago, and are just out for the cash!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This band is a joke and an insult to punk","review":"Am i the only one who thinks guys in their late twentys singingabout tests and crashing dads car is a little odd? Punk is supposed to be intense, honest and anti-mainstream, not stoopingdown to twelve-year-olds who just outgrew N'SYNC. How can a bandthat opens for avril lavigne have the balls to call itself punk?I can't wait till punk stops being cool and all of you trendy teenybopper posers stop creating a market for horrible \\"punk\\" bands like this and listen to something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"gayest band of them all......in fact........","review":"...there should be a picture of these guys inthe dictionaary next to GAY.....if i hear perfect or addicted on the radio one more time or if i hear my 11 year old sister sing them ever again i may jsut lose it and shoot up the place. Anyway, this band has nothing. their music has no depth no meaning, just a bunch of annoying pop hooks in order to cash in from the TRL crowd. There is no way these guys actually like the music they make or they may not have dicks. Bands like Simple PLan and rappers like chingy represent everything that is wrong w/ MTV and mainstream music these days. Anyone that thinks this band has musical talent obviously knows nothing about music and needs to expand their horizon."},{"rating":"1","title":"*shudders*","review":"When I first heard this song, I couldn't remember if it was Sum 41 or Blink 182. Or could it have been New Found Glory? All American Rejects? How many of these artists are there? They all sound the SAME! There IS one difference, this guys voice is painfully BAD... like the lyrics. Simple Plan's name states it all there: They have a simple plan-- mix poor, simple lyrics with a whiney cute boy sterotype lead singer and you'll get your ... on MTV. That's exactly what worked for them. I can tolerate most poppy punk, in fact, I even fancy some of it. This is just bad. It's all a copy of what's already been done."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can anyone like this crap?","review":"Seriously, this is even worse than new found glory. honestly, there isnt even the slightest hint of punk in this. anyone who calls this punk or pop punk obviously has never heard stuff like rancid or bad religion or operation ivy. if you like all those crappy pop bands like new foung glory and blink 182, then this is right up your alley. im just glad i didnt waste my 14 bucks on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Band Ever!!!","review":"This is the first band that I have felt a true connection to. I don't agree with the people saying that this band sucks. In a way I think that Simple Plan is trying to reach out and tell the world what it's like to lose your family or have a bad life and yet still pull through because great things will happen to you. This band is truly a good band and if your reading these reviews don't only believe that they are bad because some people said they didn't sound right or the music was awful. Try for yourself what they sound like. You never know what they might sound like to you. I know many people who say they are bad and yet I still love them. They have great songs like Perfect who show what a bad relationship that a boy had with his father and yet it still turned out OK in the end. Really give these guys a chance and tell for yourself what you think of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd give it 0 stars if possible","review":"This is quite possibly the worst schlock passing itself off as emo I've ever heard. This isn't emo, this isn't punk, this isn't even rock music. This is what you get when you give the Backstreet Boys electric guitars and distortion pedals. This makes posuers like Green Day look like Fugazi, Sunny Day Real Estate or Sex Pistols. And trust me kids. That's saying A LOT."},{"rating":"1","title":"cry with me.. about my dad.. who left me for my girlfriend..","review":"First off.. I just have to say.. why do they pick album names they direct to their girlfriends? I'm sure they ( their girlfriends ) have more balls then these wannabe faggots. I don't even feel like wasting anymore of my time writing a review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing New","review":"I usually have an opened mind toward music, but I think a band should have a certain amount of talent to be signed to a label and make albums and be famous. But Simple Plan is doing nothing new. They are making \\"pop punk,\\" which seems to be the current rage in music. I'm usually don't like punk music, but I do enjoy bands like The Clash, Pennywise, NOFX, The Ramones, The Descendents. Simple Plan is making punk music, only the singer sounds like a 12 year old boy whose voice hasn't cracked yet. Not to mention the rest of the band - i honestly thought the bassist was a girl the first time i saw him. The guitar parts are usually simple, as are the bass and drum parts.Also, the lyrics suck. Thats the best way to put it. \\"I'm just a kid and nobody cares...\\"You're 25 years old. Get a f*cking job and quit whining.But hey, if this is your kind of music, have fun with it. I hate it when people persecute others for their choice of music."},{"rating":"1","title":"DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE DIE!!!!!!!!!","review":"Just a message for simple plan and their fans. Look this band really REALLY does suck. Someone actually had the balls to say these guys are better then older bands such as the clash ect. I mean seriously WTF?!?!?!!

Their lead singer whines too much and their music has no purpose or voice besides *insert high pitched whine* \\"oh me oh my, my parents hate me, and god hates me, and I want your cash to help me overcome my pain,\\" well folks don't give 'em a dime, let the little bastards suffer.P.S.

Their music and lyrics are horrible. They prance around in the videos just trying to attract the young female crowd...attract that crowd, and you are set for a while...at least until the next cute boy group comes along. If many more bands like this come along, this genre will be ruined completely. Just like what Nu Metal has done to actual metal music.

For young \\"teeny-Boppers\\" that is quite understandable, as I watched my sister go through the stage as a youngin'. The fact is, this CD SHOULD NOT be qualified with the word \\"punk\\" in it at all. Simple Plan, New Found Glory, AFI, etc., they all sound identical, so if you here one of their songs, you've heard 'em all. This is not rock, so get over it and stop pretending that it is. Just because they PRETEND to be good guitarists doesn't mean that they are (they have no talent). Have you ever wondered what it'd be like to see the backstreet boys with guitars? Well, here it is.

Many \\"hardcore\\" rock lovers call bands such as Simple Plan, New Found Glory, Good Charlotte, etc. \\"punk wannabes\\".

Why does it sound like Simple Plan, New Found Glory, Yellowcard, Green Day, and Blink-182 all have the same annoying nasily voiced loser singing about some piece crap?

Of course the only reason for that is because their instrumentals were so loud that we couldn't hear their lyrics. Seriously. They need to grow up. What kind of lyrics are \\"She has two arms to hold me and four legs to wrap around me. She's not your ordinary girl. She's my alien.\\"? That's retarded.

Their instrumentals are alright, though.Conclusion: I would chop off my ears before I ever showed any mild interest in this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the worst CD ever made","review":"No originality.

THERE IS STILL HOPE FOR GOOD MUSIC!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple Plan's not too simple","review":"I remember when I first heard \\"I'd Do Anything\\" the second song released off this album. The catchy music, and Pierre's incredible voice had me hooked. I went and downloaded that song plus \\"I'm Just a Kid\\" and later got the cd! It [was bad] for me, because I had to get someone to find it, because they were all hidden! So it's no surprise that not many people have heard of this great band! Each song has it's own different melodies. And I guarantee that there's atleast ONE song you'd feel like you wrote yourself! They just cover so much that teens go through, without sounding depressing our overly poppy! So many different emotions captured on one great cd. So if you're looking for a great cd that you can listen to over and over without getting tired of it, or something to just sing along to, I definately reccomend this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"SIMPLE PLAN ROCKS!","review":"ok dude if you dont have this cd you need to go get it! they are awesome they have been on tour with some of your favorite bands! blink 182, green day, sugar ray and tons of others and even on their cd they have guest voices from mark hoppus and joel from another good band good charlotte. their pop-punk tunes will get you hooked! \\"im just a kid\\" (on the \\"The New Kid\\" soundtrack) is their most heard of song right now but other songs such as \\"I'd Do Anything\\" and \\"Perfect\\" are even better! If simple plan is coming to your town go see them. OH! they are ALSO on the \\"Scooby Doo\\" sountrack with their song \\"Grow Up\\" which i fell in love with when i went to see the movie cause they have a distenct sound and you can tell who they are and its just great i just gotta say go buy it you wont regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple Plan = Great Plan","review":"The smash debut by Simple Plan is one of the best cds I've heard recently. I enjoyed the cd a lot, and I hope you do too. The vocals are solid and the music gets you moving. If you like Blink-182, Sum41, and Sugar Ray, then you'll love this cd. The track I'd Do Anything features Mark Hoppus of Blink-182. Also the band is currently on tour with Sugar Ray. They are equally as good if not better live than they are on the cd. Check out ... for more information"},{"rating":"2","title":"An awesome CD","review":"This is one of the best albums I have ever heard. There's no songs on here that I don't like. All of them are great. Especially I'm Just a Kid, I'd Do Anything, and Perfect. I reccomend this to anyone who likes bands such as Yellowcard, The All-American Rejects, and blink-182 or anyone who is looking for some good music to listen too."},{"rating":"2","title":"What A Great Group!","review":"I'm not a total hardcore rocker chic but I DO know a good group when I see one!!

Powered by teen-angst lyrics, a great melody and 5 good-looking guys, what's not to love? In songs like \\"I'm Just a Kid\\", their first single off of their debut album \\"No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls\\", the lead singer, Pierre Bouvier, sings about life as a kid whose not apart of the \\"in-crowd\\". He makes the listener feel as if \\"Hey, so maybe I'm not the ONLY un-popular person in the world\\"; he relates to the listener. In more heart-felt songs, like \\"Perfect\\", he sings about the pressures that parents can sometimes place on a child. With appearences by Joel from Good Charlotte and Mark Hoppus of Blink182, this cd will probably the best thing you bought for anyone, including yourself. So, if you'e feeling sorry for yourself, or you want to listen to an up-beat song with entertaining lyrics...go buy Simple Plan's new cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coin Flip","review":"Listening to this band it always makes me wonder which poser band is more gay. Simple Plan, or Good Charlotte. It's a very heated race. SP's singer sounds like he's in a boy band, the song topics are all aimed for pre-teen girls. What really annoys me is the token bald guy in the band. Does anyone care about him? I for one don't. That is why you are being ripped off if you buy this crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful, just awful","review":"So this is what has happened to music huh? I feel sorry for all of you kiddies growing up these days. The music that MTV and radio plays these days is complete and utter garbage!! Thank god i was born in the early 80's and grew up with the AMAZING music of the early 90's. With REAL bands like Nirvana, Soundgarden, Smashing Pumpkins, Green Day, The Pixies, Alice in Chains, Sonic Youth, Metallica dominating the musical landscape. These day's it's just phony tripe. No creativity or originality invloved. If you want to get enlightened just listen to the bands i listed. They will send you off to a world that is a far cry from the sewage that pollutes the airwaves these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"You must have no balls to enjoy this stuff...","review":"People without balls listen to this sh*t. All Simple Plan is, is the non-gothic form of Good Charlotte. I hate these guys with a passion if you don't I suggest you open your mind to the better music out there (i.e. sh*t that isn't played constantly on the radio). A pre-teen can pick up a guitar and strum a few bar chords and sing about how he misses his ex-gf and can't forget about her or sing about how he's not perfect enough for some girl he's infatuated over.Break away from the fruitcake music open your ears to:Amon AmarthAgollochAC/DCBlack SabbathBlack Label SocietyBostonChildren Of BodomDanzigDarkest HourIron MaidenJimi HendrixLed ZeppelinMegadethMetallicaThe MisfitsMotorheadNileOpethPanteraPorcupine TreePink FloydStrapping Young LadSepulturaSlayerSteve VaiSuicidal TendenciesToolThe WhoYngwie Malmsteen"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple Plan","review":"Man do I love this CD. The songs are well written, they are original, and Pierre is an awesome lead singer. Seriously, what's in the water in Canada? Yet another amazing band from Canada. The songs are true and at times downright funny. The \\"standout tracks\\" for me are...\\"Meet You There\\", \\"One Day\\", \\"Perfect\\", and \\"Addicted\\". \\"Perfect\\" is a beautiful song about (i think) Pierre's battered relationship with his father. This is obvious when he states \\"I'm sorry I can't be perfect.\\" Not that the other songs aren't good also. I just had to choose a few to tell you guys. Oh yeah, and also Mark Hoppus (Blink 182) accompanies them on vocals and as a bassist. And Joel Madden (the awesome band Good Charlotte) sings back-up on \\"You Don't Mean Anything.\\" All in all, it is one of the BEST CD's I have ever bought. ROCK ON SIMPLE PLAN!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HA! ha...ha","review":"There seems to be plenty of negative feedback on this CD, so much so that you don't need me to write another bad review. Too bad, here goes. If you like Simple Plan cuz you're 12 years old and having a lot of problems and can relate to their POP music, then go ahead, keep these poor canucks on our airwaves by buying their cd.

They are nothing but a few kids who realized they could make money if they imitated the early years of Blink-182 and the overly-commercial Good Char. While the Goods have not stopped torturing me with their prepackaged sound, why should I have to listen to another sound-alike 'punk' group who probably did just fine in social circles. faux-outsiders like Simple Plan are taking Punk Rock, the interesting bastard-child of rock, to a new, juvenile, lower level. In their last two CDs, blink-182 has changed from childish ideas on sex to sadness and more adult themes. 'Miss You' is the cry for punk to grow up. Any CD titled 'just balls' deserves to be put on the back shelf. While other true punk bands have grown, Simple Plan and all the others like it insist on dragging it back down."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best band out right now.......","review":"I think Simple Plan has done such a great job on making music!

The only good song on No Pads No Helmets... is I'd Do Anything. The rest of the CD is crap. They whine too much about their parents, kinda like Good Charlotte whines about their dad; but where GC makes up for this with true honest lyrics and killer music Simple Plan just doesn't deliver. Even when compared to other \\"Pop\\" punk bands, or poser bands like Good Charlotte and Newfound Glory Simple Plan can't even match.

They are not original or new, sounding the same as Good Charlotte, New Found Glory and Wakefield. The music is likeable, but it never reaches to an original or different style. With about eight gutiar chords and three drum beats, they try to create songs with depth or originality like \\"Perfect\\" or \\"I'm Just a Kid,\\" but it's obvioius that they are manufucatered to cater to what's popular with music now. Although some of the music is enjoyable, the lead singer's voice becomes whiny, the music exactly the same and the lyrics are predictible.

It obviously was made to please 12 year old teeny boppers, so little girls with braces can scream at them when they are on MTV. The lyrics sound like something a 5th grader wrote. What makes albums like this even worse, is that they get labeled as \\"punk or emo.\\" This album is not punk or emo, it is pop. While there is nothing wrong with pop music, there is something wrong with manufactured music. There is nothing wrong with \\"pop-punk\\" music. Bands like New Found Glory and The Starting Line have put out some very catchy albums. The difference between those artists and Simple Plan is that Simple Plan put absolutely no emotion or art into their music; the whole album is very generic.

There simply is no originality in the music with the same riffs used over and over. The messages found in the lyrics are beaten to death with a nailbat which only helps to drive this album six feet under and then some. Many people seem to like this group the same reason they like New Found Glory or Good Charlotte: The members are \\"cute\\". If they would overlook this narrow minded way of seeing a band, some might realize these guys as well as 90% of other pop-punk acts out there do not bring anything new or exciting to the world of music.

But I can understand why, MTV forces these bands into their shows and little middle schoolers see it and think its cool and listen to it and love it. Its not their fault they listen to this junk, I listened to Blink 182 Enema of the State and actually thought it was one of the greatest CDs of all time. Yeah ill admit this kind of music is catchy but if you really heard other bands that could rock then this starts to sound terrible. Im not bashing Simple Plan because they sound good enough to be popular but I'm just saying theres music that makes this seem like total crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can these guys stand to hear themselves play?","review":"I'm actually surprsed that they would call themselves Simple Plan, it seems like their main goal is to seem more complex than they really are. Unfortunately they suck at life and we get this. It truly seems like these guys turned on the radio one day and thought they could achieve sucess by imitating the pop-punk already choking the airwaves. They started with some emo, then added way too many pop hooks, thus taking away the emotional aspect of the emo, as well as the \\"punk\\" aspect they were going for. They had screwed things up enough at this point and released their poorly titled album. Thus, Simple Plan was born."},{"rating":"2","title":"don't hate on these..","review":"if you like feel good music...then this album is for you..there is some catchy songs and good riffs...and i think their music rocks!!...any of you that are hating on this band then you need to sort yourself out...id like to see you do better.."},{"rating":"1","title":"crap","review":"so i should go into depth on this. many of those \\"hated this cd\\" reviews are longwinded crap themselves, so i'm gonna try to make this interesting to you,my eleven year old trying to break away from his parents friend.now many of these dudes on here bash greenday, but i like them. theyre good. they came out with dookie, and now they've matured big deal. simple plan will never mature, they'll die thirteen and bitching. blink 182 i dont like. but they still at least try to grasp fans over 12 with there greedy paws.simple plan is good and dandy and fun if youve had a brain anurism. they wanna b punk, and give them a pat on the head and the finger for their troubles.good luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Pick-Me-Up","review":"I'll admit, I was hesitant when my friend loaned me her copy of \\"No Helmet, No Pads... Just Balls.\\" Being a fan of The Ramones, Sex Pistols, Pink Floyd and other more time-tested bands, Simple Plan just really didn't fit in anywhere.When I heard the first strings of \\"I'd Do Anything,\\" though, I was ready to just get up and dance. The music was upbeat and, no matter how depressing the lyrics were, it just made me want to dance.\\"No Hemet, No Pads... Just Balls\\" is now one of my favourite cds. It's a cd I can listen to all the way through without having to skip one single track. I'd recommend this cd to all of my friends in a heartbeat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please!","review":"This is a really awesome album and i can't understend why so many people don't like it.I know that this a space for reviews, but some people that write here, are just showing how much they hate a band or other.Who doesnt know the cd and read the reviews is looking for something helpfull. So my review is: this is an awesome cd, the lyrics are amazing and pierre's voice is wonderful. There are some things that i don't like, as an example in the song \\"You don't mean anything\\", when they repeat many times \\"you don't,you don't,you don't,you don't\\"that's a bit boring, but i still love this cd.I hope that in their new album this kind of stuff doesnt happend anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than \\"St Anger\\"!","review":"I had to slap this kid at school who was talking about this band wearing his abercrombie t-shirt. He was saying how awesome this band was, he was saying it was the best punk band.

YEAH RIGHT!!!","review":"To start off, the only reason I purchased this cd was because the song I'm Just A Kid was on the new guy soundtrack and i love that movie. So i thought that i'd try this cd out just to give them a try. That was a BIG mistake. These guys consider themselves punk!?!? IN THEIR DREAMS. The singer, Pierre, sounds like he hasn't gone throught puberty!!! So overall I think I like the cover more than anything else on this cd!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Laughable...very...","review":"Yeah, I saw these guys Summer 2002 when I went to the Green Day/Blink-182/Jimmy Eat World concert. I had never heard of them before so I figured I would watch them. They put on a pretty boring show. My friend burned me their CD and I have got to say I think this is the worst CD I have. The vocals are really whiney, simple guitar riffs, and the lyrics...oh my god. They are absolutely terrible. Did the lead singer write these when he was 12? Former BSB and N'Sync fans, now that that trend has passed...here you go. Just remember, no matter how hard you try or how hard the band thinks they are, this is NOT PUNK...this is NOT EVEN POP-PUNK. This is borderline boy-band genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple Plan- The Best Band!!","review":"I couldn't be more happy to get this CD. When I did, I was happy to see that \\"I'd Do Anything\\" on it and \\"Perfect\\". My 4 fave songs on this CD would have to be: \\"God Must Hate Me\\" \\"Perfect\\" \\"My Alein\\" and of course, \\"I'd Do Anything\\" . Keep goin' Simple Plan! You and Avril Lavigne are the best singers (Well, one's a band) from Canada!!! Rock on, guys!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK but gets boring after a while","review":"Yeah I think this album has only a few good songs. Like the first track \\"I'd do anything\\"(featuring the great Mark Hoppus) and \\"I'm just a kid\\". Those are my favorite songs. The rest of the album is ok but it's way to poppy and It gets so boring after a while. I mean I like pop/punk and all but this is like really POP with some punk influence. But don't get me wrong they kickass live. After a few listens to it the cover and booklet photos are the only interesting thing. Well if you like a poppier version if Blink 182, give it a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"can this cd be any more \\"perfect\\"?","review":"of course not... it's a great cd, even though the guys are from canada! i've just been listening to this cd nonstop lately and i can't put it away... it's one of the best! anybody who listens to punk and doesn't have this cd should shoot themselves... or just pick up the cd!"},{"rating":"1","title":"No pads, no helmets, and definetly no balls","review":"This CD is really bad (not the good way). If anyone thinks they are punk then why are they on Nickelodeon!? Their songs are pointless. The lead singer sounds like he is suckin healium. Lyrics are very stupid. On the cover your seein a image that you would see from pop-punkers Blink 182 (who can actually sing) but no you get this Simple Plan crap. Save your money to buy some gas after work it will last longer im sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"CRAP carp and crap","review":"Simple PLan has managed to be the most bubble gum pop ever why because once bubble gum looses its flavor it tastes like crap and that whats going to happen to this band they will loose the flavor eventually and fade away and be bums....They should learn to get fans that know how to wipe there own ass if you like so called \\"pop punk\\" and you like 12yr old boys and girls and like A cup boobies then by all means by this album ok buh-- bye"},{"rating":"1","title":"You know music is dead when a band like this comes out","review":"Awful. Terrible. Preppy. Not punk, not rock. Hey, these guys don't even deserve to be called pop. It's that bad. Every single person that says this is the \\"greatest band ever\\" has obviously never heard Nirvana, The Beatles or the Foo Fighters. Every single song sounds just like the one before it and is terrible. Do not buy this album! You are only fueling the mainstream pop monster! We must destroy it before it takes over! Do yourself, and music, a favor and buy Nevermind by Nirvana, any Beatles album, or any Foo Fighters album. But do not buy this trash. There is only one thing an album like this is good for.

All these (...) do is whine about how their life is \\"such a nightmare\\" and how \\"god must hate them\\".

This CD is not pop-punk or pop-rock it is just straight up commerialized POP for all the woe-is-me hottopic posuers."},{"rating":"1","title":"* Just Balls...Right... *","review":"I've read some of these reviews absolutley cutting Simple Plan apart, and I mean, that's going a bit far. Ok, so they're pretty poppy, but the world can't just be full of groups like Hoobastank and AFI.As the songs go...well...you know. To be honest, I don't really know. They're not absolutley awful and yet they're not absolutley brilliant. They're just sort of nothing.But if you want to get into sort of punky music, I guess this is a good place to start. It's pretty soft and will ease you in. While I'm not ripping Simple Plan apart, I'm not praising them either. Just, before you judge, have a listen to this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rock is Dead","review":"I understand the catchiness of music like this. But what's with all this \\"it relates to what teens are going through\\" bullcrap?\\" If this music is so catchy and upbeat, why would you want to hear about some kid who is mad at his parents? The music doesn't fit with the lyrical content. To any teenagers who are full of rage and angst and want to relate so something musically, I recommend alternative bands of the 90's like the Smashing Pumpkins. Billy Corgan showed true emotion through his music, and i think many teens can seriously relate to him, and not this fabricated, spiky-haired garbage that has taken over popular music...no, not rock. Rock is dead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Once upon a time......before Simple Plan","review":"Well...This album is pretty bad, what makes me even more sick is the fact that these guys are capable of so much more. For anyone who's thinking what the hell is this guy talking about, Im here to inform you that before simple plan was formed there was a band called RESET made up from the majority of simple plan. Now reset was a real band, the music was punk but with a metal edge, and the lyrics actually had meaning, not ooooohhh i want to be perfect. So anyone reading this do yourself a huge favour and track down some of reset's music on the net. My fav songs are \\"let me go\\" and \\"united we stand tall'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please God, no, no, no!!!!","review":"In the vast ocean of repugnant pop rock bands featuring pre-pubescent singers, whining about non-existent love lives over music consisting usually of two or three power chords repeated ad nauseam, Simple Plan is the big ugly whale eating up all the program time on TRL and all the space on the Hot Topic shelves.Honestly, words cannot describe the putrid garbage that is this album. Hell, it's not even original. It merely dumbs down (as if that were possible) the schlock of Green Day and Blink-182, aiming toward an even less intelligent and mature fan base. All of you \\"punk rawkers,\\" I hope, will eventually grow out of this phase, graduate from middle school, and listen to real music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow, The Enhanced Version!!! Better Buy 10 Just Because","review":"I've been waiting and waiting for this enhanced version to come out! I just couldn't get enought of these fake punks playing bar chords and whining about everyday problems. I can tell this album is a lyrical genious just by looking at the title of #9. \\"God Must Hate Me\\" has got to be the deepest most influencial song eva written. No I take that back, Perfect is. I'm also going for the writty title, No Pads, No Helmets...Just Balls. Now I'll bet that Slayer could have never thought of that. Of course not. Slayer comes up with lame names like \\"South of Heaven\\" and \\"Haunting the Chapel\\".Anyways, buy this album if you want a new drink coaster. This album sucks so bad that I know Good Charlotte fans that look down on this. Now that is sad.Do me a favor if you own this album/like this type of music. Please do not make any contact with me if you value your miserable soul."},{"rating":"1","title":"same applys with all the other albums--\\"no pads....just CRAP\\"","review":"Ok, Simple Plan, is simply don't buy it. They may play their own instruments, but that doesn't mean they are great. Their album names are lame and not creative at all. it sucks, really. there are so many other bands out there to listen too. i don't seem enthralled with this band, i don't think they have much to work with. also they play on TRL so much, which is not such a acomplishment. They aren't really that 'punk-rock'.. come on. with those dumb titles?! really, get serious. real punk rockers would puke all over this. they'd be ashamed. if you like them, well you do, but i sure don't. check out other bands, and maybe you'll find this CD, eventually.. getting to the back of that shelf of yours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only you can save yourself from this piece of ....","review":"2 Stars if i hate it this much?Well the reason being that \\"Perfect is a good song.But the rest is very deluded and dull.Angst is better left to people who can actually sing like Avril.I'm sick of these punk-prodigys to Green Day.Blink is alright but the rest are hopelessly s...Don't fall for this useless garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple Plan are Annoying!","review":"This is one of THE most annoying abnds I have ever heard...in fact, it may truly be the worst I have ever heard. \\"Addicted\\" is horrible, the lead singer has the worst, most whiny voice I have ever heard.

Much in the book is such an on-target description of what is happening today. The following thoughts of Doremus are eerily close to our present day leader.\\"The one thing that most perplexed him was that there could be a dictator seemingly so different from the fervent Hitlers and gesticulating Fascists and Caesars with laurels round bald domes; a dictator with something of the earthy American sense of humor of a Mark Twain, a George Ade, a Will Rogers, and Artemus Ward. Windrip could be ever so funny about solemn jaw-drooping opponents, and about the best method of training what he called 'a Siamese flea hound.' Did that, puzzled Doremus, make him less or more dangerous?Then he remembered the most cruel-mad of all pirates, Sir Henry Morgan, who had thought it ever so funny to sew a victim up in wet rawhide and watch it shrink in the sun.\\"Yes, it can happen here."},{"rating":"2","title":"It CAN Happen Here!","review":"A chilling account, set in the depression era of the 1930's, of a feasible route to totalitarianism in the U.S. Well written, as expected of Sinclair Lewis, but not nearly as famous as Main Street and other works.

In this case, a Fascist dictatorship is legally elected and chaos ensues. The characters are caricatures (by design) and the heroes likewise -- it ends up being an allegory like \\"Vanity Fair\\" or similar.That said, the writing is pretty good, and some of the ideas are interesting.

It made me want to take a shower and read Rand's Atlas Shrugged and The Fountainhead all over again.

People still somehow have to hate/punish those that can produce and create wealth.It Can't Happen Here seems to be such an alcohol-fueled kaleidoscope of inconsequential, tongue-in-cheek, sarcastic detail as to cause this reader to glaze over page after page at what I had just read and wonder why it was even written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my first or last choice - under the right conditions I'd use again","review":"Slow to ship, slow shipping (media mail), over charged for slow shipping (charged more than priority shipping rate for media mail), and book was not in as good a quality as advertised.

No clear evidence of this as there are no stamps that say belongs to \\"X\\" library, but the first page is cut. This dramatically reduces the value of the book.

Don't give him too much credit though. He seems to have directly based all of his ideas for the takeover of America on the subversion of the Weimar Republic. The book as literature is okay, but it is NOT Shakespeare. I would still highly recommend reading this, if for no other reason, for the sake of having said you read it.The reviewers who drew a parallel to Modern America clearly never read any material about facism. There are many books that detail the horrors of a totalitarian regime.

Inconvience but it works."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly suggested reading","review":"\\"It Can't Happen Here\\" begins slowly, introducing the narrative's characters and setting in a very meticulous fashion. It will seem ponderous in pace to more casual readers, with little besides political foreshadowing to hold interest. However, with the ascension of the villain around page 100 begins the \\"meat\\" of the work: quickly the narrative transforms into a visceral, terrifying experience. The reader's patience is rewarded with a story that engages you on an emotional level beyond most novels today.As far as dystopia-themed works go, this ranks number one on my list. The characters, environment, and interactions are believable. Man isn't utterly defeated and hope isn't totally extinguished, but the notions of \\"liberty\\" and \\"progress\\" have been taken down a few notches. In such a world, the characters do their best (or worst).If your attention holds beyond the introduction, you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be Careful What You Wish For...","review":"This is one of the most unusual offerings from novelist Sinclair Lewis. Unlike many of his previous books, it was written in great haste and the subject matter is exclusively related to electoral politics. In some respects, the material is dated, unlike other totalitarian nightmare novels like \\"1984\\" and \\"Brave New World,\\" because it is set in a fixed place and time. The election in contest is that of 1936 and the question to be answered is whether or not voters weary of the Great Depression are prepared to sacrifice individual liberties and accept fascist dictatorial rule.Given the political climate in the contemporary USA, this warning from the past still seems relevant today. Too many people seem willing to follow the Pied Piper rather than asking questions and making difficult choices."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good one if you're just getting into Cajun music.","review":"Probably one of the most listenable Cajun CD I've heard.

While some of what he says is true, his descriptions of people in the company is cruel and insensitive. He describes one of the best journalists in the computer industry as \\"a drawf in a wheelchair\\" I believe. And he belittles the founders of CMP, Gerry and Lilo Leeds, for the crime of being old. They've accomplished more than Wolff ever could dream of. But, I suppose he has a family to feed, too, and the only way to do it is to insult, offend, draw caricatures instead of real people. One thing I will say for all the people at CMP involved in Netguide in the early days--they were trying, and sure they made mistakes. But so what? Everyone screws up. May Wolff be able to retire on the royalties of his book, or live off his lawyer wife. One sure thing--ain't nobody gonna want to be *his* business partner. Burn those bridges, Mike!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SOAP OPERA","review":"Burn Rate has the same kind of appeal as the Jerry Springer Show. Readers are only educated to the extent that they learn that it's bad to lie, cheat, and steal, and that people who make a habit of doing these things (especially if they lack good business sense) are likely to run into difficulties. It's nice that Wolff is able to work through his failures by writing a story in which he projects his negative feelings onto all of his peers and ex-associates. Unfortunately, the book lacks pathos, so it's a bit less gripping than other forms of therapeutic expression. I have to admit that I was entertained by the clever caricatures of everyone Wolff lied to, swindled, and stepped on in his fruitless quest for a quick buck. But if you want to learn something useful about business or entrepreneurship, read books written by the investors and entrepreneurs who succeeded."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious, Insightful, and Horrifying","review":"I know this world - I've spent the past ten years in technology marketing. And I've never read anything that described it in quite the forthright manner that Mr Wolff does.His anecdotal portraits of the 'players', including himself, are refreshing, and frankly, horrifying. It's amazing what you can get used to when you are confronted with it every day, and this book was an excellent way to stand outside the internet world and look back at it through the eyes of one of these players.I can understand his nearly overwhelming urge to projectile-vomit at yet another presentation to 'vulture' capitalists. And his discussion of the 'art of the deal' is brilliant.And jeez, if Rageboy thought it was good it must have something going for it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"BURN RATE","review":"Who hasn't read this book?

Burn Rate reveals Wolff's petulant nature, and documents his downward spiral into a money-grubbing loss of integrity. His tale tries to drag everyone he met during his push for IPO down with him, making this a pathetic and depressing read."},{"rating":"1","title":"The book is overrated","review":"As a writer, Mr. Wolff certainly has the ability to tell a story. However, his definitions of \\"media business\\", \\"communication business\\", \\"technology business\\" and so on are inconsistent and problematic. No wonder he didn't know where his comany was headed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little dippy","review":"While I don't know the whole story, Wolff seems to have a lot of experience, and little business smarts. Heck, from the few descriptions of his wife, SHE seems to have more business smarts. This is certainly an interesting, well-written book (he's a writer after all,) but the fact that he drove himself to near insanity as well as bankruptcy all in the name of pure greed leaves me feeling this book has no real point other than \\"How I wanted to get rich, or die tryin!\\" He described endless begging for money, which seems to be the central point of the book. You will find an interesting set of stories here, but the message is a rather shallow one if there is one at all. But then I guess that was the point of most of the internet bubble as a whole."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read, Well Written","review":"The best reason to read this book is that it is very well written. The author isn't really a techie, he's a writer, and it shows. It's also nice to read a business book that is so personalized. You see his internal reactions to the various oversized egos and assholes and the people in the industry who just don't know what the hell they're doing. His picture of the venture capitalists was especially vivid. Some of the scenes, like the dealmaking attempts, were just gripping, and his description of dealing with AOL was almost surreal. It makes you wonder how AOL can actually operate as a business, they're so weird and flaky. A really good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nightmares from this book","review":"Two themes- early technology and dealmaking. The intensity of the latter left me with nightmares, I felt very real and believable. Gently and ever so politely squeezing each others sensitive body parts eyeball to eyeball until someone blinks.Reminiscent of dealing with a relative with whom you have significant areas of conflict- like war there are no ultimate winners only richer and poorer losers. The almost total lack of predictability of the Internet future is amazing. Overall entertaining and informative."},{"rating":"2","title":"WHAT A STORY","review":"This is certainly the best book I've read about the Internet industry and probably one of the best business books I've read ever. You can't put it down and you laugh out loud (truly) many time a chapter. The interesting thing is how much controversy this book his inspired--because in its way it's not controversial at all. It's just an incredibly good story. Even the terrible things Wolff supposedly says about people are really more comic than anything else. My guess is that there is just so little objectivity and self-awaresness and skepticism in the Internet business that one a honest point of view comes along people freak. Anyway this is not a book that anybody who is interestesting in technology, money, business, and the general state of American culture and American writing is going to want to miss. Also, if you just want several hours of cough-up-your-coke laughter, try it. I guarantee: you'll wish you had written it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wolff's Dunciad","review":"As someone who works online for a large and lumbering giant I found Michael Wolff's account of the rise and fall or Wolff New Media hilarious and poignant. I recognised many of the types, and even more of the lines they used.All around this business there are people who are asking themselves the central question he poses (and getting depressed by the reply). Is the web media? Only partly. Is it communications? Only partly. But content is expensive, chat is cheap.In the 1720s, appalled by the explosion in the print media and the grim quality of most of what was being published, Alexander Pope wrote The Dunciad, denouncing all the Dunces - the incompetent poets and pamphleteers of the day. Wolff is like Pope - amazed and revolted by the birth of a new mass (communications) medium which has empowered the hucksters, shysters and illiterates of the world. In the eighteenth century the poets and the printers survived. And so did Pope."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enormously Entertaining Literary Journalism","review":"Burn Rate does for the Internet what Liar's Poker did for Wall Street in the Eighties. It strips away the sheen of self-righteous assurance that most Net entrepreneurs wrap around themselves, and shows that there are, in fact, real, living breathing human beings involved in this business, not automatons who believe they've excised the baser instincts from their souls...Like several of the other reviewers here, I too have met many of the characters in Burn Rate, and I can tell you that Wolff's portraits of everyone I know hit the bullseye squarely in the center. If you want to laugh out loud and find out what it's _really_ like inside the Net industry, read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story.

There is more to the Internet than how it is commercialized. If there are NO businesses on the Internet in the future, it still is going to be important. Since Wolff never get's beyond Television asumptions, he overlooks some of the most interesting things that Internet has to offer in Many to Many communication: the regular guy is just as accessable as the huge corporation. The regular guy can probably make money EASIER than the big corporation. There is more to life than being the organization man..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a donkey","review":"The book seems to spend more time on lampooning its curious cast of characters than actually explaining the Internet economy or how startups work. If you listen to Wolff too closely, you'll end up thinking that starting a company consists mainly in begging for money. I was pretty amazed at how consistently disgusting his reasoning is. He maligns everyone he comes in contact with for being greedy and stupid, but by the end of the book you can see that he is the best example of both. Somewhat interesting for its insight into how even successful startups are often going from day to day trying to figure out how to make payroll. In the end, though, I think a lot of books provide more insight while annoying less."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've Been Telling All My Friends About This MOVIE!","review":"Rented this off of Netflix and loved it.

Add it all up and you have yet another painful addition to the growing list of gay movies with potential that just aren't executed well at all.

Including ALL of the motion pictures, I find this movie to be extremely boring. The special effects were very good, and all, but the movie was very slow, and the script was to me, not a Kirk's \\"Star Trek\\" script! I would not recommend this movie. I purchased this on VCR when it first came out after watching it, I was let down by what I saw."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING","review":"I hadn't seen this movie in about 15 years and really couldn't remember why I didn't like it before. I bought this hoping that I would be surprised and enjoy the movie. I like all the star trek movies except for this one. It puts me to sleep when i watch it. It is bogged down with all the special effects they experimented with on this movie. The shots in outer space are just too long and should have been cut down. It seems like there are moments in the movie that last near 10 minutes with no dialog, but just the crew looking and reacting to what they see in space. VERY BORING. The dvd is nicely done with plenty of extras including deleted scenes, some of which would have made the movie more fun if included. Don't waste your time with this movie, buy one of the other star trek movies instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"The one that broke the mold","review":"Although criticized by many for being slow, I find the pace just right for the story, and it helps to convey the sense of unknown.Visual effects hold up well, and the score is one of the best ever written by Jerry Goldsmith.Robert Wise has done a good job in finally completing the film, adding visual effects and completing the sound mix.Worth a view, but don't expect an action film. This is an intelligent film, not a Star Wars clone."},{"rating":"2","title":"We've Witnessed A Birth!","review":"\\"Star Trek The Motion Picture\\" is always harshly criticised for being bland and lacking in action,but that's not whatStar Trek is all about.The first Star Trek movie is a STORY-it's about an Earth space probe that merges with a machinelifeform and itself comes to life.But still it wishes to returnto Earth to join with it's creator.Even if along the way 'V'Ger'destroys a few spaceships and \\"absorbes\\" two Enterprise crewmembers it's inttentions are good.Most of the movie revolves around the Enterprise's journey through the emmence V'ger vessel and the problems it encounters.So it's the only Trekmovie that's rated G-it comes off as more dialog then actionbut for those with an open mind and an interest in greatstories this will be for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Colorless, uninteresting resumption of the Star Trek legacy","review":"Take an original Star Trek episode and draw it out to three times the usual length, take away the humor, throw in some post-Star wars special effects, and finally add in some uninteresting new characters, and there you have it \\"Star Trek - The Motion Picture\\".Admittedly there is some initial fun in seeing the old crew back after a ten year hiatus but this fun drains away pretty quickly. Long, boring and colorless - right down to the drab production design - even fans will struggle to sit through this one. You get the feeling that director Robert Wise was so conscious of being respectful of the material that he ended up embalming it. If this review is not warning enough, this film has been recut twice all to no avail."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT Star Trek!","review":"Oh, yeah, the enhanced scenery was nice, in some cases even better than the original, but for a long-time Star-Trek fan like me, this version (The Director's Edition) has one modification that totally ruined it. One of the scenes in the all important climax, the one where Decker remarks: \\"But of course! We all create God in our own image.\\" was dropped from this version, no doubt in deference to the more pious consumers. Now this remark was not gratuitous, it was the main moral message and lesson of the entire adventure and an intrinsic aspect of the Star Trek phenomenon which made it (Star Trek) what it is today.Dropping those two lines from the movie changed it from a deeply significant work to just another shaggy-dog story. Boo! Mr. Director. I will hunt down and buy the original cut, thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"So totally worth the money","review":"Once you say that THIS is the version of the movie the director really wanted...what else is there?Re-mastered audio, special effects added to MATCH the original 1979 version(so they don't ruin the continuity), and the first damn time you could buy it in a decent format(sorry LD owners), full running commentary by the director and hours of documentaries.I own over 200 DVD's; and I must say that this is one of the few that has lived up to my expectations of what a DVD can be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why ruin a good film?","review":"I was very upset That some of the dialog was cut from the directors edition and also the computers voice in the background. I thought it made it sound more like what life really would be like on a starship. I wish they would just release a copy of the original cut of the movie. Most of the rework on this really didn't make much of a difference. I guess I'll be forced to buy a foriegn VCD copy in order to get the original cut. Not worth the wait or the hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"eh","review":"only saw it once a long time ago, but i recall that it moved very slow and didn't seem to draw me in. i guess that's why they took such a long time to put this one out on dvd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have the fast forward button ready...","review":"If you actually buy this movie: be aware that an enormous amount of time will be wasted seeing gratuitous special effects. Five minutes to see William Shatner being beamed up, probably an hour's worth of shots of the Enterprise moving through V'Ger's cloud, and scenes (the wormhole one for example) added on just for the sake of special effects! Yes, there is a story here, but you'll probably fall asleep before you get there."},{"rating":"2","title":"BETTER THAN YOU MIGHT THINK","review":"Although fans seem split over the issue of the Enterprise crew coming upon a 20th Century piece of space hardware, this first foray to the silver screen marks one of the best Star Trek's ever.

I remember being horribly bored, with pictures of taking \\"forever\\" cruising around the new Enterprise, showing me how \\"ooh\\",\\"ahh\\",\\"pretty\\", the new Enterprise was. And showing me \\"look how much like Star Wars we are\\" special effects. I vowed at that time that I would never watch this boring thing again. When this DVD version came out, I had heard it was supposed to have been improved. I figured, \\"OK, I'll give it another chance.\\" Well, this did a great job of reminding me why I vowed I'd never watch this thing again. It's still as boring, for all the same reasons, as it was 22 years ago. Yawn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Trek: The Motion Picture - The Directors Edition","review":"'Star Trek: The Motion Picture' is my favorite Star Trek movie. This 'Directors Edition' improves the film a great deal. The new special effects bring Robert Wise's vision of 'The Motion Picture' to life. Nothing has been done to defeat the original purpose of the film.Additions include a new soundtrack, restored image, computer generated images (certain scenes), deletion of some scenes, and a different color scheme to the credits.Special Features go in-depth on the new Director's Edition, how the film came to life in 1979 and what Robert Wise wanted to change in order to make the film as it was intended to be. Also included are deleted scenes and rare storyboards.Finally after 22 years 'Star Trek: The Motion Picture' is finished! This DVD needs to be in your DVD library! To do otherwise would be illogical!"},{"rating":"1","title":"First the worst!","review":"Ok so this movie has been enhanced with new special effects, and features intriguing extras. The film has also been edited in places, which does make \\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture- The Director's Edition\\" alot more watchable than the original. However, the movie still ... It is way too slow. Obviously if you're a Star Trek fan you're going to get all the movies to complete your collection. But to you Star Trek fans, be honest with yourselves, the movie is just boring. I suggest you buy it to compliment your collection, and watch it, the commentaries and the extra features once, before storing it away until \\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture- The Real Short Version\\" comes out. The only really positive thing I can say about \\"Star Trek: The Motion Picture\\", is that it did lead to \\"Star Trek II: The Wrath Of Khan\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Trek: The Motion Picture Cool Huh?","review":"Hey all you Star Trek Fans! I loved this movie and I'm not really even I star Trek fan really. It was well thought out, and the characters were very believeable. I only rented it because I like Stephen Collins and I rent every movie he's in in fact, I rent every movie that every cast member of 7th Heaven has been in. In this movie in case you don't know him, he played Captain/Comander Willard. Great Guy! Also, I took away one star because the picture quality was crummy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Nice Try","review":"Over all I was disappointed with this Director's Cut of the film. While the remixing of the soundtrack was an imporvement (the addition of the classic bridge sounds was an especally nice touch), I found it un-necessary to edit or \\"shorten\\" any of the scenes from the 1979 theatrical release, and the story once again suffers from the lack of plot explanation scenes from the 1983 television version. Further the replacement in the soundtrack of several background effects (the original computer warning \\"red alert\\" system is replaced with the serine from the original series) is awkward at best. While the new special effects shots were a nice touch they add little to the overall feel of the film. I still find I enjoy the 1983 \\"Special Edition\\" (yes, even with the scene of Kirk on the set) best. My ratting: A for intentions but a C for overall effect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Picture","review":"I liked tis version done over in 2000 with added scenes and remastered images, i.e. Vejur External scenery.

This 40 million dollard movie is full of speckes and scratches all along. The restored scenes are fine the sound is very good, but the rest looks like an old \\"BETA\\" print!! I also wonder why the Klingon battle music theme was cut at the beginning?? The score is one of the most beautiful score ever written for a movie, why cut it? Most of the scenes that were added for the TV version are cut. Weren't those scenes requested by the fans at that time? I would have liked both versions on the same DVD. Look at Fox's ABYSS and ID4, and what about the French track?? I guess I was expecting too much! I'm very disappointed and Paramount's DVD's are still too expensive."},{"rating":"2","title":"A science-fiction adventure worthy of anyone's DVD collection","review":"I ordered this on November 8th, it just arrived yesterday, and let me began by saying, this film was AWESOME! The special effects seemed a bit dated by today's starndards, buy they were nonetheless, impressive. The film does have a bit of a slow pace though, and if you're not a fan of Star Trek, you probably wouldn't like it. I can't comment on the DVD extras because I haven't watched them yet. Directed by Robert Wise, this film marked the return of Star Trek after a 10 year hiatus. I highly recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the case","review":"I bought this dvd and am very dispointed in the case the first discs hub is missing a tab a the top so the discs comes out very easy and it scratches it up every time.

This was the worst of the \\"Star Trek\\" films simply due to the fact that it's extremely dull. I've tried to watch it a few times over the past 10 years or so and come dangerously close to falling asleep each time-I'm not exaggerating.The films special effects (which the film relied too much on) and musical score are astounding, however. If it weren't for those 2 elements, I would only give the film one star. The first 30 minutes are entertaining, but from there it goes straight downhill. Despite all of \\"Star Trek V\\"'s flaws, at least it wasn't boaring as \\"TMP\\" was.I do plan to purchase the film on DVD solely due to the fact that I want to see the theatrical trailer. I really enjoy those. Too bad \\"Generations\\" didn't have one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, boring, not charming","review":"I am a longtime Star Trek fan, but this movie is a real snoozer. There is virtually no action in this film. There's no moral force acting in the plot, and the film doesn't bother to even speculate what meaning the ending has. Admiral Kirk is depicted as connivingly seizing command of the Enterprise, then incompetently commanding. Spock is shown with zero personality. Whatever sex appeal the movie might have had was tossed out the window when they shaved Ilia's head. If you don't believe me on how bad this film is, just go read its entry in W1kipedia. The actors hated the script, the costumes, and had no camraderie. The only saving grace of the film is that it was clearly the inspiration forGalaxy Quest."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Could (Should) Have Been","review":"Timing is everything.The snarls and delays in getting the screenplay from paper to film made the journey for this picture very difficult; there was this \\"little\\" movie made - Star Wars - that revolutionized the Sci-Fi genre and placed a heavy premium on visual effects.So, what appeared to be a trade-off with a major part of the Star Trek TV series - the dialogue of the actors - was jettisoned for visuals that looked impressive, but looked to be playing catch-up to Darth and his pals.The Director's Cut shows what should have been and is a very satisfying mixture of visuals and the personal touch by the cast. This is where the motion picture journey should have began and it was well worth the wait."},{"rating":"1","title":"Star Trek: the special LONGER cut","review":"(this does not refer to the DVD director's edition edit)One of the most popular tv shows of it's time(and one of the most popular movie franchises) Star Trek: the movie is a winner. This slow-paced scifi flick maybe hard to watch if your one of those desparate viewers who won't wait forever something to happen(or boring as heck). Granted Star Trek is worth it down to the final climax, this 12 minutes of more footage is not needed! It is long as it is and it needs to be cut down to 2hrs or shorter!This movie does have a lot of pausing and a lot of scenes where they are \\"hoing and aweing\\" at the special effects for 7 mins or so. Some movies need longer cuts,but obviously Star Trek didn't.(2 1/2 stars actually)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Uhm, I liked the original better","review":"The extras are great, lots of material there. Most of the revisions in this version are good additions, too. There are just some moments where I think the original cut was better. Particularly the formation of the bridge between the Enterprise and V-Ger. The new version is just too long. Most all the other additions were good, though. I'd like an original version of the movie on DVD all the same.

Paramount they just love milking the costumers. Hey Paramount try having both versions don't be like George Lucas."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Beginning of The Trek Movies...","review":"Some people regard STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE as a boring, and rather dull feature film. However, I feel that this is a great film, and the pacing may be slower than other Trek movies, but this has all the ingredients for a potentially great Trek movie. The only thing missing from this particular movie is more action (meaning, more ship-to-ship battles). But otherwise, this slow-burner is imaginative, intelligent, and remarkable in the visual effects department. And, more so in this updated version, the special effects are even better. Plus, you've got the thoroughly enjoyable cast from the original series and some newcomers aboard.STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE is a good movie, as long as you are willing to have patience to watch it, carefully, and to realize that in the end, you can easily see why now 9 other movies have followed in the steps of the one that started it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shatner and the Whole Original Trek Cast Are Back","review":"This new Director's Cut claims to embody director Robert Wise's original vision for this film, and I believe it holds true to that claim. Every version of this film is excellent, but the quality possessed by this particular DVD version is the most impressive. The special features contained on disc two of this set are also worth looking in to.BOTTOM LINE: The price is right for this stunning flashback to the late '70's. Also, if you own other versions, hang on to them, they're cool, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"A DULL MOVIE FOR EVEN A STAR TREK FILM","review":"I thought STAR TREK THE MOTION PICTURE was too long and drawn out. I mean I liked seeing KIRK, MCCOY, and SPOCK and all the rest of the original series characters but I didn't get the whole VY'GER storyline and the action in this film takes too long to appear in the film. Anyway see STAR TREK II instead you'll like it a lot better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good beginning","review":"I hadn't watched this movie for a while but when I picked it back up, I remembered why I love Star Trek. The plot may be a little hoky and the special effects aren't as sharp and stunning as today's special effects, but its a good story and brings the crew back in style. Personally I like some of the cheesiness of Star Trek and I think so of the cliches make it work well. Its a story filled with comradery, dedication, and adventure...definitely worth seeing."},{"rating":"1","title":"This One Was Too Long","review":"Maybe if it were cramped into 1-1/2 hours it would have been better. Ok yeah the inside of V'Ger like cloud was pretty, I guess, if you like scenic tours. But they spent too much time with that in the movie, then followed by what seemed like wasting time till the final 10 minutes of the movie. The beginning of the film is great, seems to have a fast paced move to it, but it slows down way too much after halfway. This is the least favorite Star Trek film of mine, but I guess since it was made in '79, it not so bad. But Star Wars was in '77, and look how good they did. So I guess this one's not too great. If you love Star Trek, like me, you'll still watch it. If you are new to Star Trek, skip this film and go onto the 2nd film."},{"rating":"1","title":"A dull plodder.","review":"Astonished humans watch as three Klingon battle cruisers are destroyed in a huge cloud which is on a direct course to Earth. And so James T.Kirk and crew are sent to deal with the threat.Unfortunately, for most of this film very little happens. It seems to be aimed more at '2001' fans than 'Star Trek' fans. The characters are rarely allowed to show character and some of the dialogue is pretty stupid ('it disappeared down what they used to call a black hole'). Who exactly talks like that?Good special effects and a wonderfully atmospheric score save this film from being a one-star. Thank goodness the makers of Star Trek 2 onwards knew what the series was supposed to be about."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wanted it to be good. Dear God, I wanted it to be good...","review":"A long time ago, in a galaxy far, far away...The STAR WARS phenomena took off in 1977. At that time, STAR TREK: PHASE II was in early design for the television return of the Starship Enterprise. Welp, STAR WARS was the biggest movie of all time at that time, and the powers at Paramount Pictures decided that STAR TREK would be a movie.What no one remembered was what WAS STAR TREK? In the 1960s, STAR TREK was the voyages of the Starship Enterprise. It was the expanding of the human knowledge and wisdom, and it was a mirror on our society. STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE is none of this.We're treated to so many beauty shots of the newly re-fitted Enterprise, that there are actually whole passages where you can go buy popcorn and not miss anything. STAR TREK in the 60s was also action-adventure. This movie is sssssslllllllloooooowwwwwwww, about 45 minutes too long. Luckily, there are more STAR TREK incarnations to watch that are much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"The ship, alien innards, and 5 minutes of lousy plot","review":"What a disappointment.

They took out a half-hour of dialogue, including a sub-plot essential to the end of the movie and put in a bunch of half-finished special effects shots. It actually makes the movie look cheesier to update the FX. (In one case, half the background is gone! Kirk & McCoy are talking in his quarters, and instead of leaving in the original where the camera cuts back and forth to each of their faces, they took a shot of both of them standing facing each other from 20 min later in the movie and dropped it on the scene. Lame, yes, but what's worse is that the bottom half of the wall is gone! Cummon. They butchered this movie. Just get a VHS copy of it and burn it to DVD. Do yourself a favor.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"2001 A Space Odyssey Meets Star Trek","review":"This film has no conflict whatsoever, excepting a few mean looks exchanged between Decker and Captain Kirk over who's in command over their ship. No jokes are made throughout the movie at all. A paper thin plot goes along with a rousing score and tons of shots of spaceships SLOWLY floating around. There were so many unnecessary, boring, and stupid scenes in the movie that it could have been squashed into a 51 minute episode EASILY. \\"Veeger\\" is a MYSTERIOUS UNKNOWN OBJECT HEADED STRAIGHT FOR EARTH! In all actuality, Veeger is just a bunch of BAD special effects. Going into \\"warp speed\\" looks as thouhgh it was ANIMATED (and it probably was). I was on the edge of my seat ONCE during a particularly good scene. Namely, the ending. That's why there is one star, its for the ending.

Okay, so it might please fans of 2001, but as somebody who enjoyed the original Star Trek series I was bored rigid. The special effects are faultless, true, and there is a superbly ominous soundtrack, but nothing much actually happens for most of the film. And some of the dialogue is pretty silly - \\"It disappeared down what they used to call a black hole\\". Who talks like that?Fans of special effects or 2001-type science-fiction might enjoy this, but fans of the Star Trek series would be better off watching 'Wrath of Khan' onwards."},{"rating":"1","title":"sllllllllllllllooooooooooooooooowwwwwww...........","review":"The problem with this film is that they expand an episode's worth of material into an entire film--and a LONG film at that. The previous reviewer is wrong--it's not a matter of being too action-oriented to accept a more cerebral plot; it's simply the film's appalling sense of pace. The endless panoramic views (the opening, panning around the ship, takes, I kid you not FIFTEEN MINUTES), while somewhat interesting in their own right, do not exactly make for riveting viewing. With some decisive editing, this could have been a decent hour-long feature, but as it is it just meanders interminably. Worth seeing for die-hards, but not for ordinary civilians."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"this film has some very good special effects,but the film goes on way too long,is very dull,and lots of times the camera tends to focus on special effects,just for the sake of showing off all the effects they created. if this film wasn't so long,it might have been passable entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-indulgent effects show with minimal plot and acting.","review":"This is BY FAR the worst thing to come out under the Star Trek name - and I'm counting the cheesy original show! This movie went far too long with far too little reason to. The effects may have been cool in the 70's, but they aren't now. Even that would be fine if there was some interesting plot to back it up, but there isn't. With maybe one funny part in the whole movie (which is bad for a usually pretty funny series), this needs to be put on display in a museum, not rented out for home use. You have far better things to do with your time. If you want some good Star Trek, check out 'Wrath of Khan', 'Voyage Home', \\"Undiscovered Country', or 'Genesis'. The new ones are good too - especially 'Insurrection'."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought the original was boring","review":"I remember the film moving slow, but I was almost in a coma by the end. There was just not enough of story to warrant two hours for this film. So, we see long static shots of the Enterprise and space that do not move the story.The acting was even worse. Part of the reason this film dragged so much is that the director and the actor's did not build the tension of their impending doom. It is hard to get caught up in the chance of them all dying when the actors are just like it's any other day at the office.Don't get me wrong. I love most of the other Star Trek movies, but this one is just a major dissapointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"The movie that sank like the Titanic","review":"This movie sank like the Titanic. The first 50 minutes were good. Then you start saying to yourself, \\"What am I doing in front of the TV?\\" The movie spent too much time inside the alien (V'Ger): It spent about 80 minutes in the alien. The problem was that they had nothing to do in that time segment.When they tried to pull two people from the transporter (including the new science officer). When they said the people were going into final form, or something like that, you say, \\"Oh, wow. That's nice.\\"So basically, I don't think it was a good first movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"What, no 0?","review":"I mean it, I give this film a zero. It's dull, it's silly, it's meaningles, it's long and it's boring. The biggest film of 1979? Better off watching Time After Time. The film goes nowhere fast and ends with some of TOS dialog, but it's to little to late. I don't care what people say about the Final Frontier, this movie is worse.

Also, unlike the Star Wars Special Editions, the enhanced effects really DO improve the movie. I now realize what all the visuals actually are! All in all, definitely the best version made of this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's the plot, the sub-plots, etc","review":"The magic of this film, the story, is not the terrible direction, the horrible lighting, but the depth of the story. The plot is simple, go to V'Ger before it obliterates Earth, but on the way, we meet up with the main crew. Why did Kirk steal command of the ship from Commander Decker and what problems did that cause? Doc McCoy was re-drafted into service and Spock re-joined but for what reason? Sure, STTMP borrowed from previous Star Trek episodes, but what made this movie good was the interaction of the crew, the sub-plots running all over the place. I urge people to begin to really watch this movie and see just how full it is. Then you will ignore some of the problems of this movie. By all means, the longer version is better, filling out details left out of the original movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Star Trek - The Motion Pictor","review":"This is the WORST Star Trek movie EVER made. Don't waste your time or money on this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Star Trek: More Garbage","review":"Why does Star Trek even exist? Many people claim it as a life, but if you need this tripe for a life, you don't really deserve whatever satisfaction you get from watching movies this bad. This movie never goes anywhere. The approximate running time feels about 5 days. There are only interminable plot machinations intermingled with simple special effects. Melies could have done better with the effects. Even for people like Trekkies, this movie is a stretch. I say that even with an incredibly low regard for Trekkies. This movie has taken hours of my life that I can never have back. For that I say, damn you and your girdle Shatner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not interesting at all...","review":"most interesting part of movie:I honestly cant think of any.Why is it that when I watch this movie I can think of several star trek episodes which could have been redone to take it's this movies place??"},{"rating":"1","title":"blah","review":"This movie is too long with too many slow scenes in it. The later Star Trek movies are much better than this first one. This one nearly put me to sleep, it was so long and boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missing Lines and Missing Sound","review":"I think this movie is old enough now that if you are buyng it, you know what you are getting. As an editorial review I find this version as close to the original as I have found with better effects. There were lines I remembered as a kid that I was starting to think I dreamt up since I never heard them again until this version.My real problem here was that there were lines that you could see belonged but the sound was absent. Most notably was the transporter accident where Kirk asks Starfleet if they got them. There is only dead air where the response line belongs then Kirk offers his condolenses. There are other instances I noticed and probably a few I did not but dead air on a DVD is just sloppy. I doubt it is just my DVD as they are all printed from the same files so I wonder who else out there has noticed. It really ruined a dramatic moment and took me out of the movie. I am returning my copy and will wait for the next attempt."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have but Not Must See","review":"I like this movie much more than the movie I saw in the theater in 1979.It makes more sense. It looks better.It is still not very good Star Trek.And so I am giving it a 5 Star rating only because it fills in a part of the archaeological record of Star Trek, not because it is an inherently good film.Call me low brow, but Robert Wise erred when he decreed that Star Trek, The Motion Picture was a \\"MOOVIE\\" and not a television episode.I wanted the old music. I wanted the old sets. I wanted the old action. I wanted excitement.STTMP was a boring movie, ponderous in its irrelevancy.But without this, there would be nothing else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Star Trek: The Motion Picture","review":"This movie is the second worst in all the other Star Trek films. There was absolutely no character development throughout the entire movie. Also, there was way to many dead air scences. For example Kirk is comunicating with Star Fleet and Kirk asks Star Fleet a question. Then there's a few seconds of silence and then Kirk answers back without the audience ever hearing anything Star Fleet said. That's just an example of poor edidting folks. I'm glad this is the only true terrible movie(besides Star Trek V) in the francise. Still, this movie did not have any major efffect in changing my love of Star Trek. I will always be a big fan. And as always... Live long and prosper."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING AS HELL.","review":"Besides the intro attack with the Klingons and the outstanding march Goldsmith had to offer, this movie stank. How many minutes of weird nothingness going by do we have to see? The audio dubbing was horrible as well. And was that purple eye shadow on Mr. Spock? Yikes.It was a movie made for desperate Trekkies sick of the reruns. Of course it was a hit, what else was there for these guys?And I say this as a Trekkie as well. Forget this waste. Wrath of Khan and First Contact are much better. Get this movie only if you suffer from insomnia."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Epic Sci-Fi Film!!!","review":"I have owned this movie for years, but tonight I finally watched it all the way through after seeing the new Star Trek film! (That's another review for another time) I loved the great special effects and imagery. I still haven't seen the original series yet, but I may someday. After three Klingon ships are destroyed by an alien force, Starfleet asks the U.S.S. Enterprise to investigate it. They encounter an alien probe that takes Ilia and replaced by a robotic probe named V'ger. If you are a Trekkie, you'll love STAR TREK: THE MOTION PICTURE!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Correction:Star Trek - the SLOW MOTION picture","review":"The excellent effects and the haunting soundtrack are the only things really worth seeing this for. It's all very slow, aimless and more akin to 2001 than Star Trek. This is the series' first full-length film, and it's hardly a great debut."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so movie","review":"It's good to see the Star Trek characters, again. But this movie is WAY too long. Skip this one and see The Wrath of Khan instead!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for diehard star trek fans.","review":"It is amazing that this movie was the biggest movie of 1979. It is not very good and very confusing. Possibly the worst in the long series."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was an okay movie, but by no means the best.","review":"Star Trek: The Motion Picture was all dazzle and no substance. It lacked character development and warmth. It was visually stunning and technically facsinating. For a rainy day, watch the movie and guess how many times William Shatner's hair moves."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was downright BAD!!! I am sorry to say :(","review":"I am a huge Star Trek Fan 100%...but i am very sad to say that this film was disappointing. It was just downright BAD. Okay..maybe you might have a different opinion on the video, but i just fall asleep about 10 minutes after i put it on. The only part i like is when Spock makes a dramatic enterance onto the bridge. After i see that part, i just turn the movie off because i have more important things to do than waste my time watching a movie that is so boring, i fall asleep through the middle of it. Well, anyway...if i were you, i wouldn't waste my money on this video. No matter how big of a Star Trek Fan you can be..Believe me,you don't want it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Star Trek On Blu Ray At A Affordable Price.","review":"I've received my Star Trek Blu Ray on April 2nd on Saturday by DHL Global Mail. The movie played magnificently on my Samsung Blu Ray Player. The picture and sound quality is average not that good as I expected to be but because it's an imported disk there might be some differences between a USA Region 1 And Region Free Blu Ray Disk. The overall performance of the Blu Ray is quite good and I don't have any disagreements about it but I'm quite satisfied about this new product.Thank You Very Much.Mr. David King HuangSF, CA 94122."},{"rating":"2","title":"TOOOOOOOOO COOOOOOOOL!!!!","review":"this is not the best one but personally Star Trek rules and i am only 14 years old plus anything with Spock in it is the best, now i do not think he is hansome but he is tooooooooo coooooooool!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit long, but a classic for all Trekers","review":"Those of you who aren't BIG Star Trek fans may want to see ST:2 or 4, and then come back to this one. But for all those people that ARE big fans, like me, this is a classic and quite possibly the best. None of the other films seem to achieve the Star Trek feel the original series had quite as well as this one did.Some scenes do last a bit to long,though, and so the film suffers a bit from slight bordeom. But it has one of the best developed plots of all of the Trek films so far.The special effects and the music are brilliant! If you want to by the soundtrack, it has just been re-released.If you watch Star Trek ocasanally, this is about a three star film. But Like I said, a hard core Treker will love it. So I think it is well deserving of four stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really good, not as bad as people say it is","review":"Robert Wise was selected to direct this terrific (though a little stiff) feature-legnth outing for the Starship Enterprise.

As emacs is not available everywhere, I feel that it might be in one's best interest to learn a little about the vi editor. Under 200 pages, it is much easier to digest than most other texts, yet this book covers just about everything!

The reading/learning process went very quickly, leaving me with plenty of time to take a look at all those regular expressions..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This book got me through vi in such an incredibly short time, I couldn't believe it.

The language is clear and the exercises are practical."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite good -- if only there were more examples...","review":"First, I unequivocally recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn the vi editor used on UNIX and Linux systems. The book is well laid out and well written.There are, however, two things I think would make this good book even better: (1) step-by-step examples of some of the more complex vi techniques and (2) some on-line example files available from the O'Reilly Web site. On-line example files are employed to advantage by other O'Reilly books (O'Reilly's \\"sed & awk\\" comes immediately to mind). Providing some hands-on example files to work with would definitely help anyone using this book to learn the vi editor.Having said that, this book in its current form will teach you more than enough to use vi effectively. For those who are just starting to use vi to do real work, I'd also recommend acquiring the companion \\"vi Editor Pocket Reference.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Helps you discover the full power of VI.","review":"Although it is a little wordy, this book serves as an excellent resource for anyone wanting a FAST editor - expecially programmers. The power and speed of VI can be hidden behind its obscure user interface, but once you understand it you will never want to use another editor. The detachable quick reference card included in the back of the book is really nice to have. The coverage of VIs features is pretty thorough, even VI experts will be able to learn a thing or two from this well written book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best VI book yet","review":"I knew little about VI before reading this book, but I now i feel very comfortable using it. I like the layout and the fact that it has references and summaries all over the book. This is a book you will most likely use again and again. My only complaint were the chapters on advanced editing which were hard to understand if you are not versed in regular expressions (hence the 4 stars). Still, I learned much from this book, and hope you will too.

Its only drawback is that as others have noted, the product stinks (that's why it works so well). Probably for that reason, they changed to a foil packaging and in doing so, switched from three per package to one per package. While they changed their pricing, some distributors, like Ace Hardware are behind in changing their pricing. I ordered a season's supply of this three-pack, but they replaced it with the one refill per package. The effect was that they charged me over $5 each. I could have gone to Lowe's and bought a Rescue disposable fly trap with the attractant for $5. Don't order this until they show that they are only shipping the foil pack of one each and change their pricing.

Pearl Harbor is pounded by Japanese fighter planes. The American troops are unaware and lose several thousand air planes and a few ships. Later in the war America dropped two nuclear bombs on Japan ending the war in the Pacific. In Europe America had another problem. The Nazi's of Germany were killing Jews for no reason but hatred.

It covers everything from the recoded of the 761st tank unit, which has a combat recoded that will likely never be eclipsed, to the stories of people at Pearl Harbor, people who lived through the nearly forgotten \\"Zoot Suit Riots\\" and more.

By allowing a child to have the signing skills, they begin realizing that they are an individual entity that can ask another individual entity for something. The little brain neurons start firinging and producing the communication function sooner in a baby that has the tools to sign.We knew our daughter picked it up when, at around 11 months -- couldn't walk yet and couldn't speak -- Mom took our daughter out of the kitchen after dinner and they walked by me eating dinner. Our daughter started crying, and then signed \\"eat\\" (hand to mouth) \\"that\\" (pointing at my plate).

However, we were disappointed with the limited content of the book, and feel that a simple ASL dictionary or a class in ASL would be more helpful. I have found it difficult to implement ASL into my daily life w/my daughter as my hands are often full, both literally and figuratively. In addition, we are blessed to have a daughter who is very expressive and responsive and have found it fairly easy to communicate w/her and to anticipate her needs. Watching her efforts to communicate in her own ididsyncratic ways has been more enjoyable than trying to incorporate the sign language into our daily lives. Perhaps we will give it another try when she is a toddler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good overview but sometimes frustrating to read","review":"I like the format of the book. It explains many of the signs, how to use it, and when to introduce it. What I found somewhat frustrating was that in the drawings of Mr. Garcia doing the signs he used about 20 different arrows to denote hand movement. The problem with that is the legend for the arrows was in the middle of the book, not the beginning (so you were guessing for half the book) and it only explained three of the arrows. Most can be figured out but some you have to assume. You may want other resources to complement this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"ASL correct and lots of fun!","review":"I loved that this book was quick and easy to read, and came with many ASL signs relevant to babies/toddlers.

What I soon found was that ASL (American Sign Language) which is a great tool for the deaf community is too much for me to learn (I'm college educated, but I'm a new parent who has to work for a living!) However, there are other books out there (see Baby Signs) that are much more free, more intuitive and more supported with real research than this system is. You don't NEED to learn ASL with your baby, you and your baby can create your own language. Your baby is probably already teaching you one. Do they wave \\"bye bye\\"? do they raise their arms when they want to be lifted? Then they are creating their own wonderful, original sign language with you that will free you from all of this books charts and lists!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that great","review":"I purchased this book with hopeful expectations to teach my baby to sign. Unfortunately, my baby and I had lessons of frustration. This book is really too centered around ASL signs and does not account for the fact that babies will develop \\"Baby Signs\\". Just like we don't expect our child to say, \\"Bottle\\" and happily except \\"Ba Ba\\" instead, I think it's important to recognize that our babies' motor skills are not always developed enough to gesture the accurate ASL sign. However, another book, which was more helpful to me, was \\"Baby Signs\\". I think this is gentler approach to baby signing and is better suited to parents who just want a temporary bridge for communication until our babies can talk. BTW, it's interesting that Joseph Garcia has to quote the research of Goodwyn & Acredolo (the authors of Baby Signs). Something to think about...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sign With Your Baby","review":"Amazing results. My wife and I started to sign to our daughter at 3 months, Milk, Dog, Mom, Dad, Bright Light, and sleep. At 6 months old she was asking to be nursed without crying, at 8 months old she was communicting with us for food, drink, play, naps, diaper change, dog etc.. At one year she was using over 50 signs. Now that she is two, she speaks like a 6 year old, complete sentences, coherent conversations about a single topic, and is beginning to work out written words.Stick with the signing in the book for 3-4 months and watch your child's vocabulary explode before she's one.We also believe we avoided a very frustrating time for both us and our daughter by being able to communicate with her so early and telling us her needs and wants.Invest the $15, and stick with the program, it will amaze you and your family."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"My daughter requested this as a \\"stocking\\" present at Christmas because some friends of hers had such a good time teaching their baby to sign. She wanted to do the same thing. It works, and it's super-thrilling to watch your baby pick up signing. As an interractive activity with your child, you can't beat it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"I bought this book based on the reviews here. I wanted to start teaching my 6 month old some signs and wanted a basic book that taught me how to teach him. We started with the basic signs (milk, eat, more) at 6 months old. By 7 and a half months old my son gave me his first sign (milk). He hasn't done any more since (except for milk), but I think it will take more time and consistency. This book was very easy to read and was helpful in helping me with the basics. There are a TON of other signs in the back that I might not attempt, but it's good to know that they are there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Tool for Early Communication with your Baby","review":"This is a simple read with great potential. I had friends who recommened this early form of communication to me and I was somewhat skeptical. My babysitter had also taught her second child sign language and encouraged us to do the same. You don't see immediate results but if you stick with it you will be amazed. My daughter can pick up a new sign in a day now. I have recommended this to other friends who are having babies because of the upside benefits. It is well worth your time and effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit disappointed","review":"I was disappointed with this book. I expected to learn more. I probably would have benefited more by purchasing an American Sign Language book. It was also very overpriced considering one can get through the entire book within an hour.

This mop is a terrible disappointment. The mop head needs replacing after just a few uses. It's cheaply made and ineffective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very absorbent","review":"I have the newer version of this mop with the lever. At first glance it looks like a great design -- the rollers are flat and squeeze the sponge very tightly. The individual sponge fragments should theoretically give you more working surface and corners.Then they ruined it by putting in some of the least absorbent sponges I have ever seen. Seriously you can put this in a sink and it will float on top for 10 minutes or so without taking on water. You literally have to dunk it and wring/unwring it under the water to get any water out of your bucket.Scrubs great, but unless all you want to do is distribute the filth evenly around the floor, avoid this mop, or bring a second one that can actually get the water back up. But then, what's the point?"},{"rating":"2","title":"The structure of Yiddish","review":"Vocabulary of the English language consists of several layers, which are not genre-neutral. Stories about Merrie Olde England, such as the Mother Goose nursery rhymes, are heavily Germanic; more formal English writing, such as the United States Declaration of Independence, is heavily Old French; as for modern French borrowings, I am reminded of the Internet forum tagline, \\"Pretentious? Moi?\\". It was similar with Yiddish: the Germanic, Hebrew-Aramaic and Slavic layers each had their own connotations and could be combined to give expressive richness to a text. Harshav illustrates this with both 19th century Yiddish literature and with the Yiddish poetry of American immigrants. I doubt Harshav's assertion that most Yiddish speakers have always been multilingual, though; Mendele the Book Peddler's Benjamin the Third certainly wasn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for me.","review":"Try the Felix Mendelshon CD which is much better than this.

He has the rare and admirable quality of being able to hold a roomful of football players spellbound with anthropological theory. Although we dissected the Yanomamo culture in depth, Devore hardly glorified Chagnon's study, or referred to the Yanomamo as an \\"inherently savage\\" people. In fact, he tended to be critical of Chagnon's methods and such broad cultural characterizations. As an anthropology concentrator with a primary interest in primate biology, I also feel I can safely attest that his knowledge of primates is likewise solid and I recommend his writing on them without reservation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kind of learn JFC in 21 day book","review":"Good JFC entry book with lots of simple but helpful examples, and helpful especially in light of JavaSoft's stingy documentation.

The examples are trite and uninspired, and do little to illustrate how the concepts can be used in a real application. The diagrams do add little value to the topics and would have looked better if drawn by hand. And the authors' frequent use of their own company's logo in most of the examples is childish and unappreciated.If you are waiting for a good book about JFC and Swing, keep waiting.

Now the bees are disappearing due to the colder weather in the Northeast, going into hibernation to return in the Spring. These 2 products were a total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Product didn't work for me. We have an inexhaustible supply of yellow jackets this year. Not one has entered the trap. I've also tried ham rolls and raw meat in the trap. Neither attracted a wasp to the trap. Buy wasp spray!... I've killed over 50 with the spray."},{"rating":"1","title":"Half Good","review":"The 'lasts for weeks' attractant lasted (Drum roll, please) LESS THAN 24 HOURS!! When it worked, it worked great. But, right now I think I have paid about $1.00 per wasp. Not what I had in mind. The design is good. You can see if the wasps are dead before you take it apart. I did not trap anything other than yellow jackets. The plastic is fairly rigid. That it doesn't come with a hanger of some sort is a downer. And, because of the design it must hang--you can't set it on something. If, and that is a BIG \\"if\\", I get some more attractant I am just going to put a drop on the cotton at a time instead of using the whole tube. Hopefully that will work better.Over all--two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not work","review":"Doesn't work.

I hung one under the eave in front of the house and the other in the corner of the fenceline in the backyard and both have been very productive in the week I've had them up.

Not a single bee in this trap at all. Washed it and recycled it. Waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ineffective","review":"Location seems to be critical for this trap to work. I've had it mounted in the same location outdoors hanging under a hickory tree for a month. So far have only caught 2 Yellowjackets.

It only caught a few yellow jackets."},{"rating":"2","title":"works very well","review":"we live in Sonoma and have a lot of yellowjackets this year. I hung a trap behind the house and within an hour the trap was swarming with yellowjackets. After 3 days the trap had about a thousand YJ's and was filled to the top of the cone.

Followed the instruction and installed this product as directed. After 2 weeks (the amount of time the instructions said the \\"bait\\" would last) not one yellowjacket was caught. They would fly all around the the area and near the trap but none were attracted enough to go inside. Total waste of money. One star is too high."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Rescue Yellowjacket Trap","review":"I am allergic to the yellow jacket sting. I have two of these traps hanging in my trees front and back of my house. Let the purchaser be informed, that these traps will not to lure the entire nest into the container, unless maybe it is placed next to the nest. It does capture and hold the critters so that I might have an inventory and feel for how big an infestation I might have in my yard. It uses a chemical lure that has to be replaced about every 2 weeks. So far I have been able to find replacement lure at Ace Hardware and Lowes Home Improvement stores. The traps are used over and over, only the lure is replaced. I have tried a \\"bait\\" trap that uses fruit juice, such as apple, but I could not see how many bugs were being captured. I will keep the Rescue Re-useable Yellowjacket trap all year long."},{"rating":"1","title":"DID NOT WORK FOR ME","review":"This product did not work for me.

I was counting about 20 hanging out in the yard, max.

How many people actually use this year after year? We buy too much plastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works like magic!","review":"This is killing 10 yellow jackets a day with just a bit of beef jerky in it. The best of the yellow jacket traps we have tried so far. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far, so good!","review":"After hanging for two weeks, I was surprised and happy to see this works! The weather here in the NE has been very rainy and wet for most of the time but I caught eight bees (yellow jackets) so far in the short time it has been up during the warmer, sunnier days. It is VERY easy to set-up and get ready, easy to hang, no problems at all with set-up. It also does not look as bad as the horrible 2-liter soda bottle wasp traps I am having no luck with. This trap actually looks okay hanging up in the trees. So far I have only used the attractant supplied with the trap. I purchased the 10-week pod seperately but have yet to use it as this has been working well so far. I would definitely say this works and is well designed. Only wish it worked on wasps too as I have yet had any luck trying to solve that problem with other products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok to catch one bee (yellow jacket)","review":"I've tried these 6 times...each time I caught 1 yellow jacket bee out of dozens I see flying around and living in my railings.

Other than spraying them, I haven't found a good way to rid ourselves of bees."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hasn't done squat","review":"The product arrived quickly and in good condition. I have had it outside for about 3 weeks now and have not caught squat. The yellow jackets are still flying around, apparently unimpressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"zero caught and no point in counting.","review":"Apparently there are two different kinds of yellow jackets... the kind with short legs and the kind with long legs. They dont do enoungh to tell you that this trap wont catch the long legged type til you have already purchased the trap and find all your yellow jackets ignoring the trap. Actually the decription says it catches multiple species, but if you go back and look at the pictures, one of the pics shows a warning that is missing from the description.Ive had it in the yard surrounded by yellow jackets for couple weeks now and Ive caught exactly zero."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't work with paper wasps","review":"My fault. I didn't read the small print. The attractant won't work on paper wasps, which are what is prevalent in my area. And their right. It doesn't. The W-H-Y version says it will work, so I'll be trying one of those. In the meantime, I have put some humming bird feeder liquid in the trap and I'll see if that does the trick. Again, not the traps fault, you just need to aware of the type of wasp's your dealing with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Weak 'Mondo Cane' Rip-off You Could Avoid...","review":"A blatant example of nepotism this time from producer Luciano Martino, director Sergio Martino's brother, who ripped off Sergio's 1969 trash-pic 'Mondo Sex' (AKA 'Naked and Violent', another MYA release you should avoid - read my review), which itself was a 'Mondo Cane' rip-off.

This movie is relatitively unknown and did fair at the box office, never the less has a great story, good characterizations, solid performances by all, and above all, excellant direction.

I love these British dramas because they always have the best costumes, the best locations and I like the British accents. Most americans wish they had the accent so even though we are lacking in that department it's nice to hear the eloquence in a film. I thought the story was interesting, conjuring up moral questions about love and money and which do you prefer. I sort of wish Helena's character was a bit more bitchy and deviant, she was pretty restrained but it still worked. Wings of the Dove has 3 things going for it, the acting, the story and the cinematography."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sumptuous and poignant.","review":"This film is a sumptuous feast of costume, sets, locations and performances.An adult story, well written, well acted and very beautifully presented, that brings to light the nature of what is real and true love, and what is not.A date-movie extraordinaire! I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bonham-Carter is Fantastic!","review":"Helena Bonham-Carter should have won the Oscar for her role in this excellent film.

I have seen her performances in many excellent films."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Movie for both Guys and Girls!","review":"I first saw this movie when it was in the theaters. After much resistance, my girlfriend got me to go. And to my surprise this was an excellent film. Helena Bonham Carter is superb! The story takes place in turn of the century London. But don't be fooled by that this movie is something right out of a 90's soap opera (that's why the girls will love it). Helena and her boyfriend try to swindle a dying woman out of her fortune. Not to give too much away, but the boyfriend begins to fall in love with the dying woman which creates the conflict.......but wait a minute guys....this is for us also. You have a gigilo who is playing with two women. Big money is at stake....and to top it all off the beautiful Helena Bonham Carter gets buck naked at the end. Not only that but she crawls around that way for at least five minutes with tons of close up shots. So to conclude, guys pick this one up and watch it with your girlfriend or wife."},{"rating":"1","title":"good actors lousy movie","review":"to put it very simply, there was a lot of reading in between the lines,plot was not good...boring to me.....will never watch again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Porn Warning!","review":"Everything is fine.

The one caveat is that this is an exam PREP book, and would better be used as a final review tool than as a primary study manual.

The book mostly goes over myths, and through out the book the writer lightly sprinkles some information about hell. But you're lucky if she gets into detail about hell. I really have no idea why this book has so many high ratings. But since it has so few ratings, I guess thats a good reason.

A little thing, but seeing what was on the next week was part of the experience back when it was on network TV. If you were a fan, you should buy it and relive some of the memories with a new generation. By your command."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Review","review":"I saw this great series on a commercial TV network in Australia between 2/12/1982 and 7/23/1982. It was on Friday night at 7:30pm. After seeing previews of the 2003 re-imagned series on TV and looking back at scrap-books and that I collected trading cards of the series, I decided to buy this DVD box set. It starts out slow (but good) and gets better and better as the episodes roll on until the last one which makes me think there should of been more than one season of this really great TV series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's About Time!","review":"What's wrong with the people out there who are trashing Battlestar Galactica? Their comments are not helpful, nor relevant to those of us who have been waiting forever for a release like this! I have loved Battlestar Galactica since I was a little girl.

As a kid, I would wildly wait until Sunday evening, knowing far well that my 7th grade classes are just a few hours away. As well, closing upon, 8 - 9:00 depending on the episode, I would anguish at the closing credits. But now I can see the entire series even though it's definately dated, especially considering Star Trek: The Next Generation series. The series contains everything that a guy likes: action, romance -- especially consider Starbuck and Athena or Cassie. There is just one other point I must mention in regret about the series, its overt Mormon theology. It's about .... Time Universal Studios releases this series on DVD, Now, they have to do the same with with the Buck Rogers series.

My son appears to enjoy it very much; especially, the battle scenes with the Viper fighter ships versus the Cylon ships flown by Centurion robots. As for me, I can see why the series did not make it for very long; it could have been a very good series if not for some of the poorly written episodes and silly looking characters. Plus, I don't believe the writers put much thought into where to go with the story upon finally reaching earth.

I have no idea how many \\"Earth episodes\\" were filmed, but I desperately want to see them again.

Stu Phillips great music added a certain majesty to the proceeding as well.Let's face it, it was '70s TV though. Your memory may fool you into believing all manner of things about this show.

The video and audio quality are excellent. The \\"cyclon head\\" box is cool, though it is not something you would keep next to your other DVD's. Fortunately the fold-out DVD book format fits in nicely on a shelf. There is also an accompanying booklet that describes each episode and air date. All in all it's a great value. My only complaint, and the reason for only 4 stars, is the DVD-housing itself. The clips that hold each DVD inside the case are so tight that you can literally crack the DVD's trying to get them out. I cracked two of them in a short period of time, and I was trying to be careful. This is a serious flaw. Fortunately, Amazon.com and their wonderful customer service promptly sent me a replacement set.

As a sci-fi collector I think it is worth having in your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Series combines the best of Star Trek and Star Wars","review":"If you are a fan of Sci Fi action, I have to reccomend this set. It's a little pricey and I'd wait for the clearance price first though. If you put Star Trek on a budget and add lots of Christmas lights, this was what resulted. It's light on characters,light on plot,however it's a lot of fun to watch this seventies relic. John Dykstra, who produced the effects for Star Wars,was resposible for Galactica. A lot of the flight sequences are used repeatedly, but it's still good clean watching. It didn't hold up well over time. It's remake far surpasses this one. I do have to say that I have a spot in my heart for this version."},{"rating":"2","title":"deleted scenes galore!!!","review":"This is the best box set that I have seen so far!

The film prints and sound are fantastic. The deleted scenes are a real treat considering many contain BLOOPERS! Cast interviews are wonderful and give great insight as to what went into the series and the fun and hard work it was. The only thing I wish that they had done was put the pilot in its original 1:85 widescreen presentation. But considering that it is available separately in that format. Its ok. GET THIS BOX SET !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great - But Maybe A Little too Great","review":"I've loved BG since it's 3 hour pilot way back in 1978. To at last have the series on DVD - and all in one great box - is fantastic. However, there is one drawback one can't help but notice - the DVD transfers are at times TOO good. During the outer space shots the 'junk mattes' around the ships stand out on the digital transfer so much that it is actually distracting. Granted, the sound and picture quality are lightyears ahead of the old MCA videos, but one wishes someone at Universal could have taken the time and money to 'fix' the space shots a bit - just tweaking the contrast on the original film stock probably would have done it. That said, I still HIGHLY RECOMMEND this set...the deleted scenes alone are worth the price! Long live Battlestar Galactica (and hopefully a quick death the the insipid 'remake')!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Battlestar Galactica","review":"It was a lot of fun to see the original series again. I use to watch this with my brothers. The special effects (for 1978) were not that bad. To be honest I was acctually impressed. I enjoyed some of the interviews on this dvd as well. I had know clue the daggit was a monkey. The guest stars were amazing. I also give Terry Carter a lot of credit for his role as Colnel Tigh. For 1978 it still must have been hard to play an African American officer and he did it well."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"There is NO DISK #1 in the box, instead there is a second DISK #3 in it's place and Barnes & Noble won't replace it because it is over 14 days since I bought it! What ever happened to customer service?!?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A very disappointing series.","review":"When this show first aired,I would turn it on in hope of a good story and switch it off in disgust.The show is produced by America's worst producer in Glen Larson,a man that had no idea of story and so it goes for this show which has terrible writing.Most episodes start with the same basic scene of a Galactica pilot battling and blowing up a Cylon ship with the very same effects every time.To show how confused the writing was,the human villian that collaborated with the Cylons and was killed of in the premiere episode suddenly was brought back alive as a regular villian. Then after this series was cancelled,it was revived as Galactica 1980 and became.... a comedy.Buy Star Trek or Babylon 5 instead,at least they are well scripted and well produced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Booooorrrrring","review":"I'll probably get beat up for this but Battlestar Galactica was a waste of television airtime and it's even a bigger waste of a perfectly good dvd disc. The performances are lackluster probably because everyone was just there to make a buck. The stories were silly and the dialogue is even sillier. Even Mel Blank (the voice of the robot) couldn't help this sorry piece of trash. Don't waste your money here. You're better off watching Lost in Space or Star Trek."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"Another disgusting creation by this person.

I bought this for the complete original series and I've got no complaints about it. There are two versions of this set: one comes with a cylon head shaped box, but the other one just comes in a smaller box that is shaped like a smaller box. I'm glad I got the one shaped like a cylon. Some folks would like the box shaped box. We got two boxes of all 24 hours of the original Battlestar Galactica to pick from so life is good. God Bless America and Galactica!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a few minor gripes","review":"I'm not going to get into praising BG, BUT I will vent about two things:First,the packaging is an oversized collectible box with a cylon head on the cover. This box contains a six disc fold out that is actually the size of most DVD packaging. If you are somewhat anal about your DVD shelf,this box is impractical to use.Secondly, and this is the more important thing (to me anyway)are the discs themselves. Universal used DOUBLE SIDED DISCS!While the back of the box indicated they used single sided discs! I personally would have rather have paid more for a set of 7 (or 8) Discs without having to worry about being careful not to touch the other side!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Battlestar Galactica- The Complete Epic Series","review":"I give this one 4 stars because, although it is nice to have the whole series on DVD, the picture (particularly the dark shades) tend to be grainy, and the package is susceptable to easy damage. The vac-formed Cylon helmet had three dents in it before I even got it home! If you do buy this, watch the pilot with commentary on- It's pretty entertaining! I laughed a few times! Anyway, if you liked the show, it's worth it. The extras are a nice addition. On the whole, just to have these on DVD makes it worth it. Unfortunately lasted only one season, but we all know that it cost something like 1 million per episode back then. Why would a studio spend that when you can air stupid sitcoms for very little money.

The first part of the book, for some reason, gives you a short history on the Internet, but almost everything in that section is completely wrong.For example, the author says that the Internet was designed by the government to track your every click, and you can make yourself anonymous by getting a firewall and a hotmail account.

Please keep having at it.","review":"We enjoy 'Fire' and 'Senor Smoke,' immensely, and were really looking forward to 'Switzerland.' Found the album a disappointment, for it hasn't the verve, vim nor vigour of its predecessors. Felt like we wasted our money buying it on faith; could almost hear E6 saying (à la Laurie Anderson): \\"Ha ha ha - you've already paid for this\\"). First learnt of E6 from seeing the \\"Gay Bar\\" video on Sundance Channel's regrettably short-lived Sonic Videos programme, and thought their humour and rockin' sound was freshly dynamic. Maybe we shall develop an appreciation for 'Switzerland' after later listens-to but haven't yet. Here's hoping that, despite this weak album, they press on and regain what was lost here. Solid new rock bands are far and few between these days, and we are hoping that E6 is still going to be one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Electric Six's low point","review":"\\"Switzerland\\" lost the hooks and rock and roll swagger of Electric Six's previous two albums and replaced it with a blend of styles. Unfortunately, attempts at humor seem to overtake the experimentation, making the album sound like a joke that's not all that funny. \\"I Buy the Drugs\\" is still quite catchy and is a preview of good things to come on future releases, and \\"Pulling the Plug on the Party\\" could have been right at home on \\"Senor Smoke\\". \\"Night Vision\\" is another standout, but still pales in comparison to some of E6's better music.

The fan has now cratered and it sounds horrible. I have fixed it several times by blowing it out and applying oil, but eventually it goes back to sounding horrible. The only thing good about this drive in my view is the backup software that comes with it. What I have done, and what I suggest, would be ordering an external enclosure and a regular internal drive to go in it.

Being French Canadian, I would have preferred to have a Moroccan-French book. But this is the best one I have found in North America."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Essentially Useless, and There's Nothing Better","review":"This \\"course\\" is simply a reprint of an old Georgetown book from the 60s. It is garbage. The text is not in Arabic script (which is ridiculous) and the \\"exercises\\" are useless, but the vocab could be a good start if some of the words were not outdated and the author had explained which were Moroccan, Standard Arabic, French, or Spanish. The recordings, although insightfully encoded into MP3 format, are of the worst quality. They are clearly copies from tapes from back in the 60s when this book was useful. It sounds like they were recorded in a bathroom by someone who had smoked three packs of Winstons a day for 25 years. It was a decent language book for its time, but this is 2005. LET'S GET SOME NEW BOOKS GEORGETOWN!!! If that institution is such a bastion of Arabic studies in America, then I challenge it to get off its ass and put something out there (besides al-Kitab). This stuff is IMPORTANT these days. We Arabic students NEED it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impresive","review":"I am very happy with this s-video I purchased on May 2011.It is far superior than the one I purchased earlier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for classes","review":"This book was required reading for a history course I took at university. It is one of the most memorable books I read while at university; in fact I actually re-read it cover-to-cover while in law school. The writing is entertaining and it has a very clever layout with interesting historical photos and illustrations. The author describes the historical events covered by the book in a fresh and persuasive style which is rarely seen in books about history or politics. I wish Black or other authors would produce more works like this on other periods of history or political topics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great overview","review":"I first read this book around 1989. It was a great introduction to U.S. political influence in Latin America, starting in the 19th Century and running up basically to Iran-Contra.The Good Neighbor offers a general overview of North/South American relations, touching on the major issues and events.Clearly a good place to start, and a very easy read."},{"rating":"2","title":"a fantastic mix","review":"Bruce Molsky, Michael Doucet, and Darol Anger -- the fiddlers (who are joined by a great young cellist) -- are well known in their respective music communities (old-time, cajun, and jazz-grass or whatever you'd call it, respectively). All of them are masters of their traditions, and can play \\"straight\\" trad fiddle music as well as anyone alive. But this disc shows that none of them is straitjacketed by an uptight view of tradition, and they work together in a great cross-pollination. Most importantly, their technical virtuosity -- amazing as it is -- is never just for showing off, but instead adds to the mystery and the fun of the music."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful fusion","review":"Shortly after buying the CD, I saw the group perform in Somerville, MA. They are an energetic and highly entertaining ensemble (very funny on stage), and their musicianship is superb. I can highly recommend the CD, which roams around bluegrass, Cajun, jazz, African, and Caribbean with equal facility. There's so much to admire on this disc, like Bruce Molsky's riveting \\"Man of Constant Sorrow\\" (the best version I've ever heard), the gorgeous textures of \\"Chez Seychelles,\\" or the hypnotic \\"African Solstice.\\" It's all quite irresistible."},{"rating":"2","title":"From the man who wrote \\"The Ballad of Davy Crockett\\"","review":"With white settlers moving in, the Plains Indians were fighting desperately to preserve their lands, their sacred traditions, their very existence as a people. As they neared Wounded Knee Creek, the people of the plains asked themselves each day if it was a good day to die. Set amid the drama of the Plains Indians' last fight for freedom is the love story between Chance Easterbrook, a reporter, and Shining Woman, daughter of a Sioux chief."},{"rating":"2","title":"ORDER NOW!","review":"I have been one of those frantic neophytes in a Grown-up hurry to speak the language of the world -- Computorese -- and now Sandy Berger's book has given me the key, the courage, and the confidence for success. I'm well on my way to fluent communication! This is a superb book: I've ordered five more copies from Amazon to be sent poste-haste to fellow-strugglers, and I will continue to order (or, let's be sensible: recommend) a copy of this excellent Guide each time I hear that familiar wail of near despair. Now, instead of a pitiful \\"I want my Mommy!\\", I say cheerfully, \\"I need my Sandy Berger!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Directions to Treasurers on AOL and the Net","review":"The non-threatening basics offered in Sandy Berger's new book, Your Official Grown-up's Guide to AOL and the Internet, are great. I have read the chapters on e-mail, chatting, and navigating AOL and the Internet and think I have developed a good understanding and foundation. But what I am so appreciative of, thanks to Sandy, are the great directional signs to treasures on AOL and the Internet. It would take me years to find such good information. My favorite chapter is Genealogy. Up until I bought a computer and found Sandy's help, I was able to document only three generations of my family tree. Genealogy and developing my ancestral history has become my favorite activity. The computer is the perfect tool with its specialized links to tackle centuries of history. So not only have I tackled and enjoyed the computer world but that accomplishment has also led me to take on genealogy as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT GIFT","review":"I gave this to my mother for her birthday, and she just cannot say enough great things about it!

Snoopy's initial, ornery mischief-making is quite humorous, and his eventual taming by Peppermint Patty is a nice lesson in responsibility and gratitude. It's classic Schultz that many parents(like me) will find both nostalgic and funny.The second, \\"It's Flashbeagle, Charlie Brown!,\\" seems dated to me in certain respects (particularly the disco theme), but is far and away the kids' (ages 6 and 3) favorite. Flashbeagle is the most musical of all the Peanuts special outings, with a number of catchy, character-specific songs that never fail to get our daughters up and dancing (our 3-year-old now sings along with \\"Listen to Lucy\\").This is a solid Peanuts tape worth having in your kids' video library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flashdance? or Flashbeagle? :)","review":"Hee Hee. I'm definitely going to get this one. The Flashbeagle one is hilarious! I still have the beta version that I recorded off of tv when I was a kid. I love the scene where he dances at a disco, it is very funny. Doesn't have much of a plot but the 80's music and all in all good fun time that snoopy has...Well it makes it worth it. Enjoy :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Flashbeagle\\" is a true classic!!","review":"You've GOT to own this video, just to have the \\"Flashbeagle\\" episode, if nothing else. \\"He's your Dog...\\" is a good flick, but without a doubt, \\"Flashbeagle\\" will make you forget about it, because it ROCKS---literally! All the song's from \\"Pepperment Patty's PE Program\\" to \\"Lucy Says\\" and of course the title song give this Peanuts episode all the makings of the 80's MTV/music video craze (which was the big thing when this episode first aired). I'm 26 now, and I remember it when it was first out--and when I see it, it just takes me back--it's awesome! It's a delight for all ages! I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really poorly made","review":"I bought one of these thingys for around $60 which seemed fair for a snoopy movie but it won't even fit in my DVD player! At first glance, the huge rectangular piece of plastic looked too big for the slot, but at $60 I was determined to make it work. But no matter how hard I pressed, it wouldn't go in. Then I noticed, looking through the window that this kind of DVD comes all wound up on a little spool inside the rectangle. Took me a while to figure out the spring-loaded door but I managed to pull out some of this \\"DVD tape\\" and feed it into my DVD player. Still no picture. Now the seller won't take it back because it's \\"damaged\\". Well who's gonna fix the damage to my DVD player? Huh? Never buying from those crooks again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost makes you want to love humankind again.","review":"I dare anyone to read this book and not be changed.No one has Hilton's power of drawing a reader into the mind and heart of an ordinary bloke. I don't know how he does it; why do I care so much about his characters? He knows how to help the reader to sincerely CARE ABOUT a character, and therefore even his fellow man.The twist and twist of the plot and timeline can be challenging at times, but well worth the effort.And I thought the book was absolutely great BEFORE I read the last page!(BTW, don't confuse this great book with the mediocre chickflick movie of the same name, and I don't recommend watching the movie first, as it might spoil some of the suspense.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the movie","review":"Random Harvest is one of my favorite movies. I just bought this Kindle edition. I started to read \\"look inside\\" and liked the first paragraph. If the rest of the book is like the first paragraph, I'm going to love the book. I always wondered what the title meant, and the quote at the beginning answered my question. I will write a review when I am done reading. Gave it 4 stars since I haven't actually read it yet.What I wonder is why different Kindle editions of the same book are different prices. I had a change to buy a different edition of this book for $1.99 on sale and regular price is $9.99, but this edition is $2.99I also agree that I like this story better than \\"Good-bye Mr. Chips\\", Greer Garson starred in both movies.ttyl"},{"rating":"1","title":"lost","review":"I ordered this book for my nexus 7 but never received it.

I wasn't able to connect with the characters and in the end I got about 25% through and haven't tried reading again. I asked the book club their thoughts and all said the same thing. One was in the 3rd section and still wasn't connected with the book or characters. In the end we selected another book for the club meeting. I think I will try this book again we I have more time but right now I was disappointed that it didn't hold my attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"For fans of Downton Abbey","review":"\\"Random Harvest\\" is a wonderful read and reminds us of all the British writers who were so good at telling a compelling story. There are many echoes of \\"Downton Abbey\\" with its stately estates and World War One scenes but Hilton's is a far more complex story with stronger emotional undertones.I must extend kudos to Amazon for making \\"Random Harvest\\" a 'daily deal'. I bought it for $1.99 because of the price, no other reason. It would be great if Amazon could make more books by Hilton, A.J. Cronin, and Nevil Shute available at a bargain price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Finish Reading Despite Good Reviews","review":"I've gone back to this book a number of times but just haven't been able to get into it.

I recommend them both, but if you have to choose, watch the film!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Total enjoyment....","review":"anyone who likes Donizetti or Bel Canto can not help but enjoy this wonderful performance. It goes beyond saying that Gencer is absolutely fabulous and dare I say comparable to Callas, but, as well, you get an outstanding S. Verrett, F.

Perhaps the best moment in this endless saga is Mr. Reeve's opening 'acknowledgements' page, wherein he thanks, among others, The Library Of Congress for helping him with all his 'years' of research (?!?) and - of course - \\"The Fab Four\\".

The bristles will sink into the slowly melting handle.Unless the manufacture is using a high grade heat resistant plastic.It's 3 and some change folks ...

They can bring the volume down to a pin drop and up louder than a parker aircraft. This is their first album and like many band's first albums it features not only their sounds but the sounds of their influences. Not to say that it's necessarily a bad thing, but if you've come to love the Frames like I have, it's weird to go from their established albums back to this. The remastering job and bonus tracks are definitely a plus, I remember downloading this album back when it wasn't available and it just wasn't the same, with the remastering and bonus tracks it's worth having as it has more recent tracks than the album itself, if you can buy this first, then work your way up to the present as they have never put out a bad album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"This book is a great way to learn the nuts and bolts of HTML coding.

An extremely effective way of teaching HTML........................................... However, the book is not so strong on the design element, and thus is docked one star.

The author spends most of the time describing databases of process inoformation he has collected and how he went about correlating the results, but without ever bothering to print the correlations that were developed.

Bulldozers and trains can be filmed while they are serving their true purpose, but here real firefighting is absent. Instead we are treated to practice fighting against a weak fire in a bland concrete structure (give us a destructive blaze, for crying out loud!), demonstrations of hoses, long lectures on equipment, serious-faced safety warnings, and various data, like how long the hoses are and how many gallons of water can be sprayed per minute. To spice it up, Dave treats us to high-tech video tricks like having the firemen go backward up the pole and slide, Wow!This production feels more like a 3rd grade field trip to the local station, captured on video by the student teacher. My kids found other things to do about halfway through."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough fire trucks, too much talking","review":"My 2-year-old adores fire trucks, and I bought this video on the strength of the reviews posted here. It is a sore disappointment. Most of the video is of Fireman Dave talking, walking, showing off; way too many interviews with firefighters; there's little video of the fire trucks themselves, and virtually none of the trucks fighting fires.

If his Oscar winning western is his best film, \\"Pink Cadillac\\" may very well be his worst. As both an action film and a comedy, it's pretty lame most of the time, but it remains a must-see for Eastwood fans in that he has never before (and only rarely since) been so extroverted on screen. He's quite funny throughout, and his performance compensates for a script that is as ridiculous as it is cliched. Though a minor credit in Eastwood's impressive filmography, \\"Pink Cadillac\\" is worth a look for his fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great one*","review":"Sorry, but it's not a good one... & I love most Clint movies... sorry to have to give this one a bad review.To sum up- alot of fighting- but boring!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great film","review":"I love movies set in this era.

However, \\"Pink Cadillac\\" (1989) is a noted exception. This brain-dead romantic comedy, with an offensive white-supremacist subplot, makes \\"Every Which Way But Loose\\" look like a minor masterpiece.

Perhaps these are \\"cooler\\" for slightly older kids (my son is now 23 months; he has been watching these videos since about 17 months)but young children much prefer moving vehicles; the explosions are too sudden and scary.

Along the way, we see one or two bulldozers.The last 15 minutes of the video is definitely the best. We finally see earth moving equipment close up. But, again, we don't see a lot of bulldozers.The title is definitely a misnomer. This video isn't that bad, but it's definitely NOT about bulldozers.Our two year old seemed to enjoy it.

The sandwich plates and waffle plates both cook very evenly.Removable plates make cleaning a snap. As with most teflon products, they shouldn't be put in the dishwasher.Be warned, however, that the waffle and pizzelle plates have \\"BAM!\\" written across them in huge letters.

Doesn't seem to be coming off, like I read in another review. It just doesn't work.

Batman was one of the greater superheroes. He had inner conflicts about his identity that Tim Burton focuses on here in Batman Returns. What is the perfect villain? The one you can relate to the most! For Batman, it was Catwoman. The slinky feline is manipulative, but very sympathetic! it was the penguin that completely took all the sympathy. Tim Burton didn't want you to just hate the villains, he wanted you to understand them. Thus, this is the most creative Batman movie that I have ever seen! buy this two-disc set! This is worth every penny!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The last of quality Batman","review":"When Micheal Keaton and Tim Burton left the Batman franchise, they took the quality with them. Luckily, they gave us one more Batman before they left. This film brings back the darkness and strength that Batman was supposed to have. Keaton returns, successfully pulling off the double personality role of Wayne and Batman. Danny DeVito is really the only person that could really pull off the Penguin, having that twisted creepiness and nailing the voice perfectly. I wasn't sure if Michelle Pfieffer would be able to get Catwoman, but i was wrong. She was very good, throwing in enough puns to make due, and not overdoing it (Arnold as Freeze). Burton brings back that grim and dark look to Gotham with a great plot that you don't see in sequals that often. This is the best of the sequals, from this point on, Batman slowly died in quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good as the rest...","review":"The original batman with the Joker as the villian, staring Michael Keaton and Jack Nicholson, was a great movie. It was a shock to me, who had only seen the later sequels and Batman Begins. I enjoyed Forever a lot more than most people. Val Kilmer was great, and so was Tommy Lee Jones and Jim Carey. Truthfully, I loved Batman and Robin. Arnold and Uma played the best Batman villians to date, and George Clooney was a good Batman.Batman Returns is actually the last one I watched, and I have to say it isn't that good. Danny Devito as the Penquin is good, but Michelle Phiefer sucked (Halle Berry was better) as Catwoman. On top of that, the plot of this movie (Of Penquin becoming major) is unrealistic, silly, and would never happen with excessive force. Also, Batman doesn't have many lines. All he seems to be a brick and stop the enemies; that's it.This the weakest Batman Movie. Why anybody thinks this is better than the next two is beyond me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Devito sinks this movie something fierce","review":"Look the first Burton-directed Batman film with Jack Nicholson as the Joker scored well enough but this movie with Devito sucking bigtime as the Penguin is just putrid.

The fall hit her head?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Batman Returns For What?","review":"I waited for this much anticipated sequel only to be disappointed. Michael Keaton did not seem to carry the movie as he did with the first one. The focus of the movie seem to be on the Penguin and Catwoman characters. The story of the Penguin is a sad one but I do not need to hear about it for the entire story. Catwoman as a love interest for Batman was overrated and the final scene where Batman reveals to Catwoman who he is was weak. Still a good movie no less."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW!

Incoherent screenplay and totally boring and pointless throughout, this piece of garbage is overlong, and a total waste of time. I can't believe you morons think this film is great. It reeks big time. Burton really has NO CLUE about what makes Batman great. As a Batman fan, and a lover of the awesome Batman: The Animated Series(currently running on WB as The New Batman Adventures) Burton probably watched this animated rendering of the Dark Knight and kicked himself, wishing he could have had another chance. By the way, the only solid Batman movie is Batman Forever; it comes the closest to capturing the real Batman character and the adventure; but still in no way as good as the cartoon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Son of a bat!!!What the heck is this?!","review":"This was my question when I first saw this movie.Unbelievably boring plot(although a good direction by Tim Burton),stupid,stupid characters,and a Batman that is completely overshadowed by the villans.Tim Burtons as a director does his best to save this potato,but unfortuently even he can't.I loved ''BATMAN'' and ''BATMAN FOREVER'',but this horrible sequel makes ''BATMAN & ROBIN''(which sucks) seem like ''INDIANA JONES & THE LAST CRUSADE''!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the WORST movies EVER Made","review":"Michael Keaton's amazing performance,Catwoman,and the visual effects are the only thing saving this movie from being the worst film ever made.Danny Devito(boy he should have won that Razzie,and Christopher Walken,are horrible in this movie and the script is SO awful that a five year old could do better.I am so glad that Batmn Forever saved the series and Batman and Robin is 1000x better than this!Avoid this movie at ALL costs!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"This was a good movie for hubby and I to watch together. Little far fetched at times, but hey...its Batman...LOL"},{"rating":"2","title":"More than solid sequel to the groundbreaking first film","review":"Tim Burton's first Batman film was, despite it's flaws, a masterpiece and helped set the standard for comic to film adaptations. This eagerly anticipated follow up was an instant hit, and saw the return of director Tim Burton and star Michael Keaton. The fantastic set design and costumes are some of the many highlights here, but the standout performances from Michelle Pfeiffer and Danny DeVito as Catwoman and the Penguin respectively help make Batman Returns a more than solid sequel. Keaton is terrific as usual as the Dark Knight in what would prove to be his last performance in the series. There is a much darker vibe here than in the first film, and despite some of the film's flaws, it's still one of the better comic inspired films of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"batman returns","review":"I loved batman returns. Such a classic. Great solid performances by michelle pheifer and danny devito"},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie sucks","review":"I dont know how people can watch this movie and call it a good sequel. The movie is dreadful, and the Penguin is the worst villian in the Batman series. Burgess Meredith played Penguin in the orignal series, and is the only man who can play Penguin. This movie is too long, and its basically 2 hours of talking and about 20 minutes of action that is thrown in here and there. Save your money and buy the regular dvd with no speical features, this movie is not worth rebuying for speical features."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was such a boring movie................................","review":"I cannot believe how bad this movie was...

Christopher Walken and Danny Devito round out the cast in all their scene chewing glory. If you haven't seen it yet they what are you waiting for rent it now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Darker","review":"The look of this film is a bit darker is definitely has more of a goth look than the previous Batman film. I do not think this movie was as good as the original Batman film, it's still better than the next 2 Batman films. Batman though is also once again upstaged by the Villains, who are played by Danny Devito as the Penguin, and MIchelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman.I really liked the Michelle's Pfeiffer performance as the Catwoman, she tranformed the character from a campy sexy villain, into a tragic kind of psychotic but still sexy character. Devito did the best he could do from what he was given, but to me Burton changed the character too much for my taste. The Score by Danny Elfman is also worht mentioning, it is dark and moody kind of the like the movie although it's still not as good as his score for Edward Scissorhands. In the end this was a good film and it was also the last Batman fim directed by Burton."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful! Just wonderful!","review":"BATMAN RETURNS is my favourite Batman movie in the series, but I know lots of people think this is the worst one. I don't care, I just love this movie. The Gotham City in Batman Returns is the most beautiful of the series, I would like to live in. And Keaton's performance is the better than last one. In face, he is the best actor who can act Batman perfectly. Danny DeVito and Michelle Pfeiffer are also done the terrific job, but Christopher Walken's Max Shreck is the most wonderful villian of the movie. well done! Danny Elfman's music is just the best. Tim Burton, we thank you. Thanks for give us just a beautiful and darkful Batman movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"[*] great Batman film by Burton","review":"This in one of best batman film yet. Burton captures the dark gotham mood, psychologically powerful Batman and the villains perfectly in the first and second Batman movies.More true to the comic series than the last two kiddie batman movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keaton, Burton & Elfman simply great.","review":"KEATON IS THE BEST BATMAN EVER! Well this movie is just as good as Batman because Tim Burton directed them both I think that Batman Returns is even darker than Batman but they are both good I don't know why Keaton and Burton didn't at least make a third movie of Batman he destroyed everything by giving Schumacher BATMAN I really hope that WB offers lots of millions to Burton to return and continue with a story after Batman Returns and the guys at WB don't re-release never again on any format not even on TV Batman Forever and the piece of garbage of Batman & Robin I hope they act like if those two movies had never existed deleted, erased from time. Elfman is great as always in every movie soundtrack he has worked with Tim Burton. PLEASE KEATON, BURTON & ELFMAN COME BACK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must see,must own movie.","review":"If you like Batman then you must watch this.All of the characters are very interesting especially The Penguin.Of all the Tim Burton movies Ive seen this one remains my absolute favorite.Michelle Pfeiffer is the visually stunning Catwoman who has plenty of attitude and some severe emotional problems.Theres plenty of drama in this movie especially towards the end.The Penguin and Catwoman seem to get all the really good lines but I still love Christopher Walken as the delightfully creepy Max Shreck and also Michael Keaton as Batman.Out of all the Batman movies this one is the darkest and most dramatic and in my opinion the most entertaining even though the first was one of the best movies of the 80s.You should definitely see this."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Batman Returns\\"","review":"One of the great ones. It's that rare sequel that goes one better on the original, and it goes to extremes. Superheroics are an afterthought here; director Tim Burton is clearly more interested in his characters and their own dark, twisted inner worlds. It was so in the first film, but here it's taken to an entirely new level; these three people are nakedly vulnerable, always on the edge of a breakdown (it's no accident that Rick James' \\"Superfreak\\" is heard during the masked ball). It's not too coherently put together, but it's profound and emotionally complete. Features Michael Keaton, Danny DeVito, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Christopher Walken, all in top form."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Feast For My Eyes","review":"Batman Returns is a classic movie. It has great effects, wonderful acting, cool photography, a fantastic score, and is directed by the greatest director of our time. I dont know if this is Burtons best movie as a director, but its certainly worth more than five stars. The film has aged so well and still looks absolutely gorgeous. The film is so dark and moody. I love it. Batman has always been one of the more darker heroes, this film really captures that. I cant stand when people say that Batman isnt hardly in the film. I agree with Tim Burton who says that Batman is meant to be more hidden. Dont let those opinions stop you from watching this true work of art. The film also has some great action scenes and a good chemistry between the actors. Its quite hard to describe how incredible the film is. I cant see how the original can ever be said to be better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"four and a half stars.","review":"Though this is the best of all the batman movies, I still can't give it five stars. There were just too many sub-plots for (screenplay writer) Daniel Waters to tie together in its 126 minutes of screen time. True, Tim Burton created a darker atmosphere than his first Batman film, but just how seriously can you take an army of penguins with candy- cane missils tied to there backs? The other thing that saves this movie is Michelle Pfeiffer's role as catwoman. Her relationship with Michael Keaton's Batman was five times more interesting than Kim Basingers helpless character.In fact,I seem to remember rumours that they were considering a Catwoman movie with her as the star.I must stress that if you like your Batman \\"campy\\" the first two movies aren't for you .All in all, this second movie was Batmans shining moment in tinsle town."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best one of the series","review":"Ignore the other lame-@$$ reviews on this one, it is no boubt the best of the Batman movies. I am a huge Batman fan, and while it does not hew too closely(OK make that hardly at all)to the comics, it does the character the most justice. It is the darkest of the four films, and this is what makes it so great. Too depressing? Nah. Batmans world (as it is portrayed in the comics) is a bleak and terrifying one. I mean, for christ sakes his parents were shot in front of his eyes! In making no attempt to candy-coat gotham, this film, while not acurately reflecting the REALL(comic book) Batman, gives an extremely acurate feel of Batman and his world. For me, second only to Star Wars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, no. Not ANOTHER one.","review":"See my review for BATMAN. This is more of the same, only even worse. However, it has Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman. She single-handedly elevates this into almost worth watching. I still love her, even though this and FRANKIE AND JOHNNY are her two really good roles...and THE RUSSIA HOUSE."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much atmosphere (and a rancid one at that). Little substance.","review":"Visually stimulating and persistently off-kilter with a few well-acted, stylistically creative scenes (Pfeiffer's return home, the ballroom revelation) but primarily spooky, goofy, and disgusting. Heroism, excitement, and interesting characters are nowhere - and I mean nowhere - to be found.I frequently had to remind myself that I was supposedly enduring a Batman movie. It's hard to remember that when a third of the picture is spent showing a slimy, fanged and flippered midget eat a raw fish whole as the contents of its bowels stream down his chin. All while he's running for mayor. Whee. I completely checked out when they rolled out the all-terrain rubber ducky and the rocket-launching penguins.This film is essentially just two hours of Tim Burton pleasuring himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL","review":"This has to be the worst Batman movie ever made, if not the worst movie period. Clown gangsters, suicide penguin bombers, a giant rubber duck with tank wheels, how much worse can it get? Much, much worse. A terrible, almost nonexistent, storyline, bad special effects. I can't even begin to explain the downright stupidity of this movie. Do not waste your time or your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Batman Movie","review":"\\"Batman Returns\\" fully surpasses the original,\\"Batman\\"(1989),in every which way imaginable.The story,though complex,is understandable and well crafted,and isn't just there as a fill-in for the intense action scenes.Michael Keaton reprises his roleas Batman/Bruce Wayne,as do Michael Gough(Alfred)and PatHingle(Commissioner Gordon)for their roles.The new cast,which features Danny Devito(The Penguin),Michelle Pfieffer(Catwoman),and Christopher Walken(Max Shreck),are all perfect for their roles.My only complaint is the size of Gotham City,which is much too small and bears little resemblence to the city in its predecessor.Most of the outdoor scenes are centered around \\"Gotham Plaza\\",a tiny Rocafeller Center rip-off.But,you can't let a small flaw like that discourage you.So,buy this DvD and enjoy the great story,the wonderful acting,and the fantastic ending(Catwoman lives!!),which leaves you wanting more.Its just a shame none of its sequels fully deliver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good movie, bad dvd","review":"this is just a re-release of the original bare bones dvd. no bonus content at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Catwoman is the best villian of all the Batman films","review":"Catwoman is the best villian of all the Batman films. I think that this is also the best Batman film. It is dark and edgy, but also has comedic points to it. Michelle Phiffer and Micheal Keaton are great together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Messy, gory sequel just plain stinks...","review":"Tim Burton returned to direct this sequel to the successful \\"Batman,\\" but here the premise is too dark and too grisly. Danny DeVito is just okay as the Penguin, but even worse is Michelle Pfeiffer as Catwoman. Michael Keaton has absolutely nothing to do with his role and this film is mostly just an excuse for Tim Burton to be scary. The plot is absurd, the characters are unconvincing, including Christopher Walken as a minor bad guy. Consequently, Burton did not return to direct the next two films."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointing","review":"this movie was dissapointing. Penguin is my favorite villan of batman. Tim burton ruined his funny image. he also dies!!!! The penguin was also sadistic and cold blooded. The one i'm used to is normal, formal, and funny. how sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Dark....That is why I love it.","review":"This is the first Batman sequel, and the only good one. The story is about the fight of Batman (Keaton in his best role) against the Penguin (a really sinister DeVito), Catwoman (a splendid Pfeiffer) and evil businessman Max Shreck (Walken in his best role since Deer Hunter). This is a dark movie, with a sinister humour and some sad moments (like the Penguin's funeral) but it is also a lot of fun. You will enjoy it not only if you are Batman fans and take his myth seriously but also if you just want to enjoy a truly GOOD modern fantasy movie. END"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Magic Returns Too!!!!!","review":"I am a really big fan of the Femme Fatal! Michelle P. does a great job, she plays that passive, stressed out career woman perfectly. She stunned me with her preformance as that creepy, domanering Catwoman.My bff loves the penguine, so this is the purr-fect flick for both of us!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just as mediocre as the first","review":"Again, if you're gonna adopt a comic book, stick to it.... If you don't respect the original source (other than minor embellishments), there's no point in making the film. Mel Gibson didn't make Jesus a cyborg, did he? Spielberg didn't make the shark a killer whale in Jaws, right?Just consider a few things...1) The penguin never had flippers, never lived in a sewer and definitely never ate raw fish...2) Why was the Max Shreck (although the name was cool) character even necessary?3)Gotham looks like a fake city, not a real one4) We're asked to believe that Catwoman, in her genesis, survived a fall from a 40 or 50 story building. In the comic book, Catwoman, like Batman, has no super powers whatever. None.That's just for openers. Visually, the film was enjoyable, but as a whole, again, disjointed and pretentious. Why not make a Batman film that's based on the comic? It can still be quite dark, but truer to the source, and likely more enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie!!!","review":"This movie is some kind of ride. Tim Burton brilliantly directs this movie. Keaton is the best Batman. Brilliant performances by Danny De Vito, Michelle Pfeifer, and Christopher Walken. This movie is just good as the original and in some ways better. Mesmerizing production design, much better than on the Schumacher films. Danny Elfman's greatest score. Critics have complained that \\"Batman Returns\\" has no real plot, and I agree. But who cares?! This is a great movie. One of the best ever made. EVER!!! I love the scenes between Keaton and Pfeifer, especially the one where they're dancing, and the Penguin crashes the party. Oh, and by the way... whoever said that this was the worst Batman film and that \\"Batman Forever\\" is better because it captures the spirit of adventure of the cartoon is dead wrong. Sorry kid, but the REAL Batman is the dark, brooding version of the comics. Here, Burton comes SO much closer to this than Joel Schumacher could."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Batman Film","review":"As far as I'm concerned, this is the best Batman film! It's incredibly dark but also darkly comical. I wish more superhero movies were made like this. I consider this to be a very ADULT superhero movie, which I LOVE. Superhero movies nowadays seem to be mostly aimed at the kiddies. The dark characters, sexual references, AMAZING acting, did I mention the amazing characters? This is an awesome classic...Although I'm sure some are put off by Burton's amazingly unique vision. Dark! Funny! Fabulous!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Question rather than an actual review","review":"That's why only the 4 stars cause I believe this movie is great.

A great movie made for entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST BATMAN MOVIE!","review":"This is my favorite Batman movie, The Penguin isn't as interesting and entertaining as The Joker but every scene in which Catwoman and Batman are together is great, especially the mistletoe lines. This movie is darker and more serious than the first Batman movie, I'm waiting for the guys at WB to release some kind of Special Edition, because I bought the first Batman movie and it's extra-free nothing, not even the trailers, only dated biographical pages for you to read about the main people involved in the movie. I sure hope for Burton to come back with Michael Keaton and do one more Batman, probably with Michael Keaton kind of realizing that he's getting old for the job but will have to wear the black cape one more time against his ultimate foe! Ha, ha, ha, I know that that's not gonna happen, but hey one can always dream."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who said sequels suck?","review":"Yes Batman Returns, like the first one is truly amazing! Tim Burton brought a more scarier back round in this one which makes it more funner. Pheifer is Catwoman, just like Nicholson, she was truly amazing. Catwoman and Joker are the two best villians in all of the Batman series. Danny Devito is Penguin and what better guy to pick. Overall excellent movie reason why this did not get a perfect rating just like the first one was simply because if you notice when Batman takes off the mask you can see just before that he has no makeup on his eyelids, but sure enough before that scence he did have the black make-up on. Okay, Okay that's not a good enough reason I did not give this a perfect because nothing is as good as the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"IN ONE WORD BORING!!!","review":"I found BATMAN RETURNS to be a dull film even for the caped crusader I felt that MICHEAL KEATON looked and acted bored in this film. MICHELLE PHIEFFER I really could'nt stand either, the only person I liked was DANNY DEVITO as the PENQUIN as he stole the show like JACK NICKHOLSAN before him he's the only reason this film is'nt a total disaster. I'm not going to even metion CHRISTOPHER WALKEN'S character you'll see why when you watch this film. All in all this film is not as bad as BATMAN AND ROBIN but it's close. One final word TIM BURTON how could you?!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A BETTER, DARKER Batman.","review":"The look of this movie almost gives me an orgasm. lol It's darker, gothic.

But what pianists! The list includes Roland Hanna, Kenny Barron, Tommy Flanagan, Hank Jones, and Barry Harris (who I freely admit I never heard play before). Of the 12 cuts Frank Morgan plays on 7 leaving a solo piece for each pianist. I find the concept brilliant. Just the proper mix of sax to piano with a chance for each artist to be spotlighted. Each cut is a gem exhibiting great beauty, great virtuosity, and great simplicity. Each cut allowed me to get out of myself and enter a world of beauty that the best jazz creates.

I kept feeling like I was watching a bad high school theater production - shot in the Winchester mystery house.

This sets back the women's movement 100 years...","review":"I'm not a \\"libber\\" but I was certainly not happy that this story-teller proudly declared a woman's place is serving her husband.I expected to read about dreaming techniques and instead had to find my way through a convoluted telling of this woman's childhood dreaming experiences, how she came to meet her \\"Dark Lord,\\" how the earth shook when they made love and how fulfilled she is supporting her husband's mission to lead the Yaqui nation.What a crock. If you're interested in developing Yaqui dreaming techniques, read Carlos Castanada's books instead. Although the \\"exercises\\" described in them are difficult and required a very long time to achieve success, they are effective and do work."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's your dream, it's your life.","review":"One of the things that struck me after the first dozen pages is that this is a real story about real Yaqui people. Heather provides us with a unique snapshot of American Indian life, the magic, the drama, and the power to see the world as the Yaqui do. We spend one-third of our lives sleeping. If you want to know more about the world that we spend so much time in and it's connection to our waking world, read this book.The first reviewer entirely missed the point of the book, only scratching the surface of a deeper understanding, and in so missed a chance to learn about their dreams and about themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very handy for use at home or at work","review":"The product works very well, but might prove a little flimsy if one is not careful connecting the phone.

I have owned every brand of this type of cable over the years. I think one company makes them all. They will NOT last. The cable will develop a bare spot near the device connector end and short itself out. For some reason, it only happens with the Palm-type cables. My iPod and USB retractable cables have lasted. Perhaps one just ends up using the Palm device cables more for hot-synching and/or charging daily.See my PALM page at [...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY FRAGILE!","review":"I bought this cable. My first peeve was that it was shorter than the original Palm Hotsync cable, but my major issue is that a few weeks of use were enough to break one of the little tabs that holds the contacts firmly in place, so WATCH OUT, and treat this cable nicely. I like the retracting cable concept, but was disappointed in how easily it got damaged."},{"rating":"1","title":"For hard-core Slick fans only.","review":"As an admirer of her music I found the book interesting. However, it is so poorly written that it makes it difficult to read. I would recommend it on audiotape because it seems to have been written exactly as it was spoken. It's like reading a speech."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea, but...","review":"To her credit, Grace Slick doesn't try to paint herself as particularly likeable or mature. Her book is poorly written, as if by a 16-year old. What also struck me as odd is how the book says relatively little about the music that was the focus of Ms. Slick's life. It spends a lot of time talking about the various excesses that her fame allowed her to indulge in. These topics might be interesting to teens, or to hardcore Airplane fans, but for anyone else there are much better books to buy and read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock and Roll Memoir","review":"Grace Slick writes like she lives-straight from the hip. She doesn't pull any punches and writes with total integrity about her life. I enjoy learning as much as possible about the bands that evolved out of the San Francisco scene during the '60s and she adds her own unique perspective. I can't say I agree about her ideas on old age but c'est la vie. Life in a '60s era rock 'n' roll band was tempestuous, unpredictable and very creative. Lots of unusual experiences and relationships."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could have been better.","review":"I found the constantly shifting timelines in the narrative a little confusing. Fortunately I have been a fan since 1967 and knew some of the details already but she could have used a good co-writer to get this tighter. Also I found a fair bit of the history I know of missing. Will there be a part 2 ???"},{"rating":"2","title":"No punches pulled here!","review":"Grace was my 1st musical idol; I ended up a professional musician/writer to this day (I'm 58!) because of the influence this woman's talent had on my life. She writes very candidly and you get a real sense of the person behind the fame and the media gossip. She gives great insight on the music business back then (still crappy, but in a far less creative way!) and the way her era changed music - and lifestyle - forever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in the surface treatment of events","review":"I read the book in two days and while it contained a few items of interest, I was disappointed in the lack of detail in many areas. I would have been really interested to hear Grace Slick talk about the Haight Ashbury days, how the Airplane dealt with the record company business, or the sessions and live appearances that led to some of their great songs. One would think that a woman whose songs were inspired by the likes of Lewis Carroll and James Joyce would have a deeper perspective than this book shows, but maybe not. I think a lot of the blame has to go to Andrea Cagan who most likely told her to make sure to tell her sexual experiences with famous rock stars if nothing else. In any case the editing should have been a lot better; the book is kind of a rambling mess. But for fans of Grace and the Airplane and '60s rock music in general, it's still an interesting read for all its faults."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, but not enough 60's material","review":"In this autobiography, Grace Slick formerly of Jefferson Airplane, gives an full account of her life in the rock and roll spotlite. She gives up the goods on lots of interesting and famous personalities in one of the most exciting times in rock and roll history.Although sometimes a bit irritatingly egocentric, Ms. Slick has so many interesting tidbits to disclose that it's easy to forgive her overabundance of self-love.An interesting, entertaining and often funny book, just wish it had focused more on the 60's."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money and boring, boring, boring","review":"Review of audiocassette -- Grace Slick is unbelievably self-absorbed and unforgivably boring. For example, do we really care that she was a blond when she was eight years old? I listened to this on a long drive one evening and kept waiting for the tape to get better but it never did. It's a miracle that it didn't put me to sleep and cause me to drive off the road! Grace reads her self-indulgent musings in a wooden voice without a trace of real insight or even humor. After listening to this tape, I didn't know a lot more about Jefferson Airplane or Starship or the sixties or even Grace Slick -- I just knew that I wanted my money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awsome, just what I expected.","review":"Not a rehashing of the same old 60's stories we hear over and over. I was about Grace and her life. I'm glad it wasn't all about the Airplane/Starship, you can get that anywhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great look into the psychedelic era of the 60's.","review":"This book is great and I've not even finished, I see Grace as one of my idols and after reading this book, she seems to be just how I'd imagined her to be. I love her her expression and the way she talks, she's not afraid to say what's in her head. I love the part where she talks about Jim Morrison, reminds me of a sexual encounter with Ben (Syd Barrett, Pink Floyd) in a infamous book called \\"Groupie\\". The descriptions of the things from her childhood, I seem to have gone through the same things if a little less weird.I also loved her seriousness concerning politics and her song \\"Panda\\", I also love Pandas I collect anything to do with them. So to find she also likes them is uncanny.The way she worked through the Jefferson Airplane members, excellent. The descriptions. I liked the way that she was given a topic and then had to think around it in the format of her book.I had to get it straight away. Excellent Grace."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't she have anything to say about her lyrics?","review":"I've been a fan of Grace's work since the beginning, through the weirdness, good and bad, and I enjoyed this book too. But I wanted to hear more about the songs/lyrics that she authored and that just wasn't there. But I learned some insights about Grace that had been aluded to but never acknowledged. In this book she's really a hoot and damn honest. I don't have a problem tossing a book after a few pages if it doesn't feel interesting but when I read a book in one day, like this one, because I'm enjoying the ride, I consider it a great deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all that I hoped for!","review":"Overall I'd say this book was mildly interesting. I'd hoped for a lot more discussion and details about rock n'roll in the 60s but what I wound up with was pretty much a hodge-podge of disjointed events. Grace also has a tendency to promote her personal social and political agendas which gets tiring.Since I picked it up at the local library, at least I didn't have to shell out any cash!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame and Disappointing","review":"This book contained no information about Grace Slick that I found interesting. I am only twenty, but I have been a Jefferson Airplane fan for several years. I was very excited to see the book published and then disappointed with the outcome. Slick and Cagan left out important parts of Slick's life, music, and relationships. I put down the book wanting more and even a little bit confused. The writers skip from one decade to the next while referring to events unknown to the reader and not even mentioned within the pages. Hopefully next time that Grace Slick publishes her memoirs, she will be more specific and organized."},{"rating":"1","title":"Airplane Goddess Crashes","review":"Grace Slick didn't even get off of the runway. I don't buy a lot of autobiographies. I bought this one because Janis is dead and only she and Grace have a right to write about 60s and 70s San Francisco rock from the female perspective.The woman who created such wonders as White Rabbit and Lather has worked up a bunch of meaningless bubbles for this thin thin thin work. Perhaps that's what happens when you stop drinking and doing dope.Ms. Cagan, who is listed as a \\"contributor\\", but is described more as an editor-compiler deserves some of the credit for this totally incoherent and slipshod piece of trash.Wait for the movie and hope China Kantner plays her mom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Somebody to Love?: A Rock-and Roll Memoir","review":"The book was in excellent condition as promised...I have orderd from Amazon.com before and will do so again....I totally trust them.

I am not even through the first section of this book, and I have found several errors: answers that are not consistent with their explanations, answers that are correct, but whose explanations are wrong and make no physiologic sense.I was able to pick up these errors in subjects that I know well, but now I doubt the answers for subjects that I don't know well, like OB and surgery."},{"rating":"2","title":"What do I do Monday","review":"Any and all of John Holt's books are to be treasured. Way back in the fifties I read them eagerly when my first son was in primary school! First I read \\"How Children Fail\\", then \\"How Children Learn\\" and others whose names I have not retained. They all deal with the kind of issues that made and make school learning hell or at least boring for really bright children, and they resonated with my soul and encouraged me to do better for my own son -- now nearly 60 and an amazing original and independent thinker leading a deeply satisfying life. For goodness sake, try it; you'll like it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I had heard great things about John Holt and was really disappointed in this book. Maybe part of it was that after reading about Charlotte Mason and reading books by John Gatto, it didn't seem so revolutionary to me. But Holt quoted psychologist Robert Liang extensively in this book, which to me seems like the most outdated psychobabble (granted this book was written quite awhile ago), saying if you make ____ mistake with your kids they may turn out schizophrenic!He then continues on with different teaching techniques, which is also surprising since the unschooling movement generally refer to him as the source of their inspiration, but say you should not \\"teach\\" children, letting them learn as they become motivated to do so. So if you're looking for unschooling information you won't find it here. It also has odd references like to a school in which teachers express anger to the students to make things \\"real\\" and children seem to be allowed to hit each other sometimes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alcott's First Novel","review":"This novel was a great find for Alcott fans. The very concept of a novel being discovered and published after the author's death is astounding! Here were get the opportunity to read the first work of the author of Little Women and a preview of LW. The moral concepts, within the fibre of this story, are very much the same. This is well written and I believe that readers will begin to care about what will happen to the main charactor, Edith Adelon. This story has all of the components of a great romance novel: impossible love, secrets, a villainess and a sweet ending. A must read for any Alcott fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good youthful effort by Alcott","review":"According to a note on the text in the Penguin Classics edition, \\"The Inheritance\\" was written by Louisa May Alcott when she was only 17 years old. This novel tells the story of Edith Adelon, an Italian orphan who lives with the aristocratic Hamilton family. This is a sentimental, romantic story about love, treachery, and a family secret. Class stratification is a significant theme.Yes, the characters are fairly shallow, the plot is predictable, and the dialogue is often very stiff and corny. But I found \\"The Inheritance\\" quite charming and enjoyable. The mild suspense leads ultimately to a satisfying conclusion. Along the way are some memorable scenes, such as a sequence involving the creation of historical tableaux.The Penguin Classics edition includes an excellent, substantial introduction by Joel Myerson and Daniel Shealy. They discuss Alcott's remarkable life and career and place \\"The Inheritance\\" in literary and cultural context."},{"rating":"1","title":"Her girlish scribbles","review":"Louisa May Alcott wrote this sugary book when she was only seventeen, and you can really tell from the writing. Her heroine Edith is beautiful, noble, humble, a perfect musician and singer, and everyone worships her; ditto with the hero, who has been nursing a broken heart until he sees Edith.The plot is very predictable and kind of boring. Basically the bad girl called Ida is trying to wreck Edith's life so she can marry the hero, and everyone finds out the truth about Edith's parentage. Lots of syrupy speeches and gooey looks and oh-so-noble pale men with wilting lily women. It's all very cliched, as if Alcott had to get the romantic novels of the day out of her system. I love Louisa May's fiction so much, but this was a youthful dud.On a small side note, there was a really wonderful version of this movie out in the late 90s, which only sort of resembles the book, and it's on DVD here on amazon! So check that out instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"too idealistic for me...","review":"This isn't the first Louisa May Alcott book that I've ever read, but it made me a little sick from sugar-shock. Everyone loves each other and money isn't very important to the characters with the exception of one person. I picked out this book because the title seemed quite interesting, but it was about Edith's absolutely pure heart for a good part of the story. Alcott did well for her first book, but not up to par. It reminds me of many other cute romances published today and I must say it isn't timeless. She wrote about English Lords and lived in New England! I've always heard that authors should write what they know, but Alcott didn't. Alcott, thankfully matured in writing over the years and I am grateful as a lover of American Literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abysmal","review":"Absolutely awful.

Only read it if you are a true Alcott fan, or there is a gun to your head."},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked it, I really, reallly liked it!","review":"While The Inheritance may not be favored over Little Women, it is still worthy of high praise. Considering that this is the first work of Louisa May Alcott, I consider the writing and storyline excellent(I know I would not have done so well in my ripe ol' teens). I will also admit I'm a sucker for a love story, and this one reads blessedly short and easy. The 'Cinderella' theme makes this a fairy tale adults can enjoy while reading it to their children.If you are looking for a short, well-written bit of romance to bring some culture into your life, I highly recommend The Inheritance as the book to do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"my favorite!","review":"in this book mrs.

There are enough jokes here to make you laugh out loud, and enough bad jokes to make you laugh just the same. And, you get a unique viewpoint on all things COM.

For example I found his remark that \\"no one has ever figured out how to make use of inheritance in OOP\\" way out to lunch.I recommend this book as a refresher companion to all those dreary COM manuals out there.

What an awesome song! Screaming fast, artfully trippy and tight as a noose, the original version of \\"Mahadeva\\" eclipses all of the band's attempted remakes, IMHO.That notwithstanding, AW is a killer trance record, with loads of adrenaline-pumping jams to trip out on.

As a beginner, I'm happy that it is mostly stretching, and the poses aren't held for long. They are held long enough for me, that's for sure!

I'm looking forward to the day when I can do the stretching from memory so I can take my \\"show\\" on the road. :-) In the meantime, the reminders as to posture and breathing throughout the 20 minute routine really help. I would recommend this DVD for beginners. There is another DVD called Back Care Yoga by Rodney Yee that might be more appropriate for those who know more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Backcare Yoga for Beginner","review":"The worst Yoga dvd I have ever bought. There is no audio instruction. You watch the same move over and over. It does not even give time to change from position to position. I like to follow video to exercise. You can definitely not do this.

I'm a yoga enthusiastic and would describe my level as intermediate-advanced. My dad has never done yoga before and has back problems. I wanted to make sure this DVD would be helpful for him and not frustrating. I went with Gaiam and Rodney Yee because I've had great experiences with his routines in the past. I regularly use his Power Yoga DVD, which is superb. This routine is short and very simple. Rodney Yee uses a chair for half of the stretches, which is a nice addition for the less flexible. If you're an intermediate user, this routine could very well be boring and too short. I didn't come even close to breaking a sweat. It is not challenging for an experienced person. If you're a beginner just starting out, this is a great introductory DVD. It is not demanding and has a slow pace. If you're looking for back stretches that are more challenging, this is not the DVD to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor recording","review":"I have had this yoga dvd before and it is a great one work out by.

That it was written by an editor with a major publisher is astonishing. I found it's primary value to be as a way of getting to sleep after a long day."},{"rating":"1","title":"You gotta be kidding me","review":"Leadership lessons of Donald \\"Rummy\\" Rumsfeld? The man who doesn't let little things like world events, force capability, or the experience level of his senior commanders get in the way of his version of reality? Ok, I decided to keep an open mind. After all, as a military officer, he is my in my chain of command. But after reading this, I have to agree with the reviewer from the UK - rubbish. The only lessons you will learn here are those that show you what not to do. Rumsfeld has single handedly alienated most of the senior officer corps, not to mention most of the military too. The anger within the military towards Rumsfeld is growing. I wouldn't be surprised if, push come to shove, at some point the military refuses to do this man's bidding. If it keeps up much longer, a coup seems certain. This book, if followed, will lead to the same situation in your company - divisiveness, anger, and ultimately implosion. Don't waste your money on this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insightful!","review":"Jeffrey Krames' biography of current U.S. Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld is laced with leadership advice and built on databases and clips. This short book, at last, places Rumsfeld's long career into a coherent framework. Probably to hit a wartime deadline, Krames based the text primarily on work published about Rummy over a 40-year period, and not on independent research. In fact, a disclaimer says the book has no endorsement or authorization from Rumsfeld or anyone around him. In the 1970s, Rumsfeld published a long list of bland but entertaining aphorisms under the title, \\"Rumsfeld's Rules.\\" Krames draws many of his leadership suggestions from that compilation. But the chronology about Rumsfeld's career dominates and fascinates. Rumsfeld is far more interesting than he seems, a much more potent and historic figure. For that reason, we recommend this book to corporate officers, journalists, news junkies, political operatives, disgruntled Saudis and all defense contractors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book about a great leader!","review":"This book has it all - from the early days with the great presidnet ever - R.

I loved the descriptions of Rumsfeld:\\"curmudgeonly, Darth Vader, Determined Warrier and final act of a four-decade-long career\\" and the parallel between Watergate and September 11th. I appreciated Henry Kissinger's personal assessments of Rumsfeld, \\"The Rumsfeld Way\\" thoughts and that he had \\"plowed the ground\\" similar to Winston Churchill, a true historic figure. I think Mr. Krames achieved his stated mission, \\"to paint an illuminating and compelling portrait\\" of Rumsfeld, the man."},{"rating":"2","title":"Leadership at its Finest","review":"I consider myself a student of leadership having read a number of books on leadership over the past fifteen years. The Rumsfeld Way by Jeffrey Krames is a first class portrayal of leadership at its finest. It's an easy read but Krames does a nice job of outlining key points at the end of each chapter that can be used with one's day-to-day leadership opportunities.The book underscores the little things that make up leadership such as listening before action and assessing a situation before setting a course of action. I found the book builds on our knowledge base of leadership while also introducing a number of user friendly techniques for those opportunties that confront most of us in our daily walk. From my perspective...it's a must read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time.","review":"The author finished the book in early 2002, therefore many of the controversial decisions Mr. Rumsfeld made are not discussed. Mr. Krames is an avid fan of the previous Defense Secretary which blinds his objectivity. He never interviews the employees that worked for the secretary in the public or private sectors. All of his ancedotes are taken from an elite group. The reader will not learn anything new about Mr. Rumsfeld's decision making."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Title Says Everything","review":"The Rumsfeld Way! Ha! Perhaps it is too harsh to give this book one star. After all, if read from the proper perspective this book might provide some valuable lessons such as:*Ignoring reality*Getting involved in a catastrophe purely by choice*Not listening to those more knowledgeable than oneself, and humiliating them for attempting to give advice*Alienating all of one's subordinates*Creating unnecessary enemies all around*Putting the lives of those for whom you are responsible in grave danger through one's incompetence and indifference*Speaking in a convoluted and irritating wayFollow the Rumsfeld Way and you too can be an utter failure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A chickenhawk who avoided armed combat","review":"Don Rumsfeld likes to portray himself as so \\"tough\\". Yet when presented with the opportunity to prove it by serving in armed combat during the Korean War, he dodged military service by sitting it out at Princeton with a student deferment.

I will fight alongside any race that loves and values freedom. It really has nothing to do with race, it's about your respect for property rights and freedom. This author gets it all wrong because he's SO HUNG UP on race. He thinks the US will divide into 3 nations by race alone. How dumb can you be.

This is not a novel as much as it is a referance book.If someone ever needed to look up facts and figures,this is the place to go.With a pie chart or bar graph on every third or fourth page it is more an encyclopedia than a novel.If you're looking for entertainment or even info-tainment, avoid this book!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very flawed logic","review":"Chittum obviously ignored the history of this country when he wrote this book. First off he engages in the kind of anti-immigrant sentiment that countless people have in the past, only he targets hispanic immigrants rather than the southern European immigrants of the late 19th century. He writes nothing of American Vernacular culture, which eventually breaks down all immigrant communities regardless of what race or ethnic group they are. Another thing I find irritating is the way he refers to New Mexico as a \\"mini third-world country\\", just because half of it's population is non-white. Overall this has failed to convince me of anything horrible happening in this country because of race or ethnicity. Also, for anyone who believes that Chittum is not a racist or right wing extremist, please take a look at his website."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Grief","review":"Oh, how sorry we all should feel for poor Mr. Chittum and all his reationary friends who have to endure the horrors of living in a progressive modern state based on such heresies as universal human rights and tolerance.

Better to revert to the Dark Ages and found new warlike nations based on blood, soil, and religious fanaticism. Not im MY future, buddy.

Black and Hispanic racism is on the rise and becoming more open and brazen with each passing day. The country is rapidly breaking up along lines of race, age, ethnicity, sex,sexual perversions,etc.,and the conquering hordes from Mexico and Central America are filling our prisons, bilking our welfare system, forming latino street gangs throughout the Southwest and openly vowing to take control of the Southwest as part of Mexico, while making every place they inhabit look like Tijuana north.

He sets out his evidence in a coherent, compelling fashion and tells everyone who cares to listen how to survive the upcoming war. Contemplating the purchase of an armored vest and moving to a place well away from long distance artillery as Mr. Chittum suggests should be enough to sober up all Americans to the dangers of multiculturalism. While many critics would be happy to just dismiss the book outright as paranoid propaganda and say that another Civil War could never happen, these people only need to look out to southern California to see the treasonous Aztlan Movement that is growing there.

After the LA Riots and the increase in crime in the early 90's, the idea of America fragmenting along racial lines seemed pretty compelling but I think the author overestimated the speed at which collapse would take place. In any event, this book is a worthwhile read because many of the predictions concerning a possible collapse and civil war may still come to pass. In addition, the author provides some good information on what to do if things fall apart. It seems to me that we are more likely to move towards a police state and economic collapse, rather than outright civil war, but it is also easy to see the polarization of our country that could confirm the author's vision in the next 5 to 10 years on account of failed leadership from both political parties."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dont buy this book unless you are ready for some startleing revelation's","review":"This book written about ten year's ago is unfolding like the daily newspaper.SO many truths that are being shown so many lies being unvealed for people who are ready for a life changeing reality check here it is if this dont get you you motivated nothing will."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chittum's Done His Research","review":"Chittum is dead right when he notes that multicultural nations rarely hold together. Diversity is a solvent not a solder. But like the previous reviewer noted, not all of his predictions hold up. In Chittum's defense, future predictions rarely hold up in books whether they're about the weather or about economic forcasting. And some of what he's predicted is coming true (ie, the increasing push for reparations). This book should be read by all those living in high-diversity areas. And one thing is absolutely true, and that this book is a compelling read, designed to get you focused on the problems to come; because they are coming. And whether they take the form of Civil War II or, as I believe, a sort of smoldering Lebanon, we should be ready."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't read the book, but he forgot one fact...","review":"White Americans are evidence of multiculturalism working. How many white Americans do you see with the name \\"John Greenberg\\" \\"Steve Bjornsen\\", \\"Richard O'Neil\\", \\"Daniel D'Amico\\" and so on? Lots of them. We didn't get those last names by accident, but rather by multiple cultures melding with each other, adopting the main culture, and discarding the old culture as incompatible with their new life.Our multicultural society has worked and it will work once the new immigrant groups assimilate into ours. However, he does have a point that some of these immigrant groups resist assimilation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Being Rational","review":"I was very obvious to me, the profound level of ignorance that this author possessed. It's clear that Mr. Chittum's racially-biased point of view is based on facts that are incorrect and points of view that are quite irrational. I pity a man that has to console himself with lies filled with ignorance and superficial, racial superiority.

Buy some dry red pepper flakes and you'll eliminate the bitterness of this sauce but otherwise replicate it almost perfectly.I much prefer the Huy Fong's Sriracha Hot Chili Sauce. It is not only hotter but it has a wonderful sweetness to it combined with some pleasant garlic notes.This is a good company but not every one of its products hits the mark. This chili paste misses the mark by a wide margin in my view.The product label lists (in this order) chiles (with seeds), salt and then vinegar. The vinegar and salt add a lot of bitterness.

I cannot figure the motivation for someone with equity in their home to sell that equity for nothing; accrued equity is one of the greatest advantages to purchasing property. This approach also does not take into account the potential for home values to plummet, as we saw recently. A better question an investor might want to ask themselves is why the homeowner is unable to sell their home despite the equity they've built up, and if it is realy an investment at all.

I take off one star only for the author's occasional right wing rants. But I guess he's entitled.

This one starts out slow but has a bang-up conclusion. As sometimes happens in his novels, the great detective (in this case the brilliant Dr. Gideon Fell) hardly appears at all. Unlike Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes stories, the personality of the detective hardly comes into play at all! This is somewhat unfortunate. The detective, in Carr's mysteries, is more a device than a character.As in some of his other books, Carr (aka Carter Dickson) in this book portrays a group of young, prankish, aristocratic Brits. These characters can be quite insufferable. Unlike P.G. Wodehouse (surely an influence on Carr), the author does not seem to recognize how annoying these upper-class twits can be!

He honed those skills while writing for critically acclaimed artists like Rahsaan Patterson and Dionne Farris, to great effect I might add. My favorite songs are \\"Dust\\" and \\"Seconds of Pleasure\\" (but there isn't a bad song on the album), great single selection by the label.

A while after, I saw this CD at the mall and recalled that I liked his first single so I decided to take a chance on it. The whole car ride home, we listened to it and it blew me away.

From coast to coast the story is filled with remarkable quotes and tales of the America so many of us take for granted. The story makes us see that America is more than a piece of land, it is a piece of history. So many of us see our land and our inalienable rights as simply every day pleasures that we will always have. By reading this book I began to think of how often I simply take a right for granted and do not stop to think of what past peoples have had to do to give these rights to me.I am glad to have read this book. It is an inspiration to the way I look at the world. I will never simply travel to go somewhere, I will travel to see the country and understand my history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intimate portrait of a great writer...","review":"What makes this book so special to me is that I feel I am close to one of the great writers of all time. Sometimes the book seems (and of course, it is) dated, sometimes it seems visionary. But most of all, it is warm and touching and the writer's obvious love of his dog is particularly dear. It makes a \\"great\\" man quite human, although it is amusing to note that Kerouac's \\"On The Road\\" is a far-superior book - a truly great work. Steinbeck's fiction is much better than this travelog, but still, it's a joy to read and I feel like I really got to know him as a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Charley was a POODLE!","review":"Written before the plethora of travelogues now available, Steinbeck was, as usual, ahead of his time. His observations are still fresh, and his style of writing as inviting as ever. After reading the other reviews of this book, however, I noticed one thing lacking: any mention of the inescapable fact that Charley was a standard poodle! Most unusual, then as now, to associate poodles with dreams of the open road. But Charley plays an important role in the book, as companion, conversation partner, and comic relief. Would the book have succeeded had Charley been a lab or a beagle? Perhaps--yet the idea of a tough and wisened writer touring the country with a poodle by his side is simply irresistible. Add this to all that is good about this book, and welcome the multitudes of poodle-lovers to its pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very exciting!","review":"...With his French poodle dog Charley, John Steinbeck set out in his truck Rocinante to explore and experience America at the age of 58. He meets a lot of different people on his way across the nation. What follows is an account of the places he goes and the people he meets during he's three-month journey. In he's journey john was not happy with most of the big American cities for example Chicago and Texas as having problems of people not being very friendly compare to the American villages. He was also appalled by racism in new Orleans.I like the description he gave of Maine and New England in general in 60's. It has not really changed, most of the things he talked about or saw are still around.My view of the book is that it is not exciting at all, it is too plain!. It does not cause any curiosity to the reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"review of Travels with Charley","review":"John Steinbeck sees the United States in another special angle or we may say in his personal angle. In John Steinbeck's book, Travels with Charley, he sees the America as a humanistic person more than a high-develop industrial country. So he focuses on the people instead of the constructions. He goes into the countryside, because in his eyes this is the root of America. In his travel, the customs and the ways the American live are the landscapes. He avoids or at least try to avoid the big cities. He would rather drive on a local than drive on a high way.

His mission is to find out more about the American people. Although he wrote about them, he felt he didn't know enough about them. The book shows how the average life of someone in California would be compared to the average life of someone living in New Hampshire. With Charley, his faithful dog, by his side, he seemed to feel very comfortable meeting people of high and low financial status, people from his very own home town and people from places he had never visited before. Although the story seems to bore the reader often, a lot of information about the American people can be fofound out by simply reading this tale of America."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vendor is 100% honest... would recommend highly","review":"Had a problem with this low cost used copy... not as describedBUT vendor 100% honest ---No problem FIX.. they stood 100% behind what they sell.Tks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Steinbeck discovers an America now long past","review":"I have read a number of John Steinbeck's works, and I plan to read the rest of his major novels.By travelling America during his life's twilight, Steinbeck paints an America that now is lost.

Enjoy !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Formatting Review","review":"I'm giving Travels w/ Charley two stars because at least there aren't any typos, and there are very few hyphenated words appearing in the middle of sentences.The problem with TWC is that all the white space between text sections has been removed (rather, overlooked), but the non-indent of the new opening paragraph remains.

Foster was better, Aldous Huxley was better, but Steinbeck was interesting. My impression when reading this book was that Mr. Steinbeck really didn't want to go on this trip and was in a rush to get back home to his Yacht and material comforts. It also seemed to me that he was actually seeking out people to have a conversation with. There are a lot better travel books than this one - but this is Steinbeck and therefore a must read.

He shares his impressions of the land itself and the characteristics it has inspired within the people who live in those lands.

Steinbeck recognizes the burning desire possessed by so many Americans at least once in their lives to travel around their country, and experience its many lifestyles firsthand. Travels with Charley has the power to calm this urge by delving deep into the many hearts of America, and blends together elements of friendship, civilization, wonder, and life in a spectacular story."},{"rating":"2","title":"An essential to travelers and non-travelers alike.","review":"Steinbeck captures the essence of what it means to be an American, using the wisdom which he gathered all his life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Gift","review":"This book was purchased as a gift for a person who is an avid reader and enjoys reading about adventures of people in the different parts of the United States. She was so pleased and is eager to share what she has read with me."},{"rating":"2","title":"ALL-TIME FAVORITE TRAVEL BOOK","review":"Travels with CharlieTravels with Charlie is about John Steinbeck buying a camper and taking his black standard poodle on a trip around the United States. He starts in New England and drove West across the northern border of the U. S. Then when he reaches the state of Washington he turned South and drove through Oregon and California. In Southern California he headed back East driving through the deep South. This is one of my all-time favorite travel books.Gunner July 2,007"},{"rating":"1","title":"Book damaged","review":"The book was not in EXCELLENT condition. The first few pages w title and copyright information, etc were torn out."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Worthwhile Odyssey","review":"This book is a book that you cannot put down. It is a charming description about a cross country journey during a time that is now lost. The reader falls in love with the dog, Charley. It is full of the love that the author has for his dog-even putting his trip on hold to have a vet look at his beloved friend. I was surprised at the irony of the ending!! I highly recommend this book to everyone. After I read the book, I researched it. One of the things that I read included a comment by Steinbeck's son that said he believed his father was writing fiction, as Steinbeck actually would have been too shy to talk to all of the strangers he met along the way. The trip was real, however. I believe the camper is on display somewhere devoted to Mr. STeinbeck."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great American Road Trip","review":"In this wonderfully entertaining book, Steinbeck takes a road trip across America and back, exploring its geography, culture, religion and society. In the process he explores the very nature of travel, why so many of us are so drawn to it and how that affects our lives. Travels with Charley in Search of America is similar in some respects to Steinbeck's 1948 A Russian Journal, although here the writing is somewhat more about America than A Russian Journal was about Russia. This book is also very different in that here Steinbeck travels with his dog as his only companion, whereas A Russian Journal was about travels with Steinbeck's close friend Robert Capa.This book is a very thought-provoking and entertaining exploration of many aspects of America. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Man and dog, doing little. Add a lot of wit- still only one star.","review":"Steinbeck can really write well, I just wish hadn't been so indulgent to think he should share such a boring trip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring! Too much details. NOT RECCOMENED!","review":"All throughout this book, John Steinbeck babbles on about his trip. It's very boring. Basically: HE loves Montana Hates change Hates racism Hate Society Gross book don't read..............."},{"rating":"1","title":"In part disappointing but not entirely so.","review":"Considering Steinbeck's undoubted and deserved reputation as one of America's greatest writers, some parts of the book are disappointing. Of course it is basically a travel diary and the descriptions of the towns, the people and the events Steinbeck meets along the way are such as many of us would include, probably in similar style in our own travel diaries. However there are two major exceptions to the above. First, Steinbeck's description of his desparate search for veterinary relief for his dog Charley when he gets ill. And second: his heart-rending description of the scenes he witnesses in segregated 1960's New Orleans, involving the women (\\"Cheerleaders\\") and their abusive treatment of a little black girl and her single white escort on her way to school. All too true historically, if impossible to imagine, some fifty years later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Travels with Charley in Search of America, 50th Anniversary edition, with forward by Jay Parini","review":"An old favorite, read as a child/young adult; re-read as a 60 year old.

Everyone should read it, especially the young."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot of fund and enjoyment","review":"This book was light entertainment and provided a lot of insight into America. It is well written and the dog gives the book more depth than one would get from a travellog."},{"rating":"2","title":"Steinbeck's Timeless Piece That Says It All","review":"Charlie (Steinbeck's dog) serves a his \\"Sanch Panza.\\" The two of them take a long trip on the \\"backroads\\" of our nation. Stienbeck is one of the few authors that can describe soemthing with but a couple of words: \\"Fly Paper Youth,\\" \\"Star-rattled sky.\\" This type of ability makes Steinbeck among the best Amercian authors ever. Travel with Charlie is no exception. Many of Steinbeck's details have stayed with me months and even years after reading his books. That to me is impressive. The musings of a wise and caring quthor as he relates to a country he thought he knew."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like an American \\"Heart of Darkness\\"","review":"I really liked this book. Strangely I went into it thinking it to be a travelogue of places and things but it's much, much more. He journeys into the soul of America. His observations are still valid and universal. To this day he's right on about Texas and Seattle. His comments about growth in Seattle could have been taken from todays newspaper. My favorite is (paraphrased) - why is it so often that progress looks like destruction. I have one question if anyone can help - I didn't follow the \\"Ci Git\\" piece."},{"rating":"2","title":"I highly recommend that anyone who can read this book.","review":"For easy reading and lessons about life, I strongly encourage anyone who has the chance to read this book. Steinbeck, the most brilliant man, stops and makes the reader think about life and how simple it could be. He takes ordinary circumstances and finds humorous things arising from them. It astounds me how anyone could jump into a vehicle and travel across the United States learning about the different cultures and personalities of the American people. If you are in for an adventure and challenge for life, I strongly suggest reading this book. The easy, flowing style of writing makes it understandable and enjoyable to read. I guarantee that every reader will be satisfied with the lessons they learn from Steinbeck. J.N.E."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book with a few great moments, and some questionable ones","review":"Travels with Charley is one of Steinbeck's better books, though several of the incidents he \\"reports\\"(?) bear a suspicious resemblance to episodes from some of his novels. Personally, the parts I enjoyed the most were those about his eponymous traveling companion Charley, an elderly French poodle, and I wish there had been more of them. I'm not sure that Steinbeck managed to learn or convey much that was very meaningful about America, but his description of his sojourn through New Orleans near the end to witness the protests against desegregation as six-year-old Ruby Bridges became the first black child to attend a white grade school (immortalized in Norman Rockwell's painting \\"The Problem We All Live With\\") is quite interesting, even moving. On the whole, despite some problems (including its dubious veracity in places), definitely worth a read. Three and a half stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Travels With Charley: In Search of America","review":"I found this book very boring and unintesting. I love reading books by Steinbeck but it seems that he gave up when he wrote this one. There was no excitement and it just seem tiring just looking at it. I would not recommend anyone to read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Quality","review":"The tape's sound quality is extremely bad. Not only does it sound like it has an echo, it also fades in and out constantly. I am not impressed with this purchase. Even though I got it for a good price, the shipping and handling fees were a complete waste of money, considering the tapes are inaudible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst book ever","review":"I am completely indifferent to Steinbeck, no biases, nothing, but I would have to say that this is by far the worst novel that I have ever read. Long, dull depictions of possibly the dryest parts of America dominate this book, along with not-so-clever interactions between Steinbeck and his dog, Charley. Though for a novel this book may be short, it certainly could have ended about 200 pages before it did and we would have gotten the message: geography and people influence each other, and it is obvious that Steinbeck traveled only through the wastelands of America."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most awful novel","review":"Travel with Charley is the most awful book I had ever read in my life. The plot of story is like going nowhere, he keeps telling the same occasion over and over again. He can tell a second of moment into two or three pages. Describe his stupid truck into more than a page. There is nothing interesting in his journey. He said he prefer went through the countryside road than the highway almost every time in the book.Travel with Charley makes me absolutely lost my interesting in reading novels. I think this would be my last novel to read if I don't have to read it. I'm not going to insult John Steinbeck's books; probably someone out there would like his books to death. I'm not discouraging people not to read his books, but this is my comment after reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lesson in writing","review":"This is a must-buy for anyone interested in travel accounts, written by a Master.Buy this and enjoy thé ride.Steinbeck and Charley are kings of thé road."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Quality","review":"I read this book as a young man and looked forward to re-reading it as an old man. I was excited to get it, but when I opened the package and saw this crummy little book I felt totally ripped off. This thing looks like a grade school reader, not a hard-cover book that you would want to put on a shelf. It is a total rip off. I refuse to pay this much money for garbage quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Steinbeck took a skim across America to find new places and people to DRINK with.... Then filled more boring pages with ego, which he had to highlight with descriptions of where/how his dog urinated on things."},{"rating":"1","title":"Authors should retire too","review":"WHAT A DISAPPOINTMENT!Steinbeck has reinvented himself in this work as a pretentious bore. Was this the man who wrote East of Eden? Hardly seems possible.This Steinbeck comes across as a pseudo intellectual who names his truck after Don Quixote's horse seems unaware that the New York license plates on the truck will influence what people think of him.He spends time between boring observations inserting a combination of Hemingway toughness and sophomoric intellectual \\"name dropping\\".I am sorry after 100 pages I quit...most of his insights were wrong and the few that were good weren't worth the pain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!!!","review":"In this rather short novel, Steinbeck tells the reader about the most memorable parts of his cross-country trip with his dog. Unfortunately, these memorable moments are among the most boring narratives that I have ever read! Steinbeck wastes half of the book on an in-depth study of what his French poodle, Charley, prefers to urinate on, a topic that I personally do not care about at all.Ultimately, I think that had this novel been written in the Middle Ages, it would have quickly replaced the rack as a popular torture method."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good book, missing page","review":"The book was excellent, except for the missing page. I had to return it and I am still looking for another centennial edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good travel book.","review":"I love Steinbeck, so I try to read what ever he has written. This book was a total surprise, it is so diferent from his other books. I think this would appeal to people who are not Steinbeck fans. For the loyal reader it is a surprise to see his veiw of a country on the bring of the Interstate revolution. He observation of trailor park life is great, and I hear you can see the truck that he drove at the Steinbeck Museum in California.This is one of my 3 favorite travel books. The other two being On the Road and Henry Rollins's \\"get in the van\\". If your going on a raod trip you should bring along one of these books so that you can enjoy the down time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid effort","review":"We all know the drill; the even numbered Classic Trek films are the only ones worth getting, and this DVD release is the one to get if you haven't picked up a copy of Trek VI yet.

A solid package."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shakespeare Spoke Klingon","review":"Oh my gosh, there's nothing more exciting than watching a bald Klingon with a British accent quote Shakespeare!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie-Better than most.","review":"This film,the sixth and last that featured the original crew in its' entirity,is truely one of the best in the series,ranking right up there with Wrath of Kahn.It is definately better than The Voyage Home(over rated Star Trek pap,if you ask me!!!)and has a lot of originality,unlike Star Trek 4 and ,Insurrection ,and Nemesis."},{"rating":"2","title":"FYI - no booklet is enclosed","review":"I was all set to return this disc when I opened it due to the lack of a booklet/chapter listing. It turns out Paramount did not include one in this package, apparently to cut costs.Paramount is also releasing all six of these Trek movie special editions in a box set. It's too bad they don't offer a way for collectors to purchase the actual empty box itself to house their set in."},{"rating":"2","title":"The end of a golden era!","review":"Aside from the fact that this movie is the last that the entire cast of the original series made, this movie was great far verious other reasons. The Kirk was indirectly the deciding factor on weather or not The Federation and the Kligon Empire would remain at war was an excellent plot point and His(and the crews) retirement and the signing of the treaty happening at roughly the same time also was an excellent plot point. The storyline in general was great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Star Trek","review":"One of the best in the franchise, ties Wrath of khan in my book. !!! a must for any star trek fan of any generation !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I miss Star Trek","review":"The movie was good, however not as good as the original season. I can only now look forward to the current movies, and hope for cameo appearances."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best of the movies","review":"The movie deals with a intersting concept, what happens when you enemys are no longer your enemys. This film was made shortly before the end of the cold war and this is reflected in the film.The large powerful Klingon Empire is waning in strangth after the explotion of the moon Praxis (it's main source of power). It opens a diplomatic channel to its old arch enemy the United Federation of Planits.Kirk faces a delemma, the Enerprise is sent to escort the Klingon diplomat, Gorcon, to Earth for peace talks. Kirk hates Klingons, they killed his son in Star Trek III. Kirk is trying to cope with his long standing distrust of his enemys when Gorcon is assasinated, Kirk is blamed, an Spock must solve the mystery of who the real killer is before the chance for intergalactic peace has ended.A excellent final entry into the original movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Klingons don't know Shakespeare","review":"I enjoyed this movie very much, I liked the action, the space battles, the drama, and yes, Sulu should have gotten his own TV series as captain of the Excelsior as a spin off to this film. (Why that series never took off, and \\"Enterprise\\" did, will always remain a mystery to me) Two things bothered me about the film. First, there should have been more of a send-off for the original cast. There is a nod towards this at the very end of the movie but it was not enough. Secondly, I'm sorry...but there is no way that an alien race such as the Klingons would know Shakespeare. Yes, I know director Nick Meyer is a Shakespeare fan and was making a reference to WWII germany and that the film is basically a satire of the cold war...but Shakespearean Klingons make about as much sense as Vulcans speaking in Eminem lyrics. Just plain silly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glasnost in space, one of the best in the series.","review":"Normally I am not much of a Star Trek fan, I think the series is a little too nice and sweet, but I really liked The Undiscovered Country. It has a better plot than usual for a Star Trek movie and the cast does a good job. Christopher Plummer as a villainous one-eyed alien really steals the show, especially when he starts quoting Shakespeare. Well timed with the breakthrough of Glasnost in the Soviet Union, this movie showing the same thing happening in the Star Trek universe appeared at exactly the right moment, but even now, ten years later it is still effective."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the Originals","review":"The last voyage of the original cast and crew was one that will not be forgotten. The DVD enhances the experience even more. There is also a teaser trailer on this DVD that is most interesting. Don't pass this opportunity up."},{"rating":"2","title":"PEACE BETWEEN THE FEDERATION AND THE KLINGONS","review":"Nicholas Meyer does ANOTHER fine job directing this 6th installment of the 'TREK' series. He also directed the 2nd. This film is BOTH very sad and very happy for 'TREKKIES'. It's sad because IT'S THE SWAN SONG for the original 'TREK' cast members, and it's happy because it shows the events that led to the 'KLINGON EMPIRE' joining the 'FEDERATION'. This predates the now classic series 'STAR TREK : THE NEXT GENERATION'."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fitting Finale!","review":"While there are a few glaring continuity errors, as well as a few anachronisms such as looking up Klingonese in books, this adventure plays much better with repeated viewings. The mystery aspect of the plot is what tends to stand out over time, that and how well George Takei plays a Captain in his own right. This will indeed be our last film with the original cast since the recent passing of DeForrest Kelley. Hoepfully the current producers of Star Trek will resurrect Captain Kirk before it really is too late."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, but not great","review":"I looked forward to this film before it came out in theatres since Star Trek V was so horrible, alas this effort is only so-so. The character interactions were good, I liked that part. What I didn't like was the silly whodunnit storyline that was too predictable anyway. It had so many holes. For instance on the prison planet, why not just shoot Spock and McCoy right away? Why set up this elaborate scheme with Iman's character and then surround them? I mean, what if they managed to escape? Which they did by the way.Also, why didn't the bioscanner on the transporter pick up the klingon blood that the two shooters had on their boots when they reenergized? How did they manage to beam out without the bridge knowing about it? These were some of the little things to be sure, but they really add up in this movie.A very disappointing movie. I guess Star Trek I & IV will be the only installments with the original crew that I enjoyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable, mediocre, unimaginative","review":"I don't understand why everyone likes this movie so much. There is nothing special about it. It is predictable, has a wooden plot, and runs like a standard TV episode of virtually any action TV show. There is no imagination, depth, or creativity in it. It's just a simple shallow drama. Nothing stands out from it. I have no idea what the rest here is seeing. It doesn't compare at all with any of the other Star Trek movies. Even Star Trek V is better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"The BOXed set to include the booklet for the sixth movie.","review":"Have you ever purchased a MAJOR movie release which doesnt have a booklet or atleast a token insert? Probably, NOT. Except the executives at Paramount feel they can get away with it by short- changing the person most likely to loyally purchase the sixth installment of the Star Trek movies === the Star Trek fan.You would think, that as the last movie with all the original cast that they would perhaps have included a commemorative signoff booklet or something.Preying on the Star Trek fan's desire to have a \\"complete set\\",Paramount is going to release all six movies as a boxed set which more than likely is going to include extras forcing the loyal fan to purchase (for the third time) all six movies again because this set WILL include that ever elusive booklet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately, a lot of boring talking heads","review":"In my opinion, this is the worst ST movie. Apart from the effects, ST V was better.ST VI was extremely long, involved lots of \\"commentary\\" dialogue (where the writer seemed to be extrememly concerned that we all think him well-read and intelligent), and not much plot movement.It would have made a better episode, with some tight editing,The best part of the movie is the last 15 minutes when the incredibly obvious \\"secret plot\\" is finally revealed, and the Enterprise shoots the modified photon torpedo at the \\"To be or not to be\\" captain.Don't waste your money, unless you HAVE to have the whole collection. ST V is funnier. The Voyage Home (IV) is the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paramount Doesn't Fail to Disappoint...Again!","review":"Again, Paramount fails to bring us \\"TREK\\" in DVD quality. Just like Generations, the quality of picture was well below that of most \\"re-mastered for DVD\\" movies. Although the sound quality was great, it still didn't make up for the \\"VHS\\" picture quality. I liked the story a lot, and I enjoyed watching it in the theaters, but on DVD this is average at best. Again, no special features except for the 2 movie trailers. I hope Paramount gets the message that we want the movies to be \\"re-mastered\\" for DVD and will pay for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"To be... or not... to be...","review":"Saw it in the theater years ago, with Klingons and Admirals and Lieutenants and an Andorian or two, sat down and listened to some absolutely incredible music during the opening credits and, along with everyone else, jumped a foot and a half in the air half a second after the Director's name disappeared from the screen. Those of you who saw it in the theater know what I'm talking about, those who only saw it on video can imagine, and those of you who haven't seen it yet missed the best ST movie of all, and one of the best SciFi movies of all time.It wasn't until I'd watched it on video a dozen or so times that I started to really appreciate the \\"damn show trial\\" scene. I have it memorized, and yet every time I watch I stop and gape at the acting.And the final showdown scene \\"The thing's gotta have a tailpipe...\\" is still exciting.It's in my top five movies list, and at the top of my ST Movie list.~~~Helmsman - \\"She'll fly apart--\\"Sulu - \\"FLY her apart then!!\\"~~~"},{"rating":"2","title":"Only one thing missing....","review":"Star Trek VI is almost the equal of Star Trek II, and the fact that Nick Meyer is the director can't be a coincidence. Maybe Christopher Plummer tries a little too hard to out-Montalban Ricardo Montalban, but he almost pulls it off.The only down side to this DVD edition is that it does not include the several added scenes included on the laserdisc version. That's the only version I've seen the last several times and it seems strange to have those scenes missing.It's still good to have this version available on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie...good DVD","review":"ST6 is a great movie. This DVD presentation from Paramount Home Video doesn't quite measure up to the original material. The Super 35 image (2.35:1 theatrically) has been cropped to about 2:1 (the same transfer used for the laserdisc), but the picture fares fairly well. The REAL discovery here, though, is the Dolby Digital soundtrack. ST6 has never sounded THIS good--even in the theater, unless you were lucky enough to catch this one in the one few Digital screenings. This 1991 5.1 soundtrack has enough directional effects and bass to rival the newer snazzier 5.1 soundscapes. Also, there are 2 trailers included, including a swell-looking full-length theatrical trailer.Here's hoping that Paramount embraces the 16X9 format in the future, and they start striking NEW transfers of their old laserdisc releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Movie","review":"Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country is the ultimate triumph for Kirk and his crew. It is my second favorite movie after Star Trek II. The movie really does go where no man has gone before. Nicolas Meyer did an excellent job directing the movie. Not only does the movie have some excellent quotes, but the dinner with the Klingons shows the distrust between StarFleet and the Klingons. Not only that, but the whole movie has an excellent idea. It stresses that change is inevitable. I would recommend this movie to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Movie, Poor Execution of the Format","review":"The movie is a great transition making Generations unneeded, but Paramount hasn't quite figured out all the benefits of DVD. The lack of extra features is very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Star Trek Movie","review":"ST VI: The Undiscovered Country is, in this reviewer's opinion - the best of all the Star Trek films; both \\"Original Series\\" and \\"The Next Generation\\".

The plot is interesting and the more than a decade old special effects still look great. This movie starts the friendship between the klingons and the federation that was carried on in Star trek the Next Generation. The acting is excelent and the Enterprise riding off into the sunset at the end is priceless. This is a must see for the trekkie and non-trekkie alike"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie but many problems","review":"Amazon/Widescreen rated this movie (DVD) as 5 for picture and 5 for sound. Both ratings are way too high. I love this movie and rate it 4, but the DVD is truly disappointing. In addition to the characters' lips not matching the sound, the sound is often distorted and muffled. In addition, the picture often has a line on the left side (which sometimes cannot be corrected.) How many times per movie do you want to stop play and run alignment?It seems to me that Paramount really slopped this one out and didn't even try to make a quality DVD. The VHS is better if you can believe that.I do not understand how 20th Century Fox can do such a nice job on the old Alien and Warner Bros. can also enhance Bladerunner, yet this Star Trek movie is absurd in quality compared to them.I hesitate to purchase future Paramount DVD's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic \\"Classic Trek\\"","review":"By far the best of the Classic series (Yes, even better than \\"The Voyage Home\\") and as good as First Contact or Insurrection.

The whole wall shakes. But all that aside this is the one of the strongest Trek films only bettered by II and First Contact. The principles of Star Trek are closely adhered to and the Cast Autograph sign off at the end of the movie was a GREAT way to end the last trek movie to have the complete old-series cast.

Star Trek 6 is a cleverly written Sci-Fi murder mystery with a very powerful and tension filled climax. ST6 has a great theme song and amazing special effects.

Also, MacMillan/Sams Publishing seems unable to post the sample code files on their website, as promised in the book. And don't bother with the author's email or website.

Apparently, the wrong film speed was used in transferring the film to DVD, stretching the film by an additional half hour. The film's tempo is therefore slowed down a great deal, and the pacing and timing of the various comedy scenes are very much ruined. The DVD does have decent picture and sound (mono) quality.This dated and predictable film was nevertheless well-acted by Jameson Thomas as the farmer and Lillian Hall-Davis as his housekeeper. Hall-Davis also starred in another Hitchcock's silent comedy \\"The Ring\\" (a much better film), also available as a Laserlight DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Hitchcock Film In Name Only That Goes On For Ever","review":"I have nothing against silent films. In fact Clara Bow's 'It', Lon Chaney's 'The Phantom of The Opera' and Louise Brooks's 'Pandora's Box' are amongst my all-time favourites. But with the exception of 'The Lodger', Hitchcock never really got going in silent films. 'The Farmer's Wife' certainly had the potential for an easy going, enjoyable comedy, but NOT when it lasts over 2 hours. I challenge anyone to watch this film in one sitting without their eyelids feeling increasingly heavy. On the plus points, Laserlight has dispensed with one of those embarrassing Tony Curtis introductions, and has provided us with a newly recorded (and very good) score. The picture quality is also very good. If you're tempted to buy this DVD because it's a Hitchcock film, I'd say don't. It is only worth a look to anyone with an interest in silent films or a genuine Hitchcock enthusiast."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works OK","review":"Worked exactly what I ordered it for.

The author Peter Hargitai does a good job at portraying the mixed emotions and experiences a boy faces as he is growing up. The beginning of the book displays cliffhangers for the readers as Attila goes through life and death situations. But there is an excessive use of flashbacks in the first half of the story that confuses the reader. The second half of the book should be completely deleted from the book, as it focuses on the future. As a whole, Attila is a good piece of literature. All it needs is some beneficial editing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attila","review":"As soon as I started to read Attila, I couldn't put it down.

To begin with, this has got to be one of Eddie Murphy's weakest performances ever. He's just boring. His family is fairly dull as well ranching from bland to obnoxious. The script isn't that great either. In the Nutty Professor, many excused the toilet humor because of Murphy's great performance or because of the occasional, witty line.

From that day on his childhood ability to communicate with animals is back. Soon, animals are showing up at his home to get help.

At first people think hes gone crazy and insane so they lock him up in a hospital then after he proves he isn't insane and the animals are talkin to him he winds up a hero and a good vet. I recommaned this movie its a great family movie and its so funny. Eddie Murphy played the vet real well and I dont think that with out him in it it would be as funny as it was.

This isn't one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who knew homosexuals could be this boring?","review":"The Seminarian has all the depth, subtlety and dramatic flair you'd expect from a Christian Youth Camp play. It's a tedious meditation on the angst of gay christians, without having anything original to say on the subject. It's certainly well-intentioned, but also mind-numbingly, at times even hilariously earnest. The dialogue is gratingly banal and predictable, though several of the actors frequently don't seem to understand their own lines. The pace is glacial. And, most annoyingly, the characters rarely speak face-to-face when a phone call will suffice. So watching the movie is a bit like working for a few hours at a call centre. If you're a gay christian in need of affirmation, then skip this and watch Prayers For Bobby. Better yet, read The God Delusion and really expand your mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHERE'S THE MOVIE","review":"I'm still taken aback by the oddity of this movie.

Can't believe something like this saw the light."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Production quality, plot, and theology","review":"The film concept was interesting and held the potential to be very thought-provoking and innovative. However, the writers appear to have a poor grasp of theology or the nature of academic research, making the writing inauthentic and unbelievable. This also killed any of the theological import it could have had.Further, the production values were poor at best. The camera was kept almost exclusive at a middle/close-up, with very few to non-existent cut-aways or alternate shots. Long takes cans be effective when they have a reason, but here they were merely dull. Further, the sets were bare and inauthentic and uninteresting. The shots were almost uniformly too long (each one could have lost a few seconds at least), making the pacing unbearably slow.Overall, there is almost nothing to recommend this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad American Gay Cinema","review":"Slow paced, bad acting, all about the aspiring actors in a really poor script. Not worth watching. I am dissapointed at american gay films, you see depth in international films, where characters are complex and they just happen to be gay. In american films, we are seeing the same formula, boy has crush on another cute boy and there is drama.I wish we could see better american gay films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow and Disappointing","review":"I have to totally agree with the comments by \\"Galileo\\" below, especially, \\"...the dialogue was something you might hear from 13 year olds.\\" With a title like 'The Seminarian,' I expected to see a drama revolving around the conflicts of a seminary student between his personal convictions and the morality system of a very traditional church. This movie, to the contrary, is about a young 20-something who is frantically searching for a loving relationship, the guys he falls in love with fail him, and he ends up in a state of painful disappointment and confusion. There are 2 or 3 shallow references to God along the lines of, \\"What does this say about God?\\", with no further development or insight. The seminary is just a backdrop to the story: the setting could easily have been a high school. Think \\"Glee\\" without the good music. I gave it two stars because I think the main actor, Mark Cirillo, shows promise for a good acting career in a more professional production."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad movie","review":"One word can describe the entire movie: HORRIBLE.

That sums it up. I've read practically every book-length bio (nearly 50) of William Shaksper of Stratford and Chute's is one of the emptiest biographically speaking, though that means (to here credit) she added less than the usual amount of speculation.

Neverthess, I was curious to see what a non-literary bio of the man might reveal, and was pleased to find much in this book of fresh interest about him and his times. You might be surprised, as I was, for example, to learn how common it was in Elizabethan England for the ordinary man to be involved in lawsuits, or that London sported a two-storey shopping mall. But the choisest plum -- by my peculiar lights -- is a subjunctive-mood classic angrily uttered by the Bard's aged partner at the New Globe Theatre, on the occasion of his being disburdened of the day's ticket receipts by thugs in the employ of creditors: \\"If my son come, he will thump you hence!\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A show for oldies that even kids enjoy","review":"I'm here in Sydney Australia watching reruns of the first Buffy series and thinking that though this is a show for adults like me, it's great that even young kids of 20 or 30 can enjoy it too!

It is very good pop. The rest of the recording is rather repetitive and unimaginative. I would suggest at least trying out samples of the mp3s before buying, and even just downloading that song."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awoo time....","review":"Good CD. The flavor of the Hidden Cameras music is undeniably palatable. The tunes are just fun (despite lyrics that might be considered to be \\"at the far end of some spectrum or another\\"). If you'd like a couple more melodies to carry around in your head whether you like it or not...you'll have to have to add this CD to your Hidden Cameras' collection. I couldn't give it 5-stars 'cause I liked their last CD just a little more (I suspect their fist CD is quite \\"catchy\\" as well). There are songs on this disc that I wouldn't have wanted to miss, though. It's good summertime music and also good music to keep your mood \\"up\\" in the more dreary months of the year (try not to get hung up on the words and meaning that accompanies the music)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eccentric Gay Canadian Goodness","review":"I saw The Hidden Cameras live in Toronto, in 2004. I was dragged to the concert, because I didn't think \\"gay church folk\\" was my thing, but I was stunned by the energy and melodies produced by this group. Though I cannot help but compare Joel Gibb's intonation, quirky lyrics and yelps to David Byrne, the group definitely has a distinctive sound.Yes, The Hidden Cameras can be repetitive. And yes, they are twee. However, their music is infectiously upbeat and whimsical. The oft-crude lyrics only add to the boisterous compositions of this stand-out Canadian band.Worth the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beginner book on TCL/TK - very little web programming","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. The title suggets that the book covers tcl programs for the web. I was expecting sockets, http, ftp, etc.. There is a total of 4 pages that deals with sockets. Some good coverage on tclets but minimal. The vast majority of the book (90%) deals with the various widgits in tk and tcl programming constructs.

But this I attribute to Bostitch's horrible packaging and UPS's inherent predeliction to crush everything that comes thier way. Like other reviewers, I contacted Bostitch and they sent replacement gagues, but on top of that, the pressure release valve was bent so bad that it stripped it's threads and now the thing leaks pretty much all of the time. When it decides to not leak, the thing is a beast, and will have you framing walls and tacking up trim all day long. All the faults lie in the packaging/handling. Were it delivered harm-free, it would be a workhorse."},{"rating":"1","title":"very poor packaging...","review":"The price was good for the specs but did not have the chance to try out because it was damaged during shipping. Handle was bent (caused the crack in the plastic covering), oil all over the place, both gauges were bent inward and broken (gauge housing is plastic... not metal like others). Box was fine except one hole in the side."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Seane Corn is obviously a gifted Yogi but I was very disappointed with this DVD. The instructional tape is thorough but very. very slow. She seems to take \\"Forever\\" to explain a posture before you are prompted to get in the position. The \\"Just breathing\\" DVD is just that and no other voice instruction. It is pretty to watch but impossible to follow unless you keep looking at the screen. Unless you stare at the screen you are bound to miss some of her transitions from one move to the next. A quick \\"naming the pose\\" would have been very helpful. I have been practicing Yoga for about eight years now. I am a very physical person who likes an aerobic flow to Yoga. I though that was the approach with this DVD since it is titled Vinyasa Flow. Again very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite...","review":"This is an excellent beginner and intermediate tape as beginners will feel they are getting one on one instruction and intermediates will fine tune their posture. This is by far the most precise and technical instruction I have seen. I wonder though if after I know the routine by heart if the constant instruction will become somewhat distracting. Once I have this one down pat I would definitely look forward to Seane doing a more intermediate video with a little less technical instruction and Perhaps her doing the routine without speaking but hearing her voice in the backround guiding you into the poses and breaths. I definitely loved how it was just her and no class. All in all I loved her! She is defintely inspiring!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T USE!!","review":"Should not be used with Thunderbolt!

The 'comfortable, no adjustment needed' headband was such a sloppy fit that the ear cups hung nearly an inch lower than they should have at my ear. With shipping charges and restocking fee to the seller, I can't see that it will be worth my while to return them, but I was sure disappointed. Maybe they'll fit over a hat, but don't assume they'll give you a comfortable fit just because you have an adult head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must-read for beginners in comparative religion","review":"I found this book while getting my masters in religious education.

Due to injuries I sustained to my right wrist and hand, I experience pain within 5 minutes of using a conventional mouse. The glidepoint technology has spared me from much of that pain. Over the years, I have purchased 5 glidepoints (I use one at home and one at the office). Considering the amount of wear and tear I put them through (I am on the computer for 8+ hours a day at work and at least 2 hours a day at home), I am quite happy with their durability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only Supports 3 Buttons","review":"We purchased this device hoping that we could program left/right mouse buttons on the bottum and Page Up/Page Down on the other two buttons to the left and right of the touchpad. Our goal was to be able to navigate PowerPoint via the additional two buttons. The device is advertised as a 4-button touchpad. However, after installing and talking to Adesso support, I discovered that the drivers only allow you to program 3 buttons. If you only need 3 buttons, this is a great device. However, because it is advertised as a 4 button device, I am giving it only two stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Had to download updated software from Adesso","review":"Nothing more frustrating than installing software that comes with hardware that does not work. This Adesso Smart Cat touchpad came with Adesso software version 3.3. After installing the OEM software, the Glidepoint software would not open on Windows XP w/SP3.

The plastic body so poor that the device came to me slightly warped. So now when I run my finger over the pad it constantly wobbles. My review would be at least 2 stars better if this device cost between 10-15 dollars. But at $54 this was a really bad purchase. As for the performance, it works just fine. The touch pad sensitivity is a little sloppy and given the small surface area this is causing me problems.

This is one of several early Hitchcock films that I'm sure would have been lost without trace had Hitchcock's name not appeared on the credits. In fact, Hitckcock probably wished it had disappeared without trace; there really is very little to commend this dull, boring movie. As for the DVD itself, the picture and sound quality are of an acceptable standard and Laserlight has also included a trailer for 'Dial M For Murder'. But there's no getting away from the fact that this is a cheapie DVD for Hitchcock completists only."},{"rating":"1","title":"A tedious attempt","review":"Generally I find the early Hitchcock films unique in different ways but this one could have ANY directors name on it and it would still be a bad film. It doesn't have that 'Hitch' feel to it and if the first reviewer was correct in saying he was forced to do it -- I believe it.I couldn't even understand the actors so I went looking for subtitles hoping there would be an English set but no such luck, I just had to wait for half an hour for my ears to adjust to the dialects, then I could understand why I was I was bored.The auction scene is the only one that bears any resemblence to a Hitchcock movie. Small wonder I paid more for the shipping and handling than I did for the film."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very old movie","review":"This Laserlight version is decent quality, given that the movie is almost 70 years old.

First, the young reader (or audience) may not initially realize that main characters \\"Jane\\" and \\"Teddy\\" are the dolls of the titular \\"Lily\\" and \\"Willy.\\" Second, after several gentle scenes where Willy's Teddy copies whatever Lily does with \\"Jane\\" (\\"Jane wants to climb a tree. Teddy too.\\"), Teddy surprises us by not copying the nap that Lily gives Jane: (\\"Jane wants to take a nap. Bear NO!\\")It's a nice indirect take on the difficulties of naptime and the individuality of toddlers. The soft colors and simply told story will be popular with very young toddlers, With only 12 thick pages and 22 different words, this board book may also appeal to the very early reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not get into this one!","review":"I'm a huge fan of Ernest Hill, however I did not like this book which was purchased on my kindle.

I felt engaged to it form the first down to the last chapter. Mr. Hill has a way with words. I feel there were some underline sexist approaches through out the book, but still never the less a great book. I saw that Love can and will be blinding to those who don't want to open their eyes to reality. I am glad Maurice mad the decision he mad, but upset with Omenita. I believed in her potential in growing from her past, and desired her to think differently of her surroundings. A key point that was made early on in the novel that we all should take heed to, was never let who you came from nor what people think of you control your destiny. As an individual you decide what you will endure so choose what is meant for you instead of another's burdens.

However, I am 5'10\\" tall and this presented some problems. Mainly, the head rest is not high enough and the seat is not long enough. In order to get my head on the headrest, I need to slouch in the seat. Slouching in the seat exacerbates the fact that the seat isn't long enough. After 10-15 minutes of sitting in a seat that isn't long enough you start to feel some serious discomfort in your back thighs.

I was not able to fold either chair. No matter what I did, these chairs would not fold up into their original size to fit in the bags. After 20 minutes of trying to force these chairs to fold, I gave up.

So, I inched myself up a little bit and it felt better. But I couldn't imagine sitting in it for any great length of time.My husband, who is six inches taller than me, came in and sat in the chair.

It is, however, no worse on either of these counts than any of the similar, more expensive ones I've tried.

While its campside appeal is probably obvious, its biggest use for me is on the beach. It doesn't work very well for face-down tanning, but for beach parties, it rules. It's by far the most comfortable way to spend time at the beach. The beverage cup holders and foot rest make it an absolute luxury. And its lightweight construction and portability make it easy to keep in the trunk of your car at all times-just in case the beach mood strikes. Definitely worth the reasonable price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get what you pay for","review":"I bought this chair for my dad for his birthday, it worked wonderful for about a week, then one of the joints that connects the foot rests to the chair broke (he was just sitting in it when it gave way, and he fits well under the weight limit). Also, on the foot rest, on the side where it broke, the seam is coming undone and looks as if it won't last long. We still use it from time to time, we're able to prop the leg of the foot rest against the chair and it holds, but if you don't want to have to deal with something like that, you should look into a different chair.

I've had to return 2 different sets. The first set were about a week old and my husband went to pick them up and put them in his backpack to go on a trip, and the eye cup came right off in his hand. Amazon was great about replacing it. Now I'm returning the replacement, because, within a week, the entire eye cup/focusing mechanism (so both eye pieces and the stem, etc.) came out of the housing. Both pairs had been treated properly, and never dropped. This is just shoddy workmanship. Bushnell used to be really good, but obviously quality control is no longer a factor or consideration. Perhaps because they are MADE IN CHINA?????? At the same time, you get what you pay for I suppose. I'll try an expensive set and we'll see if they are in fact any better; I suspect the lack of quality control is a larger issue than the price paid."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was definatly a great book!","review":"this book was about a human girl named jessica, and she writes about vampires' historuies under a pen name- ash night. what she doesn't know is that the creatures and the characters that she thought to be a figment of her imagination, are really alive and they know about her stories. the vampires also want tokill her because thye know who she realy is, and they will kill her if they get the chance to. she doesnt realize they exist until one of them shows up at her school. though she reconizes him from her stories, she doesnt beleive its him, and hes been told to kill her, as shes disturbing the vampire world....this is a relly gud story, and if you like anything about vampires or something of the sort, you should read this book. this author is gery talented 4 her age, and i hope she writes more on these spesfic characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coincidence?","review":"I am a big fan of Ms. Rhodes, I'll be honest, I liked this book and the one before it. I love vampire stories and have also read the anita blake series by Laurell K. Hamilton. But, I haven't read any Anne Rice books, only watched the movie. A couple of days ago, I watched Queen of the Damned as it was released to DVD and what I found were several similarites between Anne Rice's movie and this book. Both main characters, (the young girl some how tied to the vampire race) are named Jessica and both girls become powerful vampires in the end once they fall in love with the powerful, ruthless, yet passionate vampire (Aubrey and Lestat). Coincidence? I hope so. None the less, I liked the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Young Adult Novel!","review":"A very close friend of mine introduced me to Amelia Atwater-Rhodes, and I have been captivated ever since. What I found most interesting was that she is the same age as me and she gives me a lot of inspiration to follow my dreams and be an author. It just seems to suck you in and keep you wanting to keep reading. I sugest this book to anyone who enjoys a good vampire novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Move over, Rice.","review":"DEMON IN MY VIEW and IN THE FOREST OF THE NIGHT does not compare to Anne Rice's novels in a sense, but it's is enough to join her league. DEMON IN MY VIEW is a vampire story of the powerful Aubrey and the young Jessica Allodola.Jessica is an author, who writes under the pseudonym Ash Night and is a bestseller. She is a loner at school, but everyone at school loves her work. And though she can ally to many people at school, Jessica prefers the company of the her black laptop. On the first day of senior year, she meets Alex Remington - and everything goes downhill from there... including their staying alive.Amelia Atwater-Rhodes' novels are so beautifully written, that if I didn't know her age, I've thought she was 30 or so. Amelia is surely to become the next big thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"The romance is plainly unrealistic in my taste","review":"The romance is pathetically told. Of all the guys in school she begins flirting with Aubrey? Why? He's annoying to a fault and the romance is turned into physical attraction, it's just plain teen lust. The story was sadly told and turns into Amelis's fantasy of being hot and a hot guy falling for her. It's a moronic story by a writer with poor talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic attempt","review":"This book just over uses the whole vampire and human being fall for each other thing. Amelia streotypes the whole outcast thing making them all out as cynical think they are better then everyone.The writer who happens to be writing the exact events in exchange . . . see where I am going. This book is full of originality and no thought up ideas by her own creative mind. This book doesn't evn show a creative atmosphere. I admit the vampire being able to survive in the sunlight is fine but i think if she was going to change that se should at least tried to change the world a little rathe then setting it in our world using modern world science fiction.I can't think od anyone who could relate to her character: Jessica. I know plenty of outcast who love writing but they aren't cold and heartless. She doesn't have have a soul. This book is crap. I have never read something so inexperienced by someone my age. I have read better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than In the Forests...","review":"I will admit that I thought this book was better than than In the Forests of the Night, yet it still did not stand well on its own. As a book written by someone in her teens, it is better than passing. As a piece of fiction on its own, it is a little contrived and unoriginal. Though I like the character Jessica, I liked her more the first times I saw her, as Alisa in The Last Vampire series and Anita from the Anita Blake mysteries. If you have read any of the books from either of those series, you will see the... shall we say similarities? If it were not for the novelty of the author's age, and her obvious, but still to be developed, talent, I would say don't read this. But this book IS interesting, in its own way. If contradictory. And a bit unoriginal. But still, interesting. Try it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slightly Disapointed..","review":"Though, this book is slightly longer than the first one, I was still disapointed. First of all, the authors writing style seems to not have improved at all, and her voice sounds like that of Anne Rice and a blend of several other writers, thus denying the quality of uniqueness that makes you want to jump in and gobble up every word. Not only that, but the story is rather unoriginal as well. If you have ever read \\"The Last Vampire\\" by Christopher Pike, then you will see that the relationship between Jessica and Aubrey is very similar to that of Sita and Seymour (Seymour also writes true stories about vampires). Still, it's worth a read to make your own opinion. I would have given this book a two and a half if I could have."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Don't let the summary fool you. It sounds interesting, but it's horrible. The plot is pointless, the characterizations are unrealistic, and the main character is definitely not likeable. The entire time I was reading the book, I kept waiting for the good part to start, and then I read the last page and realized it never came. I wouldn't recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic attempt","review":"This book just over uses the whole vampire and human being fall for each other thing.

I waited two weeks, and forced myself to get all the way through it. The thing I found least exciting about this book is that she wrote the book about her books! Only a writer down on her luck writes like that. Also, every character was dark, gloomly, the same. I LOVED her last book, In the Forest of the Night. Then in this book, the vampires turned from superman strong to can't kill a girl. I was disappointed at this. When I was finished with this book I thought, I can write better then this. Now I am writing my own book. Her books only got published was because she is a teen. Publishers thought, \\"Money-maker!\\" Well thanks to you, Amelia, there is going to be a lot more teen writers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just doesn't have that spark . . .","review":"There are too many plot holes, it's just too unoriginal. Just like reading one of Christopher Pike or Anne Rice's books. The ending was quite very weak. The book was just too weakly written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive writing but something was lacking...","review":"I think that the writing was impressive, especailly on a 16-year-old. The story was pretty good but something was missing. I liked seeing Aubery return and lots of charecter devolpement in his direction. But I found a few things strange about it. It almost felt like the author was putting herself in the lead charecter spot. And with the whole Aubery story-lline was like reading \\"Daughters of Darkness.\\" He reminds me way to much of Ash, an evil charecter in the first book but he has a change of heart in the second when he meets his soulmate. I'm looking forward to her next book, I hope her writing will mature along with her age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Demon in my view","review":"Jessica's story ideas come to her in dreams. She dreams of vampires: how they're changed, their fights, their love, even their secret hide out. She doesn't really believe in vampires. She doesn't know that her dreams are all real. But the vampires do and they're ticked. Aubrey is sent to kill her but he just cant. So Fala gives him a choice: kill her or change her."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've read better","review":"I agree with the \\"reader from the USA\\". Yes, this chick is very talented and all that, but this book proved very much otherwise. It was a cute story at first but then it just started to become plain boring and cliche. What kind of vampire would go into high-school just to kill some girl? Why not be smart and attack her while she's asleep or typing on her computer? And he doesn't kill her because she can stare into his eyes? It's just a vampire/human love story gone wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Again, I am disappointed","review":"Okay, all you Amelia Atwater-Rhodes fans, don't jump all over me! ;) We are all allowed to have our own opinions. I was expecting a lot more from this book, and was truly hoping that the author would have matured more since her first book.Unfortunately, this wasn't the case. Although longer than the first book, there still wasn't much to sink your teeth into, so to speak. I also found this book to be a little self-indulgent, on the author's part, similar to what Anne Rice does on occasion (not in a good way). I am sorry if my opinion does not mesh with yours, but I am entitled to it. I gave Amelia two chances, and even though I am a fan of horror, I probably won't read the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish I could go lower than 1 star","review":"Ok I will give her a 1/2 star for an attempt because she is so young and she is published and I am not, but the editor needs to be fired. This book had characters coming out of the wood works. No explanation. No description. Alas, I do not fault the author it's the editor who needs a crash course writing. Also I am a 25 year old reader, the field wouldn't let me enter my real age."},{"rating":"1","title":"sad...","review":"I didn't like this book at all. She could use some work and there are too many plotholes. Even my 2-year-old cousin could produce better art than this. I wasted [money] on something that was both a waste of money and time. How could such a immature \\"writer\\" get more publicity than GREAT writers like Ann Rinaldi or Mildred D. Taylor? The market just wants to attract attention, that's what. By using this girl, they not only rake in loads of money, but they also get a ton of media attention. It might not be this girl's fault either that she's being used like a rag. But she should send out short stories and work on plot a little more. And then, she could wait until her writing's a little more mature before she publishes another book that may just be worth buying..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Demon in My View","review":"I give this book a two because I give the girl credit - she's a tad older than I am but she has no real experience writing. I don't give her any more than two stars because she HAS NO REAL EXPERIENCE IN WRITING. I've been reading adult/young adult fiction for going on three years now and I know the plots can be drippy and shallow - especially for the fantasy genre. But this... this is beyond shallow. I read it in an hour and a half (which completely kills my habit of reading a book in the wee hours of the night to the wee hours of the morning). The characters have no personalities. The plot is predictable, boring, and something that ANY high schooler could have written. I admit, I see potential. I would advise Amelia Atwater-Rhodes to fine tune that potential, take a writing course, and then her next novella will be better. She could be the next Ann Rice. But I doubt anyone would've wanted to read what Ann Rice wrote when she was thirteen."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of a teen's dream than a five star story","review":"Of course this is a popular book for drab, confused teens and those adults who still haven't recovered. The story is more of a wishful tale of the author's fantasies that are shared by many who think like this. Far from her best and most likely in saying her first isn't her worst but all the rest are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give the girl a break!","review":"Amelia Atwater-Rhodes has been highly publicized as a teen-genius, a writer whose published work was written while in high school. This reputation has set her up for the vicious attacks of critics and the unfair standards she is expected to meet.Demon in My View is an imaginative take on young adult vampire fiction. The author's writing style is fresh and clever.It is intended for a younger audience and caters to them. The book *is* short and the reader *is* left with many questions, as critical reviewers have noted. However, the unanswered questions lend a sense of mystery to the series, with each book divulging a bit more of the back story and of the characters' motivations.Don't let negative reviews turn you away from a budding new writer. She may be young, she may be learning, but she has caught the knack for how to write an interesting book full of charismatic characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Move over Dracula","review":"This book definetly falls into BEST BOOK EVER READ catergory.

It's just sort of sad that it was a little short, it ended before I wanted it to! To me that is a sign of a really great book. It's inspired me to begin writing a book about vamps, it's just so hard to pry myself away from her wonderful ideas and use my own! Great for someone who is looking for a world to escape to, characters to relate to, and senarios to base dreams on (seriously, I mean dreams, not like how you want to live!).Over all, an awesome book, the characters appear in my mind so vividly that It's like I know them myself.Fellow teens, watch out! Get ready to be blown away!Oh, yeah. and one more thing, she's completely an inspiration to the writing tallent I've always had, inspiring me to write serious novels! Looking for motivation to keep writing? Read this and her other works!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Self-Insertion Fics are BAD","review":"(...) I have to say that I didn't really like this book. Repeat after me: self-insertion fiction is bad. Mary Sue characters are the bane of writing. This book reads like the kind of junky fanfiction (as opposed to actually good fanfiction, which easily surpasses this novella) found on the Internet. You know, when the author inserts herself not-too-subtly into the storyline. Not to mention, the characters are flat, cliche, and one-dimensional. Jessica is the stereotypical outcast, etc. etc. Blah blah blah.Here's hoping that her books actually improve..."},{"rating":"1","title":"writing improved, interest dropped","review":"i admit her writing has improved, but i wasn't interested in Jessica's problems at all. she seemed very cynical and always whined. plus, aar had stereotyped the typical loner, as cold hearted and feeling hatred against the world. aubrey sounded like a jock, while fala seemed to be the only character i was interested in. i give her one star for writing it and another for being published so young -- in the end that's the only reason she's being praised. her writing level is below average, i have seen better. this is pitiful and it's sad to see so many young writers look up to her."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorites","review":"In my opinion, Demon in my View was a great book. Aside from the occasional lack of description, there is excellent storytelling and content. The characters are well developed and the plot is very thought out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Written","review":"I first read this book after I picked it up in the Library. It was very suspensefull and compelling. I like how Amelia creates this sureal atmosphere in her books. You can actually imagine what's happening word for word. But the world Amelia creates strays from the cliches of witches and vampires. Vampires don't turn into bats and fly away and witches do not have pimples all over their green noses or fly on broomstick. It gives us a new image of vampires and doesn't make them seem so monsterous as fairy tales do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Demon in my View","review":"Demon in my View was written by Amelia Atwater-Rhodes when she was only 15. The books main character's name is Jessica Allodola. She hates her mother Anne, hates her school and the town that she lives in. the only thing that she loves is writting. Going by the name of Ash Night she had one book published. It was about Aubrey, a very old, good looking, vampire. Jessica doesn't know that she has some kind of connection to the vampire world and that everything she writes is true. Some are trying to get her to stop writting and if that means killing her they will. Jessica only has one hope of getting through this and it comes from an unexpected place.If you haven't read this one pick it up. It is a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent Book","review":"I love this book. It was great! The writing was excellent and the end totally blew me away!

It's no suprise that she is being compaired to writer's such as Anne Rice, because she truely does hold their talent.

Too perfect was she, the author should have created some flaws to make her less dry and boring.The book was so pridictable that at one point I put it down and didn't come back to it for a week, already knowing what was going to happen.To me, it was dry and tastless. yet, for a fifteen year old I think if she stives towards making her charatures more interesting, she could come out with a good one.It honestly didn't do it for me, and if your still debating on wether or not to read it I say go for it.

I'm sorry to those who enjoyed it, but I didn't care much for the main character and didn't care whether she lived or died. I thought it unrealistic for Aubrey to fall for Jessica and be such a wimp in the story and sacrifice so much to save her when he's supposed to be this feared and mean character. I hope her third story is better than this one and has more believable actions by the characters. But keep writing, Amelia!

Besides that it was terribly written for someone he age for that fact. It was too shallow and she couldn't go on a page without the pathetic sarcasm. Jessica sounds like a baby and Aubrey sounds like a teen who just reached puberty. It was just another sad love story with the fantasy of Amelia herself. I wouldn't suggest this, or unless you are a teen who will read anything.

I couldn't understand why Aubrey would want to help her.The Aubrey character was the biggest letdown with this book. For Aubrey to be such a tough vampire, I thought it unrealistic of him to fall in love with Jessica and give so much to save her life when he despises humans. The only thing I can say I like about this book is Atwater-Rhodes' poem and writing style. I hope her books get better over time."},{"rating":"2","title":"worked out great","review":"This was ordered for my father. He was ill and had a hard time raising his foot rest on his recliner.

I only wish it was a little bit longer so that I can hold onto it when the foot rest if approaching the floor. Because it gets out of my reach before I the foot rest is completely lowered, it jerks suddenely as the foot rest mechanism gets released. Not something you want to happen with a sleeping baby and recovering from stitches. But overall, I am happy with it and it allowed me to use my rocker/recliner during the first weeks postpartum.

But sometimes you don't want to sit in front of a monitor for hours, reading skinny black text off a bright white screen. Frankly, that sucks.When you start to specialize in a technology like COM+, I think a set like this is essential. In this case the set is very handy and even gives some nice overviews of COM+ in the Windows DNA world.With this book you get an MSDN Library snapshot DVD (from July 2000) and a $200 rebate on a MSDN Universal subscription. Unfortunately that expired March 31 2001 :( so you should know that before buying this set. Even so, I think this is a great set and it is not simply a \\"function list\\" like most sets but is actually a great learning tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fast method to find information about COM/COM+","review":"I think this five books are perfect to find all the information you will need about COM/COM+.There are five volumes: Volume 1:COM+ Programmer's Guide Volume 2:COM+ Reference Volume 3:COM Fundamental Volume 4:Autometion Volume 5:Structure Storage and ActiveXI'm a VB programmer and I like to know what VB does under his shell and I think this is the first COM/COM+ a programmer need to read.If you do not like get lost trying to find some information about an specific Interface using the Microsoft CDs or DVD, those book will help you a lot.Have fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"The one and only COM/COM+ Reference......","review":"It is normal for me to use allot of different books for reference, but in terms of the global based COM technologies that number it maximum. For example, I would usually use for reference regarding COM the book by Don Box, Essencial COM. On the other way if I was working with ActiveX I normally had hanging around Understanding ActiveX and OLE, Visual C++ ActiveX COM. And finally if I was working on COM+ usually my I would grab anything I could get my hands on and for DCOM, my favourite pet was the DCOM Unleashed!!With this set of books all the COM stuff is there and its format between the books is identical (of course), simplifying the search within them after you get the hang of it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Aircraft Control","review":"This book, in my opinion, is a must have book for any aircraft controls engineer. Very practical so you don't get lost in the theory, and it uses an F16 linear model throughout the book (for example problems) so the numbers mean something as opposed to other books that just have random numbers in the examples. It's also easy to read and it gives matlab and fortran code for most example problems. I recommend the 2nd edition because more informations was added and nothing taken away from the 1st edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner","review":"I've read most of the mysteries in the 87th Precinct series and haven't found a klinker in the lot. I envy readers who've not yet discovered them, because they have a treat ahead. That said, this is perhaps the best of the lot. Alas, there will be no more. Evan Hunter, aka Ed McBain, is no longer amongst us.There are two major plots working here. First, there is the murder of a city councilman and wannabe mayor; it's in there so we can have the second plot, Ollie's stolen novel, the story it contains with Ollie's pursuit of the perp who stole it. Both plots weave nicely together. The atmosphere is police procedural in a big city. Only Michael Connelly is McBain's equal in this sub-genre. The characters, especially the obnoxious, egotistical, pitiful, elephantine Ollie, are excellent. No one wrote dialogue better than McBain/Hunter--with the possible exception of Lawrence Block.It was a pleasure to read this book. My only fault with it is that it ended before I wanted to let it go."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is McBain's fascination with this character?","review":"Now a whole book featuring McBain's least likeable character, Ollie Weeks. Fat Ollie's written a book and during the investigation of a mayoral candidate's murder someone steals it from Ollie's car. now the hunt is on. The murder case is pushed to the back burner as we are punished with excerpts from Ollie's book, Ollie in lust,and meeting someone even more loathsome than Ollie, his snitch the pederast Fats Donner. Enough already! Coupled with a fairly simplistic mystery, this book is McBain at his weakest, scattered and barely able to hold the interest of the reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good 87th Precinct with a Light Touch","review":"You can't go wrong with any 87th Precinct tale but this was has the added attraction of having Fat Ollie from the 88th as a main character. He is a shulb but despite his non-PC take on life the author allows him to still be a good detective. The book uses the ploy of Fat Ollie's stolen manuscript as a subtext. The long quotes from Ollie's book are good as over the top examples of bad writing and are actually blended into the book's plot. The book is a quick and fun read. It is a nice change of pace for the usual 87th crew. The book is written in the time when 9/11 was still hanging over the country. It is poignant to go back to that time of shared feelings."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"I couldn't finish the book..it was that bad. Coming from a writer who has created a character like Matthew Hope..it was indeed surprising. But Fat Ollie comes across as an ordinary white American ( WASP) who has forgotten than America is not an exclusive domain of whites!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fat Ollie's a Phat Read!","review":"Ed McBain moves the 87th precinct further into the \\"Pulp Fiction\\" and Elmore Leonard territory - everyone in the book gets into witty dialogue with offbeat, sexy, scenarios with some splashy violence. The drier, police procedural stuff is getting less and less. Here, Fat Ollie, is played for laughs while Steve Carella does the real investigating. I really like the continuity of the 87th and the books are very entertaining. It's hard to believe there are about 50 of them, I'll have to find #1 and see how how the late 1950s were portrayed. Looking forward to another next year, Ed?"},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL","review":"For centuries women have turned to nature for tips, rescue and guidance with a wide variety of health and skin conditions.

Let's hope Amazon makes all their CDs available, as Mille-Pattes charges $18 per disk. The band has ten or so CDs. Their tenth is known as \\"X\\" in Canada and \\"Rock & Reel\\" in the states. It's far from my favorite, however. Far better are \\"La Mistrine\\" and \\"En Spectacle\\" (\\"Live\\"). \\"En Spectacle\\" includes many tunes from their previous CDs, including \\"Chapeau\\", and the live versions are dynamite. I saw the band in Lafayette, LA, in April '99 and they were as good in person as on CD. A crew from PBS filmed the concert. We can hope for a broadcast in the coming months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where are the C.D.s?","review":"I also saw La Bottine Souriante at Irish Fest this year. They had the place on their feet dancing. I researched the group and they have at least a dozen different c.d.s. Where can they be purchased? They just produced a c.d. this year but, sadly, were sold out at Irish Fest in Milwaukee. It seems that not a single music store between Michigan and Chicago can order any c.d.s more recent than 1990. Please look into carrying the c.d.s of this successful band for us."},{"rating":"2","title":"It takes me back to \\"La Belle Province....\\"","review":"I bought this a few years ago in a cutout bin for around $5. I had never heard of the group before, but when I went to Québec this summer I made sure to take it with me. Many of the tracks show Irish influences as Québec was a destination for hundreds of Irish immigrants during the 19th-20th centuries. Some of the songs showcase the unique Québécois choral style, others such as \\"Beluga\\" are original compositions or interpretations. A wonderful taste of Québec music from a very talented band (I love the brass section--it really gives it an extra kick!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for babies","review":"My daughter received this toy at 2months of age and it has been and continues to be one of her favorite toys today at 8 months. I love the volume control and the fact that its small enough and lightweight for her to hold. Im guessing one of her first songs will be the alpahbet song because of this toy. Actually she loves when we sing the ABC song to her and she recognizes it because of this toy. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"My son received this as a Christmas gift when he was two. Right away he fell in love with it when he heard it sing and talk. He played for the longest time with it and didn't want any more presents! He still goes and gets it from time to time and just sits down and plays with it forever. I love it because it's small for small hands. Also because it has the loop at the top that can be attached to diaper bags, strollers, baby carriers or whatever so that it can't get dropped or lost. The enunciation on it is awesome, the speed of the songs and speaking is awesome because it makes it so much easier for kids to learn when things are clear and slow. A great toy."},{"rating":"2","title":"LeapFrog Leap","review":"My 8 month old grandson absolutely loves Leap and has loved him since he was about 4 weeks old.

It clearly introduces \\"A-B-C \\" song. It is great for the introduction to alphabets .However if you want to introduce the letter sounds first , this toy is not really for you. The reason I love this toy is because it occupied my child for a long time during a looong overseas trip without annoying my fellow passengers. It is very easy for a baby with basic motor control to operate the toy, so it gives them a sense of independence too. Now we are using the letter factory and of course Leap had to come out from hiding so that my child could cuddle with him while watching letter factory, which we love too. But that is another review. Overall , a great toy for older babies and young toddlers."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Favorite","review":"My son loves this toy still, even though he got it months ago. He still cracks up laughing when Leap starts singing the alphabet and I love it because it makes him so happy. I'm a big fan of leap pad toys, and if you have a little one, this learning toy is simply great to help them learn their alphabet."},{"rating":"1","title":"annoying","review":"I admit, I don't own this toy. I let my 2 yo son play with it in the store to keep him occupied. which it did, he sang along with the ABC song the first few times, then he was pressing it just to hear it. it only sings the ABC song, then giggles. After 20 minutes in the store I was more than happy to put it back on the shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for strollers/carseats","review":"We have the big Tad and love it so I bought this little one for our 4 month old son. It doesn't have many features- just a cute little alphabet song. But- it is perfect size for carrying along with you. It has a clip to put on a stroller, carseat, crib and we use it all the time like that. Also, the size is not so large so the baby can grab it and play with it, where as the large tad we have to hold for him. It's a great little toy for the money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Little Guy Loves Little Leap!","review":"My son is 16 months old as of tomorrow and received this for a Christmas present 1t 6 months old and has loved it ever since!

He will make Leap (and Lily) sing over and over again. He also likes to carry both toys around together. If he plays with one he believes he has to play with the other. Leap's voice is cute and not annoying. Makes a good toy for grocery store trips. Better purchase than the Learn-Along Lily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the concept but the errata are ridiculous.","review":"I like the writing style, and I really like the ambitious attempt to touch on the entire spectrum from basic COM to MTS, in each of ATL, MFC, VB, and Java. But, this book is riddled with errors. I fought my way through the examples up to chapter 5, correcting things which didn't work as described in the book by trial and error, and by comparing with the supplied CD (which is often considerably different from the printed code). In chapter 5 this just got too ugly, and even when I tried to resolve it by using the examples from the CD, one of those had a hard coded absolute path based on the author's E: drive and wouldn't compile! Coriolis's claims in the intro to \\"guarantee several important qualities ... technical accuracy ... several editing and proofreading passes\\" are laughable in hindsight.

The statement from the publisher on technical accuracy appears to be an all out lie. References to the same variable in code mysteriously change names from one code chunk to the next. The keyword 'interface' is shown as 'Interface' in the code, although no reference to the necessary macro is made. (page 20) One portion of the book is obviously a cut and pasted from another portion without the content being updated correctly for the current context!!! (page 17, step 11) In other words, as written, the examples do not compile and the steps involved are not explained correctly.

Whenever a group of friends attempt to dine together, they get sidetracked by the most bizarre reasons. A dumbfounding comedy with excellent ensemble acting only Bunuel could create. The surreal images (at one point one would ask, which one is surreal and not?) are an absolute marvel. I'm so happy to hear that this film is coming up in a digitally remasterred VHS and DVD. The latest VHS copy produced several years ago did not do justice to this sparkling gem of film. The DVD produced by Criterion with 2 discs should have tons of extras.

A really horrible film that was, it got off decently well for me until random dreams started to appear. That's when the film suddenly fell apart for me just like that. I just completely lost interest, and I couldn't believe how boring it had gotten to be. I can understand that it was meant to be a film of ironies, but let's consider this simple example: I am watching a film called The Discreet Charm of the Bourgeoisie; somebody walks in and watches it for five minutes with me; she suddenly asks me if I meant to see the film for entertainment value; I will be like, \\"Well, I thought so too.\\" That wasn't funny.

With a story set at the end of the original One Year War, this is a much more personal & intimate side story that focuses almost entirely on characters and their perspective of war. With gorgeous character designs from Haruhiko Mikimoto of Macross fame, this is a story to be recommended to ppl new to the Gundam franchise who may not be mecha fans or have the patience to watch a 50 ep tv series. Although it's not my favorite of the Gundam franchise (I prefer the more action/combat oriented gundam series full of political intrigue)I still recognize it as one of the best Gundam stories around.Also go onto youtube and check out an excellent fan made music video titled 'Bernie's Lament' which is an ode to the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"So much fun!!!","review":"I have been watching the series in the chronological order they are supposed to be in this was the first Gundnam show I ever saw in bits and pieces when it was released to the U.S. years ago.How can the directors of Bandi be so brilliant and so stupid and miss the U.S. market so badly at the same time?I am glad to have purchased the series.Order:0079 Gundam the original seriesThe 08th MS Team0080 war in the pocketThis is an awesome fun series if you have seen the original do not miss this.I am glad I did not!

I followed it and had no problems setting up Openlinux 2.3 (which is what the book covers, not version 2.2 as described here.) It covers just about everything you might need from setting up a web server to using Samba. The chapters on KDE were great (I am changing themes once a day, its fun and easy).

In a gentle way, Mother Badger shows Frances just how boring life is when you always eat the same thing. For fans of Frances, it is as much of a treat as the other books.
