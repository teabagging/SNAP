Okay, so that makes for good angst, but was it that realistic? These days, it seems to me that anybody with any sort of special power wouldn't be reviled, he'd be a celebrity! He'd get music videos and endorsements and his picture on a cereal box! He'd be... well... exactly what Peter Milligan and Mike Allred turned X-Force into.Before they took over, this was just another militaristic X-Men clone. Under them, it became something different. These are mutant celebrities, brought together mainly to become famous and get rich. (Another reviewer said they're a government sponsored team -- he's totally wrong. They're a commercial outfit).Somehow, in this setting, they've managed to tell great character stories about the cult of celebrity and what it means to be a hero. This series continued as X-Statix, and it's still just as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Picking up where New Beginnings left off, X-Force: The Final Chapter collects the final issues of the Peter Milligan/Mike Allred X-Force before it would be re-launched as X-Statix (which has sadly just ended). Continuing the idea of a commercial based mutant team brought together to pretty much make money, the group is joined by the appropriately named Dead Girl, and introduced to the Spike and Lacuna. The book is surprisingly action packed and Milligan's storytelling is simply awesome, and his Doop story is worth the price of admission alone. Those used to the other militaristic team X-Men books or the old X-Force books may have a hard time getting into Mike Allred's art or the sheer absurdity of the story, but it's sure worth a look, and once it would get re-launched as X-Statix would this become something really special."},{"rating":"2","title":"Counterfeiters Doth never prosper, unless you're 'The \\"Fed\\" '...","review":"Picture on cover is a recovering Byron Dale,a libertarian South Dakota farmer who madehis own money, redeemable in nothing, likethe military script we carry around in ourpockets every day, issued by the criminalenterprise know as the 'Ferderal Reserve',which is NOT Federal (any more than FredSmith's Federal Express!) and has NO reserves!Agents of the 'Fed' went to call on Dale @his farm and bashed him over the head witha 32 oz.

Their fifth album, the first for the California-based Alive Records, gains its intensity and blues heaviness more from the British Invasion (particularly the Stones, Yardbirds and Pretty Things) than directly from the Mississippi Delta or Chicago bars. The potent rhythm guitar interplay and the punk-tinged vocals are particularly remindful of mid-60s blues reinterpreters. The band's originals add touches of psychedelia and glamrock swagger, and on \\"Good Feeling\\" a taste of the Memphis soul that Big Star brought to the rock 'n' roll party. The band's fascination with the Stones hasn't subsided, but it's definitely evolved, as though their debt has been paid but not forgotten.

There is merit to his thinking, but the problem is that the discussion is not interesting or insightful. The writing quality is also not very good.In another section the author discusses neurotransmitters, steroids and peptides. This should have been beyond the scope of this short book and is also beyond the author's expertise. Finally he also tries to promote his drug rehabilitation business and tout his successes which I do not believe is appropriate for authors to do in their books.

But if you parse it out, it's always true, because by definition what's possible is what happens. More importantly, when I adopted this mantra as my own, and challenged it with reality, such as minor annoyances from people cutting me off in traffic, I found that using the mantra put my creative mind to work at finding ways to make the silver lining of any cloud become visible.

Thank YOU"},{"rating":"2","title":"He has cracked the code!","review":"As a newly saved woman and called of God to be an intercessor, I actually struggled with prayer. I couldn't last more than ten minutes in prayer until I heard of this book. After I purchased it, I employed the principles he listed (based on the Lord's Prayer, Mattew 6:9-13, using the main nine names of God, the Will of God and the Kingdom of God)to pray for people, cities, ministries, etc. His teaching revolutionized my prayer life! It takes me way more than an hour to get through my prayer list. A truly awesome book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learn how to REALLY pray!","review":"The book expands upon \\"The Lord's Prayer\\" and gives us great understanding into \\"fleshing-out\\" the outline given in Matthew 6:9-13. Breaking it up into six parts, Dr. L. Lea examines and expands it and associates it to six \\"laps\\" of an indoor jogging track (and calls the parts 'demarcations'). The examples and short illustrative stories add much richness to the presentation.All in all, it was a highly iformative and enjoyable read. I am currently re-reading the book and gleaning more out of it than I thought possible.Anyone wishing to enhance their prayer life should have this in their library, it will be a regular 'friend.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"30+ missing pages....","review":"While I agree with other reviewers that this is an excellent introduction to Husserl's work, I am giving this book one star because it came to me missing pgs. 119-150. That is a significant printing error!! Unfortunately I did not catch this until after my window for returning it had expired, so I have to shell out the money again. I hate providing a bad rating, because it does not reflect on the author or the content, but I do want to ensure others avoid a similar fate."},{"rating":"2","title":"inspirational and moving","review":"This book is truly the single most inspirational and moving piece of literature I have read in many years.

I do not want it to end. The honesty in which Ms. Vanzant tells her story is unheard of. Not once did I say to myself, \\"Yeah right, that could not have happened\\". I can truly relate to her and her past life. The journal entries are funny, sensitive and real. All they while I read this book, I asked over and over....Iyanla, how did you know?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as the second book, but still good.","review":"I really enjoy the Ultimate X-Men books, but I thought this one was the worst so far for two primary reasons:One Kaare Andrews should stick to doing Disney cartoons and quit the comics buisness. The third and fourth parts to this book look like rejected cells from Atlantis: the Lost Empire.Two, they try to do too much in the fith section, introducing both the Helfire Club (something I feel the series could probably have done without anyway) and the dark phoenix, as well as ressurecting Magneto all in one issue.That being said this is still a great comic, infact the whole series is really inspired. I liked the second and fifth books the best (I thought Wolverine switched sides way too fast in the first book and proteus as a plotline is kind of blah)."},{"rating":"1","title":"down right boring","review":"Normally after i read a terrible book like World Tour I just skip around but since I've always been an X-Men fan I decieded to be leinent.

The story is weak but the worst part is the art-work, which is absolutely terrible, especially the switch in styles mid-volume for issues 23 - 25. Marvel should be embarrased for releasing this extremely sub-par piece of work.

The study guide has about 70% basic programming that is not on the test. I advise using the suggested study books on the DANTES fact sheet."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am hooked on DHTML","review":"The reason that I HIGHLY recomend this book is that fact that DHTML development offers a lot of potential, but like me, it is my guess that many of you don't know what that potential is until you see it. Mr. Ruyer's sites and book surely shows that potential off, but as always it is up to you on how you use that development information, either for building a low bandwidth site or for a high bandwidth one, for corporate use or for fun. But understand the reality of ruyers work is not in the eye-catching graphics he created, but in what DHTML technology the graphics are illustrating. This is why I baught his book and why I download his online tutorials and templates, I am trying to expand my understanding of the potential in a free development environment such as DHTML that is supported by the W3 standards association compared to Flash and ChromeEffects which are propietary technologies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excellent examples, good description, no originality","review":"The book has some excellent examples and good descriptions for them, just good, not great. Only thing is of the 300 pages, only a hundred or so are original, see, he repeats each script, instructions inclusive, for each project per section. Only thing is each project is only slightly modified from the next. Every chapter starts exactly the same, first page of explanation is of the DOM, EVERY CHAPTER! He does not understand that you only need to explain it in the first chapter, than repeating it every chapter is unnecesary. Very little content repeated many times over. What is there is good though."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very innovative approach to DHTML","review":"This book is really not for the beginner. If you have a goodworking knowledge of JavaScript and HTML 4 this publication will open up a whole new approach to web design. The author gives practical examples of the use of animation and layer effects for use with level 4 browsers with code that is both compatible in Netscape and IE. The examples in this book allow programmers to create strong content and visually rich interfaces without the use of plugins that rival Flash and other current technologies. A must for all serious web designers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Two words for this book...","review":"This book really s****! All it was about was making stupid models with Macromedia products and making huge graphics that take forever to download and only work with 1-2 browsers. Waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"A definite NOT!","review":"This is a really poor example of a DHTML resource. Once you oooo and aaaah at the examples, the book is relatively worthless. The author cut and paste the same information about the same JavaScript over and over into every chapter. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great coverage, awesome graphics","review":"This is a must-have for any dHTML developer. Even though the book is only 300 pages, it is the most descriptive dynamic html resource yet. If that doesn't convince you to buy the book already, go to www.htmlguru.com and see for yourself what the author, Jeff Rouyer is capable of. The disc included with the book has great images Jeff created on Adobe PhotoShop for you to use on your site. It also has JavaScript source code, and stylesheet files to view. From a 13 year old's perspective, 'Dynamic HTML web magic' rocks!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive","review":"This book presents code for accomplishing 16 tasks using combinations of HTML, style sheets, and JavaScript. All examples and graphics are included on the accompanying CD-ROM (which worked fine on my IBM ThinkPad in Win2000). Yes, the tasks, like flashing text, circular animations, and pop-up menus, are rather cool. But are they really necessary? Will they bring more users to your Webpage? My biggest complaint with the book is that Rouyer repeats 4 out of his 10 or 11 steps for each task verbatim in every single chapter, giving full explanations each time. An additional 3 or 4 steps for each task are basically identical, with only filenames or numbers of calls to files different. This book would be a lot shorter and probably a lot cheaper to produce if these steps weren't repeated so many times. If you like to learn from examples, then this book can give you a lot of ideas. But if it's concepts that you're looking for, it will be up to you to find them on your own with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the paper its printed on!","review":"This book does not deal with reality! High end graphics are way too slow for the Internet. Visiting his site on the net if you are a user with eben a 56K modem, will tell you that the author is off track. Sure, if everyone has T1 lines or Cable modems, ADSL then these techniques could be somewhat useful. But by then 2001-2002 (when 70-85% will have this speed) the bar will be much higher and Microsoft's Chrome will be the standard, not Javascript...or even Flash The Java Script that is provided is not clean and caused some odd behavoir.

With this final tale, Ms. Warren lets two characters, who appeared in the first and second books, find their own special love with the same wit and charm seen in those earlier stories. She is able to bring a humorous, touching and highly romantic turn to the classic ugly-duckling plot, as the all too shy Eliza Hammond finally blossoms into an enchantress, who captures the heart of the endearing, devil-may-care Kit Winter.With this latest tale, Ms. Warren once again effortlessly weaves an intimate tale of courtship and romantic love. She introduces the reader to more of the colorful and memorable people who inhabit her Regency England world. And she doesn't fail to delight the reader with old friends"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good","review":"The third in Warren's series, this book follows shy Eliza, Violet's friend. Her transformation and \\"make-over\\" is well-written, and she's a likeable heroine. Plot moves along nicely with a bit of suspense thrown in. The only problem for me with this third book is Kit, the hero. He's just a bit too young and slightly immature to be the hero of a romance. One of the main points of characterization that Warren uses for Kit is his insatiable hunger for food. As a mom of two teenage boys, I'm familiar with that aspect of young men. It's funny, but at the same time, adds to the unfortunate image of a man too young for romance and marriage. However, Warren's a good writer, so the book is worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Let Down!!","review":"I read, \\"The Wife Trap\\" and \\"The Husband Trap\\", and I loved them both.

As many other Cubans I have a decent level of knowledge of our history and was expecting a more serious and truthful material.

But if her opinions about Castro as expressed on CNN to Connie Chung on December 4, 2002, are any indication of her style as an author, look for this book, like all of her others, to be laced with a predisposed bias. If you really must read it, borrow it from the public library, or from someone you know who has a copy and doesn't object to lending it to you.

To me, there are only two songs (\\"Low Bridge\\" and \\"Frogg\\") that are better than mediocre and \\"The Ballad of Sam Hall\\" is really distasteful.

The author explains for couples to keep intimacy alive in the relationship, there must be reciprocity in power. This really helped me understand our relationship better. As a self confessed control freak, the author helped me understand how each person needs to have individual power for a balanced relationship. I also found the authors explanation of the difference between euphoric love and enduring love very helpful. Also helpful was an explanation of the couple boundary and what influences, both positive and negative, can impact the relationship.

He is an excellent listener, unusually humble, ready to acknowledge a mistake (catch a Prof. doing that!), and has a spontaneous sense of humor that is difficult to match. His facility with the English language left most of us in the class just dumbfounded! He can weave words together like I haven't seen before.

Out of 262 pages 70 is not even on the subject; they are devoted to linear algebra (vectors and matrices). Out of modern Analytical Dynamics it essentially covers only one subject: Lagrange equations. The partial list of absolutely essential topics missing from the book includes: Hamiltonian function, Hamilton equations, Poisson brackets, canonical transformations, variational principle, Noether theorem, Hamilton-Jacobi equation!!!

The cd and accompanying book is pretty comprehensive and if you don't have too much time to devote to a proper classroom setting, then this is a good idea as you can play the cd in the car while you are commuting or at home while you are doing the household chores and you can always go back to the book as a guide to see that you are on track.

Every other rack I am looking at seems to be roughly the same quality, but the fact that I'm a tall guy who wears heavy coats means I have to find a sturdier rack.

KeoghFinding a way to comfort someone who is grieving and finding a way to ask for what you need when you are grieving are the two main focuses of this book.It can be a quick read or one that takes as much time as it takes just as grieving takes as much time as it takes. The author gives suggestions and helping phrases, ways to think about grief, ways to accept yourself whether you are the griever or the supporter.It may be a book that the reader reads again and again. The words are wise and carefully chosen. And although it is most importantly written in reference to death of a loved one it can be used to guide oneself in other kinds of grief also.I recommend the book highly.

Martin Keogh covered a great deal of ground in doing his research for this book - from professionals who work with grieving and dying folks to those who have had lay experience - and you can feel his success. It takes only about an hour to read, cover to cover, a small investment to facilitate your ease in knowing what to say and do - or, perhaps more importantly, to know what NOT to say and do.You will gain the courage to simply be present in the best way you are able in the presence of grief, your own or someone else's from reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful little book!!!!!","review":"This book is well written and a very supportive tool for people who have ahd aloved one to die."},{"rating":"2","title":"Folks, this is real Magick!!!","review":"This book is for the serious.

While it is true that method is hard to grasp and even harder to write about and many theologians don't even take it into consideration, certainly there are better potential works than this. In limiting himself to only four methodological approaches, Mueller limits the impact he is able to make. Furthermore, his book is further limited by his choice of methods under consideration, taking up Transcendental method rather than, say, Scholastic (which has made a much greater impact on the Church doctrine), his work thus becomes less an introduction to theological methods generally and more a promo piece for these four methodological approaches.

Fine saw, especially with a better blade installed.Word of advice: the miter gauge is very good, but the bevel gauge is almost useless for a cut not using the preset stops. I suggest you cut a 1X4 or 1X6 using the miter gauge for the bevel angle you want and use that piece for the bevel cut by lining it up against the blade.

If you don't need the bulb mode, it works (i.e. it can fire off a shot in A,CA,P,Tv,Av modes)....but then you don't need this product in the first place (use the timer).I will now take my plier and cut the 2' cable from the button-part and use it as my new shoe laces."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleaze, Glam, Gutter, Pure Rubbish, these dudes can rock!!","review":"These guys could Possibly be the next Guns N' Roses!!Influenced by, the Gunners, Hanoi, Aerosmith, Ramones, johnny thunders ect.

Most readers would see a little of themselves in each woman. Their relationship struggles aren't too far from home, either, so again, the reader will likely identify! The book is unpredictable enough to where you're guessing til the very end whether the women will choose to make their marriages legal, or call it quits.

I have used their \\"self encounter\\" technique many times, and have found out some amazing things as a result.

I was having a particularly painful morning when they were delivered to my door...what the heck I tried them out and the difference was immediate. I SWEAR BY THESE BALLS THEY REALLY ARE A MIRACLE!!!!! The only thing that might discourage people is that the spot you were using them on the first day will be painful to use the next day so just wait a day. Your body will get over it and the balls will get softer. BUT DON'T GIVE UP AND STOP USING THEM. DAY OR TWO LATER AND IT WILL BE LESS PAINFUL.

I find that the method truly relieves my pain. I'm surprised and hope it leads to long-term healing with continuous use.

I've found that it's possible to overdo it, once the pain has eased up I put the balls away until next time before the exercise itself starts to become uncomfortable.Highly recommended.

After a few days the spasm began to ease and with regular use went away completely. It may not work for everyone, but no course of treatment works for everyone.

Like most office workers, sitting for 8 hours a day, gives a lot of lower back pain and piraformis syndrome. These balls are great to relieve the pain. The only warning I have is to watch how long you stay on the balls. In some areas of the book, she recommends staying on as long as you want. This can do damage if your body isn't ready for it. I made the mistake and did too much of a good thing. Release the muscles and relax into the balls, but remove them and relax some more. This is the perfect workout if you hold your tension, stress and emotions in your muscularture. If you do, and try the workout, you will be free, relaxed, and happy!For a more precision and technical workouts, try Yamuna. For relaxation, this is second to none!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Unbelievable!

I have a constant pain and tightness in my lower back and if I stand for more than a few minutes it becomes more and more painful. I usually visit a friends hot tub for a bit of relief but the relief I feel from the hot tub does not compare to the relief I recieved from my first 15-20 minute session with the Miracle Ball Method.I would recommend this program to everyone that suffers from lower back pain. I also have arthritis in my neck (bone spurs)and plan to try it for my constant neck pain after I have mastered the lower back and breathing excercises.Try it! You have nothing to lose.

I have given untold numbers of them as gifts with universal appreciation. Unfortunately, the last couple of pairs I've bought, the quality has tanked and the value of them has been greatly diminished. Whereas they used to be made of a thick gauge, they currently are not. When inflated fully they are much larger than the originals and do not work nearly as well. They will surely wear out much, much faster. I do not know if they have always been made in China, but the older ones are not marked China and the new ones are.

I am NOT one of those people who says every chemical is out to kill us (even if some of them really may be...), but these scare me. I stored them in a cherry wood cabinet and after five days they ate through the poly down into the stain on every contact point. The stain then stained the balls (obviously) and has left a constantly sticky black film that won't wash away or even smooth off. Please keep these away from anything or anyone of value.

Perhaps the biggest issue is the poor description of the excercises. Also the tiny size of the book makes it awkward to hold in your hand while on the balls trying to breathe and relax as instructed in it. Since breathing and relaxing are key components of the whole method, I found it a difficult task that someone could actually completely let go and relax on the balls while holding the book and your head up to actually be able to read the instructions.After a few tries with no success, I finally gave up.

They just didn't get deep enough for me. I know it is more a relaxition involved product but I couldn't get it. Read my review onFENIX Deluxe Self-Care Kit. It is more expensive indeed, but sooooooo worth it. If you need deep tissue relief as I do, these balls just don't get there. Glad they help so many others though.

I really had major relief the very first time I used these. Head to toe. These are great. Order them. A set at home, and a set at work.

I have lower back problems due to carrying a heavy backpack throughout high school and college, and now I sit in front of a computer all day for work. I used the balls for 2 weeks. The first week was great, and I thought my backpain was going away. Second week, I don't know what happened, but I stayed on the balls for 20mins in one position to help relax my back, and when I got off of them I felt an even deeper pain in my tail bone. It took almost 2 weeks for the pain to eventually go away. Needless to say I stayed off the balls for good. I definitely would not recommend this product to anyone.

The balls are cheap, smell bad, and after following the instruction booklet perfectly, my back feels WORSE than it did before. Not to mention the fact that its difficult to follow along with a book, a DVD or audio track would be more helpful, now I need a massage and probably a chiropractic appt just to recover from a couple days with this so called \\"method\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Numbness Gone!","review":"I was recommended to get this product by my massage therapist. Due to excessive traveling I was having numbness in my arms and neck. I used the balls on the spot areas suggested in the book and from the first day much of the pain was gone.

I suffer from chronic back pain and had been introduced to rolling massage balls(which I never quite mastered) at a yoga class. I wanted something similar to do in my own home, but was turned off by the price of the massage balls. I was sure that something that only costs around $13 was going to fall far short of my expectations, but seriously, the exact opposite happened. You shouldn't mistake this product for the massage balls; it's completely different. They work wonders though, especially when done with the breathing exercises, the instruction book is simple to follow, and the 'non-exercises' are easy and effective. I highly recommend the Miracle Ball Method."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Technique","review":"Two small, cushy balls accompany a paperback exercise book that is meant to relieve pain, tone your body and improve posture. The manual begins with simple breathing exercises to help the individual relieve stress. Once the individual's breathing is regulated it is time to move on to the exercises, and the fun-part...the balls. The exercise techniques presented in this manual are simple and straight forward, however constructive. This is a system to help you relieve stress, tension and pain from head-to-toe. I would recommend The Miracle Ball Method."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good piece of little known history","review":"This is a good documentary on an amazing rescue at the end of WWII. Not much is known of this event other than the initial \\"death march\\". It is quite astounding to learn that the Japanese had over 17,000 U.S. prisoners in the PI. Also, the atrocities are terrible. The commentary from the survivors, as well as the rescuers makes this a very good program with a personal feel. I would have liked to have seen more on scene footage and original reel footage, instead of re-enactment. All in all, 4 stars and a keeper for any WWII/military history buff. It's always great to learn the little-known facts of any event."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lightweight, well made and easy to use.","review":"I Love it, the dog loves it and total strangers love it.

My puppy also loves to sleep in it - she feels safe and secure in there. My puppy is a little frightened when I wheel it, but that will take time getting used to I guess. As a back pack it's comfortable for both of us - Except my puppy got sick in it - not sure if it was from the excitement of travelling or from the motion.

Dorian's skills as an Author will probably improve if he makes the mistake of carrying on this career. An experienced Editor could have done wonders to the book's idea. Cliches galore, from cover to cover. A lack of imagination.

I guess if I had to compare it to something I'd have to say it is vaguely similar to Debussy's more dreamish works for piano, with a milligram of jazz added. Sorabji's music style sounds very improvisational, yet it makes coherent sense overall. In my opinion this is the best piece that Sorabji ever wrote, don't expect something epic like Beethoven's fifth symphony though. Here is just the song of the simple, meditative wanderings from a glass half-full of red wine, sitting on top of a moonlit steinway, Le Jardin Parfume is a deep midnight contemplation."},{"rating":"1","title":"wish these were cheaper...","review":"I have a need for these in my office for my credit card machine.

One would be hard pressed to find more difficult music for the piano. The intellectual and technical demands are titanic. Mr. Grante shows that he is more than equal to them. There is no finer recording of these pieces available. This recording alone would catapult Mr. Grante to the front rank of today's best pianists. Only Arcadi Volodos, Marc-Andre Hamelin, and Jack Gibbons deserve to be mentioned in the same breath with him. The music itself is delightful. Godowsky has an odd art deco sensibility that makes his music the sonic analog of a Tiffany stained glass window. All three volumes of this set are well worth having."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken when received","review":"The cedar tie hanger was broken at the top when I opened the box.

If not, then I say skip this game. I would suggest renting it before owning it, but even that would be a waste of too much money. The graphics looked like something you would have seen on the old Nintendo system. Not only was there very little detail, but the movement is incredibly choppy. Stick to Twisted Metal 2 and Tekken 3 if you want a fun 2 player fighting game with good graphics and great gameplay."},{"rating":"2","title":"Street Fighter Alpha 3","review":"Good Game! Lots of characters, 31 in all! These include: Ryu, Ken, Bison, Gouki, Chun-Li, Cammy, Sakura, Rose, Juli+Juni, Dan, Vega, Blanka, Zangeif, and many others. There is some difficulty with the moves that tell you to hold one directional key then push forward with another with either kick, punch, or something else. Secret characters, Evil Ryu and Guile can be acheived in world tour mode. Get you character to levels 30 and 31, and defeat them when they chalange you. Some characters (computer) can be incredibly cheap. These include, Vega, Bison, Gouki, Ryu, Ken, Karin, Blanka and Adon. Dificult moves and super combos. NOT a game for begginers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work at all","review":"After hooking the unit up to my 2000 Ford Expedition Eddie Bower Edition, Nothing would work.

I paid a lot of money for the new one and hated it immediately. It leaked and hung loosely in the ball joint so the spray couldn't be directed when the handle was in the mount.My partner said \\"wasn't the original called a Shower Massage?\\" And I said \\"yeah, Waterpik.\\" So off to the web site I went to do a little research. I picked the Linnea 10 setting Shower Massage because it fit my budget and had the features I wanted.I couldn't be happier. The real excitement was a setting that feels like a soft rainstorm. I can't even describe it. The only thing I would like it to have is a cutoff setting so you can intermittently shut off the spray without turning off the water. If it had that I would have given it 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pictures are deceiving...","review":"This shower head is huge.

Everything I love about V1-3, there is even more of here. The eerie juxtaposition of darkness and jubilation pretty much sums up the whole 20th Century in an hour and a half. Yes, it's short and pricey, but better in my mind to preserve Smith's original vision - after all, he scuttled the original release of this album in order to stay true to that vision."},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSTANDING!","review":"The author gives a comprehensive look at the M1 Garand and M1 Carbine---the workhorses of small arms for U.S. soldiers of WWII and the Korean Conflict.

I found the carbine informationhelpful, if a little confusing, and incomplete inregard to some of the later developments, and thereis NOTHING in here at all helpful about ammo.I have ALL the M1 books, though. And this areais where Canfield sort of falls apart and becomesirrelevant. He completely poo-poohs the ItalianBreda and Beretta rifles, does not explore therebuilds or much of the postwar history, does notmention civilian developments at all, andbadmouths the \\"import rifles\\"...which pretty muchmeans what today's shooters and collectors canactually get is skipped COMPLETELY.And a lot of the photos, while pretty good, are notcompletely explained.

(Most of the 38 pages of notes and references cite Slavic language sources.) A very enlightening examination of who the Slavs are and where they might have come from.

The content is good for this age and now when we get to the page about the things Elmo says, she will repeat me. And she will point to the other things Elmo does on the other pages.

Relatable anecdotes of self consious body image make up the bulk of these tales (oh yeah and a kids fixation on Mr. Belvedere).The only draw back I felt was the lack of sectional separation (IE. love, sex, drugs.....) which could have made it a better re-read of certain entries.

Unfortunately, the second screw I tried to identify the thread pitch on, stripped the flimsy plastic threads on the identifier. Seems the metal threads on the screw had cut the plastic threads on the Identifier (and much too easily in my opinion).I know now that I should never have bought it, as it was entirely foreseeable and a reasonable assumption that the plastic threads would strip easily when cut with metal screw threads. I give it 1 star for a cool idea, and take off 4 stars for...what the heck were they thinking making it out of plastic? I suggest that this has a market if it were made out of steel. As a tool, it fails in it's current configuration."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Return of Cyril Jordan!","review":"Ex-Flamin' Groovie Cyril Jordan and perhaps the best rhythm section in San Francisco, Alec Palao on bass (Sneetches, Chocolate Watch Band) and drummer Prairie Prince (Tubes, Journey, Jefferson Starship, Todd Rundgren, etc.), join forces with singer/Bay Pop Festival founder Paul Kopf, to put out a great set of mostly original 60's-influenced pop tunes. The most obvious influences are the Beatles (\\"No Time To Cry\\", \\"Things She Said\\") and Stones (\\"Too Close To Zero\\", \\"Angel\\", \\"She's So Good\\"), but, as in the case of Jordan's best work with the Groovies, his songs sound like classics from 40 years ago that you're familiar with, even if you're just hearing them for the first time.

Granted, a lot of music is done today on home computers, but this *sounds* like it...it has a rather amateurish feel to it.

The next one the point broke off while putting a divot in a 4 by 4, the one after that had a shoddy handle that broke in half when I tried to nail a grouse with it and I hit a rock.

It is handle heavy, but it still feels like it's in your control. The blade comes razor sharp and can cut just about anything!!!! Trust me I've tried. I did not buy it from Amazon however. I bought it at Wal-Mart for $34.99 (with a nylon sheath). Almost every Wal-Mart carries this knife. And believe me they arn't cheaply made. If you wish to buy a more reasonable 119, Wal-Mart is place to go. As far as performance goes, the 119 can do anything from skinning your buck to doing camping chores.

I find I don't use it much because it's too big for most jobs. I should have bought the woodsman or pathfinder instead. The steel holds an edge well but takes forever to sharpen. For it's size and thickness the blade seems sharper than other knives this size. The blood groove is stupid but looks cool. The grip is a bit slippery but poses no problem unless your hands are bloody. The knife resists rust better than most. The knife is light weight for it's size yet durable. Sheath is great. I think for most chores like carving wood, dressing game smaller than an Elk, cutting open boxes, rope etc a 3.5 to 4 inch knife with non-serrated blade is about perfect. This knife does perform ok for filleting Salmon however. Not the best because it's not flexible but works fine in a pinch.

One of the very best things I like about it is that it is MADE IN THE U.S.A! the only real con about the buck 119 that I found is that the blade will rust fairly easily. for my uses this is a problem and is also why I only gave it 4 out of 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perfect Knife...","review":"I bought one of these knives for myself several years ago because my brother had one when I was very young, and I was duly impressed with it's quality.

The book discusses the different kinds of forces involved in the fighting, from French Foreign Legionnaries to Guerrillas to imperial cavalrymen.

The blade came very sharp (with no rolling) which saved me the effort of sharpening it myself.As for size, it is great. The size is fine for pockets, but the weight does make it a bit heavy. It might feel a wee bit small for someone with large paws, but for me (with average palms) it is perfect. Also, due to the weight, the blade is very nimble as the weight stays in the handle.Also, from an aesthetic point of view, the knife looks much better in real life.

Unfortunately, the book lacks power and by the end is nothing more than a diatribe against war."},{"rating":"1","title":"It did not work for me","review":"I used it with a Seagate Barracuda 7200.7, 120Gb, configured as master.It recognized the HD correctly, assigned a letter, but as soon as I would transfer data to it disconnects.I tried with an usb HUB, and behing the computer directly, no difference, same problem.I ended up buying the Vantec IDE to USB adapter, it works perfectly on the same configuration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product for using old internal drive as external usb drive","review":"The Sabrent USB2.0 to IDE Cable and power supply work wonderfully.I am able to use an old drive from my smoked desktop as a plug-in USB driveto my laptop and recovered all my data.

Plug the IDE end of the cable into your drive, connect power to your drive, then plug the USB end of the cable into your machine or USB hub and after a few seconds your system should detect the drive as a standard USB mass storage device.Not exactly pretty, and it doesn't protect your drive, so you don't want to use this as a solution for permanantly hooking up a drive to your box. However, if you just need to preform weekly backups, clone a HDD, or recover data this is the perfect tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, horrible execution","review":"I bought this to recover data from a drive after I upgraded to a computer that only supported SATA connections. First, the power supply included is incredibly cheap. It broke after about a day, and the cheap casing is easily broken. This makes it prone to electrical related injuries and it's extremely likely to cause a fire if left unattended.Secondly, it only worked with about 1/3 of the drives I have. Out of six drives, only 2 worked 100% of the time with this. No matter what jumper settings I used, the others would either not work at all or would disappear from Windows right after being installed.

A good portion of these franchises have MANY failures, And never grow beyond 100 franchises. Do your research on the FRANCHISE, not the financials they purport to be accurate! If they have been in business 30 years and franchising for almost all of those years, why don't they have more units? It is because MANY franchisees have lost everything and gone out of business. They then Re-Franchise the territory, and charge a hefty fee. Remember: A press release that says they will open 250 units in the next 2 years will NEVER be followed up by one that tells you they didn't hit their goal.

The Mass, as typified by Bach and those who followed became highly stylised; Jenkins breaks this model and takes a far more ecumenical view - I doubt that this Mass would be welcome in many Roman Catholic churches - and a lot of protestant ones would agree.Commencing with a medieval French song - \\"Beware the Armed Man\\" the Mass then proceeds to Islam with the Call to Prayer: Allah is great, there is no other god but Allah, sung by a muezzin.There follow a number of excursions into the classical Mass, interwoven with poetry from the likes of Dryden, Kipling and Tennyson and also Togi Sakichi reflecting on Hiroshima. A verse from the Mahabharata could also refer to the bomb, however this work dates back to the 4th century and earlier.The work is confronting, challenging and evocative.I liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Powerful and accessible","review":"Karl Jenkins music is fresh without it being weird, familiar without it being cliched. His approach to harmonic progression is structured and logical, yet still is wonderfully original. Of the CDs I have of his, this is the most traditional in style. It is inspiring and intriguing, but on first listen, parts of it come off as a little ordinary. On second or third listen, however, the originality and craftsmanship comes through. I taught my choir the Sanctus; it was easy to learn, and after we sang it on a Sunday as a prelude, we received several favorable comments from the congregation. (The most puzzling was \\"I loved the Gregorian Chant you sang..\\"!! The only thing the Sanctus shares with Gregorian chant is the Latin..) Still, the choir loves it, the congregation loves it, and my middle-school and high-school daughters love listening to the up-tempo numbers in the car."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply wonderful and moving","review":"What a wonderful way to remember the last century!

Schnabel's reputation for intellectuality and musical integrity sometimes leads listeners to expect a kind of joyless Teutonic paragon when they hear him; in these Schubert records, to the contrary, one hears immense joy in the music, rhythmic freedom, insouciance, ecstasy. One of the great things about this box is the sound quality. Schnabel created a bell-like sound at the instrument, a lyrical, and to my ears, deeply affecting sound that is often lost in modern remastering. Not here.

This incredible collection contains some of his strongest films, I believe. No Regrets and Scandal are good ones to begin with. This is personal filmmaking at its best. I like most of his films, but am more into human relations than the samurai warrior stuff. Emotions are what moves me, and these films are great examples of that. If you are a Kurosawa fan, then this is a must. These are some of the most stunning films put to screen. They could have added Ikiru(if it falls in the same time frame), but it's a heck of a collection, and beautifully restored...

Unfortunately, it's a real let down. There are a couple of pleasant ambient numbers and a couple of tuneful classical pieces but aside from that there seems to be a lot of 'padding'. A lot of the tracks are so short they become pointless, and a number of the songs employ somewhat irritating percussion. I am also concerned about the recording quality of this album. Listening to it using decent headphones there is a lot of background hiss. I don't know if this is intentional or due to poor quality recording but it is certainly annoying.

At their peak, their material was as strong as Chicago or Blood, Sweat & Tears, their jazz/rock contemporaries.This release is the mid 70's GRT vinyl LP and the sound quality is quite poor, thus my low rating. 10 solid song selections but 40% of the tracks are from \\"Lighthouse Live\\" and while excellent 'live' versions, the sound quality is even worse than the studio tracks included.You can do better than this with other, more recent Lighthouse compilations, mainly on cd (2009, 2010) and this great band deserves the longer track listing and remastered sound they provide.

It appears to be just because the zipper's bottom slipped out of its stitching, so a couple of stitches will fix it.Other than that, it appears cheap but serviceable. It's lower quality than the average cosmetic tote from the drugstore (thinner plastic, iffy stitching) but it's a bit bigger. I do wonder why a line of stitching was added across the bottom in the middle of a single sheet of plastic...it doesn't seem to serve any purpose, and it introduces a line of holes which I suspect will wind up being the first failure point (not counting the zipper)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap, Cheap, Cheap","review":"The vinyl is very flimsy and the stitching was loose.

It turns out this is a badly edited version from Topcraft who bought the rights. I was still hooked, though. After searching for quite a while I found the comics. Hayao had continued the story of Nausicaa well beyond the scope of the movie. I found in enthralling.

Chic and Tabatha Cicero have written the most shamefully poor book that I have ever had the misfortune to read on the subject. This book is insultingly patronizing and very badly written, even by Llewellyn's standards. Their insights are so greatly lacking that I am forced to wonder just how competent the authors are on the subject. Moreover, their \\"Tree Walk\\" creation has all the depth and brilliance of a Saturday morning cartoon. Kabbalah is a Spiritual Path of Divine Enlightenment. This book not only shows little respect for this Sacred Path, it shows absolutely no respect for the reader who is being dealt with as if they were a 7 year old."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely Not their best Work","review":"Unfortunately not one of the Cicero's best works, it lacks depth and is put together in a slip shod fashion.

I have read the four by her with the Knight family and loved them. And, let's face it, when you like a particular author you read whatever they have. So I read Pirate Prince for that reason. I usually declare a book remarkable when I can name at least two lines and two scenes that really got me. I can't for this one but I give it a high mark because I would recommend it to others. I wish we had gotten to know Lazar as the pirate. I couldn't help feeling like the book should have started with him on the ship or in a pow wow with the other captains to let us like him a little more.

Lazar is the perfect, tortured hero and Allegra is the perfect woman for him. I have to admit that while I read this book, I fell completely in love with Lazar, but how could it be helped? I laughed with him, I cried with him. It grabbed my attention from the very first page and at the end of the book, all I could do was sigh. Foley is a spectacular writer, in fact I'm awed with her ability to write just the perfect words page after page after page!

Ms. Foley has portrayed a man who is one of the most intense heroes that I have read about. Lazar is my idea of the 'ideal' hero. In many historical romances today the man is pushing the woman away because he is a womanizing rake. This isn't the case with Lazar. He desperatley wants Allegra's love to save him from the demons of his past that he is constantly fighting.Not only is this a favorite of mine from Foley, but one of the best Historicals I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A remarkable document","review":"This is one of those CDs that only comes along once in awhile like the companion ShostakovichShostakovich Plays Shostakovich, Vol. 5: Piano Concertos Nos. 1 in C minor Op. 35, 2 in F Major, Op.102, Piano Trio No 2 in e minor Op 67, Concertino for Two Pianos in A minor Op. 94. Here we have the Kabalevsky conducting 4 of his concerti played by the dedicatees -Emil Gilels, David Oistrakh, Daniil Shafran, and Yuir Popov. You may argue about the music's worth (which I find considerable especially the 3rd & 4th Piano Concertos and the neglected Violin Concerto), but the authority of these recordings is unmatched.

Nothing in the entire work kept me wanting to turn the pages.Harris seems to lack a distinct style all her own. It seems as though she borrows much from other writers, but not to the point that it's obvious, to her credit. For the most of it, I found this book no more entertainign than a campfire story, only without the frightening surprise ending.Having spent a great deal of my time growing up in Texas, I did not tend to much identify with any specific aspect of the work, as some critics have praised. It almost seemed mundane. Texas twists on others' styles do not, to me, constitute good works of literature.

It's fun and it takes a lot of energy to get through this, but it's worth it. With all the kickboxing and large movements and the non-stop pace, you will be shedding weight quickly. At the end of the aerobic section you repeat all the moves in a 'let it all hang out' (as she says) series of moves.

I would say this workout is best for quick learners and you need a bit of room to move in, more than my other workouts."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"I have used this for years and love it. works great for chapped lips, dry cracked sore lips, shaving rash, small cuts, for any kind of rash or rash that involves yeast infection. not for use in eyes, nose, or any sensitive places."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Indo-europeans from the Caucasus","review":"This beautifully written and well-illustrated book explains to junior readers everything they might want to know about the Indo-europeans as they must have appeared at the spread of Kurgan III, about 3000 BC or so. It is an excellent adjunct to such works as the American Heritage Dictionary, which lists Indo-european roots. It is a valuable source for reports and papers. After reading this book, your child will know what is meant by some major terms of ancient history: Kassites, Mitanni, and the like, and just what we have in common with the people of Iran and India. The book does have one minor flaw: its date. Without benefit of Mariya Gimbutas, Vlahos has all the people of India and Europe pouring out of the valley between the Great and Little Causasus, an unlikely scenario. What happened to the Georgians there we never hear."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting!!!!!","review":"This book is exciting to have and exciting to read. I recommend it for anyone who wants to rekindle some of the magic in their relationship. Written in easy to understand form, you feel as if the author is talking directly to you.

This is a book you'll want to read time and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book in NOT just for women!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Thanks to the author for such a well-written book. It's good to see that someone is thinking about the men for a change. Most books on relationships seem to be written \\"just for women\\", but this one addresses issues that both men and women can relate to, and I like that. We men like simple, and this book left nothing to the imagination. I didn't have to try and figure out what the author was saying because it was clear, concise and right on point. I recommend this book to all the men out there who are in relationships and want to understand their woman, as well as themselves.(...)I learned about parts that I didn't know existed on a woman. This is truly a nice read, even for us men!"},{"rating":"2","title":"wow very nice!","review":"the green is much darker in person. I had one like this when I was younger and love it.

While the others feature interesting arrangements that make the songs truly bluegrass - this one basically played the same arrangements with slight modifications and different instruments. In my opinion, this one had a really dark quality about it, and there were moments where I could have sworn I was riding in an elevator or on hold with really obnoxious muzak in the background.

I fixed this by taking the blade off, then duct taping all around the inside of the housing to create a channel. It works ok, but it's not quite strong enough"},{"rating":"1","title":"formulaic formalism","review":"The author appears to be terminally addicted toreams of calculation without much in the way ofmotivation.

For example self-control in the area of sex will lead to self-control in other areas of your life such as finances. If the person I want to marry is not will to control herself in the area of sex, in the future she will not be willing to exercise self control in other minor but important areas. \\"...to whom much is given, much is required...\\"I'm also gaining a lot of insight about the kind of preparation one has to make during the engagement period.

How to prepare yourself, and what to ask each other in order to secure a good foundation. I'd recommend! The only negative in my opinion, is the Engagement Chapter. He seemed to be repeating the same three basic principles the whole time. I don't enjoy repetitive writing that is circular in thought. The first few chapters were well written and provided no excuse not to love the book. The last two were, well, quite circular in describing it's principals. If you've never dated, have experience, or are even in the beginning of a relationship, this book is helpful.

You won't be sorry with this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only scary thing is that this book was actually published","review":"Wow! Man I gave this book the benefit of the doubt because of all the shinning reviews. Who the hell compared this to Strabb's Ghost Story? After reaching page 250 (a grueling task) there was still no sign of a story here. Thorne goes on and on for countless pages with boring detail...what drivel. Do not buy this book! P.S. Who did the editing? There were more typos that I can count."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT NEARLY AS GOOD AS IT COULD HAVE BEEN","review":"I had a hard time getting through this one. The charactersseem like cardboard and stereotypical. There was way too muchdescription and not enough chills. I really couldn't relate much to the characters or the plot for that matter. The old haunted house routine is being written to death. ...My two favorites are Peter Straub's Ghost Story and Dark Side: The Haunting by J. M. Barlog and this one is no comparison. You want some chills, check out those instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"That's what I'm talking about!","review":"Loved the book! I kept thinking of Jeff Goldblum as \\"David Masters\\". The only reason I gave it four stars was because I didn't care for how the author did away with the man in black--he was so EVIL and could have done a lot more for the plot rather than getting rid of the annoying housekeeper! I'm a new Tamara Thorne fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good old fashioned ghost story...with sex.","review":"Baudley House is a sprawling mansion supposedly filled with ghosts and demons. Eager to see if the legend is true, horror writer David Masters moves onto the estate with his teenage daughter Amber to write his latest book about the house. Given this rather basic premise author Tamara Thorne then lets her imagination run wild and pulls every trick in the book to keep the reader at the edge of their seat -- seances, cold spots, daggers, dungeons, possession, a cult, succubi, a headless ghost, an abandoned lighthouse, bloody dolls, a torture chamber... HAUNTED is wonderfully atmospheric and grips the reader from the start, holding them fast, and maintaining a solid momentum throughout this juicy, and nearly 500-page, tale of possession and evil from beyond the grave. A spooky and sexy epic. Lots of fun for those who crave a good scare before bedtime."},{"rating":"2","title":"A stunning book, well written with wonderfull twists.","review":"I don't usually read horror, I've read a little Stephen King (kinda have to living in the same town as the guy). Tamara Thorne's books enthrall me though. Her view of ghosts in this book is extravagant. Her writting captures the reader and keeps you reading untill you hunger for more. I anxiously await more from her as she is a wonderfull writer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tamara Tomato Tomorrow whatever","review":"See my subject line had better writing in it. I stopped reading this book with three pages left. Just out of spite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Reading","review":"Thorne has written a very readable story that melds serial killings, haunted houses, and voodoo into a seamless whole. The denouement was especially entertaining. The creation of absorbing action scenes that clearly describe the subtleties of physical movements is one of the most difficult technical tasks that a writer can master. In the climactic scene, Thorne achieves this with excellence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty darn creepy","review":"I've been desparate for some good scarry reading and I've been disappointed alot lately. It seems like there aren't very many good \\"subtle\\" horror/ghost stories, that make the hair raise on the back of your neck. Most are obvious slasher types, and I really miss the creepy ghost stories. I was not disappointed when I read this. It made be think twice about turning out the lights!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Snags a lot in the middle","review":"While dolls with pins stories are nothing new to me, this one is quite good. The book picks up well and ends well, but the middle few chapters are somewhat boring. Another twist is the way Christabel behaves with the kid Amber. The plot is very good and I finished it in a couple of days reading non-stop."},{"rating":"2","title":"VOODOO INDUCED GHOSTS!!!!","review":"This book was not what I was expecting! I thought it would be your run of the mill ghost story, it wasn't. The main ghost was so evil that she could pass as a demon. The other ghosts were a mix of both good and bad, but they were all Earth bound because of the main demon ghost girl. Very interesting story line and I enjoyed reading it very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"scary book that was hard to put down","review":"I enjoy reading any good story and a scary one even better but have found that King, Koonz, etc. don't appeal to me. Strictly personal choice and no reflection on those great authors. So I was a little leary when I began this book but decided to give it a try due to several recommendations. I was hooked from the start and kept turning pages to find out what was going to happen next. The author (Tamara Thorne) writes with dry wit that I found highly amusing and she kept the spooky factor to a close to believeable level. I do not believe in ghosts but this story made me pause for thought. The whole voodoo plot with the mother/daughter struggle was spine chilling. Not one slow spot in the book. \\"Haunted\\" is a well written story with a creepy plot that never stumbles, contains dialogue that easily flows from scene to scene and has memorable characters. As soon as I finished this story, I ran out and bought another book by this author. Definitely a keeper!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read","review":"As horror novels go this book rivals anything I have ever read. The style of writing is very engaging.

It's great for the kid just starting to skate and will grow with them four sizes. It's a very sturdy skate with great wheels. The bearings are not very good, but that's okay when your child is learning to skate because the wheels do not spin too fast. You can always change the bearings later when they are better at skating.

Until the upper started separating from the sole. She only wore them 4 times before this happened ... so I returned them today and Amazon told me that they are no longer carrying that slipper. That's too bad -- Dearfoams should increase their quality control and tighten the stitching around the shoe so this doesn't happen again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good..","review":"Foam does not bounce back. It collapses after several uses. For the price they are \\"ok\\" slippers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not The Best","review":"These slippers would be very comfortable if it weren't for the placement of the \\"Dearforms\\" label. It is sewn in the inside heel area of the slipper and the corners of it (the label) curl/stick up and constantly poke your feet. It feels like one of those annoying plastic price tag holders is embedded in the insole making them impossible to wear. If you actually want to walk in slippers, these aren't for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Temporary slippers~scuff then fall to pieces","review":"I was delighted with my Dearfoams slippers until after a few weeks my entire house was covered with BLACK SCUFF marks which I realized came from the slippers. Then, in less then 3 months I noticed little pieces of black plastic - like stuff I was sweeping up off of the floors. These were also from the slippers. Now the pieces are much larger as the slippers are in their final stages of dis-assembling themselves. I do not wear these outdoors, nor do I use them for anything but keeping my feet warm on cold days. I am completely disappointed because they are in peices now and I still need affordable slippers. Do not buy these slippers unless you only need them for a few months. I avoid negative comments on products unless I feel it is a complete waste of my money. These should be described as temporary slippers."},{"rating":"2","title":"clydebryant","review":"Excellent--I got htem fo rmy wife and she loves them--same quality as those sold by Sharper Image for $50+."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst quality ever - DON'T buy","review":"The slippers fell apart with multiple holes in the sole after only a couple of days gentle wear.

In trying to entertain Arnold, Kipper offers Arnold choices of his favorite toys with which to play. However, Arnold--all the while sucking his thumb--chooses something unexpected. This is a great little story for little ones. The illustrations like all of the Little Kippers series are cheery and fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute book, but focuses on thumb sucking","review":"I bought this book because the 2.5 year old I babysit for is obsessed with Kipper, especially Arnold. The only qualm I have with this book is that on every page it mentions Arnold sucking his thumb. Now, I know he does this all throughout the show, but no real attention is paid to it. It was so excessive that I had to stop reading those sentences in the book because I was worried the 2.5 year old was going to start sucking her thumb when she never did before. She loves Arnold so much that I'm sure she'd want to be just like him. I did see her start to put her thumb in her mouth a couple times while reading, which is again why that had to stop."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Time or Money","review":"If you buy this CD thinking the music is going to be as hot as the cover, you will be sadly mistaken.

It's clear and easy-to-use, though quite sophsticated in its research assistance, and very, very helpful in providing ways to separate out the valid information from the misleading or phony stuff. In the areas I researched intensively, it lists all the sources I eventually found for myself, plus some very useful sites I never discovered.

I speak from experience: somehow, these talented guys manage to win over not only the hard-core Bluegrass twangers, but the cautious Bluegrass neophytes and uninitiated as well. The Seldom Scene is a near perfect combination of outstanding musicians singing songs with simple but compelling lyrics to music that is just plain pretty. If you only have a dollop of country in you, you need this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Thought I'd Scene (and Heard) It All","review":"I have been listening to the Seldom Scene for about 30 years now and thought I had already heard their best work. Scene It All was one of those rare albums for me as most tracks were great. I have purchased albums in the past and had been satisfied if I like 3 tracks. This album has multiple tracks that were worth the purchase. I especially would have to recommend a listen to the Bob Dylan cover of Boots of Spanish Leather."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Fantastic!","review":"Having enjoyed listening to these guys a bunch of times in the DC area over the last twenty years, I was curious to hear them now with so much change in personnel. Oh my...they sound GREAT! Definitely one of my favorite CD's. This may be one of the best iterations of a band which has held itself together so well in spite of the transitions. If you like bluegrass, you gotta have it!

I don't think people understand what a product like this is worth to system quality. It gives your amps a boost and give you total control. I gave my nephew my old one 3 years ago and just purchased another one recently. Well worth the money! I will always use Coustic Crossovers!

The show itself is quite good and if you're already a Harland fan you won't be disappointed. If you're new to Harland then you may wanna look him up on Youtube or see if Comedy Central will be airing one of his specials anytime soon just in case he isn't quite your style.My only real complaint about this show would be that I've already heard the majority of it on his cd Har-larious, just in a different order for the jokes. So to anyone who also has the cd, don't expect much of anything new beyond his play with the crowd which I assure you is very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Entertaining Standup Show","review":"I purchased this DVD because I'm a fan of Harland Williams, I love his movies and his comedy act. When I heard that this dvd was coming out, I was anxious to see it.I must say that the start of the DVD was a little slow. If you've heard his Har-Larious CD, you'll know what I'm talking about. However, as the show progresses, it seems that Harland gets more and mre into the regular grove just like on the CD.It's a great DVD, with lots of his best jokes. The only bad thing about this DVD is that there are \\"Deleted Scenes\\" which is actually about 3 or 4 scenes that contained his jokes that was cut out of the original \\"show\\".Other than that one little negative, this is still a great show.

I bought the CD \\"Conversations with Inanimate Objects\\" and laughed my butt off the whole way through. I highly highly recommend the CD! So after that I sought out \\"Boyish Man\\", expecting to to be laughing the entire time again, only to be dissapointed. Half of the jokes are reused from his CD, and the other half weren't very funny. I laughed very little and sold this immediately after watching it. Do yourself a favor and buy his CD \\"Conversations with Inanimate Objects\\" and skip this. If you're really adamant about watching a comedy show as opposed to just listening to it, then fine. This DVD isn't terrible by any means but when half of the jokes are identical to the ones on his previously released CD, it loses its value. Gary Gulman, from what I've seen, is a very funny man and I really wish he would make more CDs or DVDs."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I've seen him live, and this seems to be a collection of his worst jokes.

I wish I still taught media studies--I would have my upper-level and grad students read this book, especially for its admirable avoidance of acadmic jargon. Weinstein finds a way to speak about the formation and growth of early television that is clear, informed and makes me think differently even about the television i watch today, even about contemporary media. I thoroughly enjoyed this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHEAP REHASH OF MAGAZINES, NEWS ARTICLES AND VIDEOS","review":"I bought this book expecting a carefully researched, full biography on Ellen. Instead it was basically a rehash of magazine articles, videos, and news stories about Ellen and her Coming-Out. The author did not even interview Ellen, so we don't get a true, direct-source picture of Ellen's life. Instead, we have old information taken from other sources and condensed into this book. It doesn't sound like the author interviewed Ellen's closest friends and associates, either; I got the impression that a lot of the information was third- or fourth-hand, not directly from the sources. This book is crassly commercial and written at the time that public interest in Ellen was at its peak. It reads like a fan magazine and its sole purpose was to make money, not to provide an insightful biography of Ellen DeGeneres. I would only recommend it to those who no longer have access to the magazines and videos about Ellen's show and her coming-out."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THIS","review":"Love this Stuff.

Its very different than using a regular mouse because you hold it like you would a pen, which takes maybe 1-2 days to get used to. It does have small groove sort of shapes on it so your fingers naturally rest where they are supposed to, very ergonomic. Once you are used to the pen-holding grasp, its a great mouse because its really comfortable for the wrist and arm, causes no wrist tension, is really lightweight, and has a easy clicker. I would recommend this product for those with more smaller to medium sized hands, but not for men with very large hands, since it is a small mouse and could be a little uncomfortable for large hands to grasp. My boyfriend has medium sized hands, and he is always on the go with his laptop and mouse, and he LOVES this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad quality. Bought it twice.

Our employees love the way this mouse feels and that it's so light, but we told them we don't want to spend $30-$40 every 3-6 months buying them a new one.

We thought it could have been a lot of fun. ... the kids had fun, but also complained early while playing the game. Complaints were mainly about the judge random & repeated comments and the kids got confused a couple times following the dvd. Only two of the game choices were actually activities and the others involved sitting & watching really bad old performances. Everyone of all ages got bored with that. Also, the music was digital techno sounding junk and made it all sound the same. It was really poor quality music. Over all, I wouldn't buy it. It would be better to buy Karoke Cd's. PS -- I hate writing reviews, but this one needed it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is awful","review":"This game is awful. The object of the game is to accumulate stars. Stars are handed out randomly and there is no skill inolved whatsoever. The microphone is a cheap plastic toy and doesn't attach to anything.

The graphics and music are why the rating is as high as I gave it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lotsa action, not much acting.","review":"Depending on what you like, you might like this movie a lot. There are lots of chases, crazy crashes and millions of dollars of damage to the city and vehicles on the way to catch the bad guy and save the girl.Maybe it's just me, but I am always perplexed by movies showing FBI agents as less than intelligent and competent. My personal experience while (small and brief) was not like that, and I have always understood that it is crazy hard to even be accepted by the academy, but who knows. It just seems like TV and movie directors seem to have some axe to grind with the FBI and this film continued the trend.The whole bad guy and the game of cat and mouse with Cena's character was a bit over the top for me, but it is not really worse than most movies of the genre'. So if you are a fan, don't let me dissuade you.

Setting aside whether one believes in reincarnation or whether the child truly *was* the reincarnation of a deceased monk, should any religious organization have the power to essentially take a child away from its family? Yes, the family was asked. Yes, they agreed. But how freely given, truly, was their consent? The Tibetan Buddhists remain an insular and conservative organization whose powerful elites suffer all the foibles, intolerance and prejudices of any fundamentalist theocratic organization. What troubled me most was the seemingly unanswered question: Will the child's parents ever be able to visit him again?The answer seems to be, No."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSOLUTELY LOVED THIS!!!!","review":"This has to be one of the most wonderful documentaries I've ever seen! If you weren't a believer in reincarnation before, you will be once you've seen this. A heart-wrenching, enlightening, beautiful, story that not only offers incredible insight into Buddhism but one that gives great hope for all of humanity through it's undeniable confirmation that there are unseen universal beings at work guiding us towards peace, love, compassion and the realization that we are all spiritual beings. I won't reiterate the story because I could never do it justice...You just have to see this! It will truly touch your soul.

I especially agree with his opinion that the U.S. Army was often overlooked when someone wrote about the war in the Pacific with so much press given to the bloody battles of the U.S. Marines. Don't misunderstand, the Marines were in some miserable, bloody, awful campaigns, but so were soldiers and sailors and they seldom get the recognition due them.

The difference is that Crowley was an original; Wilson gets all his (bad) ideas from other sources. Wilson's books are popular partly because he is such a funny and talented writer, but mostly because he gives people phony justifications for all the kind of self-indulgent hippie nonsense he believes in.

Overall, the book is written in an easy-to-read style and also includes the chemistry breakdown and dynamics of EPO in the body. It gives hope for healing where doctors and traditional medicine have left off. I personally suffer from MS symptoms and severe acne. Since reading Judy Graham's book I've started taking EPO regularly and have noticed a significant improvement in both conditions,again, where traditional medicine has not helped. Thank you Judy Graham for writing this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very interesting","review":"I have a slightly older version of this book than shown here, with a different cover and a bit shorter too! I have to say that I found this book at times a bit difficult to follow and there doesn't seem to be any certainty about most of the results of treatments with Evening Primrose Oil. There is some useful and interesting information but that is all and the writer seems to think that saturated fats are the culprits of many problems, an opinion which, after having read quite a few books, I don't share.I promised my sister-in-law that I would give her this book as a birthday present but I think that I am going to look for one by another author, maybe more updated too and have a quick look through myself to see if I might be interested in ordering one too!

There are also numerous suggestions for comparisons [another Essay style]The review questions after the chapter and the practice tests are helpful although not that realistic.

But I must say, I didn't like the organization of the information and felt like it was jumping around a lot. I read the entire review book but did not take the practice tests. Yes, I got my scores back and I got a 5 on it. So.. I don't know if the review book helped me or not because I already felt like I knew all of my information.

The way in wich these two carry on together would make for a good comedy sitcom! The story immedately throws you into a world of a E.T. searching, Phsyco stepdad, doped up mother, and many other wonderfuly interesting characters. This book keeps you on the edge of your seat right up to the last 20 or so pages, Which in my eyes is a big plus!!! I highly recomend this book,Especially if your a die hard Koontz fan!!!

Koontz writes with such description and humor that it is a joy to read \\"One Door Away from Heaven\\". I've told my friends, \\"You GOT to read this book!\\" From the remarkable young girl, Leilani, to the mysterious Curtis Hammond, I remained intrigued throughout the entire book. Dramatic twists and turns that I hadn't expected, add to the thrill of reading this charming novel. The characters are the best Koontz has done and have me laughing out loud much of the time.

Will Micky find Leilani in time, and whatever happened to Lukipela?

This one gives away too much of the plot describing events that occur up until page 400. Secondly, the book is too long at 600 pages. This length dissipates suspense. You know the villain won't be caught because you've still got hundreds of pages left to read. Mr. Koontz is is dire need of an editor...snip out a few adjectives here, a simile or metaphor there and voila...a shorter book. Also, the technique of having several main characters with alternating chapters describing their adventures was used to better effect in STRANGERS. Reading this book was a chore...not a pleasure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Did we all read the same book?!","review":"It saddens me that so many reviewers didn't get it. This book was the first Dean Koontz book I read since \\"Whispers\\", and it was only because a friend gave it to me. I don't like the horror genre, so I picked up this book with some trepidation.

I almost put it down halfway through the book, but I kept pushing along thinking that it would get better just around the corner. About 2/3rds of the way through it got a little bit more entertaining....but I just felt like something was missing most of the time I was reading. I just couldn't get into the characters.

I was completely disappointed after having read this book. I started the book and had a hard time really getting into it but wanted to give him the benefit of the doubt so I stuck with it. What started out as chapters of lengthy mediocre writing, turned into the worst plot I have ever encountered. Every time I thought I had figured it out, I said to myself, \\"No, it can't be that, he wouldn't write something that predictable.\\" Well, I was wrong. It was predictable and boring and a huge disappointment. It was different from his normal style (much like From the Corner of His Eye which was a great book) but it did not live up to my expectations which turned out to be entirely too high.

This book is really weak compared to his earlier works. It is really slow, and takes forever to develop a weak story line. I found myself not caring what hapenned to any of the charactures, tough to get through when you have a 600 page book! I am not good at giving up on a book and struggled through to the end hoping that it would have some merit. Sadly it does not. The last 100 pages or so finally ties together the sub-plots but even then just does not make exciting reading.I really feel that this time he has taken the 'dog' theme way to far.

Placing this author anywhere near the likes of Stephen King is doing a bit of a disservice to people with a minimum of taste. I don't want to get into the kind of hidden agenda and personal hang-ups that seem to motivate this writer, as they are really his problem, but they concoct a story that never once manages to create even a hint of credibility or interest.

It's a solid 4 stars. It was a bit drawn out in parts (aren't they all though) and it wasn't until about two thirds of the way through the book that you finally found out (for sure) what the heck was going on with Curtis Hammond. I really enjoyed reading about \\"Old Sinsemilla\\" who was always whacked out on shrooms and peyote and other mind-altering substances. It reminded me of my college days. LOL! I also LOVE the ET story. I wanted much more ET than was given though. The book was right up my alley: drugs, babes, ET's (good ones and bad ones), private investigator, serial killer, dogs, and more. I really enjoyed this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Door Away from Heaven","review":"I love this book!!!! I have read several of Dean Koontz's books and, in my opinion, this is his best work. If you do not fall in love with Curtis Hammond and Old Yeller, you do not have a heart. Without giving the book away, Curtis is not who he seems and the adventure Curtis and Old Yeller take together is worth the read all by itself, however, there is a young girl Leilani, a young woman Micky and an old worn out detective who soon find themselves with Curtis and Old Yeller in a very scary situation. What happens to them is life changing and leads them on a road to true humanity and a mission to change the world one person at a time. This book will make you think about where humanity is heading. This is a must read again and again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read another Koontz book!!!","review":"This book was really difficult to finish. All the action is compressed into the last 1/5 of the book. And so much information is given at the end that would have been so helpful in the beginning. You would almost have to read the book a second time to really appreciate some of the things that happen in the beginning. Also, having four separate stories that don't merge together until the final chapters was very disappointing. It was a really frustrating book to read and I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"entertaining","review":"this was my first dean koontz book, and i enjoyed the storytelling talents he demonstrates in it. i was at the airport contemplating whether or not i should pick it up, and a woman who caught me looking at it made up my mind for me when she actually gasped and said, \\"i LOVED that book. you should get it.\\" hmm...i think she was trying to tell me something...there are three distinct stories that intertwine and culminate into one, and while at first i found it distracting, ultimately it really held my attention as i continued chapter through chapter, and i found myself reading faster and faster as the stories picked up their pace and kept me turning the pages. some might find the ending a bit hokey, but i managed to consider it inspirational when it came down to it. i'd definitely recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Koontz reaches all time low","review":"One door away from heaven is by far dean Koontz worst book to date!Once one of the masters in the horror genre now is absalutely without any original ideas left!His story here is so scattered and unscary you realy cant begin to care about anything that happens.It started with From the corner of his eye and now unfortinently continues to get worse!Ive been a long time fan but untill i know Dean Koontz will return to his old ways of writing i think im done!If you want to read some great horror novels go back a few years and read his older books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One Door Away from Heaven","review":"I usually love Dean Koontz's books, and can hardly put them down. But...this book I actually threw in the garbage! The story was so depressing, that I actually felt sick inside! And...it just drug on and on, and I could not figure out WHAT the story line was. Not for me. But..I am still a Koontz fan, and will go on to the next book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sooooo Boring","review":"This was one of the worst koontz books i've ready yet. It started out pretty good but it dragged out. It was soo long and boring i had trouble finishing it. I would suggest not getting it. I would suggest reading Intensity, velocity, odd thomas, and the face. Most of his older work i've read has been pretty good. This book i had to put down soo many times i read two other books in between reading this one because it was horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hear the school bell ringing.","review":"I typically buy Dean Koontz's new books without bothering to read the story summary, knowing that I'm in for a good, page turning read.This book started out wonderful. I was enjoying the characters and intrigued by the story's plot. About half way through the book, the story took a turn and I began to feel as though I were sitting in the lecture hall of Koontz Academy.I read his books for entertainment and a fun filled, exciting escape from the real world.This book turned into a lecture on the evil of Bio-Ethics. While Koontz has prompted me to learn more about Bio-Ethics and their agenda, this book was not a satisfying escape from reality.For true escape and great fun, I suggest Lightning or Watchers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Koontz is evolving into a writer who cannot be classified","review":"I know a lot of people are not too happy with the way Dean Koontz's writing is changing from pure suspense/murder mystery to, well, something else. But I love it! His books are becoming richer and more complex like a fine wine. I like the way he blends the supernatural and surreal with themes from real life.One Door Away From Heaven was a very satisfying book - the villain was just as evil as any he has ever written, the heroes just as good (and funnier), and let's not forget the dogs! Koontz writes about dogs in a way that is so real I can see their grinning faces while I'm reading.I also like Koontz's no nonsense opinions about such modern concepts as self help psychology and bioethics.I highly recommend this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What has happened to the master storyteller?","review":"I have been a hardcore Koontz fan for over fifteen years, and I must say that it's tempting to give this book five stars simply because it was written by one of my favorite writers.The construction of the book was similar to \\"From the Corner of His Eye.\\" There were several seemingly related subplots that Koontz attempts somewhat unsuccessfully to bring together.Some of the characters were reminiscent of other Koontz creations. The drug-crazed mother brings back memories of another drug-crazed mother in \\"Intensity,\\" and the wonderdog is back, bringing to mind the lovable Retriever in \\"Watchers,\\" who was much more believable than Ol' Yeller.Not a total disappointment; however, I long for the Koontz of \\"Dragon Tears,\\" \\"Lightning,\\" and Mr. Murder.\\" I want a novel, not a collection of short stories, which is how this book reads."},{"rating":"1","title":"too long to be so dull!!","review":"Uhhh I have a love/hate relationship with Dean Koontz and this book I hated. It was just over 600 pages and I think I enjoyed maybe the last 50 pages or so. The characters were unrelatable and I couldnt connect with anything or anyone in the book. For being such a long book I felt like there was little jolts of excitement but the amount of dullness surrounding it choked it out. The plot hops around between the different characters and you litterally have to wait til the book is almost over to understand how they connect and until then your kind of lost. What else can I say this book was just not for me"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't hold my attention - story boring","review":"I read about half the book and started skipping ahead until there was nowhere to skip. I found the majority of the story boring and a waste of time. the kid was the most interesting until each chapter became a repeat of the one before."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was okay but I probably wouldn't read it again","review":"I have dualling opinions about this book.On one hand, I found the characters unbelieveable, some of the plot to be too contrived, and sometimes just plain silly.On the other hand, I liked the forum of a fictional novel to explore real issues of significance to all of us. It got me thinking about how easy it is for a society to accept practices that benefit the few and eliminate personal choice and how easy it is for our goverment to support these practices.I liked the fact that our hero was flawed and not who you would expect, and, as always, D.K. makes us believe in the power of family and our animal friends."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one's kind of for the dogs","review":"This was a rather disappointing book from Koontz. I've read most of his books and have always enjoyed them. I found the characters in this book well written and interesting and it did keep me guessing as to where he was going with the plot. However once I got to the end and found out his destination I had a hard time not thinking I just read a 600 pages for this? I won't give away the ending for those who haven't yet read it, but I feel that though the outlook expressed in the ending is admirable it doesn't make for a very satisfying conclusion for a book of this length. If a sequel is in the offing, I sure hope he adds a few more twists."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Satisfying As Watchers, Brought Be To Tears","review":"First off, I admit I am HUGE Koontz fan; his writing is phenomenal. I have read nearly all his books. Ever since I have read Watchers, it continued to be the best book I ever read, until now. One Door Away From Heaven is a COMPLETE equal to Watchers, if not better, and when you near the end a melancholy sadness emerges in you, for you can't bear to put the book down, yet you don't want to finish it. You feel as if you are right there with the characters experiencing everything with them. When I finished the book, it brought me to tears, which no book has ever done. This book is truly inspiring and no description could do it justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"More than one door actually ...","review":"Either Dean Koontz has been replaced by a computer or he's forgotten everything he ever knew about writing suspense novels. A potentially great storyline (bioethics) is smothered in overwritten eccentric characters, stupid subplots about aliens, superintelligent dogs etc etc. Dean my advice to you is to get a good editor ... Still why bother with such inessentials as a coherent plot, believable characters and genuine suspense when the DK name will sell millions anyway?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Corny Dialog Dooms This Story From The Start","review":"I've read and ejoyed many of Dean Koontz books. This one, however seems to have been written by someone else. Koontz tries to make the characters of this story interesting by pouring on lots of colorful dialog. Unfortunately, the dialog is more corny than colorful. I listened to the audio version of this book and found myself turning it off time and time again. I just couldn't stand listening to the long-winded rants and multi-adjective descriptions that pepper much of the book. Koontz tries hard to make his characters \\"hip\\", but he does not succeed. One tip off to this is the unbelievably lame character names. Leilani Klonk?????? C&#65533;mon Dean... what were you thinking. I was very dissapointed in this offering from a writer who has proven he is capable of much, much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame, boring, very poor result","review":"I used to be a big Koontz fan. But most of his novels these days seem to be the result of an attempt to be profound. Lots of meta-physical mumbo jumbo.Bring back the action!What a waste of my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTED","review":"I was disappointed in the plot, in the flow and in the way that it failed to keep my attention and demand that I continue to read. This is not a typical Koontz book.It's most redeeming quality is the fact that it is written by a literary master. Koontz' artistry is top-notch. His storytelling ability is eloquent and humorous. I laughed out loud more than once.Yet I still found myself wishing that he'd kept it more succinct. The only reason I refused to put down the book is that I wanted it to be over -- to learn what was found one door away from heaven -- hoping that it wasn't another 600 pages in this tale.Die-hard Koontz readers may want to avoid this one -- you'll be disappointed. It is fun to see him tackle another genre, I guess, but it was painful."},{"rating":"2","title":"He's baaaack!","review":"I have been a long time fan of Dean Koontz, and have read just about all his books. Over the last couple of years, he seems to have lost the edge he had at the beginning, although his writing style has continued to improve. What I'm trying to say is that he had lost the ability to make me HANG ON to the book and be completely unable to put it down...until now. I couldn't wait to turn the page and see what happened next. It's been a long time since I felt that way about his work (sorry, Dean) but now I'm excited again, can't wait for the next one! I was somewhat surprised to learn that these bioethics jerks really exist. As someone who works in healthcare, I plan to learn more on how to shut the door in their collective faces."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dean Koontz has found his sense of joy again!","review":"Dean Koontz seems to have come out of wherever he has been. After a run of cynical and not very upbeat books, Mr. Murder and the like, he seems to be recovering his sense of wonder, hope and even joy. The characters in this book are people that he really seems to like. This book was terrific! It's nice to see some optimism and hope in the world--I was sorry to see the story end and as is usual, the next three novels I read, paled in comparison. Keep it up, Mr. Koontz--it's nice to have you back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Major disappointment","review":"I have read EVERY one of Dean Koontz's novels and while I have taken exception with some he's written in the past few years, I've never been this disappointed before. His character development, as always, is outstanding but this is one of the worst stories he has ever come up with. Literally, almost nothing happens until you're almost 400 pages into this book and the action (what little there is) slowly (and predictably) begins to build. At 600 pages, this book is far too long and should have been 200 pages shorter. His descriptions of scenes, characters, and actions have become much too flowery and wordy and I often found myself saying \\"Who cares?\\" Keep it tighter next time, Dean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short story gone crazy","review":"I read this book and toughed it out til the end, because it came recommended by someone who usually has the same taste as me in books. Slow plot, some minor suspense, and a poor ending. SPOILER: I was very mad after reading the entire book to find the reason given for the alien coming to Earth was to save the planet by, of all things, teaching them to love dogs. Seriously?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Big plot, big heart, big love for this story","review":"I'd read a couple of so-so books by Dean Koontz when this one fell into my hands. He is a great, imaginative writer, but you know how it is -- some stories you just like better than others.This story, I loved. The plot moved forward at a steady pace and both threads came together in a very satisfying ending. The character development was very good as well.I thought this was a well-crafted book with lovable, sturdy good characters and loathsomely evil bad characters and in my opinion, you can't ask for much better in a very entertaining novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disfunctional Story","review":"First, I love Koontz works. But...This one stank. I forced myself to finish it. It started very slow. There was way to much family disfunction for my taste. It was unbelievably disfunctional. And I did not really like any of the characters, even the dog and the boy. Especially the disrespectful little girl.Wait, there was one character I liked. It was Rickster. He was pretty cool."},{"rating":"1","title":"last chance","review":"I love dean koontz but his work has been off a little bit butbeing such a loyal fan I thought I would give his work anothertry but with one step from heaven I must admit this will probably be my last book. This book was a big fat zereo from start to finish.The chacters were boring it has so many plots and so many boring under devloped charters in the book that i had to keep flipping back in the book just to rember who they were. and the end was a just nonsense. This book was just awfulit would have been a whole lot better if Dean would have went more into the mother life when she was young.And cut out a lot of the dog scences"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring...plus","review":"Anyone who reads Koontz as I have read all, must think that he has lost it a bit..this book was without a doubt the most boring book he has written to date..I very much struggled trying to keep up and usually wound up falling asleep......save your time and go to Ludlums new book...much better"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money, waste of time.","review":"This is the first book I've read by Dean Koontz...and it will definitely be my last.I expected a somewhat intelligent science fiction thriller, but I should have known by some of the previous reviews and the humorous quotes introducing the novel that I was way off-base.I still can't figure out what Koontz's intention was in writing \\"One Door Away From Heaven\\". Eccentric caricatures instead of characters, unbelievable and repetitive situations, bad use of English...and a psychic dog! Is it supposed to be a spoof? Was it intended for not-too-bright youngsters, maybe as an ugly sci-fi cousin to \\"Harry Potter\\"? No matter what way you look at it, it's a ludicrous endeavor, and about 300 pages longer than necessary to hold its multiple, slender plot-lines.Valuable lesson learned: read ALL those Amazon.com reader reviews before buying!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible...","review":"The first Dean Koontz book I ever read was \\"Strangers,\\" and thank goodness it was a tremendous pleasure. Since then, I've read most of what Koontz has written. With that in mind, I'd advise you to skip this book. Awful, preachy new-agey stuff (and I've been known to like new-agey stuff, if done well!).I don't know what's happened to Koontz -- even his best books have a \\"churn 'em out quick\\" feel, yet also have a magic about them that makes them difficult or impossible to put down. Yet this one was just bad... mushy, incoherent and downright unpleasant reading... like a \\"B\\" movie in underdrive. Koontz seems to have found a \\"formula\\" -- formula characters, formula stories, formula preaching (this time his rant is against bioethics). Please, if you have to check this one out then do so -- from a public library. Don't waste the money, not even at 25 cents off the clearance racks. A tremendous disappointment... Koontz has lost me as a reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet read","review":"I loved this book. It is sensitive, thoughtful, deeply personal, and opinionated. The word choice and poetic narrative give the book an emotional color that can be in turns heart-wrenching, comic, suspenseful, and mysterious. It's not necessarily a read for people who take a harder-edged view of life. If there is some heavy-handedness in the final message, I feel it was earned. Plot holes . . . I saw them, and I didn't care. Koontz wrote his heart out."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"this book is sooo boring that I can barely finish it. I like Dean Koonze a lot but this book is a huge disappointment. Seems to me the book is a hybrid of his former works, like phantom + the dark river of the heart(the alien assasin group), from the corner of his eyes (the alien boy Curtis), seize the night (the dog), etc. I am happy I borrowed the book instead of buying it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who's missing from the lineup?","review":"Well, let me start by saying I've read almost every other book that DK has published to date and am a BIG fan. However, this was a long and drawn out story with so much going on that it was confusing compared to his other works. As to my review title \\"Who's missing from the lineup?\\" lets see...we have a handicapped little girl, a drug addict mother, a serial killer step-father, a drunk, an habitual lying old lady, a washed out private eye, TWO former vegas show-girls, and space aliens etc. etc. everything but the kitchen sink. No, wait, i think a kitchen sink WAS in there somewhere. WHEW! I was glad when it was over.I'm still a fan, but it almost was like DK threw a little of everything into the characters because the story line was so [bad].Looking forward to the next book in spite of this one..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The pic in the back tells us his dog can read, but write?","review":"Im guessing his genius dog wrote this book.I am a huge Koontz fan, so I feel guilty not giving him a good review, but I just cant honestly say good things about this book.He over details every single atom and cell on every object in the book, which gets old by page 2.Im beginning to think he writes all children as witty, smart allecky geniuses because he doesnt really know how they speak.Dogs eat their own waste, lets stop making them geniuses. (I loved Watchers, but enough is enough)The ending is one of the worst Ive ever read. I read 680 pages of detailed drivel, and the last page, 681, still didnt deliver any punchline."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some People Take Fiction Too Seriously!","review":"I read this book while I was in a psychological rehibilitation facility being wheened off of Depakote that caused me to have amonia in my blood and when I read this story I was like Lorilani is a very brilliant young girl!. The ways she survives her tormentor and drugged up mom and having to fend for herself just so the supposed \\"handicapped\\" are just that by name only. This book is a tour de force in modern science fiction/suspense crossover. I sincerely recommend this book. The Heaven part nearly kept me away from it cuz I don't like religious materials but this only has to do with the metaphorical Heaven. Anywho I have 31 of Dean Koontz novels and I find this one to be in at least the upper 7 or 8 of them over all. Grab it while you can!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not his best work","review":"I am a huge Dean Koontz fan. I have read Stangers and Watchers at least 5 times each, and have loved many others. The debth that is usually in his other books is not here. The characters are not as well developed, and I finished the book still waiting for things to happen. Pick from other Dean Koontz books, but this one was poor."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!","review":"What a waste of time! None of the characters were fleshed out enough to make me care about any of them. Too many storylines going on at once, with none of them really explored fully. The only time it got interesting was somewhere around tape #10, where the main villain's beliefs on bio-ethics were discussed. Skip this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply dreadful. But some diehards will adore it.","review":"Formula Koontz: take an intelligent dog, a couple of morose people with big problems, an exotic premise, the imminent threat of our times, and what do you have?More or less, about 10 bestsellers.Okay, okay, sometimes a person plays the part of the intelligent dog. Happy?I don't think Mr. Koontz has changed. I think I have changed. What once was fresh and unexpected, even quirky and delightful, is now just Koontzification. It comes with the landscape.The last Koontz I liked was _Sole Survivor_. Possibly because the overtone of loss resonated so deeply with me at the time. Let's just leave it there and not bestir those old bones again.Goodbye, Mr. Koontz."},{"rating":"1","title":"Koontz has stumbled yet again into boring, preachy drivel.","review":"I think that this will be the last Dean Koontz book I will buy. I have over 20 of his books. I used to find him exciting and easy to read. Of late, however, I have found his books are no longer exciting in the least.There is virtually no plot in this latest offering from him. It also contains his most annoying character yet. An alien boy who wonders around saying inane things. Too much of the narrative is taken up with Koontz complaining about the shape the world is in, the evils of Hollywood, and the corruption of Politicians.And worst of all, what used to make Koontz novels such fun to read is an interesting sicko. There is none in this book. The sicko we do get is not fleshed out anywhere near enough and is just ludicrous.For those of you who have never read Koontz, steer clear of this. I would suggest you read Mr Murder, Dark Rivers of the Heart, and Watchers."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Door Away From Heaven","review":"In the seventies, I was teaching in Houston, and a student brought me a book to read. (I really didn't want to read it, but I promised.) That afternoon, I was stuck in a two hour traffic jam, and I started to read Eyes of Darkness. I stayed up all night to finish it. I was hooked. I am saying this because I am an avid fan through all his name changes; however, this is one of the worst of his books. I have had it for three weeks and I am only through the incident with the snake. I am very disappointed. I will read reviews before I shell out that kind of money again. I know a writer cannot pump out books like Intensity time after time but this one is slow, and I cannot see anything but a group of dysfunctional characters and a rambling plot. Now if you want a book that will keep you up, just read Intensity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too rambling.","review":"When Mr. Koontz is good, he is WAY GOOD! But here's another one with too much witty, wandering dialogue, way too many fabulous metaphors, and way too many pages. One of my favorite authors, Dean Koontz. But I'm skipping through this one just to get to the end. Instead of being able to savor each metaphorical gem and finely-tuned thought, they're all running together too closely. When you have a 16 cartons of chocolate, you begin to get sick of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z-Z A Real Snooze","review":"A one star rating is too high for this book. Negative stars would be more like it. What would normally take me a week to read took me 5 and a half months of boring reading!! I'm a big fan of Koontz work and have read a bunch of his books. This book doesn't fit the Koontz style. It feels like it was written by someone else. I trudged through about half of this book, and put it down for about a month. I finally decided one day that it had to get better and picked it up again. It didn't get better. This is a lousy book with no real story. It starts bad, the middle is bad, it gets good about a hundred pages from the end and then the ending stinks. If Koontz was trying to make a social statement with this book he succeeded, if he was going for entertaining reading he completely missed the mark. I can't even say its \\"not one of Koontz' better works\\" because it's not even good enough to be classified as bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Long and boring","review":"Koontz has written a pretty good 250-300 page thriller, but unfortunately, it took him 600 pages to do it. Virtually nothing happens for the first 300 pages, and the book then picks up a little speed but still moves slowly, You almost get the feeling that Koontz is being paid by the word. That or he is trying to be \\"artsy.\\" He goes into endless and tangential harangues on every person, object or animal that appears anywhere on the periphery of the book. The only way I could get through it was with lots of skimming."},{"rating":"1","title":"Different, not necessarily disappointing...","review":"DK's latest wasn't disappointing, as much as it was different, in much the same way as From the Corner of His Eye. I enjoyed both these books, but nowhere near as much as some of his earlier thrillers. It seems Koontz is trying to explore different topics and genres as a writer, and his approach (IMHO), is still pretty flawed. I would love a return to the twisted, imaginative Koontz thriller days of old, but it seems with age, he's growing weary of that, and is testing his pen in other places. That's not a problem. Bob Dylan did the same thing, and so, it seems, is Stephen King. But I hope that Koontz can soon master this new direction, because I ... am already disillusioned and bored."},{"rating":"1","title":"His worst by a long time fan","review":"This is Dean's worst book because he spends the most time preaching a silly new age Christianity based type belief (mixxed in with dog worship... I think he most not like cats or thinks we cat people most be perverted) while demonizing the ideas of others that don't come close to his. Of course all his characters agree with him, except the evil ones who he alludes are controlled by what I assume is the Devil. He does this while also making fun of New Age believers, people into health foods, and so on. Weird and hypocritical.The story becomes a vehicle to spew this nonsense while letting the story take a back seat. Those that agree with his selective logic and particular myths will enjoy the book. Those that don't will hope he gets back to telling stories or retiring before he ruins a career I have, up till recently, enjoyed."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of his worst","review":"I am (or was) a Dean Koontz fan but the last 2 books were just verbal non speak. This one \\"One Doorway From Heaven\\" is nothing but an attempt to impress with overuse of adjectives. The story is nonsensical and makes little sense and has no flow to it. He in constantly describing things that have no relevance to the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most Enjoyable","review":"As all Dean Koontz novels do, his villians are very evil and strange. Preston has a very sick mind, but is very clever and intuative. He would have succeeded if the Hero did not come to save the day. The hero a boy, but not a boy who made some strange but loving friends. I would like to believe that I am also strange, but loving. Which I believe that Dean Koontz is too. At least where his books are concerned. I do love that he included a dog, as he does in many of his books, which I also love. All in all the characters make for a most interesting read. Just like in life, all the strange and loving encounters make for a most facinating and fulfilled life. There are so many lessons to be learned in his tale. I considered a must read on the Dean Koontz list."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big let down after 600 + pages","review":"I have been a big fan of Dean Koontz's books for over ten years and I nver thouhgt that I would rate a novel by Dean Koontz so poorly. The first book I read was Watchers. I thought it was fantastic!! After that I was hooked. To say that I was dissapointed in this book would be an understatement. It just didn't make much sense to me. As individuals the characters were not interesting. When they finally all came together they still were not interesting. Without giving too much away I will say that I can't buy the idea that the key to humankinds salvation and happiness can be found in a dog. When I usually read a Knootz novel I can't put it down. With this book I found it hard to mantain my interest and when I finished I thought IS THAT IT! AFTER OVER 6OO PAGES THIS IS HOW IT'S ENDS???????"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Too Many Characters which Dilute a Good Story","review":"Sometimes I read a book and think, \\"this should have been two or three separate books\\" and that was the case with this Koontz novel. With so many distinct characters running around and so many plot lines whipping every which way, the story just gets too thin in places to be a good read. With me, it's always hit or miss with Koontz. Some of his work is my absolute favorite reading material (\\"Watchers\\" especially) and other times I come across something like this. If only it had just been about the special boy, or the crippled girl, or the Private Eye, or the psycho Phd... but unfortunately, Koontz crams them all in and thus takes a bunch of good stories and creates a crummy one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have been left with the Editor.","review":"The only reason I finished this book (and that took some doing) was to see if possibly the end might make more sense than the book did. Very boring, very scattered. It was as if a chapter was written, forgotten about and then re-started again.

I paid my money to hear Black Rob, not the Lox, Puff Daddy, or anyone else. Some people I havnt even heard of like Joe Hooker, Mario Winans, Mark Curry, Carl Thomas, or Cheryl Pepsi.

However, this is some of the worst hip-hop I've ever heard. When real MCs like Guru and Rakim dis wack MCs, they're talking about rappers like Rob. Wack production is obvious, so how can anyone say production is tight? For example, that one joint where Rob is talking about his mama has a wack beat, an uncatchy chorus, and, of course, wack lyrics. Basically, Puff Daddy needs to give it up, because in a few years, Bad Boy Records will be gone for good. After listening to this, I won't expect anything good from Black Rob or Shyne in the future... Peace"},{"rating":"1","title":"This Is TRASH!","review":"What kind of garbage is this?

I never give anything away but this was an exception. By the way Joe Hooker fits the album. HE'S TRASH TO! Practicaly all the songs on here were already released LAST YEAR in NEWYORK.

Starts with an upbeat warm-up that gets you moving & stretched out right away (I thought the stepping was a bit fast-paced for a warm-up, but I got used to it). Section 1 is the longest--stepping mixed with toning & squats. Initialy runs the risk of being repetitive, but the second half is more interesting. Section 2 can be skipped if you're a beginner, but it's not tough--actually has less cardio than section 1, more toning & the step moves are more fun. Section 3 is floor work to target first the inner & outer thighs, then buns, then cool down. Overall, a fun workout that gets you sweating without a ton of jumping (although I have nothing against jumping).

He wrote this book so that young men (yes, it was of the times, but I bet some young women still read it) would be totally conversant with our Constitution.

It made a lot of solid statements, but didn't give a lot of good advice on how to implement their suggestions. For example, the authors stated that many women cry at work, and one should never be seen crying. But the book offers no suggestions on how to prevent yourself from crying as a reaction to difficult suggestions, right after saying it is a problem a lot of women face. Same with handling the difficulty of giving negative feedback to someone--they say it is a hard thing for many people to do, but don't offer much in the way of how to overcome that difficulty.Hopefully someone else will write an improved version of this, with real, tangible advice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as accurate as we thought","review":"We are all being deceived, as Giginotosaurus is NOT the biggest known carnivorous dinosaur ever found.

Not to mention the advantage of Steroscopic vision and lots of other advantages T .rex had. He is trying to make Giganotosaurus what it isn't.

I have always loved the Palm but go through them like bic lighters so I tried the HP. When that failed (must be me) the Sony looked like a great choice. Set up was a nightmare. You have to install each program separately and it took a while. I could not get it to sync with my Outlook although if I would have spent more time on it I am sure it would have worked. While loading the programs I plied with it a little and did not like it. The scroll bar in the middle was awkward and tough to move. It is not like the palm based products I am used to. I did not like that no cradle only a cable was included. No case only a thin cover that snaps on. The Clie is $300 and merits more quality accessories. The camera is great though and would have been a welcome feature had I kept the Clie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I bought this frame hoping that it would be slightly higher in quality then the frames sold at urban outfitters. WORST FRAME EVER! The frame arrived and the edges while wider then the frames at UO, they are lower in quality -- not only do they look cheaper but when placing a normal size record in the frame there tends to be a small gap between the egde of the frame and the record (not the right size for an average record). UO record frames also include a wooden backing to help stabilize the record in the frame, in this frame the records are held in by directly placing spring clamps against the back of the record--pressing into the cardboard and overtime damaging the sleeve! UO frames also have a piece of glass that protects the record, this frame includes only a cheap piece of plastic that looks terrible when placed over the record!SAVE YOUR MONEY - buy two frames at UO for 20$ before you buy this one for 12."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Large for LP Covers","review":"I was very disappointed. A friend of mine purchased a couple of these as Christmas gifts for me. These frames are oversized for a standard LP cover. There are gaps along the boarders depending how gravity lets the Album Cover sit inside. There is movement. A frame similar to this should be a press fit for any LP Album Cover. The LP should not fit sloppily inside the frame like these frames do. I saw least expensive frames at my local Expect Store for $2.00 each. I bought 2 of those for my daughter and the albums fit nice and snug. They were Christmas presents and they looked beautiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality a little disappointing","review":"The frames from Container Store were a little low on quality. The plexiglass in all cases (2 sheets per frame) were dinged or nicked near the edge, as the plastic is rather flimsy.

Even for $13, I'd expect the plexiglass to be of a little better quality.

Anyhoo, the action scenes are wonderful, and they are stuck together with a story that brings in some believable emotion, but doesn't go too over the top. The fairy-tale ending is a nice touch.

If you're not, it's best to just keep away. His earlier works, including the excellent \\"Bloodsport,\\" the timid \\"Kickboxer,\\" and the silly \\"Death Warrant,\\" all had the exact same elements this movie has. It's a by-the-numbers Van Damme flick that will probably interest only die-hard fans of his work. Director Sheldon Lettich and Van Damme have worked on another better film called, \\"Double Impact.\\" See that one."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didnt like it","review":"I think that the fight scenes were too slow and that the used a poor system to hide the blows. every time an actor gets hit it switches to another angle for a seacond. the only time this doesn't happen is the last fight scene because the big baddy knows his distance. the combat is slow and obvious. I give it two stars becuse van damn does show some unique athletisism in his moves.

I really didn't like the film to much. The film wasn't really like his other 80's films. The story line was really slow not much of an action movie. This movie was more like a \\"ladys soap opera\\" rather thin a action movie. IMODont get me wrong there was acouple of parts in the film that were awesome but still the movie wasn't that good.

Good movie for those new to Van Damme films","review":"Whether you're a Van Damme fan or have never heard of him, you'll appreciate this movie. As always, there's plenty of kickbutt action but it also has lots of heart and a good story-line. Van Damme usually plays good guys (with the occasional evil twin), helping friends and family out of tough situations. The same goes for this film. He sacrifices his body through underground fights to financially and anonymously help his widowed sister-n-law and nephew. Great fighting scenes. Funny sidekick. Good acting, by all characters, pulls you into the story. Bottom Line: Golden Oldie that will win you over!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HIS BEST MOVIE","review":"As someone who loves Van Damme, his style and kicks, this is the first movie where he actually shows his inner drama acting parts, if someone would have shown me this movie without the actor i would never guessed that Van Damme acted her, he is really full with emotion in \\"Lionheart\\" and quite frankly maybe if he would have acted on more drama scenes and less kick scenes in all of his years he would have been a rock star by now"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Van Damme","review":"This is not a good film. However it is an entertaining film. The plot is as follows: it is a Van Damme flick. The plot is always the same. In Lionheart Van Damme's excuse for kickin butt is that he has to provide for a family his junkie brother has left behind. Since he has no other skills to fall back on(acting included) he fights in small time pitt fights for L.A's rich thrill seekers. This films saving grace is that the action is pretty good. It is a mindless film that action lovers can enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Summary..he he he","review":"To me, this is my favorite JCVD movie of all times. maybe its because he lost it in knock off or because of all his problems.

It's poorly recorded, and very dead sounding. It's not Canned Heat!! What they are doing is putting down progressive/blues rock music.

While keeping in mind his highly negative attitudes towards the Soviet government, the reader sees clearly Shostakovich's use of codified language, forms of reverse psychology, irony, parody, all of which he uses to keep the offical government censors off his (and Glikman's) back, and yet to deliver his true message, idea, opinion in a singularly and brilliantly effective way.My only reservation about the book is the one-sidedness of it. Glikman's letters, or simply more extensive commentary (although it is remarkably thorough, and an outstanding job for an old man 30 years later!). Shostakovich destroyed all the letters he received, so remedying this problem, alas, is virtually impossible.Highly, highly recommended despite this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic.","review":"Bought this sink for a remodel job in our main bath. Needed to bring 1925 style into the modern era. This sink works well in that regard. Is nicely sized and comfortable to use; modern, yet seems traditional. We have in-wall plumbing fixtures and they work really nicely with this deep bowl. It does not work with a standard drain (the cheap ones that usually are boxed with the faucet fixtures) because the threading on them is not quite long enough.

She summarizes the influence of Julia Child's publishing of a French cookbook in the 60's, Alice Waters' emphasis on fresh ingredients in the 70's, and tons of anecdotes about the effect of an ethnic cooking boom in the 80s and 90s. But no real analysis of any of this. She cites Kellogg and the \\"Food Science\\" movement of the early 1900s as a reason for the public acceptance of poor tasting food, but there's no real analysis, nor is there anything other than sketchy hearsay about a rise in the quality and variety of the rest of the food Americans eat.

It is without a doubt the most poorly written biography I have ever read. It's more of a listing of facts and patent specifications than the telling of the story of a man's life. Seriously, does the reader need to be told, twice within the first 30 or so pages, that Wireless World went from being a weekly publication to a monthly one on a specific date? I don't think so. In the hands of a decent biographer this may have been an interesting story but the author of this book fails miserably.

I've read and enjoyed many re-treads -- some of them written by Turtledove, in fact -- but even if a writer takes a familiar storyline or tired plot device, he or she can make a new story pop by adding strong characterization or interesting nuances. Unfortunately, this book has neither and, sadly, ranks at the bottom of Turtledove's bibliography, along with his fantasy Civil War series (\\"Sentry Peak,\\" etc.)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful","review":"I bought this book while out of town and didn't have access to the amazon reviews and boy did I pay the price.It seems to be a random collection of poorly described events that don't lead anywhere.I kept hoping the author was using a simplistic style to make a point somewhere but if he did it was too subtle for me.If the book had been written half as well as some of those glowing reviews it just might have been worth reading.As it is ... a complete waste of time. I can't count the number of times I had to put the book down because I was so mad about how awful it was. If I hadn't been on travel with no other options I wouldn't have made it past the 5th chapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Missed opportunity","review":"I picked this up with the hope that, as a three book series, it would have a rich story. After reading it, I saw that the outline of the story was much better than the final product. The premise of the story has great possibilities with a rich world to enhance the characters. The implementation however is dry and forced. The primary characters have been given the wisdom of age and the intelligence of a youthful scholar, yet somehow each has the depth of an old pizza. I was very disappointed, given the possibility that this story had, to the way it was finally developed in this book. After reading you will feel empty of the desire to read the next in series. I am not certain if it was an issue with the editor, because you can see flashes of great writing within this book and wonder what could have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than inspiring Writing","review":"Having picked this up when perusing the Cherryh section for the final book in her Fortress series, I find that I'm less than impressed. The writing is awkward the dialogue is clumsy and while I found some of the characters to be witty they more than disappointed me by the 5th chapter. Roc publishing must have thrown out it's standards for publishing when they decided to publish this series. The cover art is what got me and will probably motivate many fantasy fans to invest the 7.50...however I'm thinking of returning these books for a refund. I suggest Roc fire their current fantasy editors and pay more attention to publishing polished writers. I'll never judge a book by it's cover again."},{"rating":"1","title":"More of a Young adult fantasy novel","review":"The cover art sold me on this book and some of the written reviews were glowing. I was highly disappointed with this story as the writing and plot were adolescent at best.Pro- beautiful art coverCon- plot was very weak, dialogue was very monotone, each character sounded like each other. Descriptions were very brief and the text was choppy. No main character that you really felt for and the time frame was quick and generalized. Solutions were linear, A has a problem, B is the solution, C is the result.Definite pass on this book, especially if you are expecting the descriptive stories of c.s. lewis, robert jordan, george rr martin, steven erikson, raymond feist, r.a. salvatore, Goodkind, robin hobb, sara douglas, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"BRUNO LOOKS AWSOME!!!!!","review":"HE LOOKS VERY LIFE LIKE.

I purchased the book and found it to be incredibly verbose instead. In addition, the information provided is dated. Since Ms. Fedder is no longer at Stanford, the information she gives is no longer accurate. Specifically, she stated that they have a special catagory for those gifted in math (as for those gifted in the arts and sports) and they rely upon the recommendations of the math department to select the most gifted math student. Upon calling Stanford I was informed that that was no longer in effect.She also speaks of her low opinion of early admission/early action programs. However Stanford has had them for several years now.If I, a novice to the world of college admissions, could easily spot two significant errors, how accurate could this book be to a reader seeking information.It is also manages to say in a thousand words what couls have been said in a hundred."},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely ingenius musical ensemble!","review":"This is an album you can actually dance to and not feel foolish.

Either guys are jealous of their girlfriends going and talking to other guys, or girls are jealous about the attention their guys get when they're out, or girls are trying to make their guys jealous so they start getting paid attention to ... the list goes on and on.What makes jealousy so powerful? How can it be such a destructive force in a relationship, when many times it's not even based on any 'real situation'?This book is a HUGE help when looking at jealousy. Whether you tend to be a bit too jealous yourself, or whether you're dealing with a partner who tends to be overjealous of you, the book gives real life examples of situations, and practical advice on how to deal with them.Just about every relationship has run into jealousy problems at one point or another. They CAN be worked through. I highly suggest this book as a great way to help improve your own relationship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not useful to me","review":"This book seemed to be aimed more at other therapists than at average people. The language, though readable, was full of clinical terms that made the content seem less relavent to me. It gave numerous examples of how different people react to different situations, but never really specifies how to solve \\"abnormal jealousy\\". The book's sub-title says \\"Causes, Symptoms, Cures\\", but I found no cures for my situation. There was only stuff on how to deal with normal jealousy that is caused by situations that are likely to arouse that emotion in most people (like one person cheating on another).Yes jealousy is normal, I know that, it's a part of caring for someone. But how do you deal with someone who is very possessive? Who sees intimate relationships with others when there is none? This book doesn't deal with any of that.

It was the BEST but this new stuff is made in China and is garbage. If you are lucky enough to have some of the old containers all you have to do is hold them next to the new ones and you will see the difference. The old ones are clear and the new ones have a blue cast to the glass. For some reason the blue tint in the glass weakens it but somehow makes it cheaper to produce. From what I've read all colored glass is more fragile especially when subjected to heat but I have to tell you, it also chips with just regular use. I've never had any of the old pyrex chip. Also, the lids for the new ones are EXTREMELY stiff and very difficult to get on to the containers. I even had one lid split because it would not stretch. Somehow this new stiffer plastic is cheaper to make just does not make a good product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Upgraded lids","review":"I've used a set like this for almost 2 years and the rubber lid are already very deformed when cooled and sucked in after microwaving continuously.Like these sets anyway.

My only regret was not ordering 2 sets instead of just one.Glass bowls are very sturdy and thick. Lids took some getting used to when it comes to snapping them into place. However, the lids are indeed air tight and much more environmentally friendly than using plastic wrap so it's a trade off I suppose. I got this set on sale for under $20 recently and would buy again without hesitation. I'm sure these will be in my kitchen for years to come as Pyrex products tend to last for years. A wise investment if you cook and have leftovers and don't want to dirty 2 containers between the time you cook and the time you freeze or put in the fridge. 5 stars, perfect product and a real bargain when this set is on sale!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Set","review":"Glass is the best to use in the microwave and these bowls come with tight fitting lids (don't use the lids in the microwave, of course)!

In the product review it mentions the bowls and lids can be reheated, which one would assume means the microwave.Just to be clear, on the inside of the lids it is stamped the lids are for refrigerator, dishwasher and microwave use.

Terrible product."},{"rating":"1","title":"That was short lived","review":"I can't even tell you how the lids fit. I never got that far.

Hopefully the 10 bowls we have will be enough... My wife never seems to think so. Only thing that could make them better is a glass lid (it may exist, I haven't looked) for straight to oven cooking.For those complaining about too hot, I agree, they get hot, but my food is always warmed. With all the \\"you get cancer from microwaving plastic\\" info floating around, I'd rather just deal with a hot pad for my heated bowls.Also, the lids can be difficult to get on the bowl if you don't realize that you need to circle the lid with your finger under the lid, and thumb over it.

They also fit inside each other nicely, at least I think so, despite what some other reviewers think.

Only it's turn based and not done as well. In that way, it's basically a Civilization IV scenario, but not as cool looking as a Civ 4 scenario would be.Anyone who has played Hearts of Iron for 3 seconds will appreciate just how superior it is to anything this game tries to do. Most people complain Paradox games are just too complicated, no, they just like to get things right. It's display by tons of research.For instance, being able to have Rommel as my tank commander for Germany. Researching U-boats. Or triggered events.Not only that, but Storm is just clunky. HoI is done way better, flows naturally, and is completely open ended with so many more deployable units.I just don't understand rating this a 4/5 star game???

I like it because it is small and fits in my handbag just like the camera does, but with a little extra protection against everyday abuse from keys and what-nots in my handbag. Reasonable price for a Nikon-brand camera pouch at less than $8 on Amazon, and would have given it a 5-star if not for the fact that the camera fits so snuggly in the pouch that I have to be very careful when zipping or unzipping for fear of scratching the camera in the pouch."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for Coolpix 2200, 3200, or 4100 unless you're a magician","review":"I didn't listen to the naysayers. After all, why would Nikon state that this case was for ALL of the following cameras (Coolpix 2200, 3200, 4100, 4600, 5600, 7600) if it was not true? Besides, everyone loves to gripe on the internet. In this case, they were right! I own the handy Coolpix 3200 and it is like trying to fit size 12 hips into a pair of size 10 jeans....you can do it but it's a struggle and you are afraid of breaking the zippers! Finally, the newer Coolpix Cameras are SMALLER than the older cameras so they should fit just fine in this NIKON camera case. In conclusion, if you own a 2200,3200, or 4100 - SKIP THIS ONE - Trust Me! Mine is going straight back to eBay. If you own the 4600,5600,or 7600 Coolpix Digital Camera, you will be thrilled with this custom case."},{"rating":"1","title":"Coolpix L1 - No Way ! DO NOT BUY","review":"I received this case as a gift. It is unfortunate, the buyer believed what they read. Truth is, the Coolpix will fit on the 2nd or 3rd try - BARELY. It is too much trouble to deal with if one is out shooting. I would guess the zipper would give out soon enough as one has to force it closed. If you remember one thing, remember this. DO NOT GET THIS CASE FOR THE COOLPIX L1. The case MUST be larger. The ARE other choices out there !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality small bag for Nikon Coolpix L Series cameras","review":"Good quality little camera bag. Anyone complaining it didn't fit their camera obviously didn't read anything on the description. They say it's NOT compatibly with the L100 or L110 series. Don't buy it if you have either camera. I bought the Nikon Coolpix L26 at the same time and when I got it, it slipped right in with no issues. The bag seems very well made and should protect the camera from dust and bumps quite well. Unless you have a ton of memory cards you plan on using with your Coolpix, I would get it. If you've got a handfull, say maybe more than a half dozen cards, I'd look for something a little bigger. Once you get a spare set of batteries in there, you'll be out of room. I haven't tried it out to see how many cards it'll carry, but then again the person I'm giving it to won't have to worry about that. I bought a big card to go with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, Compact, Effective","review":"My recently purchased P1 camera fits comfortably in this case, while still leaving room for a backup memory card AND battery in the front pouch. My favorite part about the case is that I can carry it around and it is hardly noticeable. In the past, I have bought cases that increased the size of the camera to an unmanageable size (and as a result I ended up not using the case at all). This case barely increases the size/weight of the camera you are carrying, and effectively protects the camera at the same time. You really can't beat the price either!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this case if you own a Nikon Coolpix L1","review":"If you have a Nikon Coolpix L1 don't buy this case.

I strongly suspect that they were trying to stuff the camera into that outside pockect. It is the only explanation for their complaints.

Her monthly column in Lucky magazine is something I flip to first, with much anticipation, and she manages to cut through the hoo-ha of beauty marketing with both grace and humor. Equally admirable in my book, she makes trenchant observations about the crossover products -- those products one buys for your children or other members of your family that can be re-used for yourself. In this way, her guidance marries the best of the women's magazine ilk (do it cheaper or more efficiently) with the heady fashion forward tone of Lucky. I love going to Target with her column in hand, and buying 60% of what appears in any given month. And when she does reccomend a pricier item, I have full confidence that it will not disappoint. I think it's entirely possible that she is beauty's fairy godmother for every woman (and baby, teen, and man, to boot)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not great literature but certainly great fun!","review":"How nice to find a beauty editor who's managed to retain her sense of humor. There is a very droll wit at work here, and it's perfect for the subject matter. Godfrey-June is intelligent and speaks in a voice all her own--readers of her Lucky column will recognize it immediately. She really is like no other. The amazing thing is that there really is something for everyone even remotely interested in beauty/fashion in here and, unlike Allure's new \\"Confessions of a Beauty Editor,\\" which takes recycling to a whole new level, this is an original voice with something new and different to say. She never takes herself too seriously, which is part of the charm. It's good, quirky fun. Long may Godfrey-June remain comfortably ensconced \\"above the fray\\" at Lucky--they are \\"lucky\\" to have her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of ho-hummmmm","review":"While there are some amusing bits in this book, I would not give it more than one star. This lady may be a great beauty editor (I am a subscriber to Lucky mag) but she is hardly a stellar author. So much of this rings false...come on, she wears a designer dress revealing her boobs to a FiFi Awards show and \\"forgets\\" she's been nominated and is \\"shocked\\" when she wins and has to accept under the lights? Puh-leeze! A lot of the book is the same kind of self-deprecating (but secret look at me) kind of writing.

I was expecting a snarky book with clever writing and amazing stories about the lengths people would go to for free beauty goodies.I ended up being extremely disappointed.Maybe its the conversion to an ebook that does the damage. There are distracting \\"tip boxes\\" that in a normal book, you would understand their placement, but in an ebook they look like new chapters or the like, and its distracting and disjointing and in the end, utterly useless to have these tip boxes come up. Some of them can take a couple of pages to go away and by that point you've lost the flow (what little flow there is) of the story.I like a good trashy read, but this book just doesn't do it for me.If you're looking for how it should be done, read \\"Bringing Home the Birkin\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Horrible","review":"Jean Godfrey-June may be a good beauty editor, but she can't write a book worth a damn. This book is sooo badly written and filled with useless trivia and inane remarks. I got halfway through this childlishy-written book and had to put it down. From what I did read, I learned nothing new about the beauty industry.

Dreamy female vocals and solid rhythms throughout, its not \\"wanker dub\\" but more song oriented than most recent stuff out there. Internet rumours abound of upcoming white label dub plates and a companion remix/dub CD release, but this record rocks mostly because it etches out totally unique territory for itself in this world of samples and electronic dub music.

The mounting adhesive and bracket work very well, as long as you have a flat surface to put them on. It has a wide range of FM frequency outputs which is great for those of you in the city where there are lots of stations interfering. The only gripe I have is that the FM signal output could be a bit stronger. It seems better in my XM MyFi than in the Nexus. That may be do to my car radio or FCC regulations though.

This book resolves many conflicts other sources seem to have with each other with a full explanation of the issue at hand. This book is truly well-written, following logical transitions from topic to topic, and well-reasoned arguments based on the available evidence. Rich in detail, I would recommend this book to anyone wanting to learn about the truly remarkable transition from a primitive, 4-octave, wooden-framed harpsichord substitute to a refined, 7 and a third octave, iron-framed marvel that exceeds all other instruments in complexity and both dynamic and pitch range."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vital repertoire in fantastic performances","review":"This disc contains music of five African-American composers who prominently figure in the American music scene. The names are perhaps unfamiliar at first, but after listening to this disc I found myself searching for more recordings of their music.None of the pieces, although composed in the 20th century, are harsh sounding. William Brown is a convincing soloist in both his works. However, my favorite piece is the Tania Leon work from which the entire disc takes it title. This is truly virtuosic music that actually has a purpose beyond its own virtuosity, and is quite a thrill to listen to.The performances are excellent.

It does not need to be and rearely is a game that you have to play for hours on end to get real enjoyment out of it. With that knowlege, as a casual gamer, this game stinks. Sorry, but it does. I like puzzle games. Intelligence cube on the psone, tetris, bust a move, and most recently polarium have all been my favorites and extremely addicting gems. PQ is not. It is hard as all get out, and you will get stuck for days on one puzzle. A better thinking puzzle game is smart bomb on the psp. THis is hard but it is hard because you have time limits. It is not hard because it is impossble to figure out like PQ. But if you enjoy spending your years figuring out impossible puzzles, this is for you.

If a book is an entity that has a beginning, middle, and end, then this doesn't qualify as a book, since it doesn't seem to have an ending, but instead just seems to come to a dead halt, I guess the author realizing that he had nothing to say.

It does make froth comparable to the average Starbucks.However, it does not make froth compared to exceptional coffee places. After moving to Seattle, I learned what a really excellent latte actually is. There are just too many variables (temperature, humidity, steam pressure, espresso machine etc.) to make one of these truly exceptional coffee drinks at home.This aerolatte frother is an excellent at-home alternative for daily use or something exciting when entertaining company.

A single charge lasts for many weeks, while making 3-6 lattés daily. The rotational speed is also perfect and does not change that much over time (unlike alkaline batteries). It may be even a little too fast right after the charge, so I have to put a teaspoon into the cup to slow it down a bit (just make sure the spoon does not touch any moving parts). Another suggestion is to use a tall cup with the initial amount of hot milk or cream no higher than 1/4 of the overall height and tilt the cup at about 30 degree angle initially.

I just brew regular coffee and add this to the top with some cinnamon. The only surprise -- which isn't really, when you think about it -- is that the milk remains cold. I was used to a steam frother, which took care of heating the milk at the same time.

You have to heat the milk first in a microwave and the Aerolatte isn't that easy to use & can take off the finish in your coffee cups. The foam isn't great either.

I like the stand that comes with, which makes it less likely that the frother will get damage due to improper storage. The frothed milk is almost as good as the one from let's say Starbucks. The only little minus is that the knob to put the frother on and off is somewhat stiff. Sometimes I need two hands to put it on, so I won't use to much pressure and mayba damage it.

Before you read this you have to read Carnage In New York."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bloodfest tries to pass itself off as a novel.","review":"Carnage in New York was a slightly enjoyable romp that mainly involved a plot with Spider-man attempting to stop a deadly serum that will cause anyone exposed to it to go into a vicious killing frenzy, with said serum winding up in the hands of Carnage. The sequel involves a mysterious foe that could be Norman Osborn, the original Green Goblin, back from the dead(this takes place before that infamous clone saga really brought him back) stealing the serum and breaking Carnage back out of prison. Unfortunately, that's about it. The paper-thin plot is really just an poor excuse to showcase a horrendous amount of violence, bloodshed, and gore, and the unless you're a new-comer to Spider-man(you've only seen the movies, for example) the true identity of the main villain is incredibly obvious. Only masochists and extremely hardcore Spider-man fans should consider buying this tripe, the rest should stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor sequal to Carnage in New York","review":"I did not like this book at all. The apperance of the Green Goblin did little for the story and Carnage pretty much does the same thing he did in the first novel, which is try to kill Spider-Man. Carnage in New York was a much better book then this. Don't bother with Goblin's Revenge."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Dare To Say That I Enjoy This More Than The First Album","review":"The fact that this contains actual songs makes this a more enjoyable listen. I like the first one and there are some great moments on it but there are also some noodling pretentious moments as well. The choice of songs are great(of couse we all probably have one in mind that they SHOULD have done-I'll throw out the theme from Close Encounters for arguments sake). Personal faves are \\"the Omen\\", \\"Charade\\", and \\"The Devil Rides Out\\".4.5 stars cuz 5 star reviews are WAAAAAAAy too common on here!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Only ONE flaw...","review":"As far as I can tell, this incredible album only has one flaw... and it's that the songs are WAY too short. I mean, don't you wish songs like Experiment In Terror, Spider Baby, Henry, Vendetta and Der Golem ran for more than just 2 - 3 minutes? I'd LOVE to hear a 5 minute version of Experiment. What a freakin amazing song that is. And Henry, geez, that's over before I have a chance to fall in love with it. Thankfully, Investigation Of A Citizen Above Suspicion is a towering 4 minutes long. That's a VERY great song.Minor flaw, doesn't even dent the 5-star rating. It's too bad Patton's music isn't appreciated by more people. (and why do stupid boybands get Grammys while amazing stuff like Fantomas doesn't even EXIST AT ALL to those posh morons? I guess I answered my own question)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocrity disguised as experimentalism","review":"Firstly, I am a Patton fan and was eager for this album to come out but I'm a little disappointed. The interpretation of the themes is sub-standard compared to the originals.How many people are actually familiar with the originals? Maybe that's missing the point. But without the reference of the originals this album seems a little pointless.To simply speed things up and play them in a mock death-metal style, as they do on a number of songs, isn't very interesting or innovative or *gasp* avant-garde. It's PARODY and parody seems beneath the talent of this group. Too dangerously close to Weird Al territory for me. Great musicians, great choice of themes, great packaging. Mediocre execution. Bring on Tomahawk and Peeping Tom!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Technically perfect but craven","review":"Well, expletive. I like Mike Patton's work and think he's smart as hell, but when he turns his back on art like this in favor of triviality, I have to recommend avoiding this album. It's a hilarious implementation of these chile-con-queso themes, but the queso overwhelms and the only statement is a self-amused ridicule of life itself. I'd rather this assembly were to tackle an artistic project as Patton's track record is proven in this area, and it doesn't seem likely to me genius would fascinate itself with this technically precise but intellectually trivial endeavor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantomas even amazes the skeptical","review":"While I enjoyed Fantomas' first album, THe Director's Cut is even better. For those of you who found the first too abstract, the director's cut features actual songs. Even my friends who did not like Fantomas agrees that this is a great album. I even heard \\"Twin Peaks: Fire Walk with Me\\" on the radio!, and that's one of my favorite tracks. Patton has taken these classic songs, and put his own spin on them (and you know what that's like) and through his gift, has created yet another masterpiece. (im also a Mr. Bungle and Faith No More fan) You probably already realize the caliber of the musicians in Fantomas, and in the director's cut, they all get to show off. It's Fantomas with a melody. My suggestion: Buy it! Listen to it two or three times, and you will not regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takedown: A great book for young adults","review":"This novel was a great educational tool! My high school special education class and I read this book together. My boys and girls equally liked the book. We would only read one chapter a day and they were truly disappointed when I wouldn't continue to the next chapter the same day. It opened up the door to alot of discussions on disabilities and perceptions. My students felt like the main character of the book knew how they were feeling most of the time. In teaching self advocacy, this novel helped my students reflect on their own disability after seeing how the main character dealt with his disability and how others perceived it. It was easy to read and understand for my students with all different disabilities. I highly recommend this novel to other teachers."},{"rating":"2","title":"soggy tales of the supernatural, Japanese style","review":"I thought 'Dark Water' was the novel from which the recent film was based on. Nope. 'Dark Water' is actually a collection of short stories with one of them, 'Dark Water', being the basis of the film. So at first I was disappointed but upon finishing the book I thought it held up reasonably well. As with most short story collections, there are a few diamonds mixed in with the zirconium. I thought his most creative story was 'Watercolors'. Without giving spoilers, it's about a theater troupe giving an initial performance when a leak from the roof drips on to the stage. From there the author takes the reader in one direction but in the end we realize we were cleverly scammed.Bottom line: paranormal stories which are soaking wet and, generally, comfortably creepy. Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"worst doll ever","review":"This is one of the most beautiful looking barbies we have ever bought. It is also the worst doll to date!The doll NEVER worked from day one. It's tail bent up and it made grinding noises and didn't move or swim - just laid there. All the reviews on this site (which seemed to have disappeared since I notified MGA - the toy maker) were correct - NOT ONE BUYER had a working doll!!! We bought this for my daughter, niece and friend - and NONE of the 3 worked. It's not hard to follow the directions - they are pretty simple - so that is not the problem.Also, the hair falls out and is EVERYWHERE in the bath water (pretty gross), and the bikini top is near impossible to get back on correctly!Overall, the biggest disappointment in a toy so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun toy that my daughter loves","review":"All of the reviews I read about this toy indicated that it would not work properly or would break quickly.

I followed the instructions to the T and it did NOT swim. All it did was make a grinding noise and the tail bent once and got stuck there. I tried to unstick it, but nothing worked.I returned it to the store and bought another one thinking perhaps the one I bought originally was defective. The second doll worked. However, it didn't really swim like it does on the commercial. My daughter was happy though.THEN after only 3 uses the same thing happened with this doll. It made a grinding sound and the tail bent and got stuck there. Again, I tried to \\"fix\\" it but nothing worked. My daughter was very sad.

These \\"people\\" are void of empathy and are the center of their own universe. You are nothing more than supply to them, you are there to serve their egos. If you take Brown's advise here and stop \\"feeding \\" them, they move on to a new victim. They can not love anyone and will not love you. I suppose if this is what you're looking for and you don't mind being an object, not a person, go for it. I just can't imagine why anyone who knows the insidious nature of narcissism, would ever want to teach you how to have a relationship with one.

It was interesting to read all the letters that were written to Sala. It would have been nice if Sala had kept her red journal with her and wrote down what kinds of things were going on in the camps that she worked in, just to give a more insider look at life in the camps; to see her view. The book is excellent and does a good job of describing some of the aspects that occured during that time. When reading the book I was a bit surprised that they were even allowed to send and receive letters while in the camp. I was also surprised by the fact that some pictures were taken while Sala was in the camps and she got to keep them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"It took me a while to get into the way this book was written. Once I got into how the book was layed out I enjoyed it.The book is written by Sala's daughter. Sala gives after decades of not talking about what happend to her a stash of letters. The book has the letters according to time translated with small passages of explanations.Sala was in different concentration camps than the brutal extermination camps. Regardless it didn't make it any easier for her. She was only 16 and went instead of her sister. The camps in which she was in were a little bit more humane. She even once can go home on vacation. Regardless there is very little food and there are selections.

It is full of details and provides an interesting alternate look at the development of the Gettysburg National Military Park and the tourist trade that accompanies it. The only drawback is the ponderous writing style; it can be quite difficult to read sometimes, causing the reader to backtrack in order to decipher without consulting the dictionary regularly.

Its layout is extremely accessible, and although there are some minor omissions in the review text, just use your textbook to supplement. The major flaw with this book, though, is that for its practice free-response question, it does not provide a rubric to score your responses. All it says is how many points the question was worth. If you go to the College Board website, though, you can find past free responses and the accompanying rubric scoring guide to practice with, and your teacher may have some, too.

Some of my impression of this book is probably shaped by speed of the course (quarter system).

Then you start using it and realize that all the stitching holding the straps/handle on come apart and unravel very easily. They need to take another look at finding a better method for attaching the straps to this bag because the current construction method is very bad. I did not have the bag long enough to test the durability of the rest of it, as soon as the straps started coming off I returned it to Amazon. I only had the bag for a total of 4 days. I am still waiting for my money to be refunded but so far Amazon as a whole has been great, unfortunately with this bag you just don't get what you paid for. The reason I gave it 2 stars instead of only 1 is for design, and because I can't say the rest of the bag is faulty since I did not keep it long enough to test that.I hope this helps in the decision making."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where has Brookner been for the last century?","review":"While I have enjoyed many of her books, this was astonishingly poorly written and sappy. She cannot decide which of her unattractive, uninteresting, self-absorbed characters to concentrate on. She is writing about modern people in present-day England, but it may as well be Victorian times; the notion that passionate sex (not true passion) will be punished through the death of the innocent (though obnoxious) spouse of the main character and their unborn child. It all has been done before--long, long before, when it would have fit the age--and much more competently. I will be wary of my next book by Ms. Brookner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic","review":"Great battle sequences backed up by insight into the characters of the people who played key roles.

Thomas dwells on every conceivable character flaw, real and imagined, significant or not, of Halsey. Do we really need to know about his bedroom behavior after the war?Every American owes Halsey their gratitude and respect. In retrospect with the benefit of hindsight, every commander who takes action is imperfect. The fact remains (and is virtually ignored in this pitiful book) that Ozawa's carrier fleet was destroyed, hastening the end of the war."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle Readers Beware!","review":"Not formatted correctly for your kindle.

The US Navy was more powerful and had more and better ships. The Japanese were more cunning and more ruthless. Nevertheless, at this point in the war, the Japanese were grasping at straws and the battle should have been a swift victory for the US.But problems arose when Admiral William Halsey began to seek the glory of battle: communication breakdown and poor decision-making. Thomas is a very talented storyteller in the vein of McCullough and makes what seems like a topic of specialized study an invigorating tale of bravado and bullheadedness."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth a tinker's damn","review":"Boy, did I make a mistake in buying this book!! I should have read the reviews first, but mea culpa. When I received the book I read the dust cover to see Admiral Halsey described as a \\"racist.\\" I knew right then that historical revisionism and modern political correctness could be a problem. And, I was right. This book is nothing more than a very general telling of an important battle with the author's biases run rampant. There are better ways to learn about this battle. I stronly suggest Hornfleisher's \\"Last stand of the tin can sailors.\\" It is rich on narrative history and the facts of the battle. Evan Thomas should be ashamed of this book. But he won't be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting -- and Far Too Kind to the Japanese of That Time","review":"Evan Thomas's exploration of the lives of four noteworthy commanders who found themselves in the Battle of Leyte Gulf is quite interesting, and provides a good foundation for futher (and more detailed) exploration of the battle itself. However, his appraisal of the Japanese of World War II is far, far too kind. Yes, they were a \\"cultured\\" people, with their arts and customs and so forth -- but on another level they were utter savages, which totally compromised their merit as global citizens of that era. In [...], and this nature of arrogance propagated atrocity after atrocity as they attempted to enslave Southeast Asia.Read this book, it is an interesting account -- but do not shed a tear for the conquered Japanese, as their own horrendous acts ultimately caused the civilized world to force their downfall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It is an excellent overview of the events leading up to the Battle of Leyte during WWII. It especially hones in on four key leaders who played important roles during that battle. There are several points which I disagree with including the author's claim that there never has been a sea battle of this scale in the history of the world. I could name several, but I'll leave it at that. Nevertheless, it made for entertaining reading and includes some excellent points about the personalities of the four main figures whom the author wrote about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reality of War","review":"Evan Thomas did a B+ job of giving the reader a sense of what a very small peek at the reality of life on both sides was during the last months of the Japanese Empire. One of the key parts of the story is the mind set of the key players when critical decisions were made. I was a little surprised at how much alcohol and nicotine along with the battle fatigue influenced the key decisions. I think that the effort to see inside the minds of the key players went a bit to far. We have not had a Naval war like this since then."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid, Well Written ...

Sadly, it is little more than a compilation of notes scarcely held together with some biographical threads. It fails to capture the drama of the events, and gives the impression that the author took a trip, read of the events, made some notes, and decided perhaps there was some money to be made by packing it all up in a book. In the latter regard, he seems to have been right, but it is not attributable to either historical or literary quality. Furthermore, the maps are poor, fail to contain many of the details referred to in the text, and are inadequate. There are many other accounts of these events that are more accurate, engaging, and literate.

This serious of tributes to jazz icons is more of what we've come to expect from Mr. Marsalis: Lugubrious idolatry, trumpeted from the peak of Mt. Wynton.As with his mind-numbing dissertations on Ken Burns's jazz documentary, Mr. Marsalis presents two central theses in his poetry that are very damaging to the genre. There are:a) You have to understand it to enjoy it, andb) You have to worship it to talk about it.Apart from offering another volume to the jazz nerd catechism, it's difficult to image how this book will in any way promote the music itself. But then again, as Marsalis notes, \\"Mingus might just talk about your momma, then go 'head and manifest a masterpiece by midnight. By moonlight.

Just one warning to potential readers. This book may well fire you up to try new things. But don't necessarily expect your partner to go along with it. Instead, read it for yourself, and let him or her find the book and read it alone, without knowing or suspecting it was your idea. Many partners are intimidated by the idea of a sex how-to manual.

To get back at her--*why?*--Yana goes after Anthony, who conveniently left all his brain cells at Fillmore with his pot-smoking friends. I say that because he doesn't seem to be thinking very much in this book.Whereas in the other books Anthony and Rae were friends, in this book they hardly talk to one another. Not to mention that just about everything else in this book seems contrived. There's a lot of the plot to kill Rae going on, but really, who cares about that?

I can't really compare this to any other framing nailers since this is my first one, but the nail depth was easy to adjust and being able to adjust the air coming out was a great benefit.

The nailer uses 21 degree plastic collated nails. Although they are not the most popular collated nails around, they are available.So far, the gun has worked perfectly. My favorite feature is the metal connector. Changing the tip takes 10 seconds. Once you have loaded the 1 1/2 metal connector nails, you can quickly and accurately install metal connectors such as joist hangers, post bases, angle brackets, and other similar connectors much faster and easier than with a hammer and nails.My only concern is the height of the gun. Although it is not unusually tall, it does make nailing in confined areas somewhat difficult."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceded My Expectations","review":"I own 7 other nail guns, and the Bostich F21PL was a great addition to my collection. The Gun's light weight made it easy to use over a long day, and because it is easy to control, I was able to get into tight angles. The rubber foot and the rafter hook were greatly appreciated. The fact that it is multi-purpose makes this an extra value that you don't usually find in today's world of corporate greed.John"},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaked out of the box","review":"Sadly this one leaked right out of the box. The handle is an air reservoir and air was leaking out of one of the nuts at the base of the it. I can only give it another star because the of the depth adjustment. It was easy to use, though I don't know what the long term life of it will be. There's basically a row of teeth that lock into place to hold the proper depth setting. I would imagine that after a while those teeth would wear down and it would start jamming up.Also to note, there's a plastic cover on the front of the nailer (not shown in the picture) that covers the exposed spring. It's only fastened on one side of the housing which I could see getting caught on something and being ripped off, but if you're careful it'd be fine.It did seem to have plenty of power, even with a leak.

I built 120 feet of fence, drove 2000 nails, worked great. I am a homeowner, and 2 nailers was not in the cards. If I was a contractor, I would get a framing nailer and a coil nailer, but this nailer at about 200 bucks does 1.5 to 3.5 inch nails. The big downside (and it is a big one) is that I cannot get the 21deg connector nails (1.5 or 2.5 inch) anywhere local. Think ahead and order online. I am also concerned that these nails will not be available long term. They are Bostitch only, and I can currently not find the 2.5\\".

The reason is the scale is extremely hard to use. Most tape measures have scales which indicate feet and inches. This tape measure doesn't measure off feet but actually measures off 16 inch intervals! There is a scale to mark off feet but its labelled but in almost impossibly small to read text. Then if you want to know how many inches it extends beyond that foot mark, you literally have to count the inches past the small text which is hard to read to begin with. Its almost like the makers wanted to make this measure as hard to use as possible. Then they put another useless scale in red which marks of every two inches (at 36 inches this other scale marks of 18). Even if it might be helpful to have a scale which marks off every two inches, its like they think your too stupid to divide by 2. I repeat, do not get this tape measure. I can't believe they can mess up something so simple to make!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap ingredients that actually make your cat gain weight","review":"I fed my cat Iams Weight Control for 3 years before she died of stomach cancer. In that time she only lost weight when the cancer started. Her coat was dull and rough.That experience led me to research feline nutrition both online and by talking to animal nutritionists. If you read the ingredient list in Iams Weight Control, you'll see that most of the first few ingredients are corn and other grains. Cats are carnivores and need a high-protein diet, not a high-carb diet. The extra carbs are stored as fat. If you have an overweight cat, steer clear of Iams and go with a high-protein, low-carb, grain free premium food.My two young cats eat a variety of high quality food. I feed them 3-4 times a day and they are at a perfect weight. Their coats are shiny and soft.

Paranoia of Russian weapons has seemed to be hunting Steven, as BMP is a clear reflection of that. The whole book is quite tilted in all aspects, from beginning to the end, he boasts of Western tank designs at the expense of Russian equipment.

In other worlds, you want to have good illustrations of this vehicle for modeling purposes, then perhaps the books is what you need( even though frontal and rear color-plate drawings are scarce, 9 of 12 drawings are straight side-views ), however, if you want this book for educational purposes, my recommendation would be to look for a less biased source to get a fair evaluation. -david"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rare Read","review":"It is rare in children's literature that readers find male figures that attempt to mentor a boy.After Walt's mother abandons him with his two eccentric uncles, they attempt to raise him and influence him through their outrageous stories.

This game is very special, though I did not not know it at the time. The key to the Tie Fighter experience was in the physics model. If you watch the movies, you are aware that despite the fact that the planes are in outer space, they bank, roll, and yaw as if there was an atmosphere because that is just how we are used to understanding things like dog fights. The way that the fighters behave int this game is just...RIGHT. This makes the game highly playable. Without any real landmarks, no up or down or horizon it is tricky to make a fighter feel fast and they hit a sweet spot with this game. The story is interesting and they even let you joint a secret society when you get to be pretty good. Sadly, my dad's old computer could not handle the sound of the game so despite having played it and beat it maybe a dozen times, I have never heard it.

There are plenty of clips from his films and the interviewees speak with authority (including WC Field's grandson - note the family resemblance, except for the nose, of course).Most importantly it makes you want to dig out the movies and watch them again. Not seen his films? Get the WC Fields comedy collection - it has his two best films \\"It's A Gift\\" and \\"The Bank Dick\\", as well as \\"My Little Chickadee\\" with that other great star Mae West (the only person who got top billing over Fields).

THIS GAME IS NOT A PERSISTENT WORLD MMORPG. I was like many people who had very high hopes for this game. I received a 10-day beta pass with the pre-order. Lets just say that the box for the retail version never got opened. To loosely quote another review...\\"Turbine made a gorgeous game, but forgot to make it fun\\". I will reiterate what other review writers have stressed as well. This game should NOT require a monthly service fee. It is ridiculously lacking in game content. If what you are looking for is a D&D experience with a group of friends online, I highly suggest that you steer clear of this game and its monthly charge. The Neverwinter Nights series may be a better choice for you. If you're looking to pay 15 bucks a months to stare at pretty graphics and be bored out of your skull... Stormreach is your kind of city."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Game","review":"Overall I have a good time with this game. What kills the fun is getting in a group that wants to sprint through the dungeons so you miss all the things that make the quests enjoyable. I've soloed some quests that were a little under me (grouping is required in most), or gone with a small group where we just took our time, and the fun factor increased 10-fold. The dungeons are really well made, great textures and lighting. Also some really nice atmospheric effects.Generally, most people so far are pretty cool. I've yet to encounter the complete tools that seem to ruin other MMO's. Grouping is pretty easy too, all the classes I've played have been as welcome in a group as any other.It's different, that's for sure, and has some issues. But it's not as bad as other reviewers have claimed, just doesn't appeal to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Swing bad Follow Through","review":"This game has hope of being somthing wonderful in the online gamming market.

Maybe somehow you'd accidently hit up on a door, and be brought to a secret dungeon, but you never really knew. The main thought running through your head was that it was just a simple little background, nothing more.Well, is D&D; anything more then a huge background with unusable objects and places?

I had loads of fun and really loved the chat function. By the end of the first week I was bored out of my mind. This is a game for people who love doing the same thing over and over again. After the first week you find yourself looking for parties and doing the same quests. I quit after the first month. If you are thinking about picking up this game, see if you can't get some friends to play also. Having a ready made party will probably help. No solo content was also a reason I left.

There are so few dungeons that the only way to hit the top ranks is to repeat the same ones over and over. Boring as mud. It is possible only as a group and yet there are so few people in any one server that it takes way too long to find a group willing to do the quests you'd like. The beta was quirky, buggy and slow, as expected. But I did not expect the game to be the same way. It is only mildly improved. Even today, major dungeons are closed for bug fixes.

You have to have a group to undertake almost any dungeon.- Level progression is slow and boring.- Small world.- Combat is mostly a click-fest without a lot of thought or strategy.- No regeneration during a dungeon. (I know this is consistent with the D&D; rules, but it kills solo play.)- Rogues do not play well.

This game totally screwed up the rules, throwing in random things like '+5 to all skills' and a Mechanoid race.The requirements for this game imply that it should be graphically very advanced. Guess again, its kinda far behind the current crop of games.Overall this title could have had *HUGE* potential, but it really failed.

Then, one day, Wrigleys decides to throw integrity out the window! The only recipe they have yet to ruin is the Peppermint Altoids, but everyone knows the original flavors were so much better! We don't care that they are white! I, for one, do not choose my mints by their color, and since these mainly cater to adults, why not put back the good ingredients, so these don't fade into the woodwork with the rest of the artificial imposters! Then, those of us who care what we put into our bodies, can raise our children and grandchildren on them, and the tradition will live on! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"YOU HAVE RUINED THE SPEARMINT","review":"The traditional spearmint Altoids were excellent. The \\"new\\" flavor does not use oil of spearmint, having substituted artificial flavors instead. Bring back the oil of spearmint! Otherwise I will not be buying your mints again.

They don't have that great of a taste and they aren't strong at all until you bite into them, and then the mint flavor quickly disappears and doesn't leave your mouth minty in the least bit.

Not their fault that flavor has been changed. I assume it was a marketing decision -- not enough volume to continue the formula. But what they decided to use instead is just a weird version of Wintergreen. Not quite as bad (i.e. Pepto-Bismol), but nothing like the addictive Spearmint it replaced. I could chew the old flavor like chewing jelly beans. Now, it's just a strong breath mint like the other Altoids.

So disappointed that this new Spearmint Altoids is nowhere near Altoids Ginger or Cinnamon flavors. You pop it into your mouth, expecting either the distinctive spice of spearmint or the full-on blast of a regular mint, and on both counts it falls short. It neither belongs to the \\"Curiously Strong\\" or the \\"naturally-flavored\\" categories; it falls somewhere in the middle of the pack.

How bad could they be, I thought? Especially when the other Altoids flavors are 1st rate. The answer to \\"How bad could they be?\\" is \\"VERY!\\" I'm not exactly sure what flavor these are. I know it says spearmint on the tin, but they taste more like winter-pepper-spear-cina-mysterymint. I wish I had tasted the original Altoids Spearmints before they were tinkered with. Obviously it was a financial decision on the part of the company to mess with the formula: fake flavoring is always cheaper than the real thing.

I noticed the label said NEW GREAT TASTE.....Well, I won't exactly say YUCK, but these no longer taste like Spearmint at all.

My dad never wrote about his combat days, but I'm certainly glad that Melvin McGuire did.The book is an honest, and very personal account of one man's war. It is well-written, and really gives the reader a feel for what combat flying in the B-17 must have been like - at least as much as it will ever be possible to do through words.

But, as was stated in other reviews, unless you have a real interest in wildfire fighting from a \\"line boss\\" point of view, this effort is less about Peshtigo and firefighting than it is about Mr. Leschak's personal spiritual journey and his finding personal fulfillment leading a fire crew. He is quite unapologetic about his disavowal of all things religious, having become quite immersed in his own revelation as it relates to the natural world.What he does share about Peshtigo is enlightening and very absorbing. It is not as wanting as some might think, and the author ties in his own personal spiritual turmoil with the Catholic priest's encounter with the fury of nature (or is it an act of judgment?). Unfortunately, what one does read about the Peshtigo fire is about what you'd expect in a magazine story; just enough to whet your appetite for more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was VERY disappointed with this book because it was recommended as a good account of the Peshtigo fire; yet, what the author actually had to say about this event could have fit into less than one chapter. I could not, however, justify giving it only one star as what he did say about the fire was interesting. This book would probably be read with great interest by those excited by helicopters and/or fighting wildfires as these are the real focuses of this book. Time after time, when I expected the author to really get into the Peshtigo fire, I was dismayed once again to find he once again goes into a long litany about himself which seems to be his true obsession. I got very tired of his self-praise and importance, his use of \\"big words\\" - as though to impress when plain language would have suited better, his over-emphasis on descriptive phrasing, and incomplete sentences! If you want to read about the Peshtigo fire, don't bother with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless Skinsations","review":"I have tried this product on two occasions.

It is an excuse to explore the tales of violence, sex, and perversion that have led criminals to the chopping block, so to speak. The illustration in uncolored pen and ink is mediocre. Not sure what the deal is with these strange period dramas set in the Edo period, like Hanzo the Razor, too. I'm always a sucker for sword and sandal epics, East or West, but skimmed this one just to see what the series is like. Not that enjoyable and don't care about the characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"What could be more boring than a fishing show?","review":"Sure, it was supposed to be a spoof on a fishing show.

It mocks itself as much as it does the form. It is aimless and yet knows full well what it is doing. It is brilliant in that it never really tries to be.

Six episodes may not seem like much, but really it's just enough, and at any rate, the price is certainly right."},{"rating":"2","title":"Now THIS is entertainment","review":"When I watched this DVD I found it neither to be a Fishing show or even a \\"mock-u-mentory\\" of a fishing show. \\"Fishing with John\\" actually defies specific classification. For me this was simply John Lurie trying to bond with other, and better known, celebraties. What was fascinating was the hybrid between scripted and unscripted material. My favorite scene was the ice fishing with Willem Defoe (mostly scripted) but hilarious. Original, silly, simple and brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"John Lurie at his best","review":"From the improvised scenes to the incredible shots of foreign lands, this is the most entertaining DVD I have watched in a long time. John Lurie teams up with such strange bedfellows as Dennis Hopper to catch the \\"elusive giant squid\\" in Thailand and Willem Defoe in Maine with whom he went ice fishing. John is able to coax the most sincere moods from his guests while forcing them to act out his often child-like adventures.The DVD includes the commentary with John Lurie which fills out the experience with the tales of how he came up with such interesting shots, the locals that helped (and sometimes didn't) and most of all the not-so-behind the scenes look at what his guests are really like. It was also surprising to see how well John is at editing the film to make a specific impression of time or mood.Everyone should watch!

This isn't what you what. This is pure comic genius, yes, and very oddball, yes, but it's not Harold Ensley. John Lurie is an inspired nutcase, taking the likes of Tom Waits and the late Dennis Hopper fishing in strange locales. Waits gets angry at one point.

What little character development Mr. White did resulted in little more than a whiny bitch.Also, the high-tech stuff left me thinking that perhaps he is thinking about writing in the Sci-Fi genre.

Wow, each book by this author is better than the last. I found this one to be the most suspenseful by far. The short time period of the novel makes its pace urgent and its plot tight. It even made me fond of Lauren Crowder, who I found to be a largely unsympathetic character previously. The subject matter was fairly original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I have read all of Stephen White's books. This was the only one that I really didn't like and struggled to get through. Lauren was just too pathetic, the plot twists were absurd and even Alan (my favorite character) was a bit hard to take.

If you're not a White fan, don't bother with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of White's Books to date","review":"I have read all of Stephen White's books, and this is the best one yet. I could hardly believe it when I reached the end. I began reading the book and then \\"boom\\" it was over and I don't think I had taken a breath during the whole thing. The main characters were all familiar from his previous books, but this time they were like old friends and not just names on a page. The plot of the book, which involves high tech use of computer and the abuse heaped by the press on celebrities, is timely and intriguingly combined. Hats off to White and I hope that he hurries his next Allen Gregory book along."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lauren's Arrested!","review":"This is the fifth installment of the Alan Gregory series. As usual with a series, reading them in order helps to understand and follow the recurring characters, inside jokes, etc. In this one, Lauren is arrested when she fires her gun and gives it to a police officer after a man is shot. We get a police procedural in arrest and see it from the prisoner's (Lauren's) point of view, limited as it is. Her MS is exacurbating and she has very limited vision. Without reading the previous books, I think one would be lacking in being able to understand Lauren's choices in this book and the way she reacts to different things that happen.I've started reading this series from the beginning and to me they just get better and better. I don't understand the limited reading audience that Stephen White seems to have, or at least that is represented in the Amazon book reviews. This series give us mystery, suspense, psychological profiles, legal aspects and police procedurals."},{"rating":"1","title":"LET'S HOPE HE'S GOTTEN IT OUT OF HIS SYSTEM","review":"I suppose every author writes a clinker now and then. After reading and loving the previous four books, I was stunned at the outright dullness of this \\"effort.\\" I never felt any real suspense, nor did I find myself wanting to find out who the \\"bad guy\\" was. I didn't even care when his identity was revealed. At no time did I feel that Lauren was in any real trouble or that Emma might actually come to harm. I am confident that this book was a glitch, and that future White volumes will return to his normal high standards. I bought this one, after having checked out his previous four. A waste of money, to say the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"so so","review":"I won't go into detail because others have, but although this book was well-researched and had many plot twists and turns, it was still incredibly boring. It was my first Stephen White book and I am not sure if I will read more.My other issue was with Emma Spire - her character was not developed enough. It was not clear why the media would be so obsessed with her other than the murder of her father."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak story, weak characters, weak book","review":"This was my first SW book and probably my last. The plot was interesting for about 30 pages and then simply stopped being interesting. Unbelievable characters - I hate it when the protagonists in a series have earth shattering, life threatening experiences in every book - and the McGuffin held my interest for about 0 seconds. Too much put into too many pages. Additionally, what drove me crazy were all these similar sounding names of the main characters (Casy - Cozy, Sam - Scott). And there were too many characters, 2 policemen, 2 lawyers, very confusing. The only reason I gave it 2 stars is the fact that I read it completely and didn't throw it out after 50 pages as I usually do with duds."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Genuine Flop!","review":"The author himself must have been on \\"remote control.\\" The book was simply dull and boring from start to finish.

All his books are clotted with these inappropriate flights of fancy-ness (he's the Liberace of murder mysteries), but this one is icky clear through. His characters are real-ish, if tiresomely self absorbed and never quite likeable (his own alter-ego, the doctor, is tediously PC and selfconscious), the plot potentially intriguing enough, when he gets to it, even the dialogue works much of the time, but, as usual, the endless detail of whether you turn right or left to get to his favorite hangouts, the florid descriptions of place and vista which never really come off, those go on for pages and chapters and make you forget whether you ever cared who done it and how come.

I hooked up a pair of Monitor Audio speakers and a set of cables to the back, through the wall - it has connections for everything including PC, DVI, Composite Video, S Video, and 2 Component Video Inputs. I have 2 Tivo's hooked up to it as well. It's just an awesome piece of gear that transforms the room and makes viewing like having your own movie screen - very, very cool. The price has come down quite a bit while I was trying to make up my mind. It's a real nice deal. Get them to deliver it inside your front door (not the kerb) - it weighs nearly 200 lbs.

Their clear explanations of figuring if an outsourcing makes any sense (MIS people are dense at financial concepts, I know I am), but their simple charts and NPV explanations helped me through the tough parts.

This book is full of religious hatred, and disinformation. This author does not even attempt to see the other side of this argument. All they seem to do is point fingers, and slander our friends, kids, uncles, aunts, grandchildren, brothers, sisters, and other loved ones who are gay, lesbian, bisexual, or transgendered.

While attempting to impose their own religious and value system on the nation as a whole, the authors continue to press their beliefs and values on everyone else. It is sad that they would deny civil (not religious, civil) rights to any group because they do not fit their viewpoint.At this time, if the religious right wishes to call homosexuality a choice (which it is not), and deny civil rights protections for that \\"choice\\", ethically they must also work vigorously to remove civil rights protections based upon marital status--also a \\"choice\\"!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very sad that anyone would believe such paranoid tripe...","review":"Move along, thinking folks, nothing to see here.More deluded paranoia and preaching to the misguided choir, strictly for the sort of people so gullible and brainwashed as to be able to believe the childishly absurd claims made herein.The audience for this alleged \\"book\\" consists of those with severely limited thought processes, and those who enjoy a laugh.It's bad enough that there are persons so fundamentally corrupt and deceitful as to argue that >> not being allowed to violate the rights of other citizens by cramming absurd superstitious beliefs down those others' throats << is a violation of THEIR rights - that's sad, indeed.

Like many people, I am continually affronted by those leading an openly gay lifestyle, and I feel this to be an infringement of my rights. I feel marginalised, like my own rights are in competition with other groups around me. Gay homosexuals have dominated the discourse for far too long, and it's good to see their previously unassailable position of power and social acceptance finally challenged, even if it is challenged from such an underfunded, underdog position as \\"Christianity\\". My right to be morose and melancholy has been openly mocked for too long by the unrelenting merriment around me. It's good to see someone fighting back.

When I first received this Beanie at a young age, I was thrilled. After all, what little girl doesn't love something as cute and colorful as this pudgy worm? This is one that I'm positive will never end up in a garage sale. Though he probably isn't as nice and neat as he was when he was first purchased, that's what comes with years of play.

The book is great but this is a hell of a ghost story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still scarey after all these years.","review":"Made before the current incredible age of special effects by computer, nonetheless this still is a scary flick for watching late at night with the lights out and the wind blowing. Not one of my top ten flicks of all time, but very entertaining and quick shots of the ghost at the proper murderous moments are a shocker, amidst quaint performances by several long-time theater/movie professionals. My teenage son, raised on special effects, found this spine-tingling and tense and we both enjoyed the way this keeps you waiting for the next strike of the ghost. Solid stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"There was nothing scary about this film.

Krige is excellant I must admit as the ghost. The story line is very good and the book must have been very good but the way the script was put together for the movie was awful. The movie never really scares you except for the scene at the end when Krige (The Ghost) goes down in the shivery water trapped in a car. An average horror movie at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ghost Story","review":"This is an excellent horror. I've been looking for it for years. More of a good old fashioned horror.

It's terrifying, too, as good ghost stories should be. Hence, I had high expectations of this film. The fact is the film is dreadful! It's almost nothing like the novel, and the only reason I give it two stars is due to some atmosphere. The cinematography looks good. That's about it. Spend your money, sure, but spend it on the novel and you'll spend many dark evenings in your reading chamber casting furtive glances at those darkened corners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Learn To Read","review":"Please don't buy the movie, buy the book. The movie is less than a foot note of the book. When I saw the movie had it not been for the fact that they mentioned Peter Straub's name, I would not have know it was based on his masterpiece. The book is THE ULTIMATE GHOST STORY whereas the best part about the movie is the all star cast.Unfortunately I have nothing good to say about this production."},{"rating":"1","title":"I couldn't get into it","review":"I rarely don't finish a movie just because I keep hopes up that it may improve somewhat. I was very intrigued with this one as I was searching for a good ghost story that didn't overuse computer generated special effects and was just plain creepy. I was even more interested with the star-studded cast. The acting was great as I expected, but I just couldn't get into the storyline enough to finish it. I got through about 20 min. of it and all resemblance to a ghostly story was completely lost. It hit me much more as an older suspense/thriller movie. It also wasn't very well put together. Dream sequences, flashbacks, etc. made it difficult to follow. I was really disappointed with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS MOVIE JUST WANTS TO SIMPLY SCARE YOU!","review":"THE BOOK WAS BETTER THAN THE MOVIE, OF COURSE, BECAUSE YOU CAN'T FIT ALL THAT DETAIL INTO A MOVIE WITHOUT MAKING IT EXCRUCIATINGLY LENGTHY.

IT UTILIZES VITUALLY NO GORE TO GET ITS POINT ACROSS. ITS RIGHT UP THERE WITH \\"THE CHANGELING\\". THE BOOK WAS CREEPY AND LEFT ALOT TO THE IMAGINATION. THE MOVIE TRIES TO DO THE SAME.

If you haven't already read it, buy a copy (available from Amazon). The movie adaptation wasn't great, but if you know the real story from the novel, it will creep you out. My disappointment was in the DVD quality which was advertised as \\"widescreen edition\\". It wasn't true widescreen, but \\"VHS widescreen\\" where it's in the standard television aspect format and black out the top and bottom to make it fit. This DVD is still worth owning at the price that's comprable to the VHS version, but I hope they remaster it in a true DVD widescreen version in the future. I'd be willing to pay the going price for a DVD-quality version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dave Mccoy knows nothing","review":"I am not sure what film he was watching, but i was lucky enough to see it in the theater when it came out and many times on tape after.

A description like that sounds weak, but would have been better than this waste of time.

He explores what it's really like to grow up in a small logging town with a large imagination. Everyone views of his family as \\"perfect\\", but Chris takes you behind the scenes of his life and shows you what \\"perfect\\"really is.I learned a lot of valuable advice in this book and had a ton of laughs. I highly recommend this book to teenagers because they can really relate, from growing up or being grown up and looking back. This book captures the funny side of life and the no worry attitude of a teenager, and also manages to capture the serious, complicated side of life that everyone has to deal with somehow."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Fails To Make You Laugh","review":"King of the Mild Frontier is hilarious. Chris Crutcher takes the reader back to Cascade, Idaho in his childhood, filled with humorous mishaps, tears, confusion and mischief.

I like cookies.Whether or not you've read any of his other books (if you have, this will give interesting perspective on his characters and the man behind them), you'll enjoy this. I guarantee it.I'm giving it to my Mom and Dad to read next, it's not just for young adults."},{"rating":"2","title":"King of the \\"WILD\\" Frontier","review":"Chris Crutcher's King of the Mild Frontier is an autoiobiography that is fresh and funny, but also teaches his readers about life experiences and teaches people to make the right decisions. Crutcher's humorous story about his life brings you through his memories and gets you to see what it is like to be in his shoes.It starts as funny, through the middle it gets hilarious, and goes down a slope from humor to astonishing heart pounding memories. From his strange family to his wakcy image, to his wannabe sports dreams, Crutcher brings you through a story of his life, that is heart filled and makes readers turn page after page. Pages of happiness, laughter, and drama that will inspire you to read more of Chris Crutcher's stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"A quote from a Kirkus STARRED review.","review":"\\"...a deeply moral and philosophical work with important messages about life, death, relativity, heroism, and why bad things sometimes happen to good people.

Hoping to relive some of the joy through this DVD.This video is just a notch above bootleg and I mean a notch. At least they held the camera steady. The visuals are horrible. Grainy, extremely blurry and just a horrendous to watch. The audio will make you cringe. The balance is non existent. Some instruments you can't even hear, others are too prominent. All this just ruins the experience of trying to enjoy the concert. I regret reading and trusting the 'good' reviews of this DVD.

I am proficient at each of the rolling methods described in the book and half the time I still couldn't make sense of what the author was trying to explain. I found myself having to pause and really think about things before the passage I was reading would click. I could only follow because I have the background knowledge to know what he is trying to get at. I can't imagine being a beginner and trying to teach myself how to roll based on this book.Note that most of the 5 star reviews from this book are several years old.

It is a fictional account of the relationship between The Duchess of Alba, and the court painter Francisco Goya. The time is near the end of the inquisition, when Spanish power was starting its decline, and Napoleon was on the border preparing to add Spain to his empire.The story starts with a woman being paraded through the streets on her way to being burned at the stake. With the country in the hands of the inquisition, people needed to tread lightly. Even if you were cleared of charges, and managed to escape torture, your name and business would be ruined by the taint of being accused.The story is best known for the painting, The Naked Maja, which got Goya in trouble for painting a nude portrait. The Duchess did die, but Goya survived and lived until 1828 when he died at the age of 82 - long enough to see the Spanish empire crumbling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oxymoron","review":"This book is not a typical ABC book.

I opened up the printer to find that toner had POURED out all over the inside of the printer, the table, the floor, the sheaf of expensive paper inside. It'll cost hours that I don't have to clean it all out, if if even can be cleaned completely. The paper is ruined regardless.

I don't know what kind of printing these other reviewers are doing to only get 2,000 or 2,500 pages out of a toner cartridge.

It left me wondering what happened after the story ended. The characters are flawed yet likable; very real. I think it would make a great movie (set in the 90s).

Now there is value in such tales, to recruit young cops maybe. But i wanted to read about tactics, training, how to learn to use a pistol. What i got was a lot about his bullets, his gunsmithing, his shooting. But nothing i could use. He is certainly an interesting guy, but i wouldnt want to take a concealed weapon class from him based on this book. I'd rather learn how to shoot like him, then to hear about how he shot some really bad guys.Get Suarez's Tactical Pistol set instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of $$$!!!","review":"Don't bother.

This book is poorly written. He repeats himself -- I swear you get the account of his first shootout no less than three times. His arrogance is overwhelming, even on the off chance it may be deserved. There is some useful information in this book about the physiology of bullet damage and the importance of drilling for those involved in high-stress shootouts.

His boring and repetitive accounts of his actions on the NYPD hit squad called the stakeout squad are doubtlessly embellished to sate his inflated ego. This makes for a difficult read. Then after attempting to impress the reader with the size of his you-know-whats, he tells us the we, the simple citizens of the USA do not deserve to be able to defend ourselves with firearms from the thugs out there. Frankly, I'm glad he's retired, because bloodthirsty cops like him made it difficult for the rest of us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ludicrous...!!!!!","review":"Only in America. The notion that some people find this kind of stuff interesting says a lot about them. That it found a publisher speaks volumes about a culture that encourages everyday citizens to pack heat...and \\"protect\\" themselves. In trying to make his vile case, Crillo indadvertently shows why we have more to fear from the pinhead next store with his or her shiny new Smith & Wesson than we do from all the so-called street scum. I support gun rights but let's be clear: this kind of nonsense will do more to sink the second amendment than any form of controls.

Rather than spend an entire book on \\"war stories\\", he rather takes the lessons learned during his many years as an NYPD professional and applies them to valuable advice for both the law enforcement practitioner and the civilian CCW licensee. Often put in extremely risky situations by virtue of his assignment to an armed robbery \\"stake out squad\\", Cirillo eschewed reloads for a second or third gun, and definitely makes the case for wheel guns as viable defensive arms.

I have purchased a few other Tango albums, yet, nothing was as close to amazing as this album is. This is the quintessential Tango album. Piazzolla is a genius!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impress","review":"I made a mistake of buying this CD without listening to it first.It has also five music in a CD.I Love to listen to Tango Especially La Cumparsita , La Paloma, A Media Luz,and love to dance Tango...Very Sorry that \\"Tango: Zero Hour\\" is not my type of music and did'nt impress me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Again and again and again.","review":"Without question, one of the finest recordings of music I will ever hear. If you don't get it, I don't get you."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing: recommended to all jazz fans","review":"I'm new to Piazolla - this is only my 2nd CD. The first wasPiazzolla: Five Tango Sensationsand though it is very good if you're only getting one I'd recommend starting with this one. Of the two, Piazolla's originality is more in evidence on this one. (Also, if you already have the Kronos, you might tryTango Sensations: Alban Berg Quartet, which I've seen in the store but haven't heard yet.)In musical sensibility, Piazolla's tango has a lot in common with jazz and classical music. His music is about innovation, the unexpected; the more you listen to it the more surprises and nuances it reveals.My third Piazolla disk will be Yo-Yo Ma'sSoul of the Tango: The Music of Astor Piazzolla. If you're richer than I am you might get all of these at once; if you're as poor as I then start with Tango: Zero Hour."},{"rating":"1","title":"No documentation just innuendo!","review":"This was a very entertaining book, but without documentation or footnotes it was hard to tell if it was fact or fiction. Assumptions were made by the authors many times, but there was no way to tell if it was accurate as there was no proof of any kind whatsoever just lots of innuendo . Where is the proof?? And I don't like the use of quotes as if they were right there taking down dialogue word for word when you know that they weren't. It was a really annoying read. Now, I did enjoy seeing all the new Houdini photographs, but then again they were printed on the same cheap pulp paper as the rest of the book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining, though unconvincing in the end","review":"Interesting and informative. Could have been more linear, since it covered so much territory. It jumped around a bit in time, which could make it hard to follow. I had to go back and reread several sections to get the timeline right.. Also, the authors chose to put their cites on their website instead of the back of the book. This made it difficult for me to cross-check their claims. End result: they didn't convince me that Houdini was a spy, nor that he was murdered by rampaging psychics. I might have been more easily convinced if their cites (which the authors say are fully supported) had been more easily accessible.Still, it was an entertaining and worthwhile read and one I would certainly recommend to anyone interested in the life of Houdini."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSOLUTLY THE BEST BOOK I HAVE READ THIS YEAR","review":"This book is amazing, it is written so well and organized in such a cohesive and logical format that in a matter of hours you feel like you have an intimate understanding not only of the central character (Houdini) but also the character and nature of the world at that time.I can tell you that anyone who reads this book will clearly have to reassess what they thought they new about Houdini's life, as the research presented here seems more like a treaties on the subject even though it reads as easy as any other entertaining novel.If the true test of a good book is how it changes you, then read this book, I assure you that from the time you open the front cover to the time you turn the last page your perspective on the life and times of Houdini will be challenged and changed"},{"rating":"2","title":"Learn from the master (magician and marketer!)","review":"I was a childhood magician, so Houdini has long been one of my heroes -- a source of fascination and inspiration. Dan Kennedy recommended reading this book to study Houdini's life for marketing purposes, so I was excited to combine one of my greatest childhood passions with my one of my greatest current passions. This book doesn't disappoint. Not only do you get to learn about one of the greatest marketers of all time, the \\"secret life\\" angle of the book sheds new light on a larger-than-life figure. Read this book!Grael Norton, Senior Faculty, AuthorsAcademy.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"Secret Life of Houdini","review":"This book was purchased as a Birthday gift. I was pleased with the presentation of the book itself. It had heft and new information on Houdini. Pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Houdini bio!","review":"Being a Harry and Bess Houdini fan, I have several books about them and so was interested in this latest one. I was not disappointed. It is a very good book, and rather enlightening, one that I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Houdini in the context of the times","review":"This book shows many sides of Houdini: showman, public servant, dedicated son, passionate (if sometimes biased) student and researcher. The authors don't shy away from Houdini's flaws. They tell his story through vivid descriptions of his performances, conversations, and audience responses, capturing energy that keeps this biography moving. Very well-researched, the authors show Houdini in the context of his time: they convey the excitement of aviation's birth, the tensions of the first World War, the controversy of the Spiritualist movement.Excerpts from letters, articles and diary entries give the reader a sense of Houdini's voice. Photos and reprints of show posters and advertisements sometimes work well to help tell the story; other photos get limited descriptions, leaving the reader wondering what he or she missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Detailed, Rich Account of Houdini's Life - Great for Newcomers","review":"I can say without reservation this text is an extremely informative and wonderfully enjoyable read about Houdini as a man, a magician, and a driven social and political participant. I would highly recommend the book to anyone just plainly interested in Houdini, as well as anyone new to magic performance history studies. I've read the other reviews and I appreciate the specifics and concerns that come from readers who have studied Houdini for a long while. Their comments remind us that all biographies have particularities we should be aware of.But I believe this is a perfect book to inform all levels of readers interested Houdini. It explores in a very lively and thorough way some of his intensely personal risks that could not be clearly calculated and controlled. I always suggest it to my friends when they ask me \\"What's a good book about Houdini?\\" It's just a terrific place to begin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Life made Less than Interesting","review":"There is no doubt that the man formally known as Harry Houdini led an interesting life. Sprinkled throughout this book are reminders of such. And yet, the authors' compilation of all this facts contributes to this book's lack in interest. Events and stories are not told chronologically, which wouldn't normally be a problem if there were some sort of other ordering system in place. Instead, things appear to be thrown in haphazardly, making it hard to keep track of the many characters in Houdini's life. Relevance to time and situation are lost with this mish-mash of information. Also, while the authors' attempt to humanize a biography is nice, their interposed dialogue proves distracting and a bit unbelievable. I would rather they had stuck to the facts, and presented them in some sort of order.The book is enjoyable only insomuch as Houdini's life was fascinating. Too bad the complete effects of this interesting life are lost within the puzzle of pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Serious and complete","review":"This is a very serious and complete biography. I bought this expecting something more for the masses, lots of rumor and sensationalism. In fact, it's a very thoughtful book, with lots of detail and very little speculation, presenting many of the lesser known aspects of Houdini's life, including his campaign against spiritualism and fraudulent mediums, and his extraordinary physical prowess. Not everything was a trick. Many things he accomplished by sheer force of will. Houdini was clearly much more multidimensional than portrayed in movies and popular references. The book also includes many details on the culture and other celebrities of the time; the extensive information on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle was especially interesting. I give it 4 stars only for the fact that there are no footnotes or references. I understand that the authors chose to put those on their Web site, but they're much less useful separated from the book they document."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Sweet.","review":"This book is pretty sweet. It reveals alot of Houdini's life, as well as some of his magic tricks. I'm not sure why the description of the book talks about him being a spy, that part of the book plays a very minor part."},{"rating":"2","title":"Utterly compelling, amazing book","review":"I usually read fiction but when I picked up this book (mainly because I'm interested in the cultural history of America at this time) I couldn't put it down. This book reads like a novel and its authors have gotten under the skin of one of America's great icons and present him, warts and all, in a tremendously human way. I was never aware of Houdini's charitable work and his great public service by going after unscrupulous fake mediums who were bilking vulnerable people out of their money. I only wish that some of today's self-indulgent celebrities would follow Houdini's lead and give back to the people who made them successful and wealthy. There's too much in this book to list here - suffice to say that this is one book that will stay with you for years to come.

No problem, right....WRONG. We have been trying to download the movies so that we can play them on our PC but have no idea where they were supposedly downloaded too. This site is horrible and leads me to ask the question, why is Amazon trying to compete with iTunes? They obviously have morons designing their site and this service!!!!It now shows that we have downloaded 1 of 2 copies, but we haven't downloaded anything. At this point I'm scared to select anything because it will tell me I've downloaded 2 of 2 and I will have spent nearly $40 on something that I will never see.AMAZON, get out of the business of downloading movies, music or anything else...you have been totally outclassed by the REAL PROFESSIONALS at APPLE!!!!!

Her Nebraska charm and poignant facial expressions along with her comedic demeanor make this show. I love the theme of this show because it's about being entertaining without having to make a political statement or worry about being politically correct. It's just funny. It is the Andy Griffith's show of the new millennium. The casting director was almost perfect, the only sore spot is Leonard (Johnny Galecki) because he is irritating to watch. He kisses like a 4 year old, for being a supposed doctor in physics his idocy is ever apparant. No one could have that much education yet be that stupid. His acting is forced and lacking in believability.

To be honest I wasn't expecting much out of the program when it first aired; but my son who is a Physics major wanted to watch it. He enjoys the nerdiness of the show; I on the other hand I am at times intrigued with the flip flopping and social dynamics between the nerds and the supposed \\"socially normal\\" characters. In the first seasons they focused more on introducing physics theories in a back door way to the general public. For me the earlier episodes were the best ones, but as with any series, there has to be evolution, both good and bad or the series goes stale and shrivels up. If you have never seen this program, watch it a few times in order to get to know the characters and their dynamics, before passing judgement on the show itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great show if the writers would stop inserting vulgar words and crude scenes.","review":"When the show lets the innocence of the guys stay that way, it is a sweet and wonderful show - but then some of the writers will take off on a track for sleeze and uncomfortable weird stuff.

After reading it through once, I couldn't believe such a book was still in circulation.

It also offers surprisingly simple solutions to problems are only complicated by a corrupt political system."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sirota is wrong","review":"Sirota sees government as a god that is meant to solve any problems in society and thinks that the solution to government mismanagement is different government action. He advocates, labor unions, tariffs, minimum wages and socialized everything yet never considers that government action might cause more problems than they solve. I don't understand how someone could NOT see that governments create FAR more issues than they solve and government officials tend to use their power to enrich themselves and the people around them instead of the people they claim to be interested in helping. Sirota is in general a backward thinking person that simply doesn't believe in freedom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneducated populist author","review":"Sirota is a populist who operates under the assumption that if we could just have the RIGHT TYPE of government, a big government would serve us well.Sirota is extremely ignorant of the fundamental concepts of economics.I recommend John Stossel's book instead as it takes a similiar broad view of the condition of our country. However, Stossel is more educated and informed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sirota Wastes Paper","review":"Author David Sirota grew up in a wealthy Montgomery Country suburb of Pennsylvania and went to Northwestern University's elite Journalism School, although he is not listed among the alumni so he probably did not finish his degree. Same problem with the book: the half-baked premise that we let corporate America hijack government is a silly watste of paper. This is because there is absolutely nothing we can do about government, corporate America, or that wealthy guy in the nice house down the street who refuses to mow his lawn. Power is absolute, and empowerment is an illusion. Smart lesders like Sirota's hero President Obama work hard to create the illusion that NASCAR Dad has some say. But the reality is that the social planners, who are embedded (and in bed with) powerful elite who run business, and they are untouchable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great seller!","review":"The book was in excellent condition as promised, it was well packed and delivery was prompt.

How can the he possibly characterize this organization as \\"nonpartisan?\\"Also, the author makes no mention of 9/11, the \\"war on terror,\\" the missing \\"weapons of mass destruction,\\" the attack on our civil liberites, election fraud, and the incredible veil of secrecy that keeps truth from the average citizen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great enrichment tool","review":"This book has everything you need except the folders to hold the sheets.

After reading the original Homeworld guide, one would expect better for a game much tougher than the original. The guide contains many exeprts straight from the game manual. The game guide does not give specific directions for the single player campaign (the main reason one buys a game guide), only broad strategies that any decent gamer could have come up with on their own. Some major game events listed in the guide do not even happen in the game! I am not sure if that is due to bugs or misleading writing but is obvious that the writers played very little (if any) of the game themselves and only wrote what they were told to by the project management. To be blunt, the guide is impersonal and flat out inacurate in its strategies for Homeworld 2. Very dissapointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"So Cute...","review":"I'm an owl collector, and I had to have Hoot. He's so cute!

You only found it on the copyright page and on the endpaper at the back. This is a typically self-effacing move by a writer who is far more interested in telling stories than promoting himself. King takes us further into the zones of the dispossessed than Berger has gone before, even in his stunning trilogy Into Their Labours. A bunch of people live on a patch of urban wasteland; the narrator, King, is a dog who talks, or possibly a man who behaves like (maybe even appears as, maybe even is) a dog. They scrounge what little money and comfort they can get, always keeping an eye out for the authorities. Berger has never ceased to write about the people most writers neither know nor care about; his voice (or rather voices), his authority and his compassion are unique. And it's maybe the best book ever written with a dog as narrator, too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compared all this one is the Best!","review":"This plasma is awesome!

Outside of the last tier of legs, they're pretty strong. The handle houses a table-top tripod that comes in handy all the time, as well. The included bag has a small pouch on the front that fits my GoPro and Panasonic digital camera perfectly. Extremely happy with the product, purchase, and service. Recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally Terrible","review":"I understand that this is a VERY cheap tripod, but it is in no way even decent. It is built out of cheap plastic which makes it very light, and easy to break. Pieces start snapping off from the second you take it out of the box. It cannot turn smoothly and makes a creaking noise when it is moved. I know that I did not get a lemon because I have read the other reviews.You may think that this would be good because it is a \\"cheap and light tripod\\" but it is NOT worth the investment, even getting a 50 dollar tripod (yes it is expensive) would be more inteligent. None of the cool features like the multi-angle viewing works. Unless you have an EXTREMELY light camera, this will either collapse under the weight, or not stay steady!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"You Get What You Pay For...","review":"I knew a shouldn't expect much out of a $15 tripod, but this was awful.

I will say one thing is that it is small light and portable. It is great for small cameras that are very light a super easy to put in an overnight bag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good design; flawed in construction","review":"Pity, isn't it? I ordered this tripod with a Lumix LX5 Camera, hoping to get a; as it says, nice lightweight travel tripod. It worked as that and I ignored the harsh smell of cheap lubricants and plastic from the tripod. That is, until it began to fall apart. Within a few hours, the plastic bolts had cracked, and the shaft fell. Upon inspection, I noticed it was because the bolts had stripped the lining of their sockets, and so it would be impossible to fix the shaft. In other words, I lost about 6-10 inches of height. Other parts cracked too, thankfully not crippling more the tripod. However, I do have to praise the portability of the tripod, even though it sacrifices sturdiness as well as...build quality. The entire set folds up into a small case, and the case can fold up into a smaller case just for your camera. To sum it up, the tripod has some excellent features and design, but poor construction and sturdiness make it NOT worth your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Until Used...","review":"This product looked great, was very compact with a miniture tripod built in. Very portable, great carrying case. Where did it go wrong you ask? We used it. I gave it to my wife as a gift, see if she would actually use a tripod as so has began advancing her skills in amateur photography. My wife used the tripod twice. Once to set it up after unwraping, the other was when she set it up to take a family protrait at Christmas. Upon taking the camera off, the top plastic cracked rendering the tripod unuseable. I suggest looking elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Davis & Sanford's Excellent 7-in-1 Tripod Kit","review":"Davis & Sanford Switchkit 7-in-1 Tripod Accessory KitI absolutely love this kit!

Everything one needs is included and fits nicely in this compact arrangement. The on-board level has always been correct and was an unexpected add-on. I carry this kit with me with briefcase and other bags, all in one trip.

However, I just didn't find this book to be practical in the least. Every room was so over the top, you wonder how anyone could accomplish anything in these apartments. I understand the idea of a haven, but i kept thinking about all of the dust that could get stuck in all of the billows of fabric and trinkets that were were literally wall-to-wall in every room. And where to sit? Where do you eat? There was NO \\"virgin\\" space that could be considered useful.I consider myself to have a pretty open mind, but nothing in this book was worth keeping. I returned it the day I recieved it. I agree that any of Rachel Ashwell's books would be a better buy than this. Her books are great for inspiring your home, but also inspire party ideas and treasure hunts."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth it","review":"I bought this book and now I am returning it. I think it has some good general ideas - e.g. how to paint your apartment, how to select things at a flea market, etc. But the pictures of actual results are uninspiring. This may simply be a difference in taste, but I think the author, whose book aims at relatively young people, decorated apartments very much in granny style. If you see the pictures, you'll know what I mean. The bottom line: the general idea is great, but the implementation is uninspiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful find!","review":"The Paris Apartment is a beautiful book to give as a gift or keep as your own treasure!

Very pleased to find this on amazon.com as not easily sourced in UK. Has an all time favourite of mine, Don Pullen's My Brothers, featuring some deft and grooving hammond. May not suit everyone's taste being somewhat raw in the production but to me this is a plus as you get to hear what is being played. Also may seem a bit wierd and self indulgent for those looking for elevator jazz, but to me it is a window on a time and viewpoint that although alien to my home culture (very English bloke in quiet domestic environment) is really enlightening and is another sort of home, having been brought up on US music of this rare kind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Live In Bonn","review":"This album has an excellent rendition of some classic Barlcay James Harvest tracks and new songs from the Les Holroyd album Revolution Days. There are some great moments from the new musicians in the band including some stunning guitar work from Mike Byron-Hehir who, along with Ian Wilson on rhythm guitar and backing vocals were part of the legendary band, Sad Cafe.

I had looked everywhere for a ring to replace it and was unable to find one. So I was thrilled to find this ring on Amazon.Com. The size was perfect and the ring is slender enough to be comfortable on my finger, yet the word stands out very clearly. I've seen some rings with Jesus' name on that are so thin that the name was just about unreadable. It also doesn't seem to tarnish the way my other ring did. I've seldom had to polish it. I'm very pleased with this ring and am going to order one for a friend's birthday as soon as I find out her ring size. She has mentioned how much she likes my ring. This ring is very nice and the price is reasonable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dark Horse?

Then, I found the book so bad, so ridiculous I had to keep going to make sure it would be on my list of real stinkers. It is. Just because you write for films, doesn't make you an author. The writing was not bad, but I would suggest Mr. Richardson pay someone to give him a decent plot. Additionally, the stereotype description of Texas and its citizens is quite insulting - very Hollywood. So it's been sold and will be made into yet another bad movie. It is really a shame and I did not find it \\"fun\\" or \\"enjoyable\\" because it was not good satire, it was just plain awful.You can be sure if this guy keeps writing (I see it did write another which sounds even worse), I won't be reading and anyone who has good taste should avoid his books as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book insults the intelligence of the reader","review":"The plot is ridiculous and insulting of even an adolescent reader. The antagonist is Shakespeare McCann who seems to be all knowing and posses super-human foresight in reading individuals. Aside from being super lucky in getting away with awful deeds, the first deed of which would get you arrested by the CIA, this character seems to be always one-two-three steps ahead of the protagonist, Mitch. The plot is unrealistic in that it would never happen like this in real life even if a plan was carried out to perfection. The plot depends on the antagonist being all knowing, and mistake free. In real life people make mistakes, too bad Shakespeare McCann didn't or else the story might end on page 4. I purchased this book for a penny, and there's a reason its worth only that. Save yourself the time. It's not a good political thriller in the least. If this was a bad movie it be a straight to DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to read yet a rather uncomfortable presentation","review":"The antics of \\"Dark Horse\\" candidate ShakespeareMcCann and the drug and alcohol addiction of Mitch Dutton own wife, turn what appears to be a sure bet into a cliff hanger in this Texas election for the a seat in the House of Representatives.The unbelievable situations which continually disrupt the campaign strategies of Dutton and continually narrow the gap between the two candidates, are presented in such a manner as to create an aura of fear and concern for the reader!I look forward to more from Doug Richardson."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aeone just keeps getting better!","review":"I accidentally discovered Aeone on MP3.comback in 1999. Ever since then, her music has haunted me, spoken to me, reached into me and brought out the Celtic heritage I never knew I had. Her music is powerful, sensitive, stirring... her music is truly a work of art. I'm ecstatic that Umbra Nihili is finally on a CD... that song sends a shiver down my spine every time i hear it... for any artist to be able to harness that kind of power in a song is a miracle just waiting to be heard. The rest of the album follows suit, bringing forth an almost supernatural presence withits beauty.

The rest are states of being- such as hot, cold, thirsty, hungry, sleepy and silly. Plus, the verb sentir is not really used in Spanish to express all those. For example to say \\"I feel hungry\\" would be better said \\"Tengo hambre\\" rather than \\"Me siento con hambre\\", same with \\"tengo frío\\", \\"tengo calor\\" and \\"tengo sueño\\". Silly is a toss up, not quite an emotion, more of an adjective to qualify someone's personality. oh, well... The translation is literal, and that does not work the majority of the time.The book is also very small, with 8 words in it you are paying 50 cents per word, and the illustrations are not very exciting either.

Honestly, I was just curious as to what in the world would make someone pay $95 for a pair of underwear. Apparently, it is the Versace name because I can't see any difference between this underwear and the brands I can find at the mall for less than $20. Of course, I ultimately paid less than $8, so I guess they would be fine at that price. The other problem is that I ordered size extra large, since that's what the sizing chart specified for a size 14. Well, I couldn't even pull them all the way up! I ended up giving them to my daughter who is a size 4/6 and they fit her perfectly. All that being said, my daughter does love the underwear. I guess if you're a size 4 and only paying $7.44, they would get 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good buy","review":"These are worth buying. They run about 1/2 to 1 full size small, so order up one size. They don't seem to be luxury panties, except that the waistband reads Versace. They are good cotton panties, though not as comfortable as others (Ex. Victoria's Secret sig. panties). The only detail I would add is that the seat only provides moderate coverage, so they do ride up from time to time when wearing. That is why I gave them 4 stars instead of 5.

The orchestrations of the songs fit quite well with the story, which is set in the early 1900s, creating a feel of going back in time. It invokes a sense of nostalgia for a more idealistic time period and the performers convey this quite wonderfully.

However, I did get into somewhat ok mystery and I do have to say that the best part of the book is when the mystery was solved and who the person was behind it. Now that was totally unexecpted.It's an ok book but not as good as some of the author's previous books."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was definitely NOT my cup of tea.","review":"I disliked both the hero and heroine. They were two-dimensional, stiff-as-boards people.Brand should have taken care of David Kerr - not Ash. I think if I were Marion, I would have fallen in love with Ash instead. Ash did more for her than Brand. As soon as Brand heard that David and Marion were alone together, he should have immediately run to her aid. Instead, he sends Ash. What was more important...his politics or his woman? Very disappointing for a hero.The heroine is dull. And the dialogue borders on cheesy - \\"Love me, Brand, love me.\\" Just didn't float my boat.The love scenes are as boring as the characters. This book is much more mystery and far less romance. The whole mystery is absurd and not worthy of all the build up.I cannot recommend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good mystery, mediocre romance","review":"What I learned from this book is that Elizabeth Thornton is a talented mystery writer, but I wasn't feeling it with regard to the romantic connection between Brand and Marion. Yes, they were well fleshed out but Marion was waaaay too judgemental and often annoying for me to buy into a man like Brand falling for her. I suppose the saying \\"you can't choose with whom you fall in love\\" can be used as an excuse here. What I found much more riveting was Andrew and Emily's relationship. I looked for a followup book devoted to their story and found none, disappointing really. Thusly, what saved this book from being DOA for me was the mystery and E & A's relationship."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best effort...","review":"This is by far, the worst book Elizabeth Thornton has ever written. It felt like entire chapters of the storyline and character development were missing. I didn't care about either of the main characters and only finished reading the book because I thought it had to get better at some point. I love Elizabeth Thornton's other books - but I was happy when this one was done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mystery Romance Novel","review":"The Bachelor Trap by Elizabeth Thornton is more of historical murder mystery with splash of romance.

The puppet enhances the story but is also fun to play with alone (or with the \\"daddy\\" puppet). It's opening is just the right size for little hands. If you have a little one who is crazy about puppets and/or penguins, this is a great little guy to own. Plus, he's very soft and cuddly!!--A good companion for the book Cuddly Duddly or Tacky the Penguin, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Puppet","review":"I have always loved the Folkmanis puppets and this one is no exception. It is amazingly durable and has stood up to being dropped in puddles, chewed on, and slept with.

It always makes her laugh and we have used it many times to get decent pictures when she is in a rough mood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chew on This, A Review","review":"When summer comes I like to pluck a few books off my shelf and read them. One of them with a review. Some parts have been excluded for some other reasons:My choice; Chew on This, the Eric Schlosser book that talks about fast food. Reading it made me thank my mother (as preposterous as it seems) for never taking me to one of those places. The facts made my stomach forget it was hungry and my gag reflex to kick in. Horrific statements such as what makes the drinks pink (did I mention I hate bugs?) and the ingredients in the milk shakes that I could barely comprehend, much less pronounce. The author's purpose, I think was to educate people about fast food. I did like the part when he talked about a school in California that cooked their own food from vegetables in their garden. I found the people fighting against fast food industries commendable for their work and I liked to hear their stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"YES","review":"All this time I've been trying to convey the concepts presented in Fast Food Nation to my child.

My daughter was totally psyched about this book. So much so that she wanted me to read it when she was done. Until...she got to the part that said the only fictional character better known than Ronald McDonald is Santa Claus. She has decided that instead of being titled, \\"Chew On This: Everything You Don't Want to Know About Fast Food\\" that this book should be called, \\"Chew On This: Everything You Don't Want to Know About EVERYTHING.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of hyperbole","review":"I found the claims in \\"Chew on This\\" to be rather exaggerated (as were those in \\"Fast Food Nation\\"). The food available at a McDonald's or Burger King, or any other chain restaurant is healthful, and it is not uniquely prone to making people fat--unless they overindulge. Further, I wonder where the hamburger and steak and chicken we buy in the grocery store comes from? This book makes it seem as though only such restaurants get their beef from feedlot-fattened cattle, or their chicken from birds kept in cages, which I really doubt. The book is well written, and certainly will appeal to young readers' imaginations, but I think the views of the food industry are certainly skewed and inaccurate. I prefer positive nutrition messages--e.g., how to fit the foods one loves into a balanced and healthy diet."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"I had read a review of this book and thought it would be a good buy. Wrong. Printed on cheap pulp paper and poorly written with almost no content. Catchy title is only a way to separate you from your money and seems to be that was what what was intended by the publisher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not nearly as good as Fast Food Nation","review":"This book misses the charm and humour that made Fast Food Nation such an interesting read. This book is just a droning anti-corporate rant that takes itself far to seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"know what crap you're putting in your body","review":"This book is excellent at detailing how the fast food companies target people, especially children, through marketing and other avenues, at the expense of people's health.It also explores the treatment and experiences of workers employed by this industry (which reminded me a lot of the book 'Nickel and Dimed').Reading about what goes into the food and how the products are processed, has seriously grossed me out from eating any more fast food. If you're trying to break the habit of eating too much fast food or drinking too much soda, definitely read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chew On This (Reveiw) 0_o","review":"In Chew On This, Eric Schlosser amazingly illustrates our world today. He talks about many main horrors in fast food, and other big companies such as Coca-Cola. The author tells you about many amazing facts, from the riots against Pepsi in Alaska to the bugs in your food!This book has really taught me a lot of things, and I hardly ever eat at fast food restaurants anymore, and this book will definitly teach you many things too. Though it is horribly realistic, it really makes a good read and is interesting. Mostly, it teaches you many things and will probably help you make smart decisions later in your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great YA adaptation of \\"Fast Food Nation\\"","review":"This book is great for tween readers looking for good non-fiction. Schlosser's message comes through a little more heavily/obviously here than in \\"Fast Food Nation,\\" but it's a good adaptation nonetheless. It has lots of pictures and explains its content in a more age-appropriate way without dumbing it down. A great buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item misleading","review":"The book title showed words in english and spanish, leading us to believe it was written in both languages.

This is a great album, perhaps my favorite \\"intelligent\\" chillout collection. The tracks are sexy and sultry, without a hint of cheese. Ambient without lulling one to sleep. Deep with only the slightest hint of a throb.To my ear, this album builds on Digweed's original \\"Bedrock\\" double disc, but loses the cocaine-overdose frenetics -- it feels more solid while remaining deeply mysterious. Many tracks have vocals, but they're not dominant house vocals so much as lyrical accompaniments to the grooves.I strongly recommend this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome sound for all you Pokinacha Punx","review":"I am one of those Pokinacha Punx that love MxPx no metter what.

Almost every one of the songs sounds better live, hence making a lot of the previous albums obsolete. \\"Chick Magnet\\" and \\"I'm OK, you're OK\\" sound so good I don't listen to the regular versions anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's up with the Live cd?","review":"MxPx is a great punk band. Catchy, yet powerful enough to draw in all kinds of punk rock fans. However, I was still upset to see them waste an album by putting out a live cd. Unless you have something radically different to do, like playing with the San Francisco Orchestra (Metallica's \\"S & M\\") or you don't own any of the previous MxPx albums, I don't really see a reason to pick up this album. MxPx is a great live band, they put on a tremendous show, but it's nothing that can be portrayed very well to CD. The only reason to purchase \\"At the Show\\" would be to hear the Ramones' cover song \\"KKK Took My Baby Away\\" otherwise the songs have not changed at all (although they do have some neat segues). I'll be excited to purchase their upcoming live video but for now, if you own any of the previous MxPx albums, this album is nothing new besides the two sentece talks between songs and crowd yells."},{"rating":"2","title":"At The Show (really!)","review":"In my opinion, this cd is one of MXPX's best.. If you have ever seen them at a show, you know how incredible they are, and this cd captures that energy. You can hear the band and crowd interacting and the cheering and screaming, but it does not take away from the music, and the music is wonderful. It allows the listener to hear the band raw, without the use of studio equipment and shows what talented musicians they are. The mix of songs is great, old and new, covers and their own writings. So i recommend that if you like mxpx, or even punk music in general, buy this, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Written with bigotry and fanaticism","review":"The book is full of radical ideas and tries to brainwash with its single perspective.

He deals with all of the problems facing the country in terms of race, both then(1970s) and now. Perhaps the most unsettling part of the book is Newton's arrogance in explaining the Black Panther Party's faultering in the early 70s. He attributes this to his and Bobby Seale's incarceration, along with the defection of Eldridge Cleaver. But shouldn't such a widespread party, founded on largely socialist beliefs have been able to hold together as a result of the party members' passion for their cause?

I was also impressed by his skill at characterisation - Vic and his family are very well-drawn, and Robyn is marvellous...

Nice work, David."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lodge Does it again","review":"NICE WORK is a fine piece of literature, using different techniques (eg. the battle of the sexes, the battle of the corporate vs the educated, the battle of two eogs), and turns them into a wonderfully woven piece where heartaches and breakups are simply side stories to the main clash between Vic and Robyn. A part of the lodge trilogy in that it has characters thrown in from CHANGING PLACES and SMALL WORLD (Phillip Swallow and Morris Zapp show up), and the connections are very evident.

To add to the predictability, Lodge blatantly tells the reader what is going to happen, which makes the next chapter or so pointless.

I would still recommend this to anyone!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ALL QUATTRO's are better!","review":"pick whatever shade/design you like, you are getting an excellent product! i have to admit that as a mom on a budget i was uneasy about spending so much on a stroller, but i was so glad i did. The Quattro's are so easy to put up and fold down (you can do it with one hand)! Attaching the car seat into the stroller for my younger child was so simple! Very easy to manuver and you feel secure knowing that your child is secure in a well made stroller."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great travel system!","review":"This travel system has been so great four our new little one! It took some time to get the angle right on the car seat so that his head did not flop forward too much, but now that we've got that right, it's great! the newborn carseat is nice and secure, and it's really easy to snap the seat in and out of the car. the stroller is lighweight and steers really easily, and again it is really easy to snap the newborn seat in and out of it. It also has a good sized compartment on the bottom that I put my diaper bag in, and I love the cup holders and the way it folds up so eaasily! The folded up stroller does take up most of my car trunk, which worries me for when we take a long trip, but I don't see that they could have made it fold any smaller. The whole thing is of a really nice quality; I think we'll be using this system for a while!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the System, Hate the Patterns Available!","review":"After reading many, many reviews my husband and I purchased the Quattro travel system for our second child. We had an Evenflo for our first and hated the stroller, plus the car seat did not fare well in the Arizona heat. While I love the safety and function of the Quattro, I cannot for the life of me figure out why Graco offers such unattractive patterns for it. We are having a baby boy and several of the patters you would think would be more masculine looking were very girly in person- namely the Mocha and the Castleton. The red and brown plaid one was just plain ugly!We settle for the Mocha figuring it was the lesser of two evils (the Castleton has purple all over it). It's an attractive enough system, I just wish they didn't overthink the patterns and they'd give up the plaid!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Possibly the worst textbook ever","review":"This is the most dense, hard-to-read, and impenetrable book I have ever read. I do not consider myself a math dunce; in fact, I am a math tutor and have taken courses as high as Calculus. However, the formulas and presentation of same in this book is nothing but laughable. Thankfully, our professor will not be testing us on any calculations. This book is way too detailed for its own good. The counselors and therapists studying this will not be helped in any way by the overwhelming minutia on how each assessment is formulated. That's what Statistics class is for."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was in HORRIBLE condition... I was in the 7th level of highlighter hell","review":"I have honestly never had a bad experience buying a used textbook from Amazon before, but I guess there's a first time for everything. This book must have been bought and sold by at least 5 or 6 different students before I happened to be unfortunate enough to end up with it. It was filled with writing in the margins--nothing helpful either (i.e., jibberish, chickenscratch, etc.). Not to mention, the aforementioned 6 owners each highlighted just about 95% of the entire book each in a different color. Since that exhausted every possible color available, I was forced to put brackets around important info and/or underline crap with a pencil. And whoever managed to basically rip the book in half and \\"cleverly\\" put it back together with what must have been an entire roll of scotch tape--good job.

Not recommended. 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I read this book because two reviewers I like gave it 5 stars. But for me it was way to mushy and had a story plot that could have been done in 10 pages or less. I finished the book hoping that may be, at some point, something exciting would happen, but when you are three-fourths the way through the book and there are still only two characters and they are still in the same place they were about 4 pages into the novel, it gets to be a bit tiresome. It really could have been good if they would have encountered some turbulence or something to add excitement. Sorry,but it barely got 1 star in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ben 10 Alien Laboratory","review":"My son (6 yrs old) really was excited to get the lab for Christmas. Not the best toy.

My boys have not had much time to play with this toy yet, but there are all already plastic pieces broken off of the vehicle just from moving it around under the tree.2. There are a number of pieces included with this toy, and the vehicle itself is too small to store the accessories.It seems to be poorly built and poorly designed.The only reason I gave it two stars was for the alien forms that can be made in the beaker.This toy won't last long at our house before it sees the recycle bin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great in theory...","review":"This was THE item my eight year old wanted for Christmas. We searched high and low finally paying too much for the product. While it looks cool, the RV doesn't hold together very well. The balls that dissolve and turn into aliens are a one-time deal and most of the rest of the set hasn't been played with since Christmas.The action figures get more play than the RV and everything connected with. My advice is to save the money and pick up a couple of the action figures because your kids will get far more fun and use out those than this set.It really was cool in theory but rarely gets played with."},{"rating":"2","title":"My kid and I had a load of fun with this...","review":"My 5 year old son and I have a great time with this toy. First off...he loves the dissolving alien rocks. I suggest you buy extra though. The mold and clay were fun to make. The only thing that isn't good is the veiw finder. It's not that it's blurry, it's too small...they need to make the opening bigger and the slide art bigger too. The best part though is the disolving rocks. My kid had fun using the beaker,filling it slowly with water. I suggest, don't tell your kid which creature is coming out so he'll be surprised. I'd say this is a toy for a big Ben 10 fan. I love playing with it with my son.Note some folk have said it's not durable...it's very durable...nothing has broken when we play with it and also that it doesn't fit all the pieces. It was not meant to hold everything. It's an action playset to use with other figures too."},{"rating":"2","title":"18\\" x 24\\" Winsor & Newton Stretched Canvas 6 Pack","review":"I buy this product for my sisiter, she likes to paint and she say it is good for the job she is doing, she realy liked :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"All as advertised","review":"The order was received in a timely fashion, packaged well, and contents were all good.I will order again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading advertising","review":"Item description is entitled ' 18x24 stretched canvas 6 pack.\\" I felt misled by the product description.

I dont understand why no one likes it, no wait, I do, they don't know what good music is, they want fast paced high energy punk. Face to Face goes deep on this album and connects on some emotions with beautiful music and even better lyrics. I always ask Trevor after their shows why they never play anything off this album live and he says that no one likes it. C'mon people, are you really a true Face to Face fan?

Face to Face was once a great band (Don't Turn Away was by far the greatest), but as a long time punk fan, Face to Face was never really very hard core. Very energetic, but not hard at all. I think I was just about as disppointed when Big Choice came out. They never should have left Fat.So this change doesn't really surprise me. Most of my friends stopped listening to F2F after Don't Turn Away. I guess I stop after the self titled (which blows Big Choice out of the water)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most enjoyable F2F Cd there is!","review":"I have been a huge face to face fan for 10 years now.

I have been extremely dissapointed with the reviews of this album by other fans. This is by far my favorite one to date toping Don't Turn Away, Big Choice and to their final work How to Ruin Everything.

I was all excited, as usual, when I saw that face to face had another one coming out. Naturally I was expecting more of the sound that I love. But unfortunately, you wont find it here. I understand that musicians want to grow, want to do something different once in a while, but sometimes it just doesn't work. This is one of those times.I have to admit that I really didn't give it much of a chance. Maybe it is better than I think after all. But the only way that is possible, I think, is if you listen to it and try to forget that it is face to face you are listening to.Otherwise, if you are looking for anything like, say, \\"Nothing\\", hearing this one makes you think you will never hear anything like it again from this band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everyone....the Face to Face has gone bad.","review":"I guess this is what age does to good punk bands.

Here's my advice to Face to Face fans: It's different than the other stuff. That's okay, though, because if this band released three more albums full of stuff exactly the same as the other CDs, I wouldn't buy them. Let's face it, Face To Face has had a tendency in the past to write the same song over and over again, and record it under a different name. They at least have the balls to write stuff with more meaning than anything anybody else is doing. One review said \\"stick with Green Day,\\" but does that have any balls behind it? No way! Everybody badmouths this CD, but it has more meaning behind it than a lot of the so-called \\"punk\\" I've heard lately. Hear it, and hear No Use For A Name's, \\"More Betterness,\\" they're both proof that punk has evolved. Trust me, I've been there since the Ramones."},{"rating":"2","title":"not the best, but not bad","review":"Ok not the best I'll give you that but come on people, when a band plays the same style each album IT GETS OLD. Look what happened to NOFX and countless other \\"punk\\" bands. You reach a climax, and then there's only so much more you can do with your music. Face to face has done this, and gone on to new stuff.If you can respect change and innovation, then give it a try. If you wanna hear don't turn away and big choice; then fine listen to those over and over again. Or open your mind to something new."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Change?","review":"Well...after waiting, and waiting and then waiting some more for this cd to come out...it finally did. I must say that the change was definitely not a plus in my book. The live album was SO good. My favorite live album by far. Now I'm afraid to go to a live show. I don't want to fall asleep. I don't hate this cd...I do like about half the songs, but it just isn't Face to Face. I certainly hope your musical tastes change once again, back to where they were."},{"rating":"1","title":"To Each his own","review":"Well, it's funny how they went from a fast Cali-punk to a more emotional filled rock. It is not something I pictured Trevor Keith to ever do. Now, change is good because it shows the band has balls and the courage to do it. However, I think Face to Face went a little extreme on this album. Its not as fast, has a lot of different instruments tracks then before and shows a lot more to the band than the 3 chord songs on their previous albums. Basically the music is cool, but sometimes Trevor Keith's voice clashes with the music, making it sometimes annoying to hear. Id say buy it if you ve always been a big fan because it's good to see bands evolve over time. However, if you just picked up on them, I'd say keep away from this and stick to Green Day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Writing, Not Face To Face......","review":"As usual, the songwriting by Trevor Keith is excellent. But, there is only one problem: This isn't the same Face To Face that recorded Don't Turn Away, Big Choice, Over It, Face To Face, and Face To Face Live, almost literally! Two of the three original Face To Face members are gone (Rob Kurth-Drums, and Matt Riddle-Bass). I expected more high energy, punk rock from Ignorance Is Bliss. I think that it's really terrible what this album did to the band. It's way to much of a change all at once. i really enjoyed the album, but I'd rather hear this music from the Foo Fighters on Third Eye Blind, not Face To Face. I was very upset and disappointed with this album. I hope that if Face To Face releases another album, it's more like Don't Turn Away, and not this %$#&! Reccomended songs: Overcome, Burden, Heart of Hearts, and I Know What You Are. If you are a first-time Face To Face buyer, buy Don't Turn Away (and read my review on it) Review By: Joseph Palazzo"},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a joke?","review":"I waited so long for some new face to face. I picked up the CD right when it came out but when I put it in my stereo the strangest thing happened. There was NO Face to Face!!! All I heard was some Collective Soul and some Oasis. I guess replacing Rob Kurth as their drummer was the last straw. Their unique fast-powerful-melodic style was obviously the product of ex-band members Matt Riddle and Rob Kurth. I did give \\"Ignorance is Blss\\" one star however because Trevor now has a beautiful quiver in his voice at the end of each line- just like N'Sync (how nice). This album is not horrible but it is NOT Face to Face. It is really slow and really weak. Profound lyrics can not save it. If you like old Face to Face style punk- PLEASE TRUST ME- You will NOT like this CD. I have been a huge fan for years and still am a huge fan, of the real Face to Face."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hope it was an itch they scratched","review":"Well, I must say that this album does have a couple of good songs on it. I personally liked \\"Overcome\\" and \\"Burden.\\" But all the rest of the songs are some sappy, overdone things that you'll probably skip over after the first 30 seconds.The syphonic sound with strings layered over the wimpy guitars are way out of character. I felt like Yanni and Kenny G hijacked this project.I was just beginning to believe that intergrity existed in the music industry, and they go and sell out. Oh well. I hope it was just an itch that they scratched, and they'll get back to making F2F music. If you want a good Face To Face album, get their self-titled CD. That one's got drive and energy on every song. It's 100 times better than Ignorance is Bliss."},{"rating":"2","title":"A change of pace, but still good music.","review":"The songs are slower and more emo-ish but it is a refreshing change!

With Face to Face, it was so sudden, like hitting a brick wall. Don't get me wrong, I love emo, but this was awful. I'd like to suggest any Sunny Day Real Estate or Get Up Kids album instead of this. Words cannot express the horror that I felt when I listened to this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Different is NOT better","review":"I anticipated the release of the new face to face studio album for 2 years. When I first put the disc into my cd player, my heart sunk. I had feelings of dread in the back of my mind ever since I read Trevers post on the web site about a \\"different\\" type of CD. I couldn't believe this was happening. I never heard of a band changing their sound, in their prime. I guess you could say the move took courage, but it wasn't a good idea. Although I have to admit there are several songs on the CD which are quite good, they're not interesting. The bottom line is that the reason face to face was so great is that they had their own niche in the world of music. They were the only band that could write such great melodies with such amazing punk energy. This is why they were one of my favorite bands. Now they're just another rock band.

I give them credit for that. :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't buy this album if it were in the 99 cents bin","review":"Do not buy this album. I know what you're thinking, how could it be bad, it's Face to Face? Well, it's awful. If you are a Face to Face fan and haven't heard this album, DON'T LISTEN TO IT!

Once they see that if they slowed it down a little they can reach out to more of a wider group of listeners. I love face to face. WHen i saw this in the store i about wet my pants.

I bought this cd with such high hopes, thinking that Ignorance is Bliss would be an incredible album, but, I was wrong. It reminds me of soft sounding Pearl Jam songs. The song writing isn't even that strong. I can't think of anything decent to say about this. I'm sure a couple people who are die hard Face to Face fans will read this and think to themselves that I'm just pissed off because its not fast, but thats not the case at all.

Why, oh, why did they have to sell out? Now there are some people who claim that this new sound is good, and that is exactly what they were working for. To get people who know nothing about good music to buy their album. These people are called \\"the general public\\", and this was their target audience. If you want to listen to good Emo, buy Diary.

DON'T TURN AWAY, to this day is still one of my favorite albums ever made. This is not the same style of music at all. The fast, melodic style of 90's west coast skater-hardcore is gone. This is a \\"grown up\\" album full of slower, moody rock which is a major departure from their earlier material. To me, it was a major disappointment. Some of the songs are still good, but this band should have a different name, it's not FACE TO FACE after this record."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Overview of Mongol Invasion","review":"Kalka River 1223: Genghiz Khan's Mongols Invade Russia is an excellent overview of the first Mongol invasion of medieval Russia. It is quite different from most other Osprey books, since the majority is dedicated to the describing the armies and their weaponary. As a result the book gives one a more indepth look at aspects other than the battle. While the 40 pages or so dedicated to the armies does not do either justice, it is a very good beginning.Where the book falls off is in the description of the battle. One would surmise that the lack of a full description is caused by the lack of information. However, this is a minor matter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous bed for our dog","review":"Excellent bed for our Frenchie. He loves snuggling in between the bumper and the cushion.

This is especially great if you feel many times you are on your own to locate things in Lab. It is a great book to study from when you don't have access to the live animals as well. It pinpoints the palpable bones and shows radiographs. Each body part is photographed at every angle including transverse sections. The book is pretty good with detailing blood vessels and nerves (these are tough no matter what!) This book is composed of colored photos of a preserved Grey Hound with great colored drawings that correspond to each photo (ie vessels and nerves are differentiated)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Usefulness depends upon area studying","review":"This book was not nearly as helpful as I expected it to be. The photographs and drawings seemed like they would be really helpful. However, I found it very confusing to try to figure out which picture corresponded to what my specimen actually looked like. It was most helpful for muscles, and least helpful for nerves and vessels. It is also very time consuming to look up the particular item and then flip through many pages looking for a picture that shows your item of interest clearly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Huge help for first-year anatomy lab","review":"I wish I'd bought this book before I started vet school!

This one, while good with the emotional issues of dealing with a chronic illness, is severely lacking if you are looking for treatment options. Yes, it provides the standard treatments for dry eyes and dry mouth (as do pretty much all of the sources out there) but if you have any additional manifestations whatsoever (especially extraglandular issues) you will find no help here. Yes, it does tell you that Sjogrens can affect your lungs, for example, but it goes no further than that (no treatments to pursue, no suggestions whatsoever). There are much better books for your money (for the most comprehensive quick-read try Positive Options for Sjogrens Syndrome by Sue Dyson)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very helpful","review":"I really enjoyed this book because it deals with the emotional and psychological effects of having a chronic illness. Sometimes when patients are diagnosed with autoimmune diseases they feel very frightened and alone...this book lets people know that others can totally empathize and relate to what they are experiencing. It gives advice on what to look for in a doctor (many are ignorant of autoimmune diseases!), and how to cope with people who just don't understand the debilitating impact of Sjogren's.

I was skeptical that these could be better than the Legos that I myself grew up with, and for good reason. The magnets on Magna Tiles are, in my estimation, very weak. They just barely hold any of your building projects together and, like a house of cards, only the smallest bump will cause the whole thing to collapse. You'll spend far more time picking up the pieces than you will enjoying the final product.

She loves it! She talks to the bears and she absolutely loves the vibration feature. I don't understand why people are saying it is to loud, we don't think it is at all! Every time she gets fussy we just turn on the vibration and it sooths her right to sleep. Compared to other bassinets it is less expensive and I feel you get a lot for the money. My only complaint was that I wish the bears were colored so they would be a bit more stimulating, but our daughter doesn't seem to mind. Overall we really don't have any other complaints."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like it a lot, my daughter hates sleeping alone though.","review":"I like this bassinet a lot. It's very cute. My daughter, however, is one of those babies who needs human contact most of the time. I've discovered I can put her in the bassinet for shorter naps with the vibration. My major complaint is that there isn't a way to turn on the vibrator and leave it on- it turns off after a few minutes. The other features (sounds, light, mobile) have been totally useless for us, but I do like the bassinet as a whole. It also doesn't rock well on carpet and the cheap plastic wheels don't do any good, but it didn't scratch my floors."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mobile Safety Hazard","review":"I loved the idea of this bassinet so much. I was ready to throw it on the registry sight unseen- but of course I didn't and I am so glad I didn't. The material was soft and it looked sturdy except for the mobile. A detachable mobile? Great idea! ...not so much. I went to 3 different stores and in all three, the mobile was broken and laying inside the bassinet. My husband was with me twice, and in both cases he looked at to see why it was like that. We thought mabe it was just the display but, no, it was just broken. But it seems to attach in an odd way making it seem like all it could possibly do is spin around on the side of the bassinet. This seems very unsafe and I just thought everyone should be aware. If you like the mobile idea, Simplicity makes ones with mobiles that are not detachable, but they screw safely into the side into a permanent plastic holster and they offer more features. (like turning into a bedside sleeper for one)"},{"rating":"1","title":"to much noise","review":"I am expecting my second child and needed a bassinet for the baby to sleep in for a few months until we move in our new house. I tried this bassinet in the store. All the features are great except the noise caused by the vibration. It was very loud and I could not imagine hearing it everytime I used it.

I am by no means handy but there were no tools required and the directions were clear and easy to follow. It is a little heavy so I don't suggest doing what I did; assembling it in the living room so my fiance had to carry it through 3 rooms and up a flight of stairs to get it into our room. The mobile is adorable and it snaps in firmly and once the nut is screwed onto it, it will not move from possition.

The copies come out very blurry and then completely black and then the machine just shuts down. I have not had any complaints from my boss as to the quality of the faxes, however.

Doesn't take up much space on the desk and you have a built in phone with caller ID, too. The copy machine part of fax makes nice clean copies, too. This wouldn't be very cost effective if you are going to receive a lot of faxes or make a lot of copies.

While I don't consider myself a tech geek, I do consider myself a due diligence shopper. I read reviews about the quality of the faxes both receiving and sending and was concerend. But at the price, I decided to take a chance. If you are expecting crystal clear, sharp faxes, this is not the machine for you. If you intend to use this fax for minimal use and don't want to run to the local Kinko's, this is perfect. I did test send and receive faxes and am more than satisfied. Hope this helps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it at half the price.","review":"Fax quality is poor. Copy quality is worse. Jams easily both scanning and printing. Prints a full page report for every fax sent (or attempt). Will not retry failed faxes.

Also, beware the very short time period to claim rebate.Simply put, this machine is garbage."},{"rating":"2","title":"fax","review":"I like the size and the ease of this fax.

But, if you are in a situation where you rarely receive faxes, just transmit, then this would be the way to go (no cartridges used for transmitting faxes).Right now this fax sits in the storeroom in case our new fax machine, which is a large Brother laser fax does all our fax work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for sending faxes","review":"Recently bought a HP 2140 Fax from Amazon that would not send when first set up.

Very intuitive. Slightly negative, the fine print on the copies were a little blurry, and the ink ribbon looks like it will be a little tricky to replace (I would have preferred an ink cartridge), though I haven't done it yet. It says the ribbon that comes with it will print 30 pages. I am hoping to find one that will print more than 30, and hoping I can get the ribbons locally. All in all I am happy with it.

This Brother fax machine does not have this problem, the ribbon cartridge does not dry up, which is nice. Also, you can roll back the ribbon cartridge and use it again to save some money. This works fine although technically the more you use it over again, the worse quality of your incoming faxes and copies would be. The fact that I can use the cartridge more than once is a real plus since I'm very into saving money. Also, a replacement cartridge is less than $19. at the time of this review, whereas the replacement HP fax inkjet cartridge is over $30.!For a light duty home office, this fax machine gets the job done at a good price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sends faxes over VOIP","review":"I send a fax every two weeks, occasionally receiving one.

But, to send a fax over VOIP, you need to use a special setting on the fax machine and my 770 is so old some of the control buttons do not work any more. Having had such good service from my 770, I purchased the 575. To send a VOIP fax, you have to turn on the \\"overseas mode\\" function. I am able to send faxes using Magic Jack. I am impressed with the design and quality of this machine. Due to the printing system, this unit is best for someone who only occasionally receives faxes. An inkjet printing system would be better.

She suggested it was something in my phone line and advised I call Verizon or try moving the fax to a different location (phone jack) in my home. I did so with same results. Several important faxes went through, but weren't received on the other end. It's hit or miss. I always have to call and verify if faxes are received. Frustrating...It receives faxes perfectly.

Both agree that the world of the Bible is the primary world which helps us understand the world in which we all must live. The biblical narrative ultimately shapes us and the way in which we view the world around us.For the poltically correct the view seems to be that the world is the primary commitment and the biblical narrative is to be examined in light of our political and social commitments.

Fragments, early drafts, some small pieces too short to publish as a single book? What I got was Austen's juvenilia.Nothing against Austen. All authors have juvenilia. They had to learn and grow. And those writings can be interesting. Austen's are full of humor and satire. But they are best in small doses. If I were teaching a class on Austen, I'd assign 3 or 4 of these pieces. But as a whole book, it gets tiresome.However, I do have a problem with Oxford World's Classic not clearly labelling this on the cover as \\"Juvenilia.\\" In fact, no where in the product description on this webpage do I see the word \\"juvenilia.\\" Yes, I still would've bought it.

I'm going to try switching to a smoother road tread to see if the noise decreases. Either way, I'm very happy to have bought this as I've already lost weight and am able to ride for a longer time at a higher speed than I was with the first few uses.I recommend buying a block for the front wheel, too.

Assembly was at bit confusing at first but it came together pretty quickly. I did have to replace the axle of the real wheel with the one provided, to attach it to the trainer but that was relatively simple. Riding with the trainer is stable and comfortable. I use the gears on my bike to adjust the resistance after setting the resistance mechanism to a middle setting. As far as noise level, on a scale of one to ten (with 10 being the loudest) I would give it a 6. It definitely makes some noise but with headphones in you barely notice the noise at all. Without headphones it is still relatively easy to watch TV and hear just fine. This is a high quality well built trainer with all of the basic features one would expect.

The setup was very quick; install the provided rear spindle (if necessary), bolt the resistance unit to the trainer frame, adjust the wheel clamp, and you're off! Some of the reviews say that noise was a problem, but I've found that even having my TV at a normal volume cancels it out. There is some vibration, but that's just from how the unit provides resistance (much less than you'd find cycling down an asphalt road). This unit does actually fold-up pretty well (about 2.5 feet wide, by a foot deep, and two feet tall).From walking up to the bike, re-mounting it on the trainer, and putting a riser block under the front tire, it takes only a minute or two until you're moving.

This book does a great job painting a picture of the early 60's London music scene that spawned the Who. It also reminds you that Keith was the father of all rock drumming, a true revolutionary. As the book chronicled his descent into alcholism and addiction, I started to find the descriptions of the debauchery repetitive and unnecessarily detailed at times. A 100 page edit would have made for a brisker read.

As an avid fan of the Who, I never had the pleasure of seeing the band live as Moon died before I was born. Because of that, the stories that I have heard about him have been in snippets and without any personal points of reference. Though the antics of \\"Moonie\\" may appear to be exaggerated by those who were on the outside looking in, Tony Fletcher has done an impeccable job of making the stories come to life in a way that, although outrageous, is entirely believable and factfully true.

Keith Moon's life was unique for sure, and this book is an exceptionally well written and thoroughly researched treatment of a compelling personality. The horrors of Keith descent into alcoholism and drug abuse provide a clear warning of the dangers of such behaviour. Keith's manic lifestyle was so frightening, yet despite it all Keith was very loveable, if only he could have accepted that. This is a must reading for Who fans.

Why didn't Mr Fletcher disscuss his drum talents more than his wild life.

Fletcher lays to rest all the myths about Moon, describing how and why the real events took place. He seems to be pleading Keith's case as he gives explanations for some of his trespasses, but it is also a fascinating insight into Moon's life. He takes us inside Keith's heart and soul, highlighting his good points and giving us an honest representation of the bad. By the end, I was in tears. Fletcher is, without a doubt, the best biographer of the decade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and full of suspense","review":"Have already read the book twice and recommend it for readers of all ages.

I rarely ever have any kind of cut or discomfort on my face or neck. My gillette blades last much longer than expected and I only ever need three or four drops of oil so a small bottle lasts much longer than any other product I used to buy. I don't notice any smell issues and I also don't go to any special lengths to prepare to shave. I just wash my face with warm water and apply the oil immediately and shave using hot water; no special towels or steps.

Although it is primarily relevant to ObjectPascal it will be a great resource for developers using other HLLs on Linux too. It really fills in the bits that are missing from Linux books, programming books, FAQ forums and so on if your history has been with DOS and Windows and, especially, if you want to cross-plat your Delphi components.I needed this book a year ago and I'm overjoyed to have it, now that I'm using Kylix 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Michigan Memories: Inside Bo Schembechler's Football Scrapbook","review":"The book is wonderful.

The speed I was refering to in the title is not the Auto Focus speed, but the maximum aperature of the lens. At f4.5-5.6 you don't have a ton of flexibility.

How can I praise Hahn's performance when the tempo is too fast to show any feeling?Yes, there is no feeling in this movement. It is almost mechanical! No, I do not wish for overly poignant songs that make people cry. However, I believe Hahn's performance of this concerto is an overly excessivly rushed one.The one thing that prevents me from giving her 1 star is the fact that, while having a rocketing tempo, Hahn's playing is flawless. I have never spotted a single mistake in the recording.In conclusion, I believe that this recording of Bach's second concerto is a disaster, mostly stemming from the fact that it speeds at a blazing tempo."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Wrong Note","review":"Ms. Hahn mistakenly played B-flat in bar 36 (the sixth note), the first movement of the A minor concerto (Track 7, 0:42).

Aggressive, emphatic and overdone. Accents consistently in the wrong place. And while the playing is fast, some ensembles and orchestras can play these fast tempi without sounding so awful. Slow movements are sweet, if you like the outrageous vibrato. Not for everybody, not for HIPsters, and certainly not for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fall dead","review":"Too fast.

Personally, I find her music addictive and I never get sick of listening to her.

As a lucky resident of Baltimore, I was able to see her perform with the Baltimore Symphony Orchestra soon after my discovery. The Hilary Hahn space in my heart grew larger. The way Hahn plays Bach is nothing short of brilliant! Her performance of the allegro assai of BWV 1041 on this CD is breathtaking!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way Too Fast","review":"Hahn is a talented artist, by any measure. But this presentation is just way to fast in the tempo department. Bach's beautiful concertos should not leave you feeling stressed out and fretful.

Hahn gives a virtuoso performance, the orchestral playing is first rate and the other soloists are equally excellent. I can't agree with other reviewers who feel that choice of tempi is a problem. What I perceive is a deliberate choice to avoid marked modulation of tempo within a given movement, in contrast to more romantic styles of performance. Whether or not you rate this recording a 5 or a 4 is a matter of individual taste, but this is a modest degree of differentiation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too fast!","review":"I first heard this recording while listening to the radio, and was so upset by the tempi that I had to find out who the conductor was and why the normally sensitive and musically irreproachable Hilary Hahn was playing so breathlessly fast. When I found out it was the LA Chamber Orchestra, with Jeffrey Kahane conducting, it all came clear...Kahane is a noted speed burner, whose interpretations are often rushed and frantic. I cannot believe that these tempi were Hahn's choice...another reviewer astutely commented that it sounded like the LACO was rushing and Hahn was trying to slow them down. Let's hope Hilary records these pieces at a later date with a more sensitive accompanist."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow down and relax please","review":"I am quite sure that Hilary has the technique to play any piece every written for violin, however what is required for Bach is a sense of phrasing and nuance that I am not hearing on this recording.

It is functional and the blade is well sharpened. Engaging and disengaging the safety with the mechanism on the back (done with the flick of the thumb) is easier than using the slide lock on the Kershaw Leek and similar models. The biggest drawback would be the liner lock; on the one I received, the liner lock is so snug that I cannot close the blade one-handed every time and the ridges dig uncomfortably into my thumb while trying. Compared to the Buck Impulse or, again, the Kershaw Leek, the assisted opening mechanism on this model seems on the slow side, but maybe that's just me. With some strategic lubrication I can probably solve any issues I have. Even as is, I do not regret this purchase"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away","review":"I am very disappointed with the quality of this knife, especially since it is manufactured by Buck.I find that the safety will not stay latched unless you tighten the pivot screw so much that it impedes the assisted opening action. The liner lock is almost impossible to push back into place to close the knife... this leads to a very sore thumb. Finally, the all-metal handle is slippery in your hand.I decided to take advantage of Buck's Forever Warranty, and sent it back complaining about the safety latch. All they did was tighten the pivot screw and grease it up... quite useless. I would advise against purchasing this, or any assisted opening knives from Buck.

This leaves the hapless student to fix the errors and waste his/her time focusing, not on the subject, but on coding error. Furthermore, the author regulary just gets lazy (IMHO) and starts to do examples, fundamental to a student understanding the concepts in this book, solely in mathcad.
