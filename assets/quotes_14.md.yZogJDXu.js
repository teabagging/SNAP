His wife is Gwenyth Paltrow, and she too is well played. She is having an affair and doesn't know that her husband is on to her. He plots to have her killed and things go 'wrong' from there.

It relied on some overhyped sex scenes [which themeslves are not much] to promote itself. I really could not blame them for doing that given the movie has nothing else to offer. It shows Douglas, an apparently shrewd and cunning man, rely on a conman to kill his wife. The conman, who being very shrewd too, fails to murder the wife and dies, the movie then shows how Douglas falters in every move to cover his tracs and kill his wife at the same time. To make things worse the wife plays little if any role in his downfall.

The BBC had a sunday night play program and this was one of the stories. This performance and the earlier movie, 1954, with Grace Kelly and Ray Milland was far better, good music too. Director Hitchcock followed the original story. This new movie has some clever twists but also has some awful gaps and holes. I did not like Michael Douglas as one of the leads. I found him very boring, totally dead sounding and looking, (I guess he didn't like the story either) and unconvincing. Indeed he has a long way to go to catch up with his father.

The information in the book is of value if you are with a tour, or planning the overall itenerary but it is not to helpful when it comes to details. Most of the hotels and such are for the more upscale traveler, with out much for the budget or midrange traveler, I ended up borrowing Let's go China from a traveler who was leaving and I ask others I meet who have the lonely planet if I can read a bit. Also another problem is there are no chinese characters in the text, so you can't show the taxi driver where you want to go, and most haven't mastered reading the romanized chinese with the proper accent or inflection. If you are with a tour, maybe fodors is OK, but otherwise go with LP, it has picture too, Fodor's dosen't."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Guide with One Major Flaw","review":"I recently spent some time in China and happened to have a Fodor's China guide with me. It was extremely informative and quite helpful at times. However, it has one major flaw - the place names of the sites, restaurants, and hotels are written only in English. In order for the average taxi driver to understand where you would like to go, you need to have the name of the place written in Mandarin characters (just in case your heavily accented attempt to speak the language is incomprehensible to the driver). The largest obstacle in a foreign country is always the language barrier. If the guide had the place names written in Mandarin, it would be golden. As is though, it is still worth the money and time to buy and read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sci fi stories, without the science?","review":"In the introduction to this collection, editor Gardner Dozois bemoans the popular perception that sci fi is a genre that is dying. But with weak selections such as these, it's a miracle the genre isnt dead already.If this is the best sci fi can do, then the genre is in alot of trouble. Its a sad day for science fiction when the best stories of the year, contain pitifully little science. In most of the stories, science is none existent, or has a negligable role in the plots (and this even from some so called 'masters' of hard sci fi). Although there were a (very) few gems in this collection, most of the stories are pointless, aimless, lack any kind of meaningfull conclusion, and leave the reader thinking (to paraphrase Simon Cowell) \\"Well, so what?\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"strong collection of short stories","review":"The twentieth edition of what annually is one of the best anthologies is a strong collection of short stories that showcases the top tales of the year. The contributions come mostly from United States, Great Britain, and Australia and run the gamut of the genre. As usual Gardner Dozois provides a superb introduction that gives the perspective and condition of the genre. This time though much of the critical world claim the genre is dead, no earth-shattering innovation occurred, and magazines have suffered losses, Mr. Dozois shows that SF remains a viable powerful entity. Each tale is well written as expected from an anthology packaged by the award winning Mr. Dozois who leaves no stone (magazine or book?) unturned in his quest to provide THE YEAR'S BEST SCIENCE FICTION at least the shorts.Harriet Klausner"},{"rating":"2","title":"Talented and then some!","review":"It's not just because I've had the pleasure to know these guys, or because I sat thru hours of rehearsals and studio time, it's because of the talent, passion, and drive of these musicians that this is one of my favorite cd's ever and I still sing Surprise Party when I'm in the shower.

This fresh contemporary translation from the 15th Century Latin edition makes the timeless wisdom of this classic available to modern readers in easily understandable language, while retaining the austerity, simplicity and beauty of the original. Meant to be read in small portions, the Imitation is truly a guide for discovering personal holiness. The Imitation speaks to one's heart, rather than one's mind, and provides one with strength, inspiration and fortitude to grow in one's interior spiritual life. Although written from the presepctive of a mideval monastic, The Imitation contains classic advice for every individual who wishes to develop and grow in faith and personal spirituality."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"For a period in my life, I read this book perhaps more frequently than any other book. It is quintessential Christian reading. Following Christ isn't just about joy. We are called to deny ourselves daily, and to carry our crosses.

It was and will be the biggest bang for my buck in my short life. A young evangelical Christian who studied philosophy at the local university, I was comfortable in the faith tradition in which I was raised. Comfortable, but not satisfied. Paging through 'The Imitation of Christ' completely blew my puny pseudo-philosophical mind. Combined with a respect for Aquinas, and an existential awakening from Blaise Pascal, it was literature like this that prompted me to reconcile myself with the Roman Catholic Church. It's a shame Kempis isn't read in evangelical circles. The Imitation of Christ truly is second only to the Bible in its Beauty and Truth. The difference is, Kempus 'breaks down' a lot of what the Bible and following Christ ultimately mean for our lives concretely."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the one I needed to make myself commit to change","review":"Few books in my life have caused me to reconsider my politics or my religion - not to change them so much but to assess why I've held certain beliefs.

In addition, the author does a poor job of tying togethr his points into a more coherent argument so sometimes the little personal stories and attempted points fall flat or don't make sense. Although I am an avid reader of non-fiction environmental texts, I could barely get through this one. As other negative reviews have suggested, the book contains a good deal of philisophical fluff.

But was the movie going to meet up with my standards for a good musical on film? The answer is a definate yes! It is quite original when compared to other rock musicals (eg. Jesus Christ Superstar), and gave me a feel of being in the front row for an awesome improvised theatre production. The music also meets up to my standards, right up there with other classics such as Tommy and Hair. Before you buy, please take into consideration that there is a \\"muddy\\" sound problem during the song 'Day By Day', which is present on ALL copies of this film that I know of, except the DVD release. Although, everything else makes up for this minor corruption, and I'm very glad to have it as a part of my movie collection. I think you will be glad, too!..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Godspell 70s but still good","review":"I saw this with my school in the 70s. I enjoyed it even more now. The songs are really good. The presentation is theatrical slap-stick but somehow it works. The message is timeless. My kids liked it too. It was sobering to watch the action with New York's World Trade Centre twin towers in the background. Adds to the relevance of the gospel message and song lyrics to today's audience. I recommend it if you've got a DVD player that will work with American zone coded DVDs."},{"rating":"2","title":"PARABLES OF JESUS","review":"Godspell is a wonderful movie full of songs like \\"DAY BY DAY\\" and tell the story of Jesus through PARABLES. This movie is a classic and enjoyable, if you don't trip on the superman outfit or the abrupt ending. Remember these are just people play acting...and not trying to be real life Christ. Kids really love the parables such as the GOOD SAMARITAN, THE PRODIGAL SON, LAZARAS & THE RICH MAN, and many more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oddspell","review":"Some great music, but the movie is quite dated.

This is not great movie making. It is great story telling! The emotions it invokes are incredible. The retelling of Jesus's parables are terrific. The way it turns from joy to sorrow at the drop of a hat (the farewell scene with On the Willows is the most moving). The characterization of Jesus and Katie -- and my personnel favorite John the Baptist). This is one not to be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent service","review":"Service was fast, product arrived in excellent condition because of good packaging, good seller, would highly recommend to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"A much more positive alternative to Jesus Christ Superstar","review":"I've been a fan of Godspell since I first saw it on the stage (about a year before the movie came out, I think). While the professional stage productions were generally better, the movie is still very good.One warning: you have to approach it with your mind in a very abstract mode. Some have mentioned the fact that John the Baptist and Judas are played by the same actor: in fact, the only actor that I've noticed having any fixed identity is Jesus. The others seem to move in and out of the roles of specific Biblical characters as the scene warrants. And you have to understand that they're not making fun of the Bible - rather, they're showing a side of Jesus that, although it certainly existed, is rarely portrayed: the humor, the happiness, the kind teacher rather than the stern lecturer."},{"rating":"1","title":"cringeworthy and creepy","review":"i saw this movie as a child decades ago and remember it as bizarre and tedious. i thought to give it another shot since my 6year old loves daddy warbucks in annie. well his much younger self has an afro, wears clownclothes, and has clockwork orange facepaint. the other very amateurish characters declaim and act out buffoonishly and i just felt embarrassed for them. the musical numbers are the only watchable parts of the movie so maybe 15 minutes of mediocre entertainment out of the lot. i don't understand how it got so many good reviews, it is horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO!","review":"I did not like the movie godspell!

I saw it on Broadway and loved it because the sets were as integral as the production. But the major mistake the film makers made was to film this on location, using the actual streets of Manhattan (where I live)It was a gimmick that you couldn't forget in watching this hideous exercise in movie making. In watching the cast prancing up empty New York streets, and wondering how did they do that, you get easily bored because there's so little color. The cast is wretched. No wonder you've never heard of any of them since except for Victor Garber. \\"Day by Day\\" sounds like a bunch of bleating sheep, because the singers are so desperate to make the story come alive. I'm usually a sucker for any musical but this is one that will never find its way onto my shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gawd!spell","review":"...Godspell is one of the worst movie musicals I've ever seen, and everyone I know who's ever seen it has agreed. The stage show was one of the great theatrical experiences of my young life back in the early 70s. But the movie is horribly miscalculated; the characters don't connect with the viewer in any way, and the songs just sort of steamroll past without any emotional charge.I saw it on the Navy base where I was stationed after seeing it once in a civilian theater. The base theater was inexpensive, and most of my friends went to whatever was playing, so I went back. But I told a group of Christian enlisteds who were heading in that they were in for an awful time. They actually told me that this was proof that I was not a Christian.Two hours later, when the lights came up, they were pretty quiet, except that they apologized to me and one of them even said it \\"sucked.\\" If you can't believe that review, whose can you believe?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lord, have mercy!","review":"To be quite frank, the only reason I would give this movie even one star is for Victor Garber's brilliant portrayal of a modern-day Jesus. But even with him, this musical is nothing but a dreary piece of Christian propoganda. The lack of subtlety disgusted me, along with the insulting way in which evil was portrayed as being jokingly punished with - oops! - an eternity of Hell. The grating giggles and irritating jolliness with which the fates of mortals were blindly decided made me wonder whether I was in Hell already. The Sunday School script was worse than an episode of \\"Seventh Heaven\\", and the simpering seventies soft-rock hymns were nauseating. It makes me wonder whether Jesus himself wouldn't have over-turned a few of their tables. Unless you feel you would enjoy what seems like an end-of-bible-camp, anti-\\"heathen\\", Christian \\"Rock\\" songfest, give this one a wide berth."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS MUSICAL IS TERRIBLE!!!","review":"THIS MUSICAL DOSN'T MAKE SENSE!

The mac700 is much quieter and as a bonus, it takes up less space due to a smaller footprint. I was hesitent to order this compressor with such a small air tank for my garage and it will never run big sprayers or large air tools that require alot of volume. My immediate needs call for a compressor to fill tires, blow off parts, and clean out carburators and this compressor works perfectly in that role.My packaging was intact however there was oil all over the cardboard and on part of the compressor.

I bought it based upon the 30 lb. impression because I was tired of lugging my Hitachi EC12.

The same uploading brass elbow was broken when it arrived from shipment. This is a design flaw in the product.

Can you imagine every time the compressor were to hit anything or tip over the elbow would shear off.Amazon was slow to ship and I got an email that said they were having trouble shipping the compressor to me. I don't know what kind of trouble but the compressor was sent to me several days after the initial time for shipping.They are going to come and pick up the compressor and refund my money after they get the compressor.

It's an extremely solid compact, runs quieter than the other hotdog compressor I have at my own home, yet still doesn't take much space. I highly recommend it if you're looking for a powerful smaller compressor for normal garage applications and accessories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Compressor","review":"Lots of power for small chores such as air tools, cleaning compact areas and very quiet compared to most of this same size and weight."},{"rating":"1","title":"makita MAC700","review":"Like many others my compressor arrived with the plastic shroud in seven pieces. It would not take much to correct the packaging to prevent this from hapening. One of those inflated plastic bubles taped to the front of the shroud would stop the leading edge of the shroud from hitting the cardboard insert and putting enough pressure on it to cause it to break. Putting large red arrows on the box and printing this end up in large letters would also help as the small red arrows are easily overlooked. My unit came with oil all over the cardboard insert and an imprint of where the leading edge of the shroud had pressed into the cardboard. This was a good indication that the box had been laid on its side. I also own the MAC2400 which is great but really heavy. As Amazon will not replace this unit I have returned it and have ordered another from Home Depot.Com for the same amount plus sales tax. I hope this one comes in one piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived broken","review":"I ordered this as a refurb and it appears new...except for the broken elbow like everyone else has already reported. Called Makita and they said to send it back to vendor (at my expense...yeah right) or go to authorized repair facility. I'm going to take my chances and try to repair it myself. Google for 'unloading elbow' and find that part for about seven and change. The check valve is about seventeen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great price and shipping but it doesn't work.","review":"Bought the Makita MAC700 for a great price and free shipping. Ordered it on Monday and had it on Friday. It arrived in great condition with no damage as reported quite often in other reviews. Never got through the break in before it stopped working. Let it set and finally got it to run again by continuely turning it off and on. Pumped it up and bleed off the pressure and it would not cycle back on without recycling the on/off switch multipile times. It seemed like the piston was tight so I reran the break in again. Worked properly once and started freezing up again. At least Amazon has a great return policy. Will drop it off at UPS tomorrow. I love Makita products but I am giving this one a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived broken","review":"On unpacking, the plastic face of the oil reservoir was cracked. Unit is unusable so returning for refund. Will buy one locally tomorrow. A low price is not a good deal when the product arrives broken."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great compressor","review":"This is a great little compressor with good output for the price. It is very quiet running.Mine arrived with a broken part which was no fault of the manufacturer, but they prompted sent me a replacement part without a problem. This does weigh 50# so it is a bit heavier than some, but well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The little compressor that can!","review":"Unlike most portables, this little compressor is surprisenly quiet. Well constructed, runs very smooth, and being light makes loading and unloading a breeze. I have no doubts about this little giant's reliability...extremely pleased!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"This model delivers amazing performance, it's built like a tank and puts out at least the rated CFM if not more. I have tried 5 other brands of portable compressors; this is the one."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great little compressor","review":"I love this Makita: it is quiet, fairly portable, and has behaved perfectly so far (purchased it about a month ago and have used it about four times for a total of about 6 hours). I use it to spray ceramic glazes, so have not tested its upper limits.The directions, though, are terrible, at least for someone unfamiliar with this sort of air compressor. And it would have been helpful if the unmarked object in the little plastic bag had been labeled \\"air filter\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Little Compressor by RMB","review":"I brought this unit and during the 20 minute break-in period, I had the compressor setting 8ft. away from my sciddish dog, and the noise level was so low she did not even bat an eye, she just layed there. This unit is quite and light weight. It was shipped in double thick cardboard boxes and arrived like a shiney new car, not a scracth! I just recieved it so I haven't had a chance to use it on the trim yet, so I'll write back to let you know about the performance. So far excellent!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Makita Compresser Review","review":"I was pleasantly suprised with the purchase of the MAC700 compressor. The unit runs much quieter than previous compressors I have owned. After a simple oil fill and break in procedure, I ran the compressor to time the recovery rate. From a low 110 psi on time to 140 psi shutoff; took a quick 15 seconds. The unit is heavier than I suspected but this suggests quality. I would definitely suggest this unit to a friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pros far outweigh few cons with this compressor","review":"Fill with oil, follow the break-in procedure (running without pressurizing tank for 20 min) and this smaller, quiet, sturdy compressor will probably serve well. Pros of appearing to be durable and quiet while providing plenty of compressed air for its small/efficient size seem to outweigh the less significant cons of being a little top heavy. It is heavy for its size but that is probably another one of the signs it is well-built/durable. Probably one of the best compromises for size vs. air supply. Overall impression so far. . . quiet/sturdy and more than ample for small to moderate compressed air needs."},{"rating":"2","title":"makita mac700","review":"The compressor arrived in good shape. There have been some complaints about shipping damage. It is considerably more quiet than my oil free Mac2000 compressor, which by the way, is still running fine. At around 60 something pounds it is still somewhat heavy. I have no complaints about the way the machine performs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best small compressor","review":"I purchased this to work with an airbrush and spray gun for the most part, not air driven tools. Without a doubt this is the quietest compressor I have ever come across. Setup was pretty easy and the instructions were clear. It charges from zero to 130 in less than a minute and the tank holds enough for my lighter duty needs. It will keep up with both my sprayer and airbrush without having to stop. Pressure setting is like any other. Light enough to carry to a job site, but I would not want to carry it around a lot. Small enough to fit under a workbench, just make sure there is a lot of room for the air intake.For a lot less money than Dewalt, Campbell, Husky, and others this is the MUCH better buy, and there are two models above this one if you need more capacity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quiet is GOOD!!!","review":"I was alarmed when I opened it and oil was all over the inside of the box and dripped out onto the floor! Very messy and inconvenient. When I finally was ready to plug it in I followed the directions and added oil opened the drain tank valve and was surprised at how quiet this thing is. Happy with purchase but Amazon needs to find out what the problem is with this oil leaking in the packages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makita, a great value for the money on a home air compressor","review":"A few months ago I ordered the Makita MAC700 to use for home projects and keeping my fleet of vehicles tires at the recommended pressure. The Mac700 is fairly quite, powerful and able to do most small project you would encounter around the house. Granted, this is no 50 Gallon air compressor but it will do a very good job for short duty cycle compressors. It came shipped in a sturdy box but must have been tipped over in shipping as there was some oil that had leaked out during shipping. It does come with a seperate bottle of the required amount of special compressor oil so that was not and issue.There was no damage to the unit or the box and it's been a pleasure to use as all of my Makita tools are. I would higly recommend this compressor if you need one to do odd jobs or just fill a tire or toy with air.It does not come with any attachments or air hose so be prepaired to buy the fittings and air hose before you can use it.Gary in Tennessee"},{"rating":"2","title":"MAC700","review":"Arrived in good shape with no damage. Assembly and break-in are simple and straight forward. Purchased for a large hardwood flooring project to power a NuMax cleat nailer and a 15 ga. PC finishing nailer. Works great for these types of tools. Quiet running and reliable for the whole job. Ruggedly built with quality parts. Be aware this compressor is not designed to run high air consumption tools like impact wrenches and air chisels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quiet","review":"Works perfectly as described and is the quietest compressor I have barely heard. Arrived intact with packaging in perfect condition. Easy to set up (fill it with the supplied oil,screw in the intake filter and oil breather). Ran the 20 minute break in and all is well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Arrived damaged","review":"After opening the cardboard box that was obviously crushed, I found the plastic motor cover broked and the brass unloading elbow broken-off in the check valve attached to the side of the tank. I called the Makita service center and explained the problem. They said I should sent it back, but agreed to fix it under warranty. When I took it in I got the same unenthusiastic treatment; 7-10 days to fix, or an additional 10-14 if they had to order the parts. I fault Makita for poor packaging and the FedEx gorillas for their mishandling. This has not been a good experience and one I would not do again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The compressor (my first) fills VERY slowly and the pressure drops after only filling a car tire...maybe im doing something wrong but my construction friends had the same thoughts. Runs quietly but is frustrating and Im disappointed in the performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little compressor","review":"I've used this guy for about a month on a siding project, and it's worked very nicely. It is indeed much quieter than most, but still keeps up with my coil nailer. I haven't tried it with two nailers at once; that might push it a bit, but I can't say for sure.As another poster mentioned, the manual does a poor job of telling you how to break-in. Be sure to fill with oil and install the air filter before starting.Only negative comment is the same as many others mentioned; poor packaging design resulted in the \\"unloading elbow\\" getting snapped off in shipping. It required drilling out the check valve, retapping the threads, buying an equivalent part at the hardware store, and reinstalling. Serious PITA, but cost was minimal and repair works fine.All in all, a great little compressor, and the best choice if noise is a concern."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Time and Money - Avoid This One, It WILL Arrive Broken","review":"Take a cue from the reviews - as I should have. Even the new packaging is unable to protect this compressor from normal handling in transit. Mine arrived with the plastic housing that routes air from the fan over the cylinder shattered. Since this will materially affect the cooling effectiveness of the fan and therefore shorten the service life of the compressor, this is a non-trivial problem. Back it goes. I'll order something else that stands a better chance of arriving unbroken. By the way: there was no external indication of damage, the box was perfect on the outside."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"The Handyman\\"","review":"After reading some of the reviews from previous new owners, I must admit I was expecting some type of damage in the shipping process, but it was perfect out of the box. After using the MAC700 with various types of nail guns this mighty mite has a new convert. It has plenty of pressure to handle any single nailer, but probably not more than this. Recovery time is excellent and the noise is very low. I already own two other compressors (both oiless) and the Makita is hands down the quietest of the lot. If you purchase this baby, you won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Industrial Quality","review":"I received this compressor from Amazon yesterday and with great apprehension, I opened the box somewhat expecting shipping damage but there wasn't a scratch on it. I have specified and installed air compressors and air dryers for years in industrial applications and the quality of this compressor rivals any I have seen. Very solid construction and assembled with quality components. I followed the instructions for break-in, the pressure settings were pre-set and there were no leaks. The unit is heavy but I would prefer that over being too light and not staying put when in operation. I found the owner's manual to be well written and together with the exploded-view diagragm, I have all of the information I need for this unit. The MAC700 has a quality touch to it and with proper maintenance should last a lifetime."},{"rating":"2","title":"2nd one survived","review":"First of all, BEWARE. I have also read many reviews before purchasing this compressor and was aware that it's almost too common for it to arrive with something broken. The reason is the lack of/or poor design of the packaging. I got one with the top cover broken, then a few clicks on Amazon and another one was sent out the next business day. The 2nd one arrived in perfect shape, but just beware that it might happen to you too.Now about the compressor, I have to say, it looks very high in quality fit and finish. Now the true test is when you turn it on for the first time, and you just wonder to yourself that this has to be quite possibly the quietest compressor you've ever heard. Then you connect a hose to 135 PSI and this small 2 gallon workhorse can do much work from blowing off dust to taking off lug nuts. Overall, very impressed with this compressor. Puts all other small compressors to shame, just wished I knew about it sooner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome compressor/shipping damage","review":"Love the compressor. Powerful enough for general purpose duties. The most quiet compressor you will find. Had broken fitting from shipping. Contacted Amazon. Amazon told me to contact the manufacturer.

I received it yesterday. This morning when I went to use it I noticed the quick disconnect on the compressor wouldn't allow the hose to be securely attached. I called Makita and they said the coupler was defective, that I need to return the compressor to Amazon for a replacement. They refused to send me the small replacement part so I could use the compressor. I had to send back a 52 lb compressor to get the right part. I went down to Home Depot and bought the $5 part myself to keep from having to send this compressor back. Any other company would overnight the replacement part to help a customer. I will not purchase Makita again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice compressor","review":"This is a nice unit.It arrived in perfect condition.It is quite compared to some of the oilless units i have used.A little buzzing from the condensor coil on the tank feed line,A few dabs of silicone and it was quite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Homeowners must have","review":"If you own your home this is a must have. Cars, trucks, campers, riding lawnmowers anything with air tires. Air tools if you are not use to them also work great off this unit. These tools once you have this compressor are very reasonable to buy and work great, saving you money. I am out from town some distance and it is a real pain to get air when you need it, particularly your riding mower tires. Good , solid unit, makita quality, easy to use, very safe. A little heavy so get a little cart or handtruck and you'll be in business. also you'll need a quality air hose and a good air valve and possibly some additional connectors. All found on amazon for a good price. Remember to keep all tires properly filled, it will save you gas money over time and it may sve a life. If you have a air compressor at hand you are more likly to keep up with that. Whats your families safty worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"We will revisit the stars after it gets fixed!","review":"Similar to several other posts, mine arrived with a cracked shroud, and yes, the instructions are awful.

The world wonders.The other negative feature that is new to this thread: mine arrived with a broken tank pressure guage. We will revisit the thread after seeing how Makita takes care of things.And yes, it is quiet - that part is very nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality Project, perfect for home use","review":"I just got my MAC700 today and I was pleased. No broken pieces from delivery and the product appeared well made. Break-in process was easy and straight forward. There as no hint that the house outlet would trip with regular use. The tank filled quickly. The noise level was relatively low, not quiet, but low. I could easily have a conversation while the compressor is on. While working in the garage, I heard no complaints from people inside the house.

These sights are what Laura was envisioning when she wrote her childhood memories.My favorite picture is the wedding photo of Caroline and Charles Ingalls. Since they are always seen from Laura's perspective, it's easy to forget that they were once a young couple just starting out on their married life together, with no idea of what the future would bring.

But I was very impressed when it arrived.This watch is \\"sharp\\". A little heavy, but is a masculine piece that reflects quality workmanship. I've received compliments from friends and business clients as well. It has great lines, and can be worn in a casual or elegant setting. The clasp was different from the description, as explained in several other reviews, but it is surprisingly secure, and convenient to take on and off. The faceplate is different from the picture, but still looks great (silver in color rather than white). It's easy to set, and is not too bulky. My only criticism is the size of the back-up power button located beside the winding device. It is a bit large, and could have been a bit smaller, or concealed in a different way. Other than that, I'm very pleased.I would recommend this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Runs great after five years","review":"I am retiring this watch after five years. It still runs great - found some incentive to go for a total mechanical one.Pros: solid craftman ship, accurate quartz, and reliable auto-winding through charging battery. Start your initial set up on a morning, shake it 200 times, and wear it for the day - good to go for the next decade by wearing it.Cons: heavy, mostly the band. As time proceeds, I always run to the situation that the watch hit a glass door when opening it in a hurry. Heavy watches cause more serious damage. The case and band bears quite some light scratches after 5 years. The crystal sapphire cover looks as day one and never get damages. The contrast on the dial is low, which makes it hard to read in bad lighting conditions.

If you're used to wearing stainless watches, it will probably be fine for you. I'm used to leather bands, and the weight difference is quite noticeable.

The characters are brought to life in such a beautifully genuine way that you actually CARE about these people, and that gives it relevance. You want to know what's going to happen next not simply because you think you can figure out \\"who done it\\" but because these characters become important to you. Perhaps one of the most striking things about the book is that it provides a view of what life is like in much of the Rocky Mountain region that isn't entirely what is expected. Both majestic and gritty at the same time the imagery is crystal clear and one of the things we learn is that justice is sometimes not the heroic ideal we would hope it to be. This was one of those books that you hate to finish, because you hope you can keep on reading it. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Marvelous Mystery!","review":"I absolutely adored this book! As a mystery fan, I am always excited to find a new writer to add to my list of favorite \\"who-done-it\\" authors. Mr. Johnson's plot is well-crafted, intriguing, and responsible for the tremendous back-ache I received after not budging from the sofa until I finished this book. As a Wyoming resident, I am delighted at Mr. Johnson's ability to capture the quirkiness of the people who live in this amazing state. I hope another book from Craig Johnson will follow quickly, since I'm dying to find out more about Sheriff Longmire, Henry Standing Bear, and the others in Absaroka County, Wyoming."},{"rating":"1","title":"plot was a tad weak","review":"I was able to put the book down to read later.

If you started somwhere else in the saga of the Wyoming law man, you must go back to this one to get your bearings.Craig Johnson creates a believeable universe parallel to ours where the bad guys get their comeuppance and the good guys live to fight another day.

That is just highway robbery and I will be either forego the pleasure of reading Mr. Johnson's earlier works or find them at a local used bookstore.Please spare me the comments about writing a review of a book I haven't read, I've heard all the arguments and in many ways I agree, but this is one of the few forums for expressing discontent of the publisher's greed driven decisions. Anyone who will take the time to actually read this review will understand my rating has nothing to do with Mr. Johnson's writing and everything to do with the publisher trying to wring the last penny out of it's customers.

The writing and acting make for a compelling procedural set in Wyoming (even if it is rumored to be filmed in New Mexico). I'm a former Wyoming resident and they're selling me on the series' authenticity.Having said all that, I was happy tap into my Kindle Fire to sample \\"The Cold Dish,\\" Craig Johnson's 1st in the Walt Longmire series of books. He brings the characters to life, gives each of them his/her own well-defined persona, and weaves a fascinating crime tale. Johnson lives in Ucross, Wyoming, and brings the landscape and people to life in vivid fashion. He carries me back to the Cowboy State with each reading. Craig Johnson makes you care about his cast of characters. He leads you logically along the mystery trail, springing delicious surprises as the tale unfolds. The books are much better than the TV series. I will have to read the entire Walt Longmire saga."},{"rating":"2","title":"DIFFERENT FROM THE TV SHOW","review":"NOT ONLY WAS THE MURDER WEAPON DIFFERENT BUT SO WAS THE KILLER.

I liked them for their humanity and I came away thinking about the good in all of us flawed human beings. The book is fast-paced and a compelling read. It shows the heart of the characters, especially Longmire, who feels deeply for the victims of the crimes he has to solve. I highly recommend it.

I thought Craig Johnson would be a similar kind of writer, but am greatly disappointed. He just goes on and on and on until I wonder if the mystery is ever going to develop. I enjoy local color as part of the story, not the story itself. I am reading The Cold Dish and listening to Death Without Company and find both of them boring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome characters","review":"After seeing the television program, I discovered that there was a book series first.

Wanting to know more about the character I decided to try the first book. I loved it. The characters areinteresting to get to know and I'm sure I will learn more as the series goes forward. The mystery was not one I could solve on the 4th page and there were many instances where I absolutely laughed out loud. The relationship between Longmire and Henry Standing Bear is wonderful. I have purchased the second book and look forward to reading it and all the rest that are available. The only drawback was I am not fond of quite so many 4-letter words.

This was the most disgusting part of the whole ordeal. I did not hear back from them. I emailed them a second time, and they gave me some tips. One of them worked, and my monitor was on. Problem was, it only worked because the monitor had been inoperative and disconnected for a month and had cooled down a bit.Long story short, I'm over the warranty and they want me to pay in order to fix a problem that came with the monitor.

I needed something affordable to open up my laptop. Within the first three screws taken off of my laptop, the screwdriver broke. The tip came loose from the main body of the screwdriver. This rendered the tool worthless. I decided to use the next size up for the rest of the screws. After a few more minutes, the second screwdriver tip broke off, just like the first one. After a frustrating half hour of trying to re-glue the tips back onto the bodies, I noticed that the majority of the other screwdrivers and torque drivers were freaking BENT! Out of the 16 pieces, only 3 were straight. Now if you try to use a screwdriver that is bent to one side, it'll probably turn your 5 minutes project into an ordeal.

Fohr is influenced by the writings of Rene Gueon and Frithjof Schuon in particular.Although I do not subscribe to Fohr's philosophical stance, I find that he does expand my awareness of Bible symbolism, and gives much food for thought.It is a very good book to get you beyond Bible literalism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after 6 shocks!","review":"Order this lighter just to have some fun with, it was fun for about 1/2 an hour.

If you like Gravitation, or any other shounen-ai type mangas, this one is for you. It is a series of different stories, all based around a club called B&B. The club is a member's only, exclusive host club, where if you're rich enough, you can rent a boy for a day, a week, a month, or the rest of his and your lives. Every story is about someone who is connected in some way to the B&B. Each story is very sweet (though there is almost always sex, so this is not for someone under 18).

Otherwise its only conceivable use is to feed a waning fire. I have been a bartender for over seven years, and I have read a dozen or so reference books. The Bartenders Bible is my least favorite of all. Its organizational system is ponderous and ultimately useless to a bartender in a pinch. It is polluted with obscurely named concoctions that make an experienced bartender wonder if the editors didn't just make them up to fill space. On top of that it is sloppy. If anyone can tell the difference between the \\"cosmos\\" pg96 and a daiquiri pg97, be my guest.I don't know what Mr. Regan was thinking with this book? I have also read his \\"New Classic Cocktails\\" and found it to be a much better read. Whatever the cause, beware of this book.

I am very happy I purchased this book, because I found some recipies for some drinks I had long forgotten how to make.

Pick up a copy today!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustratingly unusable","review":"As a manager of a liquor store, I am always asked how to make various drinks. Bartenders Bible is the only guide supplied by our buyer, which is unfortunate. It is cumbersome to use as it is organized, even in the index, by type of alcohol used in the drink. Most people are asking what type of alcohol (vodka, rum, etc.) goes into such and such drink, so how can they efficiently look it up by this method? Also, the book seldom has the drinks people are looking for, but is loaded with obscure mixtures that no one has heard of or cares about.

At first, I was kind of happy to have it, as I thought it would be fun to have around for parties. But I soon realized this book has way too many recipes in it (many of which are just slight variations on the same drink) and is organized in a way that makes it hard to find things; rather than alphabetically listing drinks, the book lumps them together based on what the major ingredient is. I'd much rather have a book that tells me how to make a few really great cocktails than one that tries to tell me how to make every drink under the sun poorly."},{"rating":"2","title":"informative but a little hard to use","review":"This book was a gift for my boyfriend accompanying a cocktail mixer. He read it and made a few drinks from this book already. This book organizes the drinks according the type of liquor inside the drink. They also have an index in case you are looking for a specific one. It has almost every drink you can think of! The front part of the book also tells you the utensils you need to make a bar and goes through the different type of liquors. I think it is very informative and useful! I think it is a bit hard to use while mixing drinks because it doesn't have a spiral bound. Thus, it won't be kept open to the page of the recipe when you are mixing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay as a reference, but missing some popular drinks.","review":"Has some interesting info about the history, processes of distilling, etc., about alcohol. It is a fairly comprehensive guide, however, I don't think it is a \\"bible\\" of drinks. It is missing some \\"modern classics\\" such as the Cosmopolitan. Also, I only found one recipe for mulled or hot spiced wine. (One of my cookbooks has about 8 variations on this). This book may be good as a starter guide, or supplement to others, but it does not cover everything. Also, it would be nice to have some photographs for those of us who are \\"home\\" bartenders and could use some more visual information about presentation. (There are some black ink sketchs of glass styles, equipment, but that's about it). The hardback version, though, does have a handy \\"flippable\\" binding style. My final score - acceptable, but not the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"This book is excelent!

The only [minor] downsides are that most creatures have an incredibly high challenge rating, and for some reason there's a celestial in here... oh well. Anyway, I seriously recommend this book for any DM with even the slightest intrest in using Fiends in their campaign."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent overall, but some minor compatibility issues","review":"Fiend Folio is an excellent supplement, with a wealth of new monsters, templates, and other goodies (such as grafts and symbiotes) that any DM can use to make a richer campaign. The only reason I didn't give it five stars is becasue it is 3.0 edition, so there are some minor incompatibility issues with 3.5 (the main thing I noticed was a few spell-like abilities not listed in the 3.5 Player's Handbook). So, if you are a stickler for such things, perhaps it is not for you.

Some fiends here, an undead there, one totally random celestial, with absolutely no unifying theme or purpose.

Real Life Entertaining also offers a decent collection of good hints for new cooks as well.Experienced cooks will find this book offers few novel recipes, many photographs that don't give solid presentation suggestions, and lots of white space.

Other recipes are good, even great--try the roasted potatoes with whatever you have on hand (I used fingerlings & purples), just as the book suggests.

The animation and voice acting are better than ever. The action, drama and comedy are also the best the series has had so far.

This game has very beautiful scenery which changes dramatically every five floors. Exploring through the dungeon is fun and rarely repetitive. Every so often it may be annoying to go through the same floors over and over again.There is only one real flaw that you probably won't notice until the end of the game draws near. You are limited as to how many skill points to assign your characters, which requires you to be very careful in appointing them. Once you reach your characters last level, you can't gain more skill points. If you want to reassign your skill points, you have to lose 10 levels, which take a good deal of time to earn. I really don't see any good in limiting the maximum level and skills your characters can reach. Until you reach that point in the game, however, the game has no real flaws."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great old-school dungeon crawler","review":"I spent many days during my misspent youth playing the original Wizardry RPG on my Apple II, making little paper maps to mark my way through the dungeon.Etrian Odyssey captures that old-school feeling, complete with annotating your own map as you traverse the labyrinth.

The measure of a good cd player is that it can still play an old or fair-condition cd well. Not this player! The slightest imperfection and it was skipping or out of business altogether. Also, It was very sensitive to shock which annoyed even my daughter when I tried to fob it off on her. It eats batteries like a fiend in anti-skip mode.

But while the story bounds along, at times verging on the highly improbable, the language dazzles on every page - in every paragraph, in fact. The author, to whom English was (I imagine) a 2nd or 3rd language, shares with Joseph Conrad (and not a few other non-native English speakers) an enviable mastery of the most subtle wit, the choicest use of epithets, the snappiest of similes. And, having spent a bit of time in Tbilisi, Georgia, in the past decade, I thought more than once or twice in the course of my reading how well that valley city, with its river, smog - and wall-to-wall gangsters - could have served as the setting of this unlikely but likeable tale..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time","review":"This novel has so much promise at the beginning, with Vladimir's adventures through Manhattan. At first, the story moves quickly and is extremely funny. When the hero goes overseas, it just turns awful. It becomes painful to read.

I wanted to like this book, but am putting it down at about 275 pages into it. The main character gives me no reason to care what he will do next. The catalog of characters are caricature comments on cultural (not just ethnic but class and attitude) stereotypes that wear out their initial delivery of comical observation.

In a world of paper-thin characters in fiction, television movies, how refreshing to have a character as complex as Vladimir Girshkin. He is an immigrant, yes, but there is a little bit of Girshkin in all of us, whether we were born here or not. Like most of us Girshkin dares to dream big, and like most of us he is punished so terribly for his dreams. I can't think of the last time a person so complex could evoke our sympathies and our pity, maybe The Confederacy of Dunces. When the book ends you feel lost in a world that is without Girshkin, and without the narrator's moral clarity. Superb.But a warning. This book is for mature readers only.

Nabokov. For all that, I was disappointed in this novel. It's not as good as Nabokov! The main character, Girshkin is not that sympathetic, his female characters are thin and unconvincing, and his adventures are interesting but never really engaging. True, there are funny moments in the novel, but it's not the type of book that would force me to drop everything until I finished it. What I mean is, there are parts that are brillant, parts that are boring, and parts that are OK. So you see it's a mixed bag.

The book cover together with few first chapters is probably the most promising part of the book. But once it moves to the Eastern Europe it could sound funny and intelligent to people who don't know much about Russians and Prague (Oh yes, fictional Prava, is Prague, shocked ?). Prava is definitely not a product of the author's imagination as he claims in the book, people speak Czech, have Czech names and go to places everybody who has lived in Prague recognizes. You just keep wondering, why to combine the third rate gangster movie with the outsider ideas about the American expats in Eastern Europe and hope for a good debut .

And in Volodka Girshkin (and his parents) he has created great comic heroes. My only criticism would be that the book could use some editing down. But all in all, a wild, funny ride and I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Over the top, but","review":"This is an excellent debut.

I am sure many in my class share the same opinion. I must admit that earlier reviews are right. It is a very comprehensive servey of high energy physics, but the writting is simply bad! It's so obscure, hard to understand, and extremely fragmented. Here is an event that should keep anyone interested from buying it. We were assigned a problem in the book as a homework problem. The professor later had to take it out of the problem set because appearntly, the problem concern a session of the book that's already TAKEN OUT of the 4th EDITION!!!!I would recommend Griffiths book, except that that book doesn't emphasize on concept as much I suppose...o well, it's your call...but I'd say: DROP THIS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Introduction to High Energy Physics","review":"Speaking as a graduate student in physics who is condemned to sort through this abominable text, I strongly discourage anyone from engaging in this book if they are given the choice. It's presentation is extremely fragmented, and explanations obscure - survey unlucky students who are condemned to this text and they will tell you that learning particle physics has been a matter of finding other strong treatments. Not at all recommended. I am disturbed by the five star marks awarded by Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"I hope that it isn't just me","review":"I just took an intro to particle physics class as a fifth year undergraduate who has had all of the usual courses that one is supposed to have to be able to at least gain a glimpse into the world of particles. This book by Perkins is one of the worst textbooks that I have ever had to use. The examples were limited if any, and the problems seemed not to correlate with the content of the chapters at all. The problems that I did work on I had to reference other texts just to get an idea of what he was talking about. I have to say that Griffiths' (whose EM book was great and his quantum book not all that bad) was much more mathematical and clear, as well as Halzen and Martin. I agree with the other comment. Get another book before ever buying this book. Plus my Professor was not too thrilled with it as well. I ended up buying the Griffiths text in the end, which helped a lot."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible book","review":"For those who have had to suffer through Perkins before switching to Griffiths, I gotta say that Perkins book will really make your life miserable. This books is terribly unorganized; speaks using concepts before explaining what they are. Perkins book is horrible compared to Griffiths. I don't know if it is the fact of how bad Perkins was that makes think that Griffiths book is fantastic, but I'm really glad I changed from this book, otherwise I would have miserably failed my particle physics class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tunnel Rats","review":"I did a year with the Air Cav in 1966-67. I've seen most Vietnam movies. The Tunnel Rats is without doubt the worst of the lot. I can only assume no one connected with the production ever set foot in country, read a book about Vietnam, watched a movie about Vietnam nor did any research into the war - even the basic technical details of their above ground base camp were completely wrong and looked more like a Boy Scout camp in Wisconsin.The major tunnel systems began in Cambodia and Laos; the networks extended for 100's of kilometers and you certainly didn't crawl the entire distance. Some systems were so well developed there were roads complete with mechanical workshops, hospitals, barracks and substantial warehouses. While there were limited numbers of small \\"neighborhood\\" tunnel systems as depicted in this movie the majority were similar to those shown in the movie We Were Soldiers.This movie sucked!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I want a refund! (Should be zero stars)","review":"Totally bizarre, clumsily plotted, the attention to detail (there is none), special effects (lame), any sort of real acting (zero & there was no script). I think I saw a paint ball gun in a few of the scenes. If I really looked at the cover & saw the Blackhawk. I should have known better. I don't know who the director is & I don't care. Uwe Boll received a rare \\"Worst Career Achievement\\" award at the 29th Golden Raspberry Awards on February 21, 2009 for 1968 Tunnel Rats. I never thought I should have to google a movie before I rent it. Okay, I lost an hour and a half of my time (which I can't get back). I just want my money back.If you have a family member who served during the Vietnam War...don't rent or buy this!* I forgot to add - the place where I had the misfortune to rent this.

I think that Tunnel Rats will top expectations, even for those who love Postal, etc. The trailer really got me excited for it to be honest--[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Tunnel Rats misses its target...","review":"Tunnel Rats is a Vietnam war film by Uwe Boll. I'm not an Uwe Boll hater, but this film just doesn't hit the target. ( I do recommend you watch Uwe Boll's Rampage and Darfur though.) The acting was mostly bad from most of the actors; a lot of overacting and some dull dialogue. The special effects were also bad during the war scenes or when people got shot in general. Also, it didn't really tell a direct story, I couldn't tell if it was telling the American or Vietnamese story because it doesn't really bother to develop characters or clearly develop the conflict. The tunnel scenes were claustrophobic and slightly exciting, though. And I did like the atmosphere it built. It did go by fast so the packing was great.Overall, I don't recommend buying this film. If you have Netflix Streaming, it is available as of 7/1/12 if you want to check it out.Tunnel Rats has blood and gore through its violent war scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"MIA--MOVIE IS ATROCIOUS","review":"Gave two stars because at least almost everybody gets killed in the end--which given the low quality of acting is meet and just.

Give this to your claustrophobic friends for their birthday. Or buy two copies of the DVD and throw them both out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can any John Wynn movie be all bad?","review":"I think a whole lot of people are wrong about this movie.

I don't think I'll even attempt to watch it if the DVD jacket cover isn't somewhat historically accurate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amateur Hour","review":"I am giving the movie 2 stars only because of the body count and action. Spoiler alert: Where was the perimeter of defense for the base camp? Where were the trip wires and claymores? The enemy literally walked in and began slaughter. Why would they enter the tunnels with their pistol over their head and not in front of them? The producer/director could and should have used a military technical advisor. As a 40 year military and police veteran in my oipinion the tactics were totally wrong and suicidal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magic Laundry Pre-Spray!","review":"I believe I must have tried every product out there for removing stains. Rubbing and scrubbing, soaking and spraying and using the stick stain remover - none of them were convenient and none of them really did a good job on grease and food stains. Charlie's Soap Laundry Pre-Spray is something you can leave in the bathroom (or wherever you undress) and spray the offensive spot. Then put the clothing in the laundry basket and forget it - or wait about 30 minutes and run the laundry. There is no re-treating of the spot necessary, even after days in the laundry basket.

The bottle that I got had a strong irritating chemical smell to it, unlike anything described by other reviewers. I was coughing as I spayed and had to open all the windows to let the smell out. It also was useless in terms of cleaning the bathroom; seventh generation all purpose cleaner was much better. Since my experience is so different from other reviewers, I am wondering if Generation Orange had substituted the product with something else. Be aware, think twice before getting it from Generation Orange."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all purpose","review":"I was very hopeful that this product would be all purpose. It's not.

So, I ended up getting the stains out with oxyclean laundry stain remover, which is way cheaper anyway.Also, Charlie's prewash has a very strong chemical smell, like 409 or something. Just a very disappointing product."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT Praxis","review":"If you're expecting Bootsy or Laswell on Bass, Brain on drums and Buckethead on guitar you're looking in the wrong place.

The checklists at the end of each section make it so easy to make sure you haven't missed an issue or just forgotten something. It is also an EASY READ...I can barely make it through 1/2 an E&E before finals. I have never reviewed a book before EVER, but if I had not had this supplement yesterday, I would have cried on the last question regarding the ERIE doctrine. It is worth it just for the checklists and sample (short) answers alone. Hope this helps!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A new way to organize","review":"Unlike any study-aid I have come across.

However, for the price this is a decent set of steps overall."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works Great!","review":"At first, I was a skeptic... I've never been a fan of the \\"Mike on the same wire as the earbud\\" type of hands-free devices. But this one works great! The sound is likely the best that I've had from a mic, and is very crisp and clear, with minimal background noise. Having two earbuds really enhances the sound quality when listening to music or other sort of MP3.The one drawback that I've noticed is that it doesn't have a pass through jack, so you cannot use this headset if you also need to charge your phone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bring Your Ears and Eyes","review":"This is a great video from a great musician.

It's more like George is having inside jokes with the guitar players who \\"get it\\", and those of us who \\"still don't get it\\" are left confused and frustrated.I put down my guitar ten minutes into the video because it was futile. I couldn't even hear myself play after seeing how George BREEZES through the neck whipping out one tasty jazz lick after another.Don't kid yourself: it takes a lot of theoretical knowledge and long hours of practice before you can play like George.

Much to my surprise, I found both fans to be noisy as a result of vibration of the bezel and lens cover. Like some other purchasers I wound up making some rubber gaskets to quit the fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quiet, good looking, and efficient","review":"We've had this fan (and also a 48\\" version) for about 4 months now and couldn't be more pleased with it. It moves air very well, is close to the ceiling (works great for 8' ceilings) and is very quiet. In fact, the only noise I hear when running it at night is the air moving. No motor noise at all.I had mine installed by my electrician, since I didn't have boxes in the ceiling in the rooms I placed the fans in. He installed wall switches for me for power, mostly for convenience. The remotes work great for adjustments, but the wall switch lets me just turn it on and off easily. Since he installed two, he made sure to read the instructions so he didn't have trouble setting up multiple units with the remotes (just make sure to set the DIP switches before pairing). Overall, I consider this a really good purchase, even though it is priced much higher than the equivalent big box store fans. In this case, I really do think that I got what I paid for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks great and works great","review":"Stays tight to the ceiling, so great for rooms that aren't vaulted.

No wobble and silent except for the air moving.Great job engineering this to make it easy to install!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely love this fan","review":"runs so quiet on all 3 speeds and easy to assemble and use! since i was wiring electricity in a new room, i had my electrician install it, which made it much easier, but watching him, i think this is a really easy fan to set up. remote works well. since this fan gives you the option to either install the lamp or cover it with an included metal plate, i set it up without the light (i think it looks tacky). fan looks awesome in my somewhat modern design room, and always gets tons of compliments. fair price, perfect operation, im psyched."},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving air","review":"I bought two of these Minke-Aire Concept II fans and have both installed in a largish living, kitchen, dining area in Florida. They project the modern, white look I wanted and they move a lot of air, even with only three blades (also modern looking and made of bright white plastic instead of being painted white). I wanted a light, too, and when off, these fans look like there is no light. The glass light cover looks just like the metal cover that comes with the fan, which could be installed instead -- a good look.I researched flush mount fans purposely because I have barely 8-foot ceilings and am 6-feet tall myself. I didn't want old-style fan with the three-light fixture hanging below. However, even though these fans in total hang down from the ceiling about an inch less than old-style hugger fans, the blades themselves twirl away about 1/2 inch LOWER. This I don't like but have accepted -- so four stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy to Install and works very well","review":"The fan is as described: quiet, easy to install and works well. It is a bit noisy on the high speed but overall a very good value. The amount of light from the light kit is sufficient as an evening light for a normal sized bedroom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Ceiling Fan I've Ever Owned!","review":"I got this fan last April and have loved it from the first moment. It's beautiful. It's quiet. It's easy to operate. It's close enough to ceiling that my very tall husband and son don't bump into it. When my son accidentally stretched under the fan and hit his hand it didn't hurt him.The controls are easy to use and I got the matching wall control to go with it, so when someone walks away with the remote or it falls into the couch I can still control the fan and its light.While I didn't install it myself, the electrician who did the work remarked that he'd never seen an easier-to-install fan, so I thought I'd pass that on too. We had it installed it with the light, which isn't particularly strong, but seems to be comparable in brightness to lights I've seen on other fans.When I replace our older fans I will probably get other Minka-Aire fans. After living with this fan for 9 months I'm really pleased with my choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fan works as advertised...exceptionally poor light","review":"The fan is super quite. Works very well. I have 8 feet ceiling and this fan's drop from the ceiling is great. Replaced my old fan with this in about an hour or so. Easy to install. The blades are not the same color as the main body of the fan. At one point, I thought of calling Minka-Aire's service dept to replace the blades but avoided the hassle. I got used to the 'two tone' effect. The remote works well.The biggest dissapointment was the light (or the lack of it). Removed a star for that.I was thinking of buying 4 more for upstairs rooms but now I am not sure because of the poor light."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic, quiet fans","review":"I was looking for flush mount fans for my house (ceilings are only 8 feet). These fans are fantastic! I've installed the brushed nickle, as well as versions of the white and bronze. All of them are extremely easy to install. I also put a Hunter fan in one of the rooms - to compare, the Hunter fan took me 2 hours to install with all of the many little parts and cruddy directions. The Minka fans are by far the easiest fans I've ever installed (and I've done quite a few). Took me no more than 20 minutes. And the results are fantastic! Extremely quiet, a light that will dim (which is important in kids rooms), looks great. I've had one for a year now, and three others for 6 months, and not a single problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy","review":"to install and a unique look.

I'm not complaining about Hunter, but I do have a problem with the remote control modules on Hunter when the latest one went out in my living room I decided to go with a Minka, taking advantage of the Amazon Prime program.I ordered it on a Thursday, it arrived on a Friday, and I installed it on Saturday morning.Everything was in the box, packed well, and the instructions were clear. I managed to drop one of the mounting screws and could not find it again so I had to run to Lowes and buy a new one - but had I not done that, it would have been the easiest install ever.Now that the fan is up and running, it is quiet, balanced and looks great. It has a modern look without trying too hard, and the three blades push enough air to make it count.I will follow up in a few months with any issues - but this one looks like a winner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Minka Aie F519 vs Casablanca C30G11H","review":"I had the Minka Aire F519 fan installed for 5 days and spent a bit more and replaced it with a Casablanca C30G11H. Both are 52\\" fans.1. The Minka Aire exhibits motor hum at middle and high speeds. The Casablanca has no detectable hum.2. The Minka Aire does not necessarily mount cleanly to the ceiling. The Casablanca has a mounting ring which gives a flush clean look with no mounting screws visible.3. The Minka Aire housing has a bulky look to it. The Casablanca, in comparison, looks more elegant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely love this fan!","review":"Amazing ceiling fan, no motor hum at all, even on highest setting. Clean, sleek, almost blends into the ceiling. I like that it's somewhat contemporary, yet not overly so which could date it in a few years. 3 of these fans in 3 upstairs bedrooms keep not only the bedrooms cool, but the entire upstairs when the doors are left open. One word of caution, fan is extremely heavy so a bar attached to joints must be installed or something to hold this fan firmly. This will also keep the fan from wobbling. I've seen reviews that this fan doesn't sit flush to the ceiling (approximately a 1\\"-1/2\\" gap), so my contractor mounted the box higher into the ceiling to compensate for this. The fan now sits flush and looks beautiful!! It's worth it to hire a contractor to achieve the flush look. Hands down the best ceiling fan I've experienced yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"great fan when wired correctly","review":"the minka-aire f519-bn 52 inch concept II fan arrived in great condition and is a breeze to install - however, when I powered it on I found that the dome light and the fan control seemed to be connected (turn on the fan and the light turns on, make the light brighter and the fan slows down, fan won't run without lightbulb installed)... on closer examination I found that the wire connection block was oddly miswired: the blue & white wires switched locations from one side of the block to the other (blue is for the light and white is for the fan) - after rewiring the blue & white wires outside of the block the fan works correctlyI've probably voided some kind of warranty by rewiring the fan, and it's quite obvious that minka-aire doesn't test their fans before they leave the factory - but other than that this is a really nice fan"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice and simple, good for low ceilings","review":"It's great, but I wouldn't call it super quiet. Remember that it takes a while after you hit the \\"reverse\\" button for the fan to actually start reversing, at first the installer thought it was broken. I did have to replace one because the motor was loud and the remote receiver stopped working."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible fan","review":"I bought one of these fans and installed it. It works fine so I bought two more. The second one works okay. It wobbles but probably just needs to be balanced (I hope). The third fan was a disaster. The light bulb exploded a few hours after turning it on. When it exploded it shattered the light dome. My 4 year old son was in the room but fortunately was not hit by the glass. I wasn't quite so lucky but just had some minor cuts. I contacted minka air via e-mail 3 times and never heard back. Now the fan motor hums loudly when I turn it on. I can't use it as a light. I can't use it as a fan. I can't return it. I'm out $300. Terrible experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed","review":"I purchased this fan based on customer reviews and a 7 FT ceiling. On low speed the fan is silent but you can barely feel any breeze. On medium the fan motor hums and you get the amount of wind you would expect on low. On High the motor hum increases yet again. We use the fan in our bedroom and are forced to ONLY use it on low speed due to the humming noise on any other speed. The remote works well but the dimmer for the light is retarded. Giving the fan 2 stars just because i like the looks of it and the installation is super easy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"minka aire ceiling fan, 52 inch 3 blade","review":"Very easy to install, from taking down the old fan to installing the last blade of the Minka Aire, it only took us 1 hour.

They are as follows: Licorace, Anise(basically, the same as licorace), Disinfectant, Unpleasant, and Slightly Herbal(close to patchouli, but not close enough).

I was simply unable to burn a viewable DVD until the first patch. That eventually was fixed, but other issues still remain. Because of Pinnacle's back-asswards decision to not adhere to standard Windows GUI design guidelines, the program window will not display correctly on widescreen LCD displays or resolutions above 1024x768. Support is terrible and forum moderators on their site aren't much help either. They are quick to blame problems on your hardware rather than admit there is a bug in the program.

I use LOTS of different software from business databases to Microsoft Office to all the professional Adobe products and have NEVER experienced the crashes (still ongoing) that I have with this program. Pinnacle's constant answer is turn everything else off in the task manager. Funny that Adobe Premier video doesn't need to do that or any other program I have. I defragged my hard drive and made it worse. I upgraded from 8 to 9 and still am walking on egg shells. Do you like the color BLUE as in the windows crash screen??? Use this program.

Certainly they would have noticed the PC freezing up 5 minutes into editing, so I'm going to lean towards the former. If you are the kind of person that likes to go against the grain and ignore all the real users' warnings to stay away from anything made by Pinnacle, then you have no one to blame but yourself if it turns out to be the nightmare it is for most users. Just make sure you fully test out the product within the store's warranty, because my Pinnacle product did not have a manufacturers warranty and I could not return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay Away - very far away from this product","review":"Where do I begin - All I wanted to do was to create a movie with 60 clips, and a title page between each clip. Nothing fancy - that's it, just 60 clips. I've been working on it for 3 months! even after the recent patch (9.4) I cannot finish the product. It keeps crashing and freezing. I have a 3.2gz machine, 1g ram, and I've defragged my harddrive - the product just does not work. I feel like I've thrown $79 out the window on this product.I've read other's reviews before purchasing Studio - and I always thought - \\"It must be something with their systems - or it can't be as bad as they describe\\". IT IS THAT BAD. Do not buy this product - if you do - you will be sorry.Sad part is, I've since tried other programs, and Studio is the, in my opinion, easiest to use, if it would work.

Technical support from this company was horrible, they hung up on me after about and hour of hold time, and then when I got through to them they said they would e-mail me, they sent me a generic e-mail that told me to try things I already tried. I got fed up and deleted the software, I bould ulead video studio and had to re-edit all 3 hours again, but this time it burned to the DVD flawlessly. Don't waste your money on this junk.

As stated on their customer service site, they don't \\"support\\" the current version. I had to DOWNGRADE my XP to use this, and I bought this off the store just today!

Windows never popped up the New Hardware dialog, and there was nothing under device manager. I uninstalled everything and tried the install again, but no luck. I downloaded patches, and new drivers, but nothing worked. Mean while, tech support was just sending me canned answers, and not even reading my emails.

The horrific events are the same, no matter which publication you read, but many do a much finer job of portraying the events than this one. It is like anything else in life, we generally get what we pay for. This book is extremely short (48 pages) and lacks the dramatic photography and complete detail some of the other books contain. Compared to other books, this one was more of a \\"brief summary\\" as opposed to a detailed account. I would recommend \\"New York September 11\\" by Magnum Photographers before this one.

The thin (48 pages) paperback features photos (most of which can be found elsewhere) with captions seemingly written for grade schoolers and little else. There is no particular point of view (other than tragic loss) and the whole thing looks like it was cobbled together in less than an hour.

The streets of the town as Halloween begins, the haunted house where Moundshroud lives, the ancient rituals we are led through by Bradbury, the travel through time and history, the underlying message that death will eventually come for us all -- it is ominous yet strangely comforting to read every time.

So as the boys traveled back in time, they kept losing Pipkin and had to travel into another era of time to find him again.

But here I feel like hearing it from row 24 and under the balcony yet visually sit in row 1. No difference between stereo and surround recording. The singers are always too far away from the front mics and although you can see a mic on Florez, the audio engineer seems to have forgotten to turn it on. I have Bellini's Beatrice di Tenda and Strauss' Simplicius from the Zurich Opera House and they sound both a lot better than this.

The professional reviews and customer reviews I read placed this machine at the top considering the price tag. The coffee that came out was fine, but although it heated the milk, it made little froth. I also noticed that it took at least half an hour for the machine to get really hot. In fact, it got so hot that if you touched it you would burn. My third time using it, I tried to get froth by heating the milk for over 20 minutes. It didn't work. The machine stopped working. The pump just went dead. I tried to shut off the machine and turn it on and nothing. I waited about fifteen minutes and turned it on and the pump worked, but now no froth came out at all. Of course, I had cleaned the attachment well. I used a needle to clean it again. I even took it apart and replaced it. Nothing. I'm returning it.

The krups unit I had for 10 years prior to buying this machine worked flawlessly. I have had to unclog the double walled filter at least 5 times in under a years time already. The other thing is that the machine is noisy and vibrates so much that you have to hold the metal expresso cups in place or the vibration causes them to slide around on the all metal drip tray. Casues a big mess if you know what I mean. As for the frothing wand, in my opinion it does not do a very goods job of producing a strong steam flow. The frothing process takes forever.

I looked it up again on Amazon because I wasn't sure they still make it and if mine fails, I WOULD buy another. A lovely, reliable cup of espresso, easy peasy frothed milk (now that I know how). Suggestions: 1) Do buy your coffee ground to an appropriate grind. Otherwise you may get superfine grinds stuck in the filter and frustrate yourself. 2) If you are having trouble getting the hang of frothing, do as I learned in the video and start with water with a drop of dish detergent to practice until you get it right. That way you don't waste the milk. 3) Keep the machine clean and don't forget to turn it off when not in use. Enjoy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst machine ever.

Customer service was great, sent me a new seal but even with my biggest screwdriver the screw holding the seal in place could not come out.But from my disassembly it looks like my seal was installed upside down! Another call and they shipped me a new ESP8XL.The first thing I checked was the seal and again it looks like it is installed upside down and would fail again.I returned this unit and will continue shopping for a new unit.-> Breville had good people on the customer service line but they didn't know how to get the retaining screw out and couldn't find out the details about the seal upside down or not.--> Even worse was that since I had disassembled mine, there were rusting parts inside that you would never see unless you took it apart.Frankly the unit may have suffered some cost reductions in production and that seal issue is trouble.Bob"},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't buy another","review":"I bought this to replace another bad designed espresso maker a KitchenAid that I paid over a thousand dollars including tax. This started out just like the previous one,worked fine for 3 or 4 months and it became a pretty stainless steel space filler for our counter. The main problem with these is clogging filter that cant be cleaned properly. I don't think I will buy any more hi end makers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Espresso -- short life span!","review":"I bought this unit about 3 years ago and have been very satisfied with the flavorful espresso it constantly produced. Had some issues with the filters clogging but solved that with using filtered water. The water reservoir level is impossible to see, so you might just as well not have it there. Some other method would be better. Now the good part... Even with doing regular descaling procedures, two weeks ago the heating element stopped working. Tried running another descale,....same result. Finally called Breville Support. There recommendation was to turn the system on for 6 hours and then run a full tank of Distilled Vinegar to clean it out. That didn't work either. They also said the the unit is no longer manufactured and there are no spare parts in their pipeline. They'll give you a 20% discount on a new unit at the $500-600 range. That's it.

However, the heating unit began failing just after the one-year warranty ended, and failed all together at 1.5 years after purchase. Although Breville gave me the name of a \\"local\\" service center--in a small city 100 miles away, although I live in a large metropolitan area--the cost of mailing, much less repairing the unit will just about buy a new machine. Needless to say, I did not purchase another Breville."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Crema Ever!","review":"This is the best espresso machine I've ever had, bar none. It's had the best crema on my espresso this side of Italy. And beautiful too. The pump (most important part) is made in Italy. All S/S. Parts are well made -sturdy. Even the coffee measure is well designed, a pleasure to use. Highly recommend it to any espresso lover. Comes with beautiful S/S cups which do not burn your fingers.It's so much better than the Pavoni I had for 10 years...which died finally. Pavoni never was terrific and very quirky.The only small problem with the Breville: you really can never see the water level through the clear window, and there is some steam buildup residue on that window. Called Breville and they had no clue. But it doesn't seem to affect the results."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good machine","review":"I'm very happy with this. it makes a nice cup of esspresso.

Didn't work well with PODs, stick to the regular grounds. Oh yeah, and the stainless steel houseing looks great! Great value for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"a poor performance machine","review":"I have been making espresso for many years.

I've bought my coffee from multiple coffee shops and have had them grind it for me each time. I've merely rinsed my filters after use and they brew perfect creme each time to this day. Those that are complaining HAVE to be over-grinding their coffee.So far my favorite that I can't get enough of it the Iced Mocha. I brew 4 double shots of a bold type blend coffee and add it to 10 tsp of Starbucks Mocha powder and then top off w. milk to the 56oz mark and refrigerate!I also steam my milk to 130 and then start frothing just to ensure the temps up before the jug gets full of foam.Starting to get hot so might play around w. some frosty coffees this summer!Love mine!!Photo:[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Water reservoir contains BPA","review":"This review is simply a warning that the water reservoir in this unit is #7 plastic (polycarbonate) and contains the toxin bisphenol A.

The first cup of espresso was wonderful...though not very hot. The steamer is a JOKE. It takes a very long time to froth a little milk and get it good and hot. The Capresso machines had much more powerful steamers. On this thing, it just kind of dribbles out.After the first cup, I really had to fool around with the grind and tamping to get any espresso to come out at all, which was never a problem on the other machines. And the warming tray...what a joke. At this point, I'm getting better at using the machine and it's making decent espresso and cappucino. But next time, I'd pay a little more money and go with a Capresso."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was great for a little while","review":"Made great coffee for about 25 cups, using distilled water since I hoped to get around the problems people reported.

Do I use this model anymore? No. Couldn't figure out why I could no longer get a great cup of coffee and crema... UNTIL I read the review explaining the double wall filter. After a few months, maybe making one espresso a week, the espresso started coming out watery, no crema, sometimes not enough pressure was produced to even penetrate the coffee. Lots of money to spend on a machine with a bad design.... maybe I can find a replacement filter?? Buy the EC155. I had one before. It lasted a long time and made a great cup after several years of use.

My only complaint is that it takes too long (for me) to steam the milk (3 minutes to get 170 degrees) My steamer tube did not come with the frother (new design I guess) and the milk sticks to it like CEMENT.

It was brushed metal allright. It also dripped more than any other espresso machine I owned or seen up close. After you make a shot the consistensy of the grind is that of a mud - clean-up and readying for the next shot was quite tedious. Quality of espesso with ground coffee was passable, but performance with pods (from Kimbo and Segafredo to Lucaffe and Lavazza) was abismal - poor and inconsistent. At work I use pods almost exclusively (in a Briel) and find them indispensable whenever speed and easy clean-up are important. If you plan on using pods stay away from this model. Yeah, the cup-warming tray is slow but that's the least of the problems with this design. Overall it's a nice-but-dull looking/constantly dripping machine - sorta an Amish girl with allergies of espresso makers. Returned it and got a Francis, just for the looks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful machine very poor design","review":"This machine is beautiful but was not able to use it.

It made OK espresso for an inexpensive machine but the real problems started when I'd had it a while. Because you have to place the espresso cups just so underneath the machine, it's necessary to get down at eye-level to make sure the brewed espresso doesn't miss it's mark. The first clue I had that the machine was starting to fail was I was splashed in the face with scalding water while trying to ensure the espresso was going where it should! I thought this was a fluke and blamed myself for not locking the basket properly. Some time later, the same thing happened. Finally, the machine spews hot water regularly now...the water actually bypassing the basket entirely and spewing everywhere resulting in cups full of brown water, not espresso.I emailed the company and never heard a word.

As always Demi's artwork is beautiful. Were I to grade the story telling alone, I would probably give it 3.5 stars. Then I would give the presentation (artwork, printing, etc. 5 stars). The story is definitely not for children any younger than seven. My six year old is an advanced and avid reader, but she becomes bored with this story rather quickly. This is telling given that she can sit down with something like \\"Charlotte's Webb\\" for more than an hour. Nonetheless, for the time being this is the best biography of the Prophet in English for young readers.

It left me sadly disappointed. The chapter that addresses the four marks of the church defined in the nicene creed did not attempt to reconcile Protestant perceptions of those terms with the historical understanding of the council fathers. None dealt substantially with Eph 5:32. I was further saddened that one author criticized the piety of Catholics on the basis of his understanding rather than taking the time to just ask some of them why they were doing it. All guns trained against Catholicism while the Eastern Orthodox hold nearly identical views on ecclesiology. Perhaps someday a book with less rhetoric and polemic will attempt to address issues that build understanding rather than polarizing divisiveness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great results","review":"Used this on the vinyl top of my VW Cabrio.

Like him or not he must be emotionally connecting with somebody to have sold 60,000 cds over the last 9 months...and no one can bash him for making money -thats what quality musicians do- He hasn't sold out cause he hasn't changed anything in his music or presentation for money. I think his critics are probably jealous, but dont take my word for it...Listen to the sample tracks above-great songs will defend themselves.I definitely recommend his other discs and I DEFINITELY recommend seeing him in concert- crying with him for an hour and a half is very theraputic and cheaper than your shrink.

My friends told me Dashboard was good, so I went and picked up this CD. It is expenisve for just 4 songs, but its worth not having to keep skipping tracks you don't like.For You To Notice-5/5, excellent. a little slow at the beginning but it doesn't bother me!So Impossible-5/5,a masterpiece. This song blows me away!Its more upbeat than the 1st track, which makes it all the better.Remember to Breathe-4/5-good, but not great. His voice isn't as good in this song, but the rythym and lyrics are good.Hands Down-5/5, one of my all-time favorite songs. Simply amazing. Don't take my word for it, listen yourself!Overall it is an amazing CD! this won't be the last I get from DC. I would give it 5 stars if it was cheaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING THAT CHRIS CAN FIND HAPPINESS","review":"this album....man, what can i say? if you've had a chance to purchase this album, you will agree that it is a damn good buy, and worth the money (even though it is only 4 songs). Also, if you have heard the unplugged album, you may have heard these four songs played with a full band. personally, i think that the full band to these songs enhances it and also stunts its genuis. \\"Hands Down\\" sounds amazing with a full band (especially the racing drum beats mike marsh pumps out), Also \\"for you to notice\\" has an excellent drum beat that reminds me of an 80's pop song, but still effective in its own right. the other two songs \\"Remember to Breathe\\" and \\"So impossible\\" i think are more effective when they are sang solo. If you are thinking about picking this album, DO IT! its a brilliant tale of love that only chris carrabba could capture."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!!!!","review":"OH MY GOD!!! I have never heard such meaningful and well written lyrics. Hands Down is hands down the best Dashboard song of all time. I play it to my girlfriend all the time.

The only bad part is that this is and EP and only has 4 songs. BUY IT NOW!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"He did it again","review":"Chris Carrabba did it again. He managed to put out consecutive cds of great worth and individuality. This latest,unfortunately short, cd is quite good and quite distinct from the previous works he did. I would recommend this cd to anyone who enjoys emo or enjoyed previous Dashboard cds. For the most part it is just him and his guitar, singing out heartrenching lyrics with such intensity. If you have never listened to Dashboard before, I would recommend starting with Swiss Army Romance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another whiny emo album","review":"The fact that this was a solo project was the only redeeming quality of Dashboard. The album was one whiny and sorry group of heartbroken love songs. I almost feel sorry for Chris Carabba. If he gets dumped one more time he might ...(do away) himself. Aside from his obvious talent, there was no other attractive qualities in this or any of his albums. Perhaps my distaste for this album stems from my general dislike of emo in general, but I also think there is a line of how whiny emo can get."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't bother.","review":"the ONLY reason i gave this one star is because hands down is a cool song. but the rest of it is just drone. don't bother to buy this, it's not worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BE FOOLED","review":"What we have here with this band/artist is the recent \\"emo\\" craze preying on the sappy emotions of our society's troubled youth with what seems to be \\"deep and emotional\\" songs. This music is not very good. What seems like catchy and creative guitar rifts is really a feminine man raping his guitar by strumming it too hard. All of his songs are about love lost in a cold autumn/winter/November. If you have a lot of unchecked emotions and want to pool your self-loathing and depression, than by all means give in and by this horrible record and dye your hair black, but if you want self-respect, look much further than Dashboard Confessionals."},{"rating":"1","title":"hahahahahaha","review":"Go pay your $10 for these 4 songs to that money-grubbing pseudo indie label Vagrant Records.

Why then is he still writing these whiney songs as if he were some broken-hearted outcasted preteen who just can't seem to make that certain someone to understand that he is the one, he is the swell guy she should be with. Don't get me wrong, it works, he has a great vocal style and works really well with his guitar, but like all emo records (with the exception of Death Cab for Cutie) the music is fun until you actually recognize what they are saying, then you just feel sorry and sort of embarrassed for him. Chris, buck up man, write some songs about Saturdays in the park or Walking a dog or something and forget about your preteen romances. You make a living playing music for living instead of working behind a desk or in construction, you should be giggeling like a drunk college co-ed, let's see some happiness and some better vocals.

What makes this book so valuable is that Ms. McHenry combines practical advice on how to start and continue a healthy walking routine, with encouragement to pray and the spiritual benefits received. I particularly loved her encouragement on prayer....it really made me want to dive into a deeper \\"walk with God\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"If You Can Talk the Talk then You Can Pray the Walk","review":"The author has written a great book on the ministry of praying while you walk. It is a great form of exercise for the mind and the spirit. She spends time on both sides of the topic including helpful information on walking as an exercise and also on growing your life of prayer. Even if you are unable to walk, the sections on prayer are very helpful and informative. The book includes a 30 day challenge to get you started, along with a Bible study and suggestions for covering a community prayer walk. The author covers the subject thoroughly and with interest to the reader. The book is written to address women and issues that we face in our lives of prayer. I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to expand their prayer life and willing to take on a new physical challenge at the same time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable to read","review":"What I enjoyed most about PrayerWalk is that it covered not only the natural body but also our spirit. Being able to address the need to recondition our lives, physically comes by way of confronting that part of us that we overlook... exercise. The \\"E\\" word. Ugh. We know we need to but how many of us stay committed to a lifestyle of change. I do believe she addresses how important it is to renew our minds. That is truly the only way we are going to achieve the goals of having a well disciplined life. As one incorporates walking and prayer, I'm sure if we do it on a consistent basis it will ultimately become a habit. Great book that encourages us to do what we really long for and that is to become women of prayer, strength and discipline."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Challenge to Your Health and Prayer Life","review":"In Prayerwalk, Janet offers encouragement, inspiration, Biblical support, and productive fitness helps to challenge anyone's health and prayer life.

Prayer Walk is good book to start the New Year with. Janet Holm McHenry leads her readers through her own experience with prayer walking. She writes about her dealings with depression, weight, and the overall blahs in her life and how the Father lead her to overcome those things by committing to walking and praying every morning. In her book, she talks about how she began to pray for her community as she walked and the awesome changes she saw as result. She hits the basics of how to prepare yourself, so that you're less likely to hit that snooze button when morning comes. She talks about how to pray, how to stay focused, and how to make time for prayer walking. I was encouraged and can't wait to give prayer walking a try.~I received this book for free from WaterBrook Multnomah Publishing Group for this review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"This book is too elementary to teach you anything. The dialogues may give you a sample of the kind of things you may need to say, but there is no real help with the language itself. There does not appear to be a plan behind the dialogues.

It is riddled with mistakes. Even at the outset with simple greetings such as \\"How are you?\\" \\"I am well\\" , the answers to exercises have a woman using the masculine form (Exercise 1, Unit 1) and gives \\"Are you well?\\" to a man as ..estas 'bom' instead of the usual 'bem' without any explanation (box on page 15). In a table of personal pronouns, the feminine singular is given as a plural (elas instead of ela) Unit 2 p. 21 and in the same Unit a table of nationalities has transposed the feminine singular and masculine plural. And so it goes on. I thought it had been produced in a hurry but yet it appears to have had three editions since 1996.

A man of few words and many, many, low-fat treats, he does the right thing(s) with alacrity and calm confidence. Despite the self-deprecating humor about his massive girth, bad back, and average intellect, he gets the job done--and the chicks go for him.As a northeast Iowan for the past 50 odd years I can tell you that Harstad's depictions of the terrain, the gravel roads, the love of buffets, and the relentlessly cold January weather is spot on. Clearly, his knowledge is due to first hand experience and the quality of the narrative is evidence of a first class mind.One suggestion: Harstad's prose is best when he's just another guy telling stories about dissecting \\"corpse-sickles\\" that Houseman has found in a shed. A kind editor would whack the few lapses into purple prose and tell him to stick with what he does do so well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Procedure does not equal plot","review":"Thirty years ago Julian Symons wrote of police procedurals that \\"A fair degree of realism is possible, but it cannot be pushed too far for fear that the book might be as dull as the actual days of a policeman.\\" Donald Harstad's latest is dull not necessarily because of too much procedure--I am a huge fan of procedure-- but because he and his editor have assumed that procedural realism will cover up plot weakness. The last 120 pages of the book are superfluous and little more than an extended chase for a known killer. With Hollywood offering such lucrative options on books, one can hardly blame writers for offering up stories that will appeal to film producer's literary agents. But do all readers have to suffer through pages and pages of chase scenes? Why not just ship the manuscript directly to Paramount?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!!

I am the co-founder and 26-year head of an evangelical ministry for Christian childbirth educators, and I have been a born-again Christian since I was four years old.I also happen to know Jan Barger, another reviewer, personally, and she is a committed Christian who is very active in evangelical ministries. She also has a solid Christian family heritage; her great-grandfather was one of the most noted Christian leaders of the early 20th century, and her mother was a published Christian author.It is perfectly appropriate for other Christians to disagree with us if they wish.

The book does contain a very readable and pleasant introduction to general nutrition and exercise, with many excellent illustrations, and is a good book for school libraries and health classes.Unfortunately I do not feel that this book lives up to it's title, and will probably not be usefully to competitive athletes at any level or fitness serious adults.For personal trainers, coaches, and athletes with some biology or chemistry foundation I would strongly recommend \\"Sport Nutrition: An Introduction to Energy Production and Performance\\" by A.

Mrs. Stanger has a degree in psychology and a caring heart.

Trying to keep a home audio system within a fairly tight budget, and having read the reviews [...], I bought the Pioneer S-HF11C center channel speaker in order to hear the dialog often missing from the television's more fuzzy sound.I have been quite impressed with this speaker. The voices and even music from DVDs are much clearer than before. Watching television itself is a much more enjoyable experience with the center channel speaker.This speaker is solidly built. If you are looking for a good center channel speaker and don't want (or need) to spend a lot, you won't go wrong.The only negative is that there is a slight buzz in the speaker when I turn on the receiver/amplifier. However, it disappears within a minute. I expect it to disappear completely after the speaker is broken in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Performing Speaker for the Price","review":"I have no problems at all with the performance of this speaker for my home theater audio setup. Gives you all you could want and more than you would expect for the price. Only thing that stops it from getting 5 stars is the visual looks - little bigger, squarer, and boxier than I was hoping. I am still working on hiding it a little bit better to stop detracting from the beautiful large screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT IMPRESSED","review":"I am so not impressed with this centre speaker. the main problem is the low output for my large room. i have to have the volume close to max to get the dialogue clearly in surround mode. the sound just doesn't carry. this is using a 5.1 (100W x5) pioneer AV receiver. the quality is also no better than what i get from my tru picture Toshiba t.v. anyway so what's the point??? luckily i have a pair of great front speakers to rescue the surround experience. i may give this away and try another brand soon. would recommend looking elsewhere really."},{"rating":"2","title":"So who do you think you are?

Someone said the first 40 pages were confusing. I tried to get into this book for 90 pages and then gave up. The narrative is confusing and it's hard to keep track of the characters. When I could get a feel for where we were heading, I just kept thinking \\"Who Cares?\\" and \\"So what?\\" I tried to keep going since I had spent the money for the hardback but finally decided that my time was too valuable to invest any more of it on this read.

Unfortunately it is a dull read with too few moments of true excitement. This book isn't like Conrad's work in that you don't get the feeling of an overarching intelligence guiding the story. It is more of a travelogue laying out the oddness of the journey and the poor, doomed English and their Empire. Perhaps if the book had been reigned in by a tougher editor and some of the details and characters condensed it would be a more interesting work but as it is I was bored for vast passages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes a great adventure boring and confusing.","review":"It's hard, but obviously not impossible, to make one of the great true adventure stories, the British Raj in Borneo, boring and confusing. Ms. Godshalk's rambling prose makes \\"War and Peace\\" look terse. Ms. Godshalk has a habit of writing a paragraph with twelve charactors and starting the next with \\"he\\" or \\"she\\". Most of your time is spent trying to figure out \\"he\\" who? In a book this size the charactors are surprisingly sketchy. Perhaps there is just too much trying to happen here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Abandoning ship","review":"I picked this up again after putting it down 6 months ago--imagine my shock at not even recalling much of the 50+ pages I had already read. True, the story is lush and somewhat enrapturing in its description and setting. But I find it impossible to know Barr, much less give a hoot about his philosophies, actions and life. And, if this is a \\"woman's story\\" as I have read in several reviews, after 110 pages, no 3-dimentional woman character has yet surfaced. I wonder why an editor did not help Godshalk eliminate some of her dozens of extraneous characters and terms. This book is, in a word, frustrating."},{"rating":"2","title":"England vs. East Asia","review":"This novel, which at first glance seems to promise luxury and languor in the tropics, delivers its plot points in sharp, savage bursts, much as the dyaks swooped down on the English settlers after months of uneventful living (except for the jungle rot, tropical disease and delusions of imperialism). It's a compelling read, one that I will go back to, but having been introduced to maias and dyaks and Dutch naturalists by Patrick O'Brian and the lovably flawed Stephen Maturin, I felt more sure of where I was going (the short glossary is a joke). The journey through the fictional Gideon Barr's empire is misleading, heartbreaking, infuriating. Nonetheless, it's a trip full of wonder and well worth taking."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Andy Griffith Show - The Complete Final Season","review":"This is a very nice box set with the original 25 minute episodes. 5 DVDs, Great Color, Good sound and at a price barely above 20 dollars. I know some will complain because Floyd Lawson is not on this last season, No Otis Campbell or Ernest T. Bass and Barney Fife was only on one episode but the wholesomness of the other characters really shine through such a Howard Sprague, Goober Pyle & Emmitt Clark. Yes, it is true that there is not much action here and no bad guys coming to Mayberry to wreak havok on the community.

It never sold out to a populist message, to common stereotypes of southerners and quite often touched humorously and compassionately on some sensitive subjects. I learned a lot about being a father from the countless \\"Andy and Opie\\" father/son talks which would help me years later as I raised five sons. The show is timeless and quite literally the most entertaining television show I've ever seen in my 57 years. Being a native southerner I have always loved the honest, down home charm of the show and the final season does not disappoint nor deviate from that charm. Absolutely wonderful!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Introduction - SUPER CLEAN SOUND","review":"I have a ton of Django CDs but I must say this is some of the cleanest sound I've ever heard for these vintage recording.

The former chief judge for the highest court in New York spent time in federal prisons, and in this book, he shares his experiences and the lessons he learned.

Every card looks like a beautiful painting, complete and whole in its own way. It's definitely more difficult to use these cards because a lot of the images are very simple and the symbolic language used in other decks, like the Rider Waite or Thoth, is not present. But having said that, I still find these cards a pleasure to use just because they are really aesthetic and definitely portray a delicate and hidden world of magic in the simplest way possible or imaginable.

As a software developer we have a need to produce a lot of cd-copies each week. This one will not burn \\"silver\\" cd's. They are a relatively new item (couple of years) but every other burner in the office handles them just fine. Support from Iomega is limited to a \\"sorry your cd's are not on our approved list\\" and we have no plans to add any. It is too bad that the limited list is not on the packaging or sales liturature. In fact you are led to believe that all major cd-brands are supported.

Shaun is a loveably sympathetic character and (best friend) Ed provides endless laughs. there IS a horror flick hiding behind the schtick,...but only BARELY. there is SOME gore (usually presented in a gratuitously humorous manner) but the demeanor of the film is quite light-hearted (and decidedly British)...and i absolutely LOVED IT. it is one of my absolute favorite \\"feel good\\" zombie flicks!! oh,..by the way,....you've got RED on you......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a horror film - so don't write your review as if it is.","review":"I just want to say that I enjoyed this comedy.That's right... it's a comedy.

Whether it's Monty Python or a Hugh Grant, it's just my genre. This movie is personal a 5-star, but because of my bias, I'm saying it's a 4 to everyone else. It's funny, because they're just normal people in a weird situation. If you like British comedy, you'll love this.About the zed-word: You don't have to love zombie movies, I don't. I have a friend that does, but I'm more of 'a once you see one undead person, you've seen them all' type of person. What I liked was the fresh approach on an absurb topic. The movie looks at the humor behind putting a normal person in an abnormal situation. The zombies are just the choosen abnormal situation, it could have been aliens or vampires. The zombies do make it a bit gory so it's not for the faint.All-in-all, I am glad that I received this and have it in my collection.

If you like to see parallels between \\"zombie-like\\" activity (from everyone using cellphones and wearing business suits, to all those skaters wearing hoodies and bouncing in step to their portable cd-players) and actual zombie activity, it's for you. If you love great dialogue almost always with a touch of humor, and can wait for set-up in the beginning of the film to establish real character relationships before they start kickin' some serious zombie ass--I repeat, this is for you. I absolutely love this film and it's main characters, there are some hard sad scenes but since they are mixed with gore, it's harder to get too depressed over them...But all in all, go see this movie!!

Hero gets up one day, does his usual thing, and suddenly everyone is a zombie and it is up to him to save the planet. Only here, the catch is that Shaun is just your average everyday slacker in a dead-end job. He doesn't have a chiseled figure and is filled with self doubts. His best friend is disliked by many and is a slacker himself. In other words, these aren't the guys you would expect to be leading a group of people to safety.But this movie works. Unlike other movies which focus on blood and gore, this movie focuses on humour. The gore and violence is kept to minimum, with more of a focus spent on the interactions between Shaun, his girlfriend, and his slacker buddy.This is most definitely a zombie movie for the Gen-X'ers amongst us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good British Humor","review":"My favorite attribute of British Humor is its unpredictability, and so goes Shaun of the Dead.

Shaun is a computer salesman who is dumped by his girlfriend and lives with a slacker pal and a mean owner of his apartment, when zombies attack Shaun and slacker Ed with a few other people battle and then get trapped in the local pub. The funny part is when Shaun and Ed are in the backyard and think the zombie is a drunk woman and then start throwing records at two zombies.

It's as if the writer of the movie was granted a wish by a Genie for every time he put the \\"F\\" word in the script.

Starring Simon Pegg as Shaun and Nick Frost as his mate Ed, SHAUN takes the piss out of zombie movies with its referential dialogue and many scenes of having fun with the recently resurrected (such as trying to take them out with Shaun's prized record collection).SHAUN follows the typical zombie structure with its group of mismatched survivors constantly seeking safety from the flesh eating former folks. Completely unprepared for the walking dead, our heroes use an assortment of shovels, cricket bats, and other blunt objects to fend off the zombie menace. Apparently they never read Max Brooks' Zombie Survival Guide! Favorite scenes include Ed and Shaun doing a sing-along of Grandmaster Flash's \\"White Lines\\" with an undead chap and the remarkably choreographed bashing of a zombie all set to Queen's \\"Don't Stop Me Now.\\" Funny stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stupid! Funny! Kinda Scary!","review":"My family and I have a kind of sick love for really, really stupid movies, so we thought we were good to go with this one. But actually, it was very funny, very smart. The basic premise, that the dead are walking and attacking the living is certainly not original, but the reactions of the clueless hero and his slacker sidekick are just wonderful. They argue over which records to use to immobilize the zombies, which I found amusing. But the best is in the end, which I will not give away except to say that for some of the characters, being a zombie isn't much different from being alive...I recommend this movie to all who like zaney humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"This is one of the best zombie-apocalypse films I've ever seen it, and it's surprisingly technically a comedy (although there definitely are some dramatic moments in my opinion).

Also, instead of having a bunch of quickly-sketched characters (the brave guy, the smart-ass guy, the cynical guy, the cowardly guy, etc.) like a lot of horror movies, this one delivers a nice little group of nicely-drawn, multi-faceted characters. And, again, that extra detail doesn't dilute the scares. In fact, the scary and tragic scenes come off as especially scary and tragic because we get to know and like the characters involved in them.

When you think about it why wouldn't zombies be funny, they're slow, stupid, and two English guys with nothing to do are willing to show you every other reason to laugh about it. Don't even try to watch Shaun of the dead if you take everything seriously because it really isn't that type of film. This movie is like one of the classic zombie flicks and the guys who are watching it and saying all the stuff they would do if they were in the movie like if that was me I'd shoot all the zombies save the girl and run. Except those guys are in this film and get interrupted by the zombies while sleeping after a night at the pub.

I understand that it's a comedy about some juvenile delinquents dealing with the zombie apocalypse. I understand that... But they're just too dumb to even be remotely believable! How is this funny? The dialogs, arguments, reactions, behaviors are not of normal human beings. We just wanted these idiots to go ahead and die! We don't really watch British movies but if this is what they offer, it's pretty sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"FANTASTIC MOVIE!!!","review":"to bad i couldnt watch it again since it was in pal format and didnt clearly specify anywhere or give an option for ntsc or pal orders.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I can not for the life of me figure out why people were so impressed with this movie. I had to work extra hard just to stay awake through it. Maybe you need to be British to get the comedy. I'll admit it. I was fooled by the trailer into thinking this was a good comedy movie. I was mislead by others who called this a epic horror movie. Sure it is a comedy movie if you like your comedy as dry as the Sahara desert. Of course it is a horror movie if listening to people covered in cheezy fake blood groan constantly sends chills down your spine. However, I will not mislead you when I say don't waste your money there are much better films out there then this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't believe this got good reviews","review":"Some other negative poster said that if you like British comedy you would like this. Well, I love British comedy (Rowan Atkinson, French & Saunders, Ab Fab, etc.), but I couldn't get thru more than 25 minutes of this stinker. Didn't laugh once; absolutely nothing to compel me to watch it for a 26th minute. I picked this up at the library because it got an 80-some percent fresh rating at RottenTomatoes, which I thought after seeing it just again showed that critics do not view movies the same as real people. But when I came here to warn people to save their money, and saw it had 4 stars over a large number of reviews, I didn't know what to think. I guess you'll have to judge for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way overrated","review":"I cant understand why this film is considered by some to be something special. Granted, we all have our opinions, but if a person is interested in good comedy or crafted zombie films I would not suggest this nonsense. With comedy, their is a difference between funny and stupid, the movie is the latter. As a zombie film, their is no real horror felt, just ugly faces and some splattered about fake blood. Horror and comedy can work together, but not in this concoction. The film may have played better in England, but a good British movie works anywhere. Humor can be a matter of taste, I have to concede that. Watch and snore."},{"rating":"1","title":"What an incredible let down.","review":"Wow!

It is definitely only for zombie-movies fans, which I turned out to be not.On a positive side, there is an actual PLOT (I suspect that most zombie movies don't really have a plot). And, the tension doesn't come from dread and gore but rather from the plot itself. Yes, I laughed couple of times, and felt disgusted another couple of times.I could recommend dozens of comedies which are funnier and dozen of better thrillers to keep you on the edge of your seat.I thought it was a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is a scream!!","review":"I HAD to buy this movie for my boyfriend (from England).

It's not comedy (although it does have scenes of laugh-out-loud humor) and it's not horror, (although the gore in this film is enough to make George Romero wince.) It even slaps you in the face with a little dramatic piece towards the end (which I won't reveal.) This movie is here to poke fun at zombie movies, and also to admire them. \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" works on all levels because it seems to KNOW it's ridiculous.As I said before, this is a \\"FUN MOVIE\\". 'Resident Evil' is a movie that can't decide what it wants to be, because it takes itself seriously.\\"Shaun of the Dead\\", like its title character, does not, and works better because of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very funny movie","review":"This is another of those movies definitely made for adults. It may give your children nightmares, but the point of the movie is not to be scary; it's to be funny, and it is. This movie made me laugh out loud over and over again. It is especially rewarding if you've seen the original Dawn of the Dead, but funny even if you don't get all the references to that cult classic. There are a number of visual gags you may miss the first time you see it because the movie doesn't always call attention to them. Worth buying because this is one you'll probably want to watch more than once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious","review":"I love this comedy.

Out of this list there is a dffinite top 10 of what gets repeatedly watched by the whole family at various times and not always together.Shaun of the Dead is in that Top 10. It is because of that movie that I love playing Left for Dead 1 and 2 and any other video game with zombies. They turned zombie killing into an enjoyable art. This is a true cult classic that will be around for many generations to come. George Romero freaked me out with \\"Barbra they're coming to get you\\" lines. Shaun of the Dead fights back. I am no longer freaked. I fight back and laugh while doing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant zombie flick!","review":"I'm a huge fan of this film.I've seen it numerous times, and I'm sure i'll see it plenty more. It's a really fun film with a unique twist on zombies. It isn't just a survival of a horde massacre, it's genuinely hilarious and well put together.

I think this is a great movie with great humor and great lines."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good british zombie fun!","review":"When I first saw a trailer for this movie, I didn't think it looked great. The humor didn't make any sense to me, and I wasn't a fan of the zombie genre. Well, first of all, the problem with that trailer is that it featured most humor that only someone from britian would understand. The other thing was that I used to be a bit squeemish about gore (I stopped being so squeemish when after seeing \\"Alien\\"). Well, after it left theaters and went to DVD my dad let me watch it. It made me laugh hysterically (especially at the part where Shaun, Liz and Ed are beating the bartender zombie with the pool sticks). After seeing it I became a huge fan of the zombie genre. My next purchase is going to be a 10 inch figure of the superzombie Nemesis from Resident Evil. There was only one flaw with the movie: The accenct that all the actors had made it really hard to understand what they were saying. But, that aside, it was an excellent movie, and one worth 5/5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceeds all expectations","review":"Incredibly enjoyable flick. Simon Pegg has a great performance as the deadbeat, laidback Shaun who suddenly has to become semi-heroic to save himself, his useless roommate, his girlfriend and her roommates. The flick is very gory in spots but I found myself laughing at the blood and gore in the original ways the leads disposed of the various zombies. I'm a big fan of Brit comedy and this did not disappoint. Definitely a DVD to put in the collection!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mislead","review":"I feel as though I was mislead when I bought this DVD. Nowhere did the listing say that this was a \\"HD DVD\\" and when it arrived it was not compatable with my DVD player therefore I can't even watch it.

If you want to be grossed out and be rolling on the floor laughing at the same time, I would recommend any \\"The Evil Dead\\" trilogy, \\"Re-Animator\\", or Peter Jackson's \\"Dead Alive\\" rather than this movie.

Did they all see a different movie then I did? Cause the movie I saw was your typical zombie movie with a TINY bit (and I mean tiny bit) of humor in it. That's it, nothing new, nothing original, nothing great. Below average at best.I've seen the good zombie comedies, Dead Alive, Evil Dead 2, Army of Darkness...this one falls short of all of them by miles.Where's the humor...I mean every now and then we have a scene that should be funny...but the humor never comes out, I don't understand it?

The real crackers here are very sparse or perhaps non-existent - the majority of the film consists of episodes that seem to hint at something funny but leave you wondering \\"Was I supposed to laugh?\\" . It appears to be the type of movie that aims to appeal to \\"mature\\" audiences but instead seems to be capable of impressing only 5-year old kids with obtrusive swearing and cheesy zombie action. I mean, c'mon, when that guy Pete inserts f**k after every word he speaks , is that supposed to actually make you laugh? On a side-note, I expected to see a lot more piss-takes on the original horror classic but there were few. Anyway, I cant see why people like film so much. Maybe because it's different, but even so, it's different in a very bad way. I strongly suggest you avoid this - even the pity that \\"loser\\" Shawn might be able to pull out of you wont save this crap.t"},{"rating":"1","title":"Idiotic, stupid, unimaginative, and lame!","review":"I can't believe there are people who actually like this movie.

I waited a few days and tried again. But it is still, the bad movie that it is.This move \\"tries\\" to be satirical and funny, but instead, it fails at everything possible.No laughs.

It took us yanks to get it right with the new version of \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" This is a scary movie!

The movie is just boring and it's not that funny. There are funny parts through the movie but not enough for it to pass off as a comedy, there also isn't one laugh out moment through the whole movie. Also I really dislike the british accents and their sense of humor is just boring and sometimes confusing.

Gorey in a delightfully silly way, comically scarey and a whole lot of fun. Definitely recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty British Spoof tackles lots of issues","review":"I went into watching this film not knowing too much about it. I was originally expecting a pure comedy, but that's not what it is.While \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" is predominantly a spoof of \\"Dawn of the Dead\\", it does touch on a variety of different topics in a semi-serious way.The title character Shaun is a 29 year old stuck in a dead end job supervising teenage co-workers. He can't seem to get it right with his girlfriend, Liz, and he never goes to visit his mother.What makes this movie hilarious is that it took an apocalyptic event for Shaun to get his life in gear. While that doesn't sound funny, it surely is made funny by Simon Pegg's performance as Shaun.Great dialog, a new twist on a common horror theme, and a little seriousness thrown in make this a great film. I wouldn't take anyone squeemish to go see it, but all violence is made to look obviously fake and is done in a slap-stick manner.Catch this one when you can, it's spectacular!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Hilarious Zombie Movie","review":"Shaun of the Dead is hilarious. And it's a zombie movie.It's not a spoof, it's not a joke. It's an honest to god zombie movie.

All of the characters were really annoying and by the end I wanted all of them to get eaten by zombies. I love comedies, but I just didn't think this was very funny. Shaun and his slob roommate are so dumb that they are unaware the zombie apocalypse is going on until days after it starts when there is a zombie in their yard. How would you be able to miss that, even if you don't watch the news? This could have been more entertaining if the characters were people you could root for instead of irritating slackers with few redeeming qualities and no common sense.

It was occasionally funny, but never rip roaring hilarious like many said it was. Ironically, Romero's Dawn of the Dead (and Raimi's Evil Dead series) had a lot of dark humour in them already, and they're a lot funnier than Shaun is. This film tries way too hard to be funny, and you feel like you almost have to laugh. Sure, there are some chuckles, but the only time I really laughed out loud was when Shaun put on a red bandana, and looked exactly like Christopher Walken from The Deer Hunter. It had to be intentional. It was very funny, but the rest of it was sloppy and not the drop dead (excuse the pun) hilarious film that critics and fans made it out to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"funny good sound","review":"Funny movie.

And it actually some other quality to it other then humor, it actually some good performances esspecialy from the guy who played shaun. And it even has some shcok value too, not much just the guy getting his guts ripped out toward the end, that was crazy, everything else is hilarious. Take it from me this is the only comedy EVER worth watching more then once or even at all. And its really the only zombie movie worth watching too, i mean come on house of the dead? dawn of the dead, 28 days later and nothing happens, the list goes on, THEY ALL SUCK. I give this an 9 out of a 10, the only flaw is its too short, but definetly i will consider buying this if i can get money, and then it would also be the only comedy i own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying subtitles","review":"This will be short seeing as many others have reviewed the film already. The film itself gets five stars from me, just so that is said. BUT this DVD version deserves no more than two. The reason for that is the subtitles which seems to be the version for the hearing impaired (Example: \\"Come on!\\" [Line Ringing][Video game noises][Line continues ringing]). In addition the subtitle text is massively huge and makes this option more of a sour annoyance than anything else. So if you want to watch this film with subtitles, don't buy this version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funniest Zombie Movie!","review":"The Brits are funny anyway and when you mix them up with the living dead you cant stop laughing.

While it does have the gross factor of a zombie movie, it wasn't as bad as I have seen in others. And the movie is so funny too! We both couldn't stop laughing throughout it!

Shaun, who has already been increasingly dissatisfied with his aimless life, rises to the occasion and sets off to rescue his ex-girlfriend (Kate Ashfield) and mother (Penelope Wilton), dragging Ed along for the ride.I enjoyed the film, due to wonderful performances and the funny way that hell on earth so slowly impinges on Shaun's existence. However, I have to admit that it fell short of my expectations, given the acclaim it has received over the years. I was bothered by several scenes in which characters have extended, pointless conversations with each other while in the midst of an attack, but I was won back by the fresh take on a familiar genre and sharp social commentary."},{"rating":"2","title":"'We're surrounded by zombies!!!!

Not to be missed!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny Funny Movie","review":"When I saw this I couldn't stop laughing. It was like Dawn of the Dead mixed with a british comedy like Four Weddings and a Funeral. This movie is a much better zombie movie than that remake of Dawn of the Dead(horrible horrible how could they do Romero like that). Simon Pegg is great as the titled character Shaun whose life goes dull until the undead start coming. Though a comedy this film does have some dramatic points, one includes a spoof of a classic scene from Reservoir Dogs. Nick Frost is really funny as Shaun's friend Ed and the soundtrack is great and has alot of funny moments in it. Romero loved this film so much he asked Pegg and director Edgar Wright to appear in his new film Land of the Dead as zombies. I haven't seen it but heard good things about it so I will get it when it comes out. Until then I will enjoy this good zombie movie.

The outtakes are hilarious. For an aspiring screen-writer, there's a feature under \\"raw-meat\\" that contains footage of simon and edgar going through their \\"flip-chart\\" of ideas, plans, and...irregular drawings. These let us view into their world and see what was on their minds as they spawned such a creative plot and characters. the casting tapes were excellent as well. Watching simon's video diary made me crack up because it showed the informality in structure. it shows how much fun they really had behind the scenes...the atmosphere did not seem stressful for one bit. But my heart goes out to the most creative part of the extras: the plot holes. everything that was left unexplained? explained. simple as that. not to mention, the answers will keep you rolling with laughter. these features are just compliments to an already amazing movie. Buy it today and remember: aim for the head."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Blend of Comedy and Horror","review":"Most movies of the past that have tried to blend comedy and horror have been straight up spoofs; and after hearing the title Shaun of the Dead it is easy to pass this up by dismissing it as one of these.

This is much different from Evil Dead 2 or Army of Darkness where the evil dead things do funny stuff.

Brilliantly written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Brit movie ever!!!","review":"Shaun of the dead comes out on dvd in the uk on september 6th. I saw it at the cinema way back in April which more than makes up for the lack of hellboy which we dont get till 2nd of september.

The real plague is the Hollywood infection that's spreading across the world and turning all movies into dull, predictable garbage that just can't seem to get moving.Shaun of the Dead is lacking in comedic performances. In a movie like this you'd expect the Indian guy in the store to be surprisingly hilarious or the mother or somebody, but nobody was really hilarious. There were a couple of good moments, Shaun going over a fence and it falls down, can't think of anything else, but I'd seen that in previews. Then there's a thick accent you have to deal with and worst of all the style I've seen in every other comedy film. Pathetic. I kept leaving the room to do chores around the house. To think this got rated 4 and a half stars by the time I reviewed it. Shows you how bad movies are."},{"rating":"1","title":"shaun of the dead boring","review":"Wow! For me, the really shocking part about this movie was the thought that people I knew thought this movie was good. It wasn't. It starts out with the promise of being something new and cutely entertaining but then runs out of uniqueness and ends up where all the bad movies go, falling all over itself until the credits. One of the final scenes with the main characters mother clearly shows the movie in a full retreat from it's early promise and now attempting to elicit feelings from us that really seem out of place with what this movie had been doing. Finally, I'll bet that the screenwriter came up with the idea of this movie after he heard his friend Shaun being refered to as \\"Shaun of the dead\\". This movie is all title and no craft. Don't even rent it."},{"rating":"1","title":"shaun of the dead","review":"i thought this movie was going to be better than i expected. but when i watched it, i couldnt really understand half the jokes, they were either talking too fast or too quiet, and the zombie parts were disturbing and unnecessary in this movie. overall, if you like movies that are laugh out loud crazy over the top comedies with violence with tradgedy and drama and romance all squeezed into 1 hour 40 minutes, then this is the movie for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of a kind.","review":"How do you describe a movie like \\"Shaun Of The Dead\\"? Well, that's the hard part, because there really isn't anything else out there like it. The writing is incredibly smart...mixing comedy, horror and even a bit of drama all together so well. it's a movie that can't be classified, as anything other then just a GREAT film. There are moments that make you laugh out loud, followed by, and sometimes mixed with scenes that are genuinely creepy and unsettling. And towards the end, there are some truly touchingly sad moments. I give immense credit to star/co-writer Simon Pegg & director/co-writer Edgar Wright. I just wish there were more movies like \\"Shaun Of The Dead\\" being made these days; ones that are as entertaining and intelligent. Going to the movies would be a lot more fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rabbit Angstrom: The Four Novels","review":"It's great to have the four Rabbit novels as a collection in one book. HOWEVER, the type in this collection is lighter than normal, making it difficult to read and the weight of the printed pages is very flimsy. Had I to do it over again, I would buy the four Rabbit novels individually from used book sellers."},{"rating":"2","title":"When a novel becomes a friend","review":"There is always that sad feeling at the end of a great character-based novel. It's as if you just got to know and love someone and they vanish. This series is spectacular for so many reasons, but I particularly love how well I know Rabbit by now (I'm in the 3rd book), as if he were a friend of many years. Updike does an impressive job of weaving details throughout the entire series that makes the reader understand, and believe."},{"rating":"2","title":"No one writes like Updike","review":"Sadly, John Updike is no longer with us. He leaves behind a very large body of work behind him, though, which is a solid legacy.The 'Rabbit' novels span a lifetime of an ordinary man who is faced with some extraordinary challenges. 'Rabbit Run' is the first in the series, and it ends on a memorable note. It doesn't exactly urge the reader on, but Updike is such a polished writer, he draws you in and you do want to read more about these characters.Highly recommended. These are not exactly a fast read, but very involving and thought-provoking. I urge any serious reader to read the series. And this is a well-priced grouping. I have bought the books as they've come out, but this is a much more economical way to read the novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worn Out Tape - Great Movie","review":"Long ago, my wife and I had one of those Saturday nights when we didn't feel like sleeping. We thought we would watch this boring black-and-white movie to help fall asleep, but instead we enjoyed the movie. When I found it on Amazon, I thought I would give it a try. That was a mistake. When the movie arrived the VHS tape was un-watchable. The movie jumped, skipped and was full of snow. Ended up tossing the movie and the vendor returned my money. Sure wish I could buy this movie in good condition somewhere on modern media."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dock Designs, Second Edition","review":"Way over priced for what you get!

The only problem with it is the fact that there isn't a very good storyline. The story part is good, but there's no variety to it.

BUT, it just may be worth the buy for some New Jack Enthusiasts. Three tracks save this album from hitting the trash cans: \\"Something in your eyes\\", \\"lost in the momment\\" and \\"Above the rim.\\" \\"Something in your eyes\\" is perhaps one of the best R&B New Jack swings songs that never was. It never got the recognition it deserved, but has always stuck with me over the years. \\"Above The Rim\\" actually kinda sucks, but Michael Bivens verse always gets me going and is the only reason I mentioned this song. The ryhmes he spits are off the hook folks in \\"Above The Rim.\\" The song \\"lost in the momment\\" is a little too simple for my taste, but it still manages to drift the listener away like any good R&B track from '95 can. BOTTOM LINE, if you are down with New Jack Swing and mid 90's R&B, this album is a MUST, otherwise, PASS."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame On You Guys","review":"Bell Biv DeVoe half or spin-off of the group New Edition drop fall short with second release. Nothing close to Poison, so don't be surprised. Nothing on here seems to hold my attention either. The only reason I gave it a one star is because of tracks 9 and 10.

I wish we would have purchased better quality batteries, but this one had a high rating, so I went by that information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun way to enhance vocabulary","review":"This book will be instantly appealing to most kids. The pictures are really precious and brightly colored. They did a great job including art from almost all of the Disney animated movies, including the newer Pixar movies to the classics. Because of this I think adults will enjoy this book as well. Each section begins with the letter (both upper and lower case) and then has several pages of pictures with words that begin with that letter. With each word there is a picture, a defintion and then a sentence using the word. Some of the pictures and sentences are really creative! I like that the words include words other than nouns. There are verbs and adjectives as well. You could start this book with your child as early as you like (I don't think it's ever too early to start reading with your child) although the book is rather large and the pages could be easily torn by younger readers. And I think this is a book that a child could enjoy for a very long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing product","review":"Fine tip bristle brush cleans between teeth much better than regular toothbrushes and massages gum gently."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful contemporary account of early California","review":"I first heard about this book in Kevin Starr's California and the American Dream. I have been reading a lot of California History and wanted to dive into this classic of the genre. I have quite enjoyed this book and would recommend it highly to anyone interested in California's early days. It also has a lot to say to the unique qualities of America's character, some of which are not very pleasant.

The cd provided for creating the game is easy to follow, and as long as you follow all the given suggestions it offers, it's a breeze to use. And fun, too! There are so many details that one can personalize for whomever the recipient of this game may be that it's a wonderfully personal gift that one will enjoy for a lifetime.

And what kid DOESN'T like something that's all about him/her?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Make your own opoly","review":"I was expecting a make your own version of Monopoly. The game sent to me did not share enough of the monopoly features, such as railroads, jail, and just visiting squares. The tokens are not made of metal. The pieces that are provided do not resemble houses or hotels. If I knew it had so few features of a monopoly game, There was no cardboard (only paper)provided to make the deeds. I would not have ordered it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!!","review":"We purchased this as a 40th bday gift for a person who has everything. It was a huge hit and we learned so much about our friend's life putting this together. We included pictures of family members, schools, his house, etc. to personalize it further. It definitely took time to put together, but the finished product was amazing! Highly recommend!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Compatible with Macs","review":"I just received this game for Christmas, and it is basically headed for the Goodwill pile. Everyone in my family uses Macs, and this game is only compatible with Windows XP or Vista. There really should be something for Mac users in 2012, or there should be some sort of disclaimer on the front of the box. I'm hoping that people buying this game as a gift will see the negative reviews and think to check the system requirements so that they don't waste their money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Make Your Own Opoly","review":"This turned out to be more time consuming then expected. Also, I could not tell which side of the white adhisive paper was the side to print on & it was very had to separate. I think some mention should be made that there is no money included.

The program only works with bmps, and even then it makes the bmps much, much lower in quality. This is only useful for those of you who want to make some sort of 8 Bit Video Game themed Manapaly (this isn't Monopoly, I figure Manapaly is a nice cheap knockoff name for it. Like Spoder-Man and the i-Pud.)DWhat this offers is simply -minor- customization. Street names (but not the prices), low quality images for the streets and 4 of the 4 corner spaces, 24 cards to divide between \\"Good News\\" and \\"Bad News\\" (yeah, you can't name them yourself), and that's pretty much it.Don't be fooled by the box or the product description.

We just opened the box and, to our dismay, it has pieces missing (the clip art, 20 Monopoly buildings, etc.) Also, the CD that contains the software to make the entire game came completely unpackaged and unprotected inside the box itself. In fact, the unprotected CD was bouncing around inside the box and is (not surprisingly) scratched. What a disappointment. I've already printed the return labels and am sending it back for an entire refund. Shoddy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unpleasantly surprised","review":"I ordered this game to make a board for my dad for his birthday.

I do not recommend this board. I wish there was another way to make a customized board."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Alternative","review":"If you are a true Monopoly lover then, you may be very disappointed in \\"Make-Your-Own-Opoly\\". There are some major differences in the board from the original Parker Brother's game such as the jail and free parking and \\"go to jail\\" have been all changed to loose a turn and roll again and things of that nature. Also, there are no hotels or houses so you were not able to increase land value by developing properties. All in all I found it too far from the concept of the original (or parker brother produced variations) monopoly game to be able to enjoy it as a \\"Monopoly\\" alternative.Other deterrents include that there are only a couple of plain sheets of paper sent with it for your money and property cards to be printed on. One would need to use their own printer paper if they wanted much money at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disapointing","review":"I returned the item because I mistakenly thought it would be essentially the same Monopoly board as I was familiar with.

In the segment on Washington DC, Anthony talks to Jose Andres and has a degustation meal at the Mini Bar with more detail and comments than you will find in this DVD.

Based on reviews here I decided to try the Nylabone Frisbee and I am VERY glad I did. We have had it 4 months with no sign up breaking apart. It flies very well and actually works better then some of the bargain Frisbees I had purchased in the past. The only note of caution I would make about this product is that it will discolor if left in the sun (however that has not effected the performance)."},{"rating":"2","title":"solid","review":"Exactly what I was looking for. I wanted something softer than the plastic discs, but that would still fly well. This will fly much farther than any of those nylon or canvas soft frisbees made for dogs.

Maybe I am spoiled with my Thinkpad warranty support, they actually come to my house and fix the problem (and they don't claim that I voided my warranty by adding more memory or using a non IBM (Lenovo) monitor).

I should have spent a little more to buy these tracks from other Stevie Wonder compilations. These are some of his best songs, and I love listening to them. But a quick listen with my headphones on, and comparing them to samples on Amazon from these same songs in other collections, really brought it home: the sound quality on this particular album is terrible. Tinny, weak, lacking depth.

Personally I think there is too much of the earliest stuff on it that was made before he hit his mature genius. However, it is inexcusable that the recording quality is so dreadful! There are remastered versions of this material available that sound wonderful, and much of this sounds like a transistor radio. Another rip-off by a record label on us. One wonders if the engineers who put this stuff together have any pride at all in their work. I see no evidence of it here!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Songs - Poor Mix","review":"Have the people who re-mixed the songs on this album ever heard the original recordings?

Living For the City, (the begining to this song used to bring shivers, but this is disapointing, no soul here!!) This mix sucks!!!

I personally recomend the often overlooked \\"Music of My Mind\\", the deservedly heralded \\"Innervisions\\", or the underrated \\"Fulfillingness' First Finale\\". (I would also recommend \\"Songs In the Key of Life) but that's two CD's and anyone rich enough to make such a splurge is advised to just get all the albums, preferably on vynil so that you hear what Stevie wanted you to hear and not what some two bit studio engineer ratcheted off after he was done playing with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where is 'Lately\\" gone?","review":"With this one-of-the-best heartbreaking love song of all time absent, you shameless call it this collection \\"definitive\\"?

Stevie Wonder's music remains timeless. 15 number 1 hits!! Plus 6 more that reigned at the top of the charts! Stevie Wonder's genius cannot be squashed into one CD but they did a GREAT job trying. We all may have our favorites, some have been left out BUT 21 Stevie songs is nothing to complain about. If you grew up with his music, this CD will transport you right back to that time, and leave you overjoyed. A time when EVERYBODY knew all the words to EVERY song, because EVERY cut on the album was great. If you were too young, you still won't be able to keep from groovin' to this CD. Invite some friends & family over. Through the burgers on the grill. Pop in this CD. Feet can't help but move, heads will be boppin', as everyone relaxes to Stevie Wonder's heart and soul he put into his music.Also, the CD insert is worth reading.

There's far too much missing--\\"Isn't She Lovely\\" and \\"If You Really Love Me\\" for two--and quite a few songs that really don't belong on a \\"Collection\\" disc (I'd get rid of \\"Hey Love\\" and \\"You Haven't Done Nothin'\\" to start with). Stevie Wonder has always been a lot of fun to listen to, but this disc and its rather arbitrary arrangement and selection of tracks just doesn't cut it. What a shame to have 21 tracks to work with and come up with these selections. . . . who gets paid for coming up with crap like this, anyway, and what are their qualifications? I've always wondered. . . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"The sound quality is terrible","review":"People complain about the selection of songs, but that's debatable. It has a lot of Stevie's best songs on it. The big problem is that we all know what these songs are supposed to sound like and its not how they are on the album. The recording is terrible. I am not very picky about these things. I often don't even notice the things that cause others to complain about sound quality, but it's glaring throughout this album. Just awful and frustrating. I'd avoid this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"GOOD GOD","review":"I WAS SO EXCITED TO FINALLY GET A MIX OF STEVIE WONDER. I LOVE THE OLDIES. THE SONGS ARE GREAT BUT THE SOUND ON THIS CD IS TERRIBLE.

If you're a lover of his music, this CD is the one to have because it includes many great songs that he's done. If you're into more recent stuff that he's put out, then this may not be for you, but if you're like me and love his older, feel good hits (many of which are often featured in a lot of period films and romantic comedies) then you'll love this disc.

While the civil war gave freedom to the slaves,world war 1 settled nothing except for a few border changes, freed Belgian from german occupation,freed poland and led to the communist revolution.

Here's what I did; I bought a box of CD/DVD paper sleeves for about $5, (box of 50's) put each DVD into one, folded back and taped the bottom sides to the back of the sleeve, tore the pocket on the right side where the disc slides into and they all fit nicely into the slot and the DVD's are protective. Each season folded and fit back into the box, just a little more snuggly. Yes it's a pain, but I just wanted to share my solution. It really did work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movies a hit but the dvd holders are poor","review":"I agree with previous reviewers about the holders the dvds come in, they are terrible.

And most overweight women get lots of attention from men who like overweight women. I do feel judged by society and ostracized at times, but I've never been lonely...unless by choice. Don't read this book. Get some Douglas Adams."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable and fun!","review":"I would recommend this book. It is chicklit at it's finest. Good summer book to read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Count me in with the other lovers","review":"This chick lit type book about weight and all the issues it brings was a wonderful read.Our main character, who has a fairly serious weight issue tries for and successfully gets on a reality show about weight loss.Although this book is obviously written with lots and lots of humour, you still manage to feel the pain this character is in. EVERYTHING she does is about her weight.The storyline is well written if a little cutesy at times and we genuinely like Kat.Of course this story also touches a chord with all women - because it deals with body image and more specifically romance and worldview of weight.My only slight negative would be that Kat is written a little too wishy-washy. This, in my opinion, is often the case in chick lit. I would have wanted her to pick her battles a little better.Still, this novel about love, weight, weight and oh yeah! weight ..... is a great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"More than a little predictable...","review":"Again this is one of those novels that I couldn't wait to read. I was hoping it would give me a happy large woman to cheer for...but instead it gave me a sullen whiner who seemed to snip at everyone. I couldn't rally behind her. I didn't really like her. The story line was actually pretty cool. Almost like The Biggest Loser meets Surreal Life meets Survivor...but it fell apart and ended up becoming unbelievable as the girl everyone loves to hate ends up being with the smarmy host who we're supposed to believe is a really nice guy...it becomes a sickeningly sweet over the top unbelievable romance instead of something real with heart and humor. Sorry this one just isn't worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Thing","review":"I was impressed by this book - the wittiness, the subject matter in general (reality television), and the characters. Although Kat was a size 18 woman, I didn't feel as though the book portrayed either fat or thin women unfairly. In fact, Kat had a major attitude problem at times and the reality show did help to show a different side of her. The romance(s) turned out exactly as I'd anticipated and I have a feeling that Nick would have been Nick even if Kat was a size 4. The book was fun, and definitely worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"A little lacking","review":"I thought that this book seemed to try to fit too closely to the \\"cookie cutter\\" chick lit formula.Overweight girl, reality tv, gorgeous guy.....While it was an easy read, it was not, in my opinion worth the time. I think it could have been done much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute!!","review":"I liked this book alot. It was a cute story and quick reading. Didn't get bored one bit, I recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I feel dumber for having read this book","review":"I picked up this book in a hurry when I was looking for some light reading to de-stress. I wish I would have been more discriminating. I'm as much of a fan of \\"mindless\\" books as the next person. Unfortunately, there is nothing redeeming about this book. It is neither clever nor entertaining. This book is devoid of originality; it's simply a bad copy of a Jennifer Weiner novel.The poorly-developed characters are nothing but the same formula players we see time and time again. The main character is unlikeable and all of the \\"heavy\\" women portrayed in the book are portrayed as being stupid and/or unstable. Most importantly, the story is predictable and borders on being downright stupid. The only reason that this book merited a second star was that I was able to stand to finish it - merely because I paid money for the book and thought I should. Had I borrowed this book, I wouldn't have bothered. I could predict what would happen anyway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Read","review":"It was nice to read a \\"fat girl\\" book where the main character doesn't end up stick thin at the end. I enjoyed the inside look at a reality show. Kat is a realistic woman with insecurities, a temper, and dreams. She expresses many thoughts and emotions that overweight women struggle with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps you guessing","review":"I found The Next Big Thing enjoyable to read. Many of the reviewers gave low ratings based on their dislike of the main character...but I get the feeling that you aren't really supposed to like her at first. The web of lies she spins and gets trapped in prompted me to think, \\"stupid, stupid!\\" throughout much of the book but I did root for her.There was at least one thing I found ridiculously unrealistic and I don't know how the author even got it past the editor. There is NO WAY a 5' 10\\" girl who weighs 176 pounds would get on a weight loss show. That's not even overweight...unless she had absolutely no muscle and it was all fat...which I would find hard to believe.The story features several jaw-dropping twists that made me, as cliche as it sounds, unwilling to put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable first novel","review":"I really, really enjoyed this first novel. It's light and fluffy fare for a relaxing day when you want to escape from your problems. The best books take you away from your world and let you enjoy another's life, and this did just that. Kat, as a main character, was very sharp and often funny. She didn't get on my nerves, and wasn't your typical whiney female protagnist, which I liked. I often feel female protagonists in these types of books can be too self-absorbed. That was not the case with Kat.The overweight characters were very realistic and the dialogue and the scenary fit very well. The pace kept moving at an admirable speed and I never got bored or lost interest. I also chuckled to myself and even outloud at various points."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is what it is.","review":"Nothing fancy here it does what it is designed for.

It's about time!!","review":"Although I was more of a fan of Seasons 2 and 3, I am so happy to see that Gomer Pyle USMC is FINALLY being released on DVD!! My VHS tapes are so worn from the constant playing! The first Season is not to be missed though. Gomer coming right out of Mayberry RFD/Andy Griffith and straight into the Marines to face the sweet tender hearted quiet Sgt. Carter (not!). On a side note, Frank Sutton was truly an incredible powerful actor, and his early death in 1971 from a heart attack was unfortunate. He was in many movies prior to Gomer...too many to mention. One of my all time favorite actors. I can't wait until this December!!! I will be rush ordering this one for sure!! Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best comedies ever","review":"After waiting for the first season of this series to be released for years,it was just as hilarious as I remembered. Jim Nabors was sensational as Gomer Pyle, but the real key to the success of the show was the brilliant performance given by Frank Sutton as Sgt. Carter. His was one of a small group of contenders for the funniest performance given by an actor in TV sitcom history. With current TV nothing but reality garbage, American Idol dribble and endless news and talk shows ad-nauseum, what a pleasure it is to pop a show like this in the DVD player and enjoy something truly original, creative and funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Set In B&W with Nabors Commentaries and Extras!","review":"This season has never looked better. Beautifully mastered. Nice sound and a C-ration of extras to complete it.I really enjoyed the Jim Nabors commentaries (on the pilot and TAGS spinoff). Any GOMER PYLE fan will love the set, which comes in new slimline cases with episode synopses written on the back of each case."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like collecting the first season of old favorite shows","review":"and Gomer is no exception. Such a stupid show, but oh so much fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, Excellent, Excellent","review":"Being 46 yrs old, I used to watch this show when I was 4 yrs old & up. I hadn't seen an episode even as a rerun since the early 70's and all I can say is that it wasn't a SURPRISE, SURPRISE, SURPRISE at all at how good this show still is! From the packaging to the picture and sound quality it has been great! My children ages six and four, my wife and I watched an average of 2 episodes a night until we had seen all 5 discs and there wasn't a flaw in any disc. THIS SHOW LIKE MANY SITCOMS FROM THAT ERA PROVES YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE DIRTY, NASTY OR VULGAR TO BE FUNNY! I am now going to order season 2. A must for families looking for wholesome family friendly entertainment!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Comedy","review":"Gomer Pyle was one of my favorite shows growing up. The good,clean,funny scripts of these shows is what made it a classic during its time. Unlike all the garbage that is on tv now, I would rather watch all of my favorites from the past that brings back alot of fond memories of when television was fun to watch. Frank Sutton was one of my favorite characters--his mannerism was priceless. Another show I would like to see released on DVD is \\"Dennis The Menace\\" with Jay North. Bring back all of the classics from the past!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!!","review":"The first season is wonderful, not as good as the remaining ones, but still excellent. Certainly as good as the first season of Andy Griffith, when Andy was still trying to be funny. Look at the writers and directors of Gomer, right from TAGS. The quality is superb and the 3 commentaries only make the whole package that much better. Gomer is truly a unique character in television history, and if you think this is just a show with stupid country hicks acting silly, you really missed the point. As Jim Nabors says in his commentary, Gomer is a Christ-like figure who always looks for the best in people. I can't wait for the next 4 seasons!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gomer Pyle, U.S.M.C.","review":"I purchased this as a Christmas gift request. I saw Gomer when he first came out and we watched him on Christmas. Itbrought back very fond memories.

The protagonists are unjustly accused of witchcraft, sorcery, and apostasy. The characters, including the villains are well drawn; the writing is excellent. The story is hard to put down. Even when facing certain death, the love of the main characters transcends the surrounding world of intolerance and hatred. The novel is possibly one of the most romantic stories I have ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I enjoyed reading about a different perspective on weight challenge. It made me realize that everyone should strive to be as healthy as they can be and this may mean you won't be a size 4 because your body is not built that way. I would recommend the book to people who are having issues with weight control."},{"rating":"2","title":"I found the book easy to read and a pleasure.","review":"Unlike some books in this category, I found the writing easy to read.

I just love the 'theme for an imaginary western' - Leslie West et al have done killer covers of this. Here is the original, and its awful beyond redemption. Jack was a major element of Cream and I love some of their songs. But not these songs. Most of the album sounds like very early Genesis in their formative years but played to a regular rythym, with chinzy, cliched keyboards, and with the bass player on steriods. I like early Genesis but hated this so much I cant play it more than once. Poor production doesnt help. Sounds flat.Well I guess if you like jazz you might like this but if you dont you wont. Hear it somehwere before you buy (you cant on Amazon...)I am just stunned that all the other reviewers gave this five stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Real Bruce","review":"I was not surprised to see that, of the 14 customer reviews to date for this album, there were 12 5 stars and 2 4 star ratings. This masterpiece is one of the top 10 rock albums of all time. \\"Never Tell Your Mother...\\" sets the standard for brass in popular music, \\"Theme for An Imaginary Western\\" is one of the most melodic, heartfelt works on record, \\"Tickets to Waterfalls\\" - even the song name is enchanting, and the \\"Ministry of Bag\\" standout for me although this is one of the very rare records where every tune is a winner. The Best of the Best (although you cannot overlook Harmony Row)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jack Bruce- Song for a Taylor","review":"One of the best albums very few ever heard. How did this one drop off the radar. Fabulously tight band performances, a wide variety of styles served up, and just all around terrific songwriting. Of course, some great singing from one of the most talented , but forgotten vocalists of England or anywhere else for that matter. His bass playing always astonishes. This first solo album of the legendary lead vocalist/ bassist of Cream should have been an instant classic, but alas...Now we can all rediscover this jem released FINALLY on CD. I wore out my vinyl copy so long ago. Bruce never again attained such heights."},{"rating":"2","title":"TO MUCH CANDIE AIN'T GOOD FOR YA!!","review":"Ms. Hampton you did it again!

Kiley is the man...all I can say is he was putting on them girls made me wanna holla at him.(HEHE) Ms. Hampton is the author of the year.!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps you on your toes","review":"This book was really a trip. The shenanigans of these guys really had my laughing quite a bit, and rooting for them to keep their life and lifestyle going. Kiley seemed like he had it all together, and had things under control, but women were ultimately his down fall. Kareem he was something else, I was sad to see him turn out the way he did. Behind Kiley, Quincy was the most level headed of the group. The way he went out was the wackness, but you couldn't help but be proud of him for taking one for the team. I have to say I saw the outcome with Candi coming a mile away. As smart as Kiley was he was so stupid to have walked right into that trap. This book really had it all, a good story line, hot sex scenes, and a great bond between the characters. I can't wait to read the sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"How Can I Trust","review":"I started reading this book two days ago and couldn't put it down.

Keep up the good work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ms. Hampton Has Done It Again","review":"Okay Two's Enough Three's a Crowd was too good, but How Can I Be Down was GREAT TO THE THIRD POWER.This book made me feel like I wanted to cry,laugh and explode at the same time. I knew something was up with Candi \\"it's a hood thing you just know\\" I guess Kiley was too busy craving Candi's body along with her beauty which kept him from thinking. I recommend this book to anyone who has truly lived in the hood or just knew someone from the hood.

It's a very nice little gift book."},{"rating":"2","title":"not about politics, about Turkish culture and its future!","review":"The reviews of this book are turning into a political rant forum, so I will forgo any lengthy diatribes about Kurds, Turkish army, terrorism etc. It's a short, compelling book that does not get mired in the politics. Besides, most people in Turkey care more about a Galatasaray-Fenerbahce game than Ocalan's ravings or the influence of the military.Kinzer is not shallow. He is not patronizing. His conclusions are spot on. I bet he has had more fun living in Turkey than pretty much anyone who has written a review of this book here, and is able to pen his experiences and share his insights with intelligence and wit, critical while being upbeat and optimistic, like a good trusted friend would. That's all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly written and shallow.","review":"So poorly written I have trouble believing Kinzer was a NYT correspondent. The book is thin on interesting detail about modern day Turkey. It largely consists of a running, numbingly repetitive complaint by Kinzer about how the political & military elite don't allow true democracy in Turkey. True or not he has little more to say, and he delivers this message in the first pages... and in the conclusion to nearly every hectoring, preachy chapter. Compare this book to Kinzer's fellow correspondent, Elaine Sciolino's well-written recent book on Iran (\\"Persian Mirrors: The Elusive Face of Iran\\") -- I felt learned a great deal about modern life and politics in Iran; next to nothing about modern life or politics in Turkey. Skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent coverage of many aspects of modern Turkey, written iin a thoughtful, insightful way.","review":"The reporter's use of language is direct, relatively objective and insightful. I was looking for just such a coverage of Turkey today, with all its potential and warts. Well done!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Look at Turkey","review":"I was interested in understanding a little bit about Turkey both because of the role it has played in the current Iraqi war and also because my officemate at work is Turkish. The author can be a little repetitive at times, but overall I found the book pretty interesting. Talking to my officemate I also believe that the author has done a fairly good job of accurately capturing the country of Turkey. I also liked the style of mixing in less formal, more personal short chapters with the more historical and formal chapters. I would recommend this book to anyone trying to better understand the country of Turkey."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Turkey of a Book!","review":"CRESCENT AND STAR is a fun, informative read. Turkey is becoming a popular destination for Westerners (unless they're Greek and mad about Cyprus) and this book shows us why.Turkey has been in the middle of things politically and culturally for so long, and yet the country and its people are pretty much a mystery to most Americans. Mention Turkey, and images from MIDNIGHT EXPRESS spring to mind. But every person I know who has visited has had great things to say: the people are hospitable, it's cheap, there's a lot to do and see, and the food is superb.It's also important for us to understand our allies, and Turkey has been courageous enough to stand with the US even though it's been criticized for doing so. Turkey also shows us how Islam and secular society can co-exist. This is important now, as Muslims become a stronger political voice, in the US and in Europe."},{"rating":"2","title":"frank and well written","review":"A smart American journalist spends some years in Turkey and speaks frankly about what he saw and felt. The result is an interesting, readable and informative book with some imperfections: The tone is often too prescriptive and many assertions are questionable. This is not serious scholarship. Rather, it is more like having a long conversation with an informed Turkophile. That's why I liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Turkey","review":"I read this book seeking to learn more about Turkey and accomplished my goal. The book conveys insights from the author's experience as well as his analysis of the country. He revealed a side of Turkey which was not always positive."},{"rating":"1","title":"another book on Turkey","review":"The book is an interesting attempt to formulate some impressions and views about present day Turkey. Besides a few wellknown cultural and popular findings, the author's views on Turkey's foreign policy, the role of the military, Ataturk's reforms and Kemalism, on Kurdish problem, Armenian realities and on Turkish-Greek relations are rather shallow.Statements such as Turkey's \\"political and psychological underdevelopment\\" (Page:24), Turkish \\"National Security Council\\" is like the \\"Iranian Mollahs' Council of Guardians\\" (Page:17),\\"Turks are victims of Devlet\\" (PP:12,26-28 and 145) are erroneous and misleading.As regards the \\"politics\\" recommended by the author; these are not at all adequate to Turkish realities and to Turkish historical background.Kinzer is of course not the only writer who after having lived in a country for four years feels quite confident and entitled to recommend major policy changes or cultural shifts towards new horizons. This is an unfortunate mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Sided look At Historical events","review":"Stephen Kinzer has spent time in Turkey and does report of truths on some political issues, but goes into a world of some historical points that he believes to be true. He has no evidence in some of these points he makes. He is not a historian and can not accurately claim some of these events he mentions. On the political side of things he may have an opinion, but opinions are just that. Let us remember that Stephen Kinzer was there as a journalist and certain points journalists make are not always clear and concise."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"If u want to learn about Turkey,u should read this book.its very helpful to understanding Turkey.I strongly recommend that book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth reading for Turkish people","review":"Having lived in Turkey makes a person too much get accustomed to Turkish way of thinking. This is, of course, not a good thing, if you are wondering about how Turkey can become more civilized, or join European Union.This book gives a fresh perspective on Turkey by an outsider who understands Turkish culture and mentality. Its points are well made, writing style is crisp, and occational prose is delightful. Perhaps most importantly, the author's points on Turkish state, democracy, and Ataturk are worth thinking for any Turkish person.I would recommend you to see what a US person thinks when he goes to live in Turkey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crescent and Star - a find read","review":"For anyone who is interested in present day Turkey this is a book that is very informative and interestingly told.

It's oversimplified at best, although I have to say it does make a good attempt to describe the people of Turkey.It's only when talking about the goverment and politics where Mr. Kinzer fails us. He fails to mention HOW a coutry with the most genocides in recent memory, and a military that runs things can be a true democracy. Conviniently skipping the genocides of Greeks, Armenians and Kurds jumping from the present to an ancient past that in no way connects to the current inhabitants in the area (who came from central Asia and in no way are associated with the history sang by Homer in the Iliad), he would have us think that history can be re-written.History can help explain the present, because history shapes the present.Very dissapointing.Maybe Mr. Kinzer can make another attempt after he studies the history of the region."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great overview!","review":"I read this book while in Turkey and finished it in a day. It might be the one source for a quick look at the history of this great nation and people. The author who spent a great amount of time in Turkey wrote about the founding of the nation, its hero Attaturk, and its rich history. While it is very general and simple, it is a great quick snapshot into Turkey. This book is great for a traveler and a good starter for a more serious student of Turkey."},{"rating":"1","title":"The author tries too hard to satisfy both sides","review":"The author tries too hard to satisfy both sides. Each time he criticises something, you know that a few paragraphs or pages later he will be delivering praises. That kind of book would have been natural by a Turkey author who knows that he or she may need to deal with that state and that army the rest of his or her life, but I was expecting a much more clear book from a foreigner who had the opportunity to see many abuses in the country. He also adopts a paternal attitude trying \\"to show\\" to the Turks the road toward development and democracy. Besides, the chapters are a kind of long newspapers articles, rather than real chapters on the recent history of Turkey. I missed at least a chapter about Turkey's economy, since there was none. Of course, the book teaches about Turkey... since I assume that most readers (like me) will know very little from Turkey before reading the book, but I was expecting much more from the book when I decided to buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Balance, please","review":"This book should be balanced by a careful reading of Speros Vryonis'The Turkish State and History: Clio Meets the Grey Wolf.Kinzer, as one other reviewer pointed out, is not an historian, and he has left out here the serious history of oppression against minorities, including the Armenians, Greeks, Jewish people, and (more recently), the Kurds.Unfortunately, this book lionizes Kemal Ataturk, while failing to analyze his serious historical shortcomings. It's unfortunate, because Ataturk set in motion notions that Turkey is the source of all civilization, history and language, and racist theories that, in Vryonis' words, amount to the Turkification of Gobineau.Whatever it is, this book does not honestly assess the essence of Turkey, its history, or its future prospects.--Alyssa A. Lappen"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good summary of Turkisk Politics","review":"Kinzer has very nice style in telling the stories, he is great, book covers mostly political issues in Turkey, almost from start of the republic to current. He introduces a lot of his opinions how or what Turkey should do, which takes considerable space in the book but that is part of the style. Individual stories are spread into major theme of the book. He has the grasp of the conditions with some bias but still nice to read some opinions. It is not about history, culture or the turkish land but politics, local"},{"rating":"2","title":"Deeper than you'd think","review":"I have to chime in with the majority and say that this was a great book. I like how she keeps the reader honestly guessing about who Ginger will end up with, and I also like the working-class aspect of this novel. Maybe I'm just a little weary of glamour-lit since I can't identify with expensive lifestyles.The author really makes the reader identify with Ginger and her struggle about what it really means to be a woman, and she also makes you wonder if she's gonna sell out her feminist integrity by becoming a mere sex object.

This is clearly an amatuer try at chick-lit. Her plot has holes in it and relies heavily on cliches. I would like to say that its entertaining, but mostly I was frustrated with writing. The concept of the book sounds hilarious, so its too bad. There are so many good books out there. Don't waste your time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"turgid, awful","review":"I so much wanted to like this book.

In Angel Trumpet, the second book of her Civil War mystery series, author Ann McMillan sets the opening scene in gruesome technicolor. Her meticulous research and medical knowledge of the period are skillfully woven into the fabric of this story. Her two protagonists provide an interesting contrast: Narcissa Powers, a young white widow, is still growing in her self-awareness and abilities, while Judah Daniel, a free black herbalist and conjure woman, is a strong and fascinating character. The unlikely duo works together to make sense of the carnage that faced John Berton, master of Goochland Plantation, when he rode home in 1861 for a respite from the war. A captivating read that leaves one wanting more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like all good Disney flicks, fun for kid and parent alike.","review":"With all the subtle and not so subtle tie-ins to old nursery rymes, songs and stories, this book grabs the older crowd maybe even more securely than the kids - and they love it, too. Completely hysterical and deviously fresh, this is probably one of the best produced books for a 15 minute reading you will ever find. The exciting and angular illustrations are from a craftsman who has a knack for odd but appropriate compositions. The text is gut wrenchingly funny, even after the 100th read.Guaranteed to be the most frequently requested bed-time story because kids love the renderings and the mischief throughout. Kudos to the producing and publishing teams."},{"rating":"2","title":"4th graders love Palatini","review":"Though Palatini's books are billed as read-alouds for a younger audience, my fourth graders can't get enough! The books are simple enough for even my lowest readers to tackle independently, yet clever enough that my high readers choose them as well. The humor appeals to all ages. In fact, there are many things my kids \\"get\\" that younger children don't. My students recommend Palatini books to each other all the time, and I can't keep them on my shelves. I am on my third copy of Piggie Pie and currently need to replace my worn-out copy of Moosetache. They've simply been \\"read to death\\".

I really enjoyed \\"Kavalier and Clay\\", but this book was dull and flat, and I did not care about any of the characters. The only thing I found to like was that one of the chapters was told from the parrot's point of view, but in the end the book just wasn't satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Final Solution? - The Final Straw","review":"This is the first book that I have read by Michael Chabon and based upon my assessment of this book will not buy another. Although technically a fine writer, the plot of the book is threadbare, many of the characters shallow and the flow of the narrative spasmodic. The chief difficulty I have wih this novel is the palpable presence of the author on virtually every page, leaving me with the impression that the theme of the book was not to tell a story but rather to provide evidence of the author's ambition and literary prowess. Conan Doyle must have rolled over in his grave upon publication of this literary brick!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Holmes' fans beware","review":"\\"The Final Solution\\" is a self-indulgent and not very intelligent piece of writing. The title is blatantly misleading: this is not a story of detection. Worse, the Sherlock Holmes character is simply not believable. None of this will matter to those who are admirers of Chabon's writing style (I am not one of them), but those who enjoyed (for instance) Nicholas Meyer's \\"Seven Per-Cent Solution\\" will be sorely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not worth the time","review":"This is \\"exquisite,\\" as several other reviewers have said. It is skillfully done, it is clever. It is deliberately old fashioned.But I think a reader needs to ask: why write such a book? If this is entertaining, then so is the whimsy and cuteness in \\"Murder, She Wrote\\" or the delicate fake nostalgia in Merchant and Ivory films.Late in his life, someone asked Ezra Pound to write a preface to his first book of poems, published when he was young. The early book was called \\"A lume spento\\" -- the poems were pretentious, precious, and old fashioned. Pound knew it, can said they were \\"stale cream puffs.\\" I know that Chabon writes in several different styles, but I am not going to read any of his other books. Why? Because if he thinks something this artificial and concocted is entertaining, then I do not trust his taste. He can't possibly be a writer for the twenty-first century."},{"rating":"1","title":"hopefully, this will be his final book","review":"this is a terrible book. the plot is thin, the characters are unbelievable, the story never goes anywhere, and it is hard to read. lots of words between the noun and the verb and stupid sentence structures. skip it. dgs"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Old Man...","review":"The Final Solution finds Sherlock Holmes (never named, but always referred to as \\"the old man\\") an 89-year-old recluse who lives in the country and cares for nothing anymore except bee-keeping. Then, one day, a young boy with a parrot on his shoulder strolls into his life.This is a very modest story: the safety of the free world does not rest on the outcome. It does not rely on previous Sherlock Holmes literature: Dr. Watson and Lestrade are not here; we do not find out what happened to the old man since his retirement. Chabon's style is so distinctive, we always are aware that we are reading him and not Arthur Conan Doyle; but, as Chabon is one of my favourite writers, that is not a bad thing. However, he is true to the character: I am sure that he must have read all of the real Holmes stories and gives us valuable insight into his mind at the end of his life. This is an entertaining read and would interest any fan of Sherlock Holmes or Michael Chabon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Close, but Not Quite","review":"I love Michael Chabon's life and work. Working at the creative fringe of multiple genres, and succeeding at most of them. I can think of few contemporary authors who would write a new Sherlock Holmes mystery with Holmes as a crotchety 89-year-old beekeeper. It's a delightful concept.But that doesn't mean that the book is equally delightful. The writing is fine, and certainly consistent with Chabon's work elsewhere. The images of an aging Holmes are memorable. But the mystery is pedestrian, and the ah-hah moment of its solution lacks the thrill that Sir Arthur Conan Doyle would have evoked. It is a worthy read, but falls short of truly emulating the best of Doyle and of Holmes."},{"rating":"2","title":"A little difficult to follow","review":"I loved all of the descriptive phrasing, but I often felt confused about the story line. It always felt incomplete. I guess I am just one of those people who needs more answers, instead of more questions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Novella","review":"My first Chabon book and well worth the wait. The story, the characters, the pacing, the deftness of the writing - a true master at work. And when you put together the meaning the numbers the parrot spouts, chilling. This is everything a short novel is meant to be. I'd be hard pressed to identify what could actually be better about this book.If you've heard about Chabon, or his writing, I'd recommend getting this book first. In 131 pages, you'll know if you want to read more of his works or not. I, for one, will be reading them all."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"Especially if you were hoping, like I was, for the same quality of character development and plot whimsy as Kavalier and Clay. Judging by the other reviews, I guess one either likes this book a lot, or not very much at all.These would be great characters if they had a chance to develop. Instead, they show up out of nowhere, even Holmes, and act out of motivations that are more redolent of pop psychology than anything else. Perhaps it is better as a screenplay than a book.The story has such a great historical and literary backdrop and I was very hopeful in the first few pages. However, it was a book I finished only out of grim determination than any deep interest in the plot or characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mute Boy, A Lost German Speaking Parrot, somethings afoot","review":"Michael Chabon has taken a simple story, much in the tone and feeling of Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, and developed it around a title that can only be described as a \\"double entendre\\" of the most precarious type. ACD was well known for his marvelous descriptions of decorum and the wit of his characters. Chabon has name his most nervous character-Paniker, and calls his Holmes character-the old man, and beekeeper.Chabon's Holmes is almost like a walking obituary. His manners are of a different age (which he, Holmes, acknowledges), as are his many mended clothes. But from time to time, that bright light of genius shows, and the great man is back. Chabon's description of Holmes trying to communicate with the boy, is worth the whole story. It is so much like an old man trying to remember back 80 years, to a time that seems almost medieval.The solution, to say the least, is elementary."},{"rating":"1","title":"So Wanted To Love It!","review":"What a disappointment. This book misses every mark it tries to make. A humdrum read and puny mystery unworthy of N. Drew let alone S. Holmes. Plodded through it on the hope that the final pages would make it all worthwhile; they didn't. If you are looking for an engrossing read and crackerjack mystery, don't choose this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"I was excited to read this book as I am a huge fan of 'The Amazing Adventures of ...' I was so disappointed in this book. For such a brief book it took me a long time to read because it was much like force feeding yourself something you just hate. I would love to say that all the work resulted in some sort of reward in the end but it did not. The writing style is unnecessary for this brief story and the 'detection' part does not hold its weight. Unfortunately, I have to advise against reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overwrought","review":"I'm a big Chabon fan and have read most if not all of his stuff. I loved Mysteries of Pittsburg and liked Adventures of Cavalier and Clay a lot. \\"The Final Solution\\" seems more deserving of a New Yorker article than a full publication. He's playing with the detective genre and formalizing his style - I get it. But to me it's like a jazz musician blowing fast and furious non-stop, showing us his chops but forgetting to give us some dynamics and contrast.Too much wordsmithing and fancy-pants writing here for me. I actually got 99 pages of the total 120 somehing pages, and I put it down. Ouch. It seems like Chabon needs to just let it flow sometimes and get out of his own head. The critics seem to love it, but this was totally unsatisfying for me.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This is my 3rd Chabon novel, and this was such a disappointment. This book is so short that there is no time for development of nearly every aspect of the story. I would definitely stick with Chabon's other novels or read a real Sherlock Holmes mystery."},{"rating":"1","title":"I just didn't get it","review":"What's with all these paragraph-long sentences that must be read three times to be understood? Where's all the character development? I thought the relationship between the old man and the boy promised a rich, intriguing story, but I could never get on board. I concur with the one-star reviewer who compared the book to a jazz musician drowning you with a blizzard of technique with no texture, emotion, or dynamics. Just too much. I really think the writing got in the way of a potentially great story."},{"rating":"1","title":"ILLINOIS RAILROAD MUSEUM","review":"I find that this film spends more time with interviews than showing equipment.

The patterns are extremely readable, and easy to follow. The stitches used should be within the range of most beginning knitters. The only downside is that many of the yarns recommended are pricey or hard to find. I couldn't find one of the yarns so I had to use two different yarns (knitting them both at once) to achieve gauge, at a cost of $110! For a beginning knitter, whose stitching may not yet be where it will be later, making this type of investment may not be worth it. However, I was an advanced beginner and pretty confident of my needlework, so it was fine for me (and the jacket *was* stunning!). The patterns are absolutely top notch, and the author provides many, many options for embellishing and customizing to achieve a truly one-of-a-kind treasure!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why Fight It?","review":"I don't think there was any suspence in the story at all, it was just a matter of time until Jane/Jesse/Jill and Rob gave into the heat burning between them.

There was no basis for these two getting together after the reality show was taped. And that whole thing about the \\"real\\" princess.... dumb dumb dumb.

It is clear, precise and very helpful in providing many algorithms and much needed explanations on calculating ephemerides.

By extension, Meeus then refers to the user to other works of even greater accuracy for the calculation of the position of the sun. However, this is a minor point.

Maybe because I am not a practitioner of High Magick, or because I don't know much about Crowley, I had some trouble following it; the plot often meandered away and left us with random ramblings about Magickal theory. That said, it was a most fascinating book, if only to (as Crowley says in his foreward) get a grip on his \\"diseased imagination.\\" It is obvious the man was a misogynist of the first degree, but for all that it is my understanding he is responsible to a large degree to bringing Magick back into the public eye, so I cannot find it in myself to dislike him overly much. Give it a try if you are interested in High (Ceremonial) Magick and/or Crowley."},{"rating":"2","title":"a great book","review":"this book cronicles all of the great special effects masters from lon chaney to rick baker. even though it is out of print if you find it get it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work","review":"Sadly, this didn't work for my stubborn Persian cat.

She instead chooses the bathtub, closet, etc. We changed to this litter and an uncovered litterbox. There has been some improvement, possibly from the switch to an uncovered box, but this litter has certainly not fixed the problem or been a quick fix. The switch to this litter simply has not prevented our cat from using other places around the apartment to relieve herself.It scoops well, but so do litters that cost half as much (or less)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work","review":"I ordered this product because my vet said it should work.

So we ordered up this product and it's been three weeks now and not a single land mine outside of the litter pail.On top of the bliss of not having to scrub the carpet any longer this litter clumps really well.

No matter what we tried nothing worked. It got to the point where we were considering sending her to an animal shelter because cleaning up after her was becoming a real burden for my wife and I. We are both 71 and this was becoming a problem. From the moment we used Cat Attract, Weezer returned to the litter box and has ever since.

The support bars on my old chairs kept falling out, so I was looking for chairs to match an existing table. These chairs not only look like they were bought originally for my table, but the support bars are straighter than my original chairs. They seem like they will not loosen so easily.

There were moments when I thought the story was really going to take off. I wanted it to, I believed it would, but it never did.

I am sure that war is hell to go through, that people miss their families, that the Army doesn't always take care of their own, etc, etc. Having said that, this account is really a lot more about having a lame time in Vietnam than \\"Flying the Cobra Attack Helicopter in Vietnam\\". I was really looking for more operational info, mission sorties, weapon load outs, hair raising tales, things like that. The author seemed to overlook most of that though.

Needless to say, this requires some skills and experience. It is not a beginner's model.Tamiya's green plastic is very tough. Even with many thin parts, none broke during construction. The dimensional precision is also quite good, and little trimming is necessary. Overall, the experience is a lot more pleasant than with Revell models of comparable complexity.Amazon did not mention that this gun can be optionally mounted onTamiya 1/35 German Hanomag Sdkfz 251/1.of the same 1/35 series.

Too bad he can't write to save his life. The chronology of the book is confused. The sentence stucture is often awful, and what is often meant to be a telling detail instead comes off as contrived. I am shocked that he has written for publications like the Economist.Though the writing is poor, in Bradley's defense, this book is at least somewhat balanced, and he clearly has a real affection for the culture and some of the people he met there.

Just dreadful. Pass it up and either read a good book or watch a decent documentary.My favorite part is when the German infantry are \\"pulled back leaving the Artillery out in front\\", or wait- maybe it was the fire hose flamethrowers, or no, the backwards west wall obstacles, or.. or..It has ONE good monent when they are walking in the woods- then they ruin it by having the guys stand around talking next to the front line foxholes. Oh the pain...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad acting and contrived plot","review":"Compared to the best I have seen, i.e. SPR and Band of Brothers, this dog barks. The acting is atrocious and the plot so contrived it begs ridicule. And the guy that plays the Major should stick to country music and leave the acting to people a bit less wooden.I know the Hurtgen Forest was a horrendous episode in WWII but this film cannot possibly do the brave US Soldiers who actually fought there justice.Save your money, buy Band of Brothers or The Lost Battalion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Done","review":"I am always very happy to see something created that is well done. In the same caliber as Saving Private Ryan, this movie takes you too the decisions made by a reluctant participant who eventually has to deal with his overall responsibility to himself, his country, and his men. Well done, Bravo"},{"rating":"2","title":"Realistic military film...must see","review":"This is one of the most realistic military films that I have personally seen. More so, in my opinion, than Saving Private Ryan, which was a theater release from a premier director and received much more attention as a result. This film depicts the grittiness of war and portrays the hopeless situation in which soldiers can find themselves when confronted with a seemingly unmoveable enemy. No happy, feel good emotions at the end of this flick. Just the hopelessness that soldiers feel in tough situations like the Hurtigen Forest campaign. It portrays one of the reasons why soldiers perform in battle. Simply just to stay alive. For military film buffs, this is a must see film."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Cold Of War","review":"I, too, think it's better than Saving Private Ryan, for the simple fact that it only addresses the issue of \\"the pain of war\\", not about \\"earning the rights\\". After reading Stephen Ambrose's \\"Citizen Soldier\\", where I first learnt the details of the Hurtigen Forest, I was just too moved by this movie. One can feel the temperature, the horrid condition, the \\"bright shining lies\\", the \\"zing\\" of the bullets hitting nearby and the NCO war of the Hurtigen come-onslaught. Sometimes it forces you to think why didn't Manning just commit an actual Section 8, why did men fight under such hopeless condition and not desert? I'm sorry, I never did think it's because it earned anyone any rights. I guess Ambrose did put it rather well, too, that, these men fight because they don't want to lose that precious self."},{"rating":"2","title":"This one's a keeper.","review":"I was flipping through channels a few years ago and caught the last two-thirds of this movie on HBO. It was fantastic. No punches were pulled in it's delivery of realistic, wartime violence. The storyline was original and stayed true to itself, the cinematography was inventive (chilling at times), and the movie easily keeps the viewer entertained. I bought it. And I'm happy that I did."},{"rating":"1","title":"When the Movie Faded....","review":"I'm a WWII war movie, game, novel buff. I bought this sight-unseen because of my interest in such subject matter and because I was told it was a good film. I've never seen such egregious over acting in my life. At one point, a green soldier (forgot his name) used a flamethrower (a weapon normally used by elites) to burn some German 88LL crews.. he kept on screaming through out the entire melee in such an over dramatic manner that I literally was laughing... and I don't think I was supposed to. The characters were shallow. DO NOT buy this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"junk- the vets deserve better","review":"There are only one or two moments in the film worth watching.Like walking through the woods . They they get to the front line and stand upright outside a foxhole and talk.(...) Accuracy is at a minimum, historically its baffleing how they got this story from what really happened, and all in all it is very clear producers and directors had no clue what combat in WW2 was like.Don't rate it high in honor of the vets that fought there. They would be discusted that it was done so poorly. While lip servce wa spaid to the vets, and they did talk to a few of them I am told, obviously they did not listen. I assume it was to keep the cost down. Which is a shame as most fo the problems could have been avoided if they had competant advisors on set that the director listened to. Go watch \\" a walk in the sun' instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time.","review":"I thought this was gonna be atleast half way entertaining but man was I wrong.

On the whole it is not an entertaing movie much less one that gets your attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the?!","review":"People seem to say this movie is so realistic. The storyline was so weak. The main character kept cussing to make it sound realistic. It sounds stupid. They were trying too hard.It had some decent pyrotechnics, but thats about it. The story was terrible. It was so offbeat and didn't flow smoothly.What really bugged my about this made-for-TV movie was they spent a lot of money on making it realistic, they should have spent money on a better script.Is the main character wearing lipstick???"},{"rating":"1","title":"I doubt if my grandfather's generation acted like this movie","review":"Dwight Yoakum is in it I think, other than that, this is a poor movie overall. The battle in the forest I am sure, could have some redeeming qualities, but it doesn't show it too much. It seems like it is geared towards generation X with the soldiers wearing their hats backwards and the parts with the cigarette smoking to explicit to say here.One of the few movies that I have rented that I felt like turning off and watching was a chore and a bore.Private Ryan is an epic. This movie isn't as good as Hamburger Hill which I would give 4 stars. It isn't even as good as \\"Tora, Tora, Tora.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie! Bad timing!","review":"This was a great WWII movie overshadowed by Saving Private Ryan. It shows that war is not always heroic and clean. The good don't always live. The cowards don't receive poetic justice in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best epics of all time.","review":"Because of being HBO and a non-theater release \\"When Trumpets Fade\\" never got the praise it should of. After seeing this movie I fell in love with it. It is very different but equally as good as Private Ryan. I'd say better then Platoon, The Deer Hunter, and many more. If you havn't seen, SEE IT. I cried at the end. Be aware veiwers, contains graphic and very disturbing human carnage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad show.............!!!!!!!!","review":"One of the worst WWII movies I've seen.

It did show an interesting perspective of three soldiers cut off from American lines during the the bloody battle of the Hurtigen Forest, but not one to long be remembered."},{"rating":"1","title":"When Trumpets are Out of Tune","review":"Although the subject matter is interesting (Hurtgen Forest 44'), the film is weak. Ron Eldard does a good job in the lead role, but all of the other primary actors are poor. This is especially true Dwight Yokum who plays a sterotypical callous and ruthless battalion CO. Of course there is the angst ridden company CO and the cowardly platoon commander. The treatment of the Germans in the film is deplorable and in fact there are only handful of shots featuring German infantry. As far as simulating the actual battle, this film is a stinker. The Americans bunch up in attack like on a Sunday stroll and the Germans are able to foil an entire battalion attack with a single 88mm gun with no infantry support! If you want a good \\"realistic\\" war movie, buy Saving Private Ryan, Stalingrad, Tora!Tora!Tora!, The Iron Cross, or the Battle of Britain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trumpets fade ... hopefully","review":"This is not a movie: It's a succession of clips stitched together. I don't know if this editing is the one decided by the director but the result is exceptionally bad. For instance, we see the battalion attacking German positions and taking much of a beating. The sequence after we see the survivors of the attack lying and moaning. Where are they? What has happened? Have they made it? After a while, we understand that the attack was a failure but we never saw the fall-back order and the retreat. The whole movie is like that: There is no scenario, no tenure, nothing interesting in the end. Quite upsetting when you're getting used to higher movie making standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of better war movies ever made","review":"Maybe my mistake was that I watched this after having been obsessed with Band of Brothers for the past month, watching the series all the way through 3 times and watching some episodes 4 times. When Trumpets Fade is very poor in comparison. The battle scenes weren't terrible, but the plot is poor, the acting is fairly weak, the scenery is average, and although I don't remember ever noticing the music in a movie before, the music in this gave it a very low budget feel, and I found myself checking the DVD setup for a way to play the movie without the accompanying music. Whoever made the decision on the music for this film had to have been an amature, because at times it was worse than a '70's porn movie. I am sort of a war movie buff, and if you are one of those you should probably rent this, but I cant help feeling like it was sort fo a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a Very Bad Movie","review":"I had high hopes for this movie and I could not have been more disappointed. It had neither plot nor character development. The jokes were few and far between and most of them were mean-spirited jabs at Japanese culture. Bill Murray seemed to be either bored or just doing his lounge lizzard act during the movie. Even my wife though this was a pointless waste of time. Great idea that next left the batter's box."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot like the TV series Combat","review":"I loved this movie. It's anti-war, anti-authority, anti-officers.Super bloody with realistic battle gore. The action is as good as Saving Private Ryan. I really liked Ron Eldrad in the lead role. He reminded me of the Vic Morrow character in the old Combat series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hurtgen Hell!","review":"This is a war movie I had seen once on t.v. a long time ago. It's a very good WWII tale of the lunacy of the battle in the Hurtgen Forest. The Army took horrendous casualties there, only to come to an end due to the \\"Battle of the Bulge\\" which would require these troops to hold the northern part of the Bulge.

There was an additional sheet of material stuck in the manual about troubleshooting so I wonder if this is a common problem. I called Hitachi and they told me I had to pay to have it shipped to them in order to get it fixed. I decided to return the item and get a paslode instead. The paslodes have their flaws, but work much better than this hitachi. The finish of the gun is better than the paslode, the gas chamber is better designed, as is, the nail catch and case, but it just didn't work at all.

Someone unfamiliar with Ercilla's poem would not realize they are only buying part one.

Unfortunately, it was not really repackaged for a more general and sophisticated audience. So there's a lot of space wasted with reminders that, for example, Greek society was very different from ours or that we shouldn't dismiss Marx because of Lenin and Stalin. There are also annoying chatty asides, that feel like the kind of lecture tool required to grab the attention of uninterested first years. Despite all this, it's a useful survey with some good introductory information, it's just a bit painful to read.Additionally, it seems that Stevenson's Christian background completely muddles that chapter and infects the rest of the book.The two Haberman chapters are actually quite good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the greatest, but not the worst either.","review":"This book is ok if you are using it to review for the test after having used another more in-depth book (sybex or the like).

The book left out important details that will be on the exam, had an above average number of errors, poor questions, and surprisingly, included a lot of needless information that won't be on the exam. For example, the troubleshooting chapter had very general, obvious, tips rather than recommending a certain cable tester for a sample situation, which is what will be on the test, or what is the problem if a DVM gives a certain reading? Another example, the 5 Microsoft troubleshooting steps should be listed, rather than just mentioned in one paragraph. I could go on...I would recommend the IDG books for main study and the \\"Nutshell\\" (Which do have the info you'll need in a concise format) books for review.

Even with such high expectations, I was awe-struck by the philosophical and scientific implications that genetic engineering can pose in so many directions at such an infinitesimal discovery (like the molecular structure of a rare transponase) and change the world!

You can often really appreciate good writing when you hear it spoken by a good reader. This came off as very uninspired. Does this author know synonyms for \\"said\\"?

All the characters spoke like an article in a medical journal, not realistic at all, with the exception of Black characters, who threw in an occasional \\"Hey man\\" or \\"You know what I'm sayin\\". That brings me to another problem with the book: it was stereotypical. The evil German villian with the scar, the Italian mobsters, etc. Most people's reviews say they were let down at the end, but for me, I was just happy it was over( I had to read it for school)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The prose is stilted and character development lacking.","review":"This was the first (and last) book that I will read from Robin Cook. If his bedside manner is as stilted and pedantic as is his novel, no wonder he is writing for a living. The potential was there for a keep-me-awake-at-night page turner: characters with promise, hair-raising-it-could-happen plot, some bad guys, some good guys, an exotic setting, all fallen to ruin for lack of talent.

The ending seems unappropriately unfinished. The ending is self explanitory, but there are too many story lines in the book are left hanging in the end.

However, just as I was thinking \\"this a GREAT BOOK\\", the author abandons the story. There was no resolution to the action packed body.

It's not a cliffhanger, just a solid brick wall.Thumbs down"},{"rating":"2","title":"Chromosome 6","review":"To start with this is the first book I've ever read in the past 15 years. Those who love forensics and medical experimentation will surely love this book. In general you don't need to be a medical expert to be able to follow thesense of the story with all it's medical terms here and there. I am not a medical expert at all. The only thing which I have to criticise is that at times there are so many characters thrown in the story all at once that you start to lose count of who is who. Apart from that the novel is very well presented."},{"rating":"1","title":"A strangely written story...","review":"I had a hard time keeping up with the plot of \\"Chromosome 6.\\" This story about biotech experimentation mingled with the mafia seems to drag on and on in places with sub-plots that have no impact or meaning in the end. Robin Cook spends a lot of time in the story developing certain characters that again have no significance in the \\"big picture.\\" He also teases the readers with the possibility of romance and relationships between two sets of heros/heroines, but never delivers. Toward the last 50 - 75 pages, the story really picks up and promises a \\"bang\\" of an ending, but the final pages fizzle out if you ask me. I was disappointed; Robin Cook is capable of much better work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many loose ends!","review":"First of all, the scientific terminology was very difficult, unless you are a docter and since Cook wrote the book for common readers, that was a mistake on his part. Second, the book ended rather abrubtly... and too many loose ends were unsolved. The more Cook writes, the worst his novels are getting. Maybe he should stick to medical practice instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"So so at best","review":"I'll skip my disappointment in the ending. Obviously, I am not alone.

Would highly recommend it for an long weekend drive. Will keep you in suspense."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Robin Cook's Best","review":"The premise of this book was most intriguing but the character development was poor. The main character seemed almost like a rehash of characters found in previous novels by Cook. The scientific details were fascinating and obviously a lot of research went into these details. The geographic descriptions were also quite vivid but the ending was most abrupt and extremely poorly written. This could either be the fault of the author who lost interest by the last chapter or else the editor was overzealous and did a hatchet job on it. Either way, it was most disappointing. If you feel a need to read it, buy a used copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool and hot at the same time","review":"In this fast-paced medical thriller, Cook develops two parallel and intersecting plots about scientists in Equatorial Guinea who are frantically exploring the ethics of genetic engineering, and medical examiners in New York who are stubbornly (and against all odds) determining the cause of death of a mysterious mobster-corpse. I found Cook's characters well-developed, his plot original, and his narrative both humorous and suspenseful. Although I am generally not a fan of authors who reuse characters (how often can once-in-a-lifetime adventures happen to one medical examiner?), I loved this book and recommend it to any fan of medical suspense. So far, this is my favorite Robin Cook book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exciting story, poor ending","review":"This is the only Robin Cook book that I have read so far. I found it to be very interesting and exciting. The medical stuff wasn't too deep that an ordinary person couldn't at least understand it to a certain extent. Plus there is a glossary of terms at the back of the book. But...the beef that I have with it, is the poor ending. I was getting so excited during the last third of the book, but the ending was so abrupt, it was like getting the wind knocked out of you. It left a lot of questions up in the air. Maybe he left it open for a part 2, I don't know. But I do wish we could know what happened with GenSys and the research facility in Cogo. Also, what happens to the Bonobos? What about Kevin, Melanie and Candace? So many questions left unanswered."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moronic Characters, dull undeveloped plot","review":"This is the first and last Cook novel I will read. Although the idea is an interesting one, I could not think of a worst way to develop it. The characters were completely unrealistic. I found that I could not relate to any of them.

Find another read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cooks starts quite well but still cannot find an ending.","review":"In Chromosome 6 Robin Cook sets a great scene, builds both characters and suspense but as usual comes up with a lame ending.

Of course, nothing this procedurally complicated or morally questionable comes cheap, so only the most affluent can afford the procedure. Not surprisingly, several members of the mafia become clients of the biotech firm offering this service.I enjoyed the book, as well as the world travels, and meeting the bonobos monkeys. The end of the book is exciting, but after the climax the reader is left wondering what will eventually happen to the main characters.

It has a very interesting premise, but the writing does not live up to the promise. Many of the major characters are one-dimensional and totally unsympathetic, to the point that I simply did not care what happened in one of the two major story-lines. Stereo-types are used in place of character development, and verge on the offensive. Logic takes a holiday, as characters miss the obvious and do not possess knowledge that they should. Loose ends abound, with potentially major plot-twists simply evaporating with no residue left behind.

I loved the characters, especially Stapleton. The mix of the Mob and medical scenarios involving transplants kept my attention thoughout. I enjoyed this read so much that I am currently reading Contagion because the characters here were introduced in that work. I can see the possibility of a sequel because of the inevitable ending.

Cook's verbose, pointless descriptions, his banal, clumsy dialogue, and his generally tactless, maladroit writing makes reading this book a complete waste of time. The story? It doesn't matter because Cook's ineptitude as a writer completely overshadows any merits it may have. If you consider yourself intelligent, you should not even open this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stunningly bad. Run, run from this book!","review":"Robin Cook's novel of genetic manipulation which creates a race of proto-human simians is laughable. My congratulations, however, go to him for apparently creating one of these creatures himself, as Chromosome 6 appears to have been edited by one of these self-same bonobo apes!This novel is tripe- absurd, unbelieveable characters (in particular the female characters assisting Kevin at the complex in Africa), dialogue that is beyond clumsy, the most howlingly bad, stereotypical mafiosi imaginable- I fail to see how any editor worth his salt wouldn't be forced to ask for an extensive rewrite.That is, of course, unless he were a genetically engineered chimp editing with a sharpened flint.

I, an avid runner, found this book to be a pretty horrible tribute to the greatest distance runner in the last 25 years.

This book on the otherhand basically skips over that saying \\"Haile won this, got the world record...or Haile lost this, and all of Ethiopia was angry at him.\\" It doesn't go into any detail though.

When I finally finished and went to sleep I lay there wishing there was more. I was so drawn in that I could have read all night long. Some people have left negative reviews on this book. I think you have to be willing to let your mind work to draw you in to this book. Some people are not willing to invest themselves in a book in that way. For those that are willing, it is a unforgetable book well worth the investment. It will take you hours to read but a part of it will stay with you forever.

If you want to read about the fanatically far-gone preying on the innocent, your newspaper's close at hand and less expensive.

I must echo the request of others: Oprah, please suggest something uplifting, filled with joy, inspiring to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Proof that shameless imitation sells books.","review":"Regardless of textual merits, and regardless of compelling story, the author it seems has abandoned the concept of originality in favor of something much more unbecoming. She should simply subtitle her story a homage to Flannery O'Connor's \\"Wise Blood.\\" Mortification with trash in shoes and with barbed wire on the body has been done before by O'Connor; the impact of Protestant fundamentalism on people either unable or unwilling to think things through honestly and faithfully has been done before by O'Connor. This current incarnation of O'Connor's themes does not speak well of the author--or the publisher."},{"rating":"1","title":"mundane repetition","review":"The mundane repetition of ridiculous medieval religious practices in a 20th century American landscape did not work for me. I did keep reading, hoping for the development of the main characters, which had the potential of being interesting and valid literary characters. Unfortunately this never happened. The ending was as ridiculous as the rest of the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Washed in the Blood","review":"You get caught up in Ninah's plight pretty quickly. You begin to understand her upsidedown world. Yes, there is a literary way to interpret this book, but read it for the sheer pleasure of getting to know people who do not share your view of God, whose views of God are so extreme as to seem barbaric or savage, certainly primitive. But they are as human as you or I, have the same dilemmas, pettiness, moral failings. A beautiful, beautiful book, and a great, great read. Oprah got it right this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the hype","review":"I was disappointed with the book. I never gained the perception that Ninah was undergoing a great spiritual awakening. The portrayal of this extreme fundamentalism was frightening."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculous","review":"It seemed like the author was trying way too hard to make this book \\"deep\\" and \\"spiritual\\", but I found myself laughing the whole time. The characters were silly and unbelievable, and the part where James and Ninah got it on in the prayer room was crap--I didn't believe it for a second and still can't believe the author fed us this and so many people just ate it up. Come on, this was a cliched and stereotypical book that had absolutely no emotional impact on me whatsoever. The only thing this book made me think about was why just because Oprah recommends a book, people will read it and praise it, even if it is contrived and silly."},{"rating":"1","title":"nasty, just nasty","review":"if it was the author's intent to disgust me, then she was successful. i put off reading this book, and now i know why. i think the author's intent was to come up with a story to make us rethink our value systems/religious beliefs...but she did it so immaturely...concentrating on the bizarre punishments to feel jesus's pain. let's take the basic same events, and set the story in a normal child's life...one who isn't in a cult-like religion...still have her struggle with her morality...and i think you have a much better story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing special","review":"What's all the fuss about? I thought this was a very flimsy story barely held together by it's thin and implausible premise. The writer's tone comes across as overly conscious of her attempts to portray Southern attitudes, personalities, and religious beliefs and contradictions. The ending was almost laughable and left me wondering why I bothered sticking with the book to get to it. I know someone is bound to try to illuminate the \\"deeper meaning\\" of the conclusion, but let's face it, there's nothing deep about this novel. It's packaged to look sophisticated, but it's extremely simplistic and banal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just glad I didn't purchase it...","review":"I did not like this book at all. My friend lent it to me, and I am overjoyed by the fact that I didn't spend my money on it. There was much too much offensive (to me, at least) content in the book. I don't advise anyone 12 or younger to read this. I have read more graphicly detailed books, such as The Invisible Circus, by jenifer egan, which contained the \\"offensive\\" content, but still had a great deal of content. Rapture had zip content, if you ask me. Yes, the character sketches were excellent, the description was good, but the book lacked something special that makes a book worthy of excessive praise. It just didn't 'click' with me like other books, like Invisible Circus or The Oath by Frank Peretti did. Definitely not worth another read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oprah, what is wrong with you???","review":"OK, Oprah, I have now plodded through about 4 of your book choice recommendations and I must say I'm worried about you. \\"Rapture...\\" is just another in a long line of depressing victimization books. This one, however, was award-winning in its use of contrived and imagined sadistic punishments in a religious cult group. I can't imagine anyone spending creative energy thinking up these unbelievably grotesque images. Further, I'm truly astounded that Oprah Winfrey actually promotes the selling of this nonsense.Is the author still alive after writing this bit of tripe....I would have had to blow my brains out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very interesting story","review":"This book is pretty good! I was not interested in it after I found out it was about a \\"cult\\" but it was not what I thought. I enjoyed it and only give it 4 stars because a few parts were slow. This girl goes through a lot growing up in this religious community. Lots of twists and turns you will find interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very enjoyable book with a very likeable central character","review":"One of Ninah's greatest revelations is when she realizes that those who lie the most at Fire and Brimstone are the ones who claim to be the most pious, and those that tell the truth like Nanna are considered \\"sinners\\" and need to be redeemed. Nanna is really the spiritual leader at Fire & Brimstone, and certainly the wisest, but the patriarchal Grandpa Herman could never acknowledge this. A very enjoyable book with a very likeable central character in Ninah."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book was a real page turner.","review":"I found this book to be a real page turner from start to finish. Not only did the Fire and Brimstone so called religion anger me, but what the grandfather did about Nina's baby angered me. The book was about a girl who grew up in a religious cult got pregnant. The Grandpa was in control of the whole sect and decided to take his own actions on anyone who sinned against his rules, well Nina's pregnancy didn't help and led to the suicide of the father of the child. This book had a very joyful ending, but I don't think enough time was spent on the ending and on the outcomes. Over all I would recommend this book to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring story about a simple girl who triumphs","review":"It took me less than 2 days to devour this wonderful book (a record for a working mom). I found Ninah to be a tremendously empathetic character. Who cannot relate to being in a situation that we know is wrong but about which we have no power to change? Despite her youth and the tragedy of James' death, Ninah triumphs. The story was well developed and the characters were as real as my family. This was one of the best books I've read this year. It was a feel good book that I will read again"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful book great for ANYONE!","review":"I'm 14 years old and I read this book last winter. I finished it in a bout 4 days. I sould hardly put it down. The way Nina is so attached to James and her hurt. Sheri Reynolds did a GREAT job expressing the emotions of Nina. So tragic, you can't wait to see what will happen next! I also reccomend Bitterroot Landing by Sheri Reynolds, it's a little out there, but it's a good book. If you read the Rapture of Canaan, you'll be hooked!! I recomend you buy this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just didnt like it.","review":"I didn't like this book. It was very well written, but in the end I was disappointed. In order to like a book, and its characters and its story, I have to believe what I am reading. If the storyline has me perplexed, because the characters are doing things that would not be within the normal parameters of the plot and theme, I scratch my head. If this was truly a community of religious people, following their leaders rules and regulations no matter how ridiculous or abusive, than the events would have ever taken place. You have to suspend disbelief and I don't like doing that. Ninah and James would have NEVER been aloud to be alone, never. Not for Prayer time, quiet time or hammer time. Grandpa Herman, while not the smartest man alive, would have been worldly enough to know the brains of young adults, no matter who they were. Now I know it's a work of fiction, and it \\"could have\\" happened, but something deep down in me kept doubting it and it ruined the book for me all together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting read, but disappointing ending...","review":"This is the first book by Sheri Reynolds that I have read and I picked it up on a whim because a woman passing by me mentioned to her friend that she loved it. Although the metaphors and symbolism are entertaining, \\"The Rapture Of Canaan\\" did not leave me spell bound. The tale of a Christian cult somewhere in the Deep South with a typical evil minister/grandfather and the star crossed lovers Ninah and James was interesting enough but to be honest with you, I never really grew to care about these characters. When I came to the last page knowing that there was an afterword I was relieved because I thought the afterword would contain more about what happened. The ending left no sense of closure for me...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very satisfying at all.","review":"I'm a pretty diverse reader, so I decided to give this one a go. It started out somewhat interesting, but then just sort of made me keep saying, \\"Okay...what's the point here?\\" I really like Ninah, the main character, but I keep waiting for her to break free from the chains of this commune she lives in. I guess the ending is somewhat a symbol of her doing this, but I closed the book wondering, \\"why did I read this?\\" I grew bored with a lot of the goings on in this community and found many of the \\"punishments\\" just ridiculous. I'm pretty open when it comes to accepting different religions, but this was just way out there for me. Ninah's relationship with her Nanna was the neatest one in the book. I'm glad I'm finished...now I can move on to something more fulfilling."},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened here?","review":"I found the premise of this book to be quite unbelievable...but maybe I'm just a little too Roman Catholic. I did not identify with a single character and was frankly a little disgusted with the main character at the end. Only 17, she made the most un-wise choices I think a 10 year old would have handled the situation better. I would have quit reading without another thought about the story but had to complete it for my book club."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book bites","review":"This book was horrible. It was the first Oprah book I ever read and now I am totally turned off to her books. The book was BORING. I did finish it tho, just to see if something interesting would happen. Nothing did."},{"rating":"1","title":"RAPTURE OF CANAAN","review":"I do not want people to confuse this book with actual facts from the bible. The tribulation itself will only be for seven years. The thousand year reign will occur after that when Christ returns for yet a third time to destroy the devil and reign on the earth for a thousand years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rapture of Canaan is an excellent novel","review":"I first read The Rapture of Canaan about a year at the suggestion of a teacher. I fell in love with it right away. I just finished rereading it, and it is such a good book. The part where Ninah and James are working on the chicken coop and Ninah says something about \\"why build up the foundation when the building is already standing?\\", is a metaphor to the relationship between Ninah and James. I would recommend this book to anyone, especially 17-20-somethings like myself. It is a beautiful story with unforgettable characters and happenings. Anyone interested in human relationships, religion, and even mob behavior (the church turns into a mob or even a cult of sorts) will find this story fascinating."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing..","review":"I am in an American lit. class and had to read this book among many others from the Oprah Book Club. This one was my absolute favorite! I laughed and cried throughout it. I can relate to Ninah and feel for her, she reminds me of myself! I always like it when I can read a novel and begin to understand things about myself and my actions and that I am not the only person who thinks and acts that way. Ninah is truely a liberating charachter!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Setting","review":"I've always been intrigued by small religious communities: the Amish, the Mennonites, etc. who seemingly live in their own time and space. The author does a great job in this book with setting the scene. While reading this book, I too was walking around the compound of The Church of Fire and Brimstone and God's Almighty Baptizing Wind. I was very angry at whoever wrote the description on the back of the novel however, as they gave away events in the story that don't happen until well into half the novel. Even so, I enjoyed the story of Ninah and was rooting for her the whole way through."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE RAPTURE OF CANAAN","review":"I found this book to be a page turner. The author gives a chilling account of life under oppressive patriarchal rule in a small religious community in the South. The characters were richly developed and complex. The writing was beautiful, crisp and direct. The opening paragraphs read like pure poetry. The story features the life of, Ninah, a girl coming of age in this strict, often bizarre fundamentalist sect. Her story unfolds in a tantalizing sometimes tragic way. However, she uses her inner strength to triumph in the only way she knows how. I highly recommend this interesting and thought provoking book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! Words can not explain!","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read! Thank you Oprah!! What can you say? I totally related to this story, questioning my own religion early on, I can relate to Ninah. It is scary that people could follow a leader that blindly. It gave me hope that one person could have a say in changing that. Everyone who has ever questioned there religion should read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Believeabe, fascinating and though provoking!","review":"I have no doubt that cults exist in every state in the union. Many people make the mistake of confusing charisma for leadership potential. This book explores the dynamics within the cult so that the reader is left with more understanding for the cult members' behaviors. Surely, no one having read this book could be so judgemental of those actions or unaware of the incredible strength and intelligence required to walk away from it -- especially if one had grown up in the cult and never developed any perspective of the world outside that cult's power"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read.","review":"I too could not put this one down. This book is a story everyone can learn something from. I found it an extremely moving story."},{"rating":"2","title":"So true to life!","review":"I read this book in two days. I just couldn't put it down. When I was younger my family was involved in a church with many similarities to the one in The Rapture of Canaan. That helped to make the book so believable for me. I loved the ending, and the lessons the characters learn along the way. Thigs like this really do take place, and it is wonderful that Sheri Reynolds decided to bring it to our attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Done","review":"I greatly enjoyed this novel.

I reccomend this book to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow...this book is really good!","review":"This is probably going to be one of my top 10 most favorite books. I loved every single part of the book. The ending was soooooo great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ambitious","review":"This is an ambitious novel in that it deals with religious belief within a self contained Christian community where belief is at the core of people's lives. The story is told from the point of view of a girl coming of age who is assailed by doubts, but for whom belief still has a strong hold. It is to Reynold's credit that even though I personally lack religious belief, I still found all the characters credible and the novel interesting. As a prose stylist, Reynolds sometimes leaves something to be desired, being too heavy handed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great! Hated the ending tho","review":"What a great book! I couldn't wait to find out what happens to Ninah and her child, but when I got to the end, I was disappointed. That's why only 4 stars. But it made me feel so many emotions and really care about the characters. Truly a great book."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you must have it then buy it used.","review":"Please don't beleive the hype! Just because it is an OPRAH pick does not mean it is superb. This book is mediocre at best. I don't know where to begin. Like other reviewers the first few pages were interesting and then ...nothing! Dialogue, dialogue, and more dialogue without in depth description or anything else! After 40 odd pages the story doesn't move much. You could literally start in the begginning and open the second half of the book and still know exactly what was going on. The end was a dud! There were NO twists and turns in the plot. The reader already knows that the protagonists will be punished for their \\"sins\\" because it has been pounded into his/her head for 200 pages! This book is all quantity and no quality! No wonder the book is selling for ONE cent used on Amazon. Because those who have read it practically want to give the sh*t away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only because Oprah picked it.","review":"I found little interesting or compelling within this book. Aside from Reynolds's final declaration of thanks for freedom and independence, I found most of the content offensive and appaling, not because it was blatently sexual or masocisitic, but because the story lacked origionality, the characters lacked depth, and the the narative lacked any kind of hook to keep me interested."},{"rating":"1","title":"the only good thing - it was a fast read...","review":"This has to be one of the most unbelieveable and ignorant stories that i have ever read. All that Reynolds does is pile on more and more punishment schemes and eccentric behavior from Grandfather Herman. She does little to offer up either a reality or any kind of explanation as to why the characters act as they do. It could have been an interesting story to tell if there was some sort of realism or insight into these characters. Reynold comes off as completely ignorant as she creates this far-fetched community of religious zealouts, it would have served her message and novel better if she would have made it a bit more realistic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very good up to a point.","review":"I read past the half-way point with interest and amazement that people who call themselves Christian can be so dumb and gullible as to follow a \\"religious\\" leader such as Grandpa Herman in this story. I know there are cults where people follow a leader, without exploring the Word of God for themselves, but it's really painful to read about them.I gave up when the girl got dunked for being pregnant. Just couldn't read anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was really disappointed with this purchase. It was nothing like I expected it to be. In fairness, I shouldn't say its not a good book...my expectations were just much higher. I was hoping for something really \\"moving\\" & something that would re-ignite my spiritual fire~ but this fell way flat for me. :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth reading","review":"It is entirely possible (and biblical, most importantly) to yearn for something all the while, trusting the Lord for His provision of it in His time, if He wills. This was a refreshing book about the true heart of a woman created by God, one who feels deeply. It encouraged me to ache over lost things, desired things, missed things.The author comes from her own heartache of a broken engagement in her past and knows how to be raw and real before the Lord."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snooze bar sets off alarm / So does setting alarm and time","review":"The unit will run on the included 9 volt battery. BUT the unit sent will sound when you hit the \\"light/snooze\\" button. This means you CANNOT pack it in a duffle or suitcase as anything touching that bar causes it go off. The \\"alarm\\" also chirps every time you hit the HR or MIN button to set the time or alarm which is aggravating. And it does all this even if the alarm is set to off. A minor problem for a truck driver perhaps but a deal breaker for this reviewer who needs to pack it in luggage. It is neat that the clock works on either 12 volts or the included 9 volt battery; but the mentioned design \\"feature\\" will mean you need to pull the battery out before packing. AND if you don't want alarm to sound when you hit snooze or when you set the time or alarm, pass this clock by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works - I think when it wants to","review":"I like it and like the sound however I don't know when it will work.

I tried calling the Audiovox customer service and they were very rude and worthless. They would not listen or give me any troubleshooting help. They told me they would only help me with the problem if I sent them $93. After much frustration I told the customer service supervisor that I would write a review warning people about this product.

We charged the second one and carried it with us to the hospital for our 4 year old to watch while we were visiting with a family member. Shortly after Simba met up with Pumba and Timone (about 45 minutes for those who aren't familiar with the Lion King) the screen started getting lines across it and locking up. Then the picture went dead and so did the sound. Needless to say, I returned that one without any hassle from the people at Target. I would not buy another one. I hope everyone else has better luck with theirs."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT BUY","review":"I checked with Consumer Reports Magazine and they gave Audiovox protable DVD players an excellent review. We took our new player on a trip to California. We drove 12 hours and the picture, sound etc. was fabulous.

They won't work on the player until they recieve the $168. I called to find out what was wrong with the player and they said they wouldn't know until a technician looked at it. I just about lost it at that point.You have to realize I have only had the player for less than 6 months, but the warranty is for only 90 days. That isn't very long for a warranty. I'm very disappointed with Audiovox and their services.I have told them to ship the player back to me unrepaired.

However, it broke & the problems were the same (flashing screen, etc).We tried to return it to Target, but it had been more than 90 days, so now I am stuck with a $100 repair charge from Audiovox for a DVD player that will MOST LIKELY break again.

The worst of all is the video production and camera movements.

The level of incompetence is hard to beleive and La Scala has reached a new low in its undistinguished recent history. The Orchestra sounds very good, but Alagna is uncomfortable as Radames, with a voice inadequate for the role, although he does try. Urmana is somewhat better, but it isn't enough.

The first half or so is about the history of the katana as well as a brief history of Japan itself. The rest of the book it seems are frame by frame kata movements. Obata Sensei doesn't recommend trying to learn Shinkendo from a book, and he clearly states that early in this book, so anything you draw from this in terms of movements, shouldn't be set in stone in your mind. Use them more as a guideline to prepare yourself for the true movements you'll learn from a Sensei.p.s.

The two narratives happen at the same time but only cross paths at two points. Yet both narrators are on paths of self-discovery, deeply affected by the death of a poet, known to each, who becomes the catalyst for both.Along the way, the city and some of its recipes moves the tale forward. The cooking was a delight.

A cute story during the Special Features Commentary by director, Ronald Neame, indicated that Maggie Smith and her co-star-husband, Robert Stephens, became pregnant during the making of the movie because the B&B where they stayed had peacocks in the grounds that woke them up every morning between 4:00 and 5:00!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's a long way from Hogwarts","review":"This is Maggie Smith's first cinema outing as a teacher and she's rightly applauded for her performance.

It also does not include every song on the cd, which I found to be dissapointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Huffy Pro Thunder Boys 16-Inch BMX Bike","review":"I bought this bike for my grandson's 3rd birthday.

It was very easy to assemble and it came in a sturdy box with a handle on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Pan","review":"I thought this was a nice pan, but I don't think it was quite worth the $16 plus shipping. I thought it would be heavier for that price.It's still a good pan and I found plenty of recipes online for baked donuts. They usually call for them being piped onto a cookie sheet, but I just used the pan instead with fine results.I do agree the donuts are a little heavier than normal store-bought cake donuts, but still they are good. Just don't over fill the shapes and your donuts come out fine looking. Nothing stuck, not even to the center flutes.I will definitely use it again and try many different recipes. The donuts are not too big or too small. Fill in the forms with a pastry bag or plastic bag with a corner cut out, it makes it much easier to fill and the final product looks so much better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A treasure found!","review":"Although a little more than I would like to have spent on a baking pan, I love it! I ordered two since we have a large family and wanted to cook up multiples at a time. Finding a recipe required a bit of work, but we settled on our favorite things in the donut pan are our tried and true banana bread and pumpkin bread recipes with chocolate chips in them. We pipe the batter in with a bag with the corner cut out (or a tupperware frosting decorator ball thing minus the tips from a friend works super!) The donuts are so much more fun than the muffins we were making previously and great for kids' hands and superb baked gifts for friends. We get rave reviews from all who try it. It was definitely worth the purchase and the wait for them to arrive from backorder."},{"rating":"2","title":"great pan, need a recipe","review":"This is a very sturdy, well made pan. The doughnuts popped out effortlessly with just a thin coating of crisco shortening. One thing I really like is, each doughnut is approx. 3\\" in diameter -- good portion control (unless you eat two....) I would have given it 5 stars if it came with a recipe I could use --- the Kaiser recipe is in metric measurements, and includes ingredients that I am unsure of (soft curd cheese?). I tried a recipe I found online, and it was just OK, nothing to rave about. But that is no fault of the pan! When I find a great recipe, this pan will get a real workout in my house."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pan makes great donuts","review":"I had never seen a pan to make baked lower fat donuts before so thought I would give it a try. Well, the pan is a nice weight, the non-stick surface works perfectly, and the donuts came out so tender and melt in your mouth. The recipe that comes with the pan is in European measurements, but I found a recipe on the internet and used it. The donuts baked evenly and actually fell out of the pan when I turned it over after taking out of the oven. My whole family could not believe these perfect little donuts. They are on the small side, but are just the right size for a snack or after dinner. I will definitely be using this pan over and over again."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT IS THIS STUFF?","review":"I just received my donut pan from Amazon in 4 business days despite having chosen Free Super Saver Shipping. I love Amazon, but my opinion of this pan is so far very unfavorable. It came with a card board label attached to it with some kind of tar-like substance that I have never come across before. I can't even get it off with Goo Gone. The instructions and recipe that is advertised to come with the pan was completely torn off because the sticky stuff was placed exactly on the English version. I am tempted to pack this up and send it back without even making donuts because I don't know how I'm going to get this stuff off the pan. If I figure out a way and use the pan, I will update my review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Doughnuts","review":"I made doughnuts with this pan and they turned out pretty good.

The pan seems solid, even if it is lightweight. The price seems comparable for other doughnut pans sold here. The non-stick finish seems durable and it seems comparable to the Nordic Ware pans I have. The doughnuts are not very large, unlike the mammoth ones at the grocery store. I baked doughnuts from a Cooking Light recipe and I barely had enough to fill the pan though (roughly the batter from 2 1/2 c. flour and 1/2 c. sugar)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"The recipe that came with the pans is not easy to follow, since the measurements were in grams. I did not have a quick conversion chart. The so called \\"donuts\\" did not brown on the top when I followed the temperature and time directions. I tried to bake donuts again using a recipe from allrecipes.com and found the the so called donuts tasted more like muffins with a hole in the middle. I also bought the mini pan at the same time I bought the classic pan and had the same experience. The handling and care of both the classic donut pan and the mini pan takes more effort than I want to devote to keeping the \\"donuts\\" from sticking in future uses.

I hope that \\"Andy\\" did a poor job of keying into the emo mind, but unfortunately, he did not. He gives a good account of the consumers of this year's suckerjuice. I have never felt as justified for disliking a music and it's absoloute lack of values and humor or sense of invention.

The author, it seems, is too dumb to realize quite a few things: A) the bands discussed in this book are on the same corporate caliber as the bands it denounces. B) bands like Jimmy Eat World, Thursday, and Dashboard Confessional are not elusive indie acts, they are millionares and any rock radio station you tune into will gladly cram them down your throat. C) Said bands do not fall under the true category of emo.

The big problem is, Greenwald contributes to the misunderstanding and mockery of \\"emo\\" with this book. Like many people who try to define and classify \\"emo\\", Greenwald's definition is completely wrong. So, you want to know the real definition of \\"emo\\"? Its simple, \\"emo\\" is emotional hardcore. The important part of that definition is hardcore. If its not hardcore, than its not \\"emo\\".

Seriously, pick up something that's going to expand your mind, not close it. I don't know how this all caught on, but whether or not the music is quality (check out the original \\"emo\\" bands) no one should be spending their hard earned bills (although I'd imagine the majority of the money is coming from the middle class suburbanite parents they claim to despise) on a handbook for fitting in."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book has inaccurate information","review":"It's apparent that the author of this book did not do his homework, specifically regarding the events that took place between Chris Carrabba and Further Seems Forever, I don't even think he bothered to contact anyone in the band (FSF) regarding about what he wrote.

This graphic film depicts the appalling process by which young prepubescence and teen age boys in Prague are so skillfully lured into the eviscerated life of a male prostitute. Candid interviews with both predators and victims alike allow the visitor to observe how deftly and skillfully an unsympathetic pimp/promoter/and oftentimes executioner, can entice, convince and then blackmail his victims into becoming porn stars. Systemic of a life of poverty, the boys recall how easily they and their peers became street hustlers. Converging at a well-known swimming pool in the city, unsuspecting victims are attracted by the promise of money, and too often find themselves defending the tragic lifestyle of the walking dead. This film is not for the faint-hearted, but rather for those wishing to obtain the remnants of humanity on the verge of self-destruction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Body without a soul","review":"This was not the same documentary, but a watered down version.

The central character, a porn-film director was somewhat self opinionated and irritating. Listening to him was not helped by having to read the English sub-titles. There are some rather cute Czech lads to look at, and you can sympathise with their (albeit self-induced) plight. Anyone looking for much nudity and sex however, will be disappointed.The film is more of a 'Talking Heads' Documentary, with very little action. There is a strange (and repellent) inclusion in the film, of what appears to be a very real post-mortem (the directors daytime occupation is a mortician ).The DVD will probably gather a little dust on the shelf, as it's not particularly re-watchable."},{"rating":"1","title":"No information, no pictures","review":"The film shows no action, except a disgusting performance of cutting apart a dead body, and you ask yourself, in what relation to the subject of the film this stands.

(Like advertising) You are provided with not the least background information about their education, why they left their home town, why they have no normal job.

This novel introduces us to the sister of the cross dresser who inspired Caesar's line about requiring a wife above suspicion.Like the two other Saylor's that I've read, there is a lot of scholarship behind the story. Here, Rome's criminal justice system is put on display as is a description of the oratorical style that built Cicero's career.

The fictitious world of Gordianus hooks the reader into the shocking reality of ancient Rome. Saylor finds those great historical incidents and skillfully gets Gordianus and family involved. We get a deeper look into the surprising past of another family member in this volume.

I could just pat them while I'm still laying down. The only inconvenience is the size. Of course I need it to be big so I could fit them both. But it takes up about half the size of my Cal King bed.

Again, the directions are of absolutely no help. It was impossible to get the whole thing into the carrying case and get it zipped up. Also, this thing weighs a ton. I now realize I need to buy something else to use when travelling. How annoying.

First of all this was not so easy to assemble and was extremely difficult to disassemble and pack up. Our baby girl cried every time we put her in it, maybe because the mattress was very firm. I returned this because while we were sleeping I awoke to find the duvet part way in the co-sleeper. Later that night a pillow made it halfway in as well. If you use this, I would recommend only a light blanket on your bed and only a pillow for your head."},{"rating":"1","title":"mattress is lame","review":"This co-sleeper is just ok. I do not attach it to the bed- I use it the same way you would a crib. It's a little tricky to assemble and my husband hasn't had to break it down for any reason. My main complaint is the mattress... it's way too hard. My husband found an quilted pad online specifically made to fit this bassinet but it didn't do much good. The Arm's Reach website has an organic mattress for $120 but that's crazy expensive! I ended up carefully folding a microfiber throw to fit over the mattress and then covered both with a jersey fitted sheet. While it's not the best solution, it's the only way my baby will sleep in this bassinet.I wish I would not have registered for this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Perfect!","review":"I purchased the Arm's Reach Original Co-sleeper/Bassinet and I think that I'm going to really love this thing. I'm a mom of two, with my third arriving in just 4 weeks and I just assembled the co-sleeper by myself in less then an hour. I wish I was aware of the co-sleeper with my 17 and 11 year old's because they both shared a bed with me and it was hard getting them out of my bed. Additionally, I never really considered how dangerous it was to have an infant sleeping in the bed with me, this co-sleeper will definetly give me peace of mind and his father and I a little privacy ;-).Extremely fast shipping I received my purchase within 3 days and I received the free shipping offer through Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"I like it so far!","review":"Imagine placing a play yard next to your bed. That is how large this is! I dont know why I was expecting something smaller since I know it could be used as a play yard as well as a co-sleeper. But anyways, I was suprised at the size. Otherwise, it did not take long to put together it is a very simple design. I think we will get alot of use out of it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for beds with frames","review":"This seems like it would be a sturdy baby bed, and even with the extensions does not seem wobbly. The problem is that is does NOT attach to a bed with a frame. This fact is not listed anywhere in their product description either here or on their main site. It must be attached up against the mattress, and the legs do not allow it to get anywhere close, there is about a 5 inch gap left, too much to just pull the mattress over as I also have a memory foam mattress. So I'm left with a bassinet that is no different from any other bassinet attached above a play pen, at twice the cost. The quality of this product is the same as any other name brand play pen, so nothing else justifies the extra expense if it cannot in fact be used as a co-sleeper with a bed on a frame. Very disappointed that the company doesn't give this information in the listing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for new babies and new moms!","review":"We bought the co-sleeper based on the great reviews it had received, and we were not disappointed! Our new baby sleeps great in it, and it promises many months of use. It is well-made of quality materials. For new moms, it allows quick access to the baby as well as ease of checking on the baby frequently, while in bed. My only complaints are that there is no access to the storage space underneath the bed (when used as a co-sleeper) other than to remove the mattress. It would be more user-friendly if there was a zipper or door to access this area - it would be great for storing blankets, diapers, etc. Also, if you purchase the canopy to cover the co-sleeper, be aware that there is only one zipper opening which makes it difficult to get baby in and out of the co-sleeper during the day (depending on which direction the zipper faces if the co-sleeper is used as directed up against the bed)."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST CUSTOMER SERVICE","review":"We got the arms reach for our newborn twins and though it was tough to put together - sticky and unclear - we persevered and it was fine as a co sleeper - HOWEVER when we moved the twins to their cribs and wanted to change it to a pack and play our troubles began. It would not lock into place and was unsafe. I called the arms reach customer service 5 times and have not heard back. You cannot actually reach someone. Instead, they force you to leave a message and then do not return the phone call. I am left with a useless $200 item that is unsafe for my children. Get a real Pack and Play with the bassinet option. Other parents told me to do so and I wish I had listened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea, but with drawbacks","review":"We have had the original Co-Sleeper for 2.5 years. Our first son slept in it for 2 months and then refused to sleep in it. Our second refused to sleep in it period (even padding it with a small quilt). I assume that they make it completely uncomfortable to help prevent SIDS (your baby might has well be laying on the floor because it is not padded very well at all). The fitted sheet cannot be dried in the dryer, which is inconvenient. Most of all, I hate assembling and disassembling this thing. I never complain about assembling toys, gadgets, playards, etc...but this thing is horrible. I actually beat it with a hammer when I took it down after my first child quit using it. It is now put away and I will never put it up again. The only good thing I will say about it is that it's extremely sturdy (probably why it's a pain to assemble). I would suggest scouting ebay, yard sales, and second-hand stores instead of buying a new one. It is not worth $200."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too difficult to be portable and poor sleeping surface","review":"I though it was just me but after reading several other reviews I see that others agree on just how difficult this thing is to assemble/disassemble. The locks are impossible, the items do not quite fit right, and it would be impossible to get this thing into its \\"travel bag.\\" The mattress is thin and very lumpy; each fold in this mattress causes hard lumps. I bought this product thinking I could use it as a portable play yard after my baby out grows the co-sleeper aspect but there is no way. I recommend you avoid this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"cosleeper","review":"The quality of the bed is great, and I love that eventually I'll be able to use it as a full sized playpen when we're ready. I love that I can collapse it for traveling and that it came with a tote for travel. I find the pockets on the sides of it to be very useful to stash things I may need in the middle of the night. It is an effective cosleeper and makes access to my newborn from bed easy as can be.Now, that having been said, after one month of continuous night to night use of this item I have to say I find it an inconvenience when getting in and out of bed. I have unattached it from our bed and put it against a wall where it is still easily accessible at night, but where I won't find it such an obstacle to climb around."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would have worked fine if I could ever get the baby to sleep in it","review":"Just a warning - if you think this product is going to help keep the baby out of the bed so you can have a little more room and sleep a little better, well, might not work out that way. The product that ended up working best for me is getting two side-rails and attaching those to the bed and using those to keep the baby from falling out of the bed at night. I set the co-sleeper up and had every intention of using it but everytime I would lay the baby down, she would wake up and cry. She just wanted to be next to me - not just near me - 100% of the time. So, I recommend the side rails instead - they are a lot cheaper!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I do not like it","review":"We got this and a chicco play yard and my son does not like this as much as the chicco. The chicco appears to be softer to sleep on."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Mattress\\" HARD (as in wood hard)","review":"I really wanted to love this item, but 3 months into using it, I am not too keen on it. The mattress is really hard (I am not sure you can even call it a mattress), and now I am going to purchase one and spend an extra $50 or so. The so called mattress on the cosleeper consists of a thin pad of about 1 inch backed with a wood composite board. Considering the cost of the cosleeper ~$200, I think the mattress should be an actual mattress. The \\"mattress\\" it comes with gives once your baby gets to about 12-13lbs, basically having the baby sleep on the hard wood board. Specially the head.It is also a bit wobbly,the baby kicking or getting excited with her toys makes the entire cosleeper rock back and forth.I hope that it works better as a play yard, but by reading the reviews I am not so sure about that either. Basically I would not buy this item again or recommend it to someone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I bought this product on the advice of a friend and having read the previous reviews - however we were very disappointed with the co-sleeper. We bought it so i could nurse easily during the night - but my son and i were never comfortable either keeping him in the co-sleeper to nurse or \\"sliding\\" him across to the bed. I found that I always had to sit up in bed and lift him out of the co-sleeper to nurse him.Also the co-sleeper is large - it took up a good portion of our bed and so i would have to slide down the bed to get in and out. I found that when nursing I needed our bedside table to put all of the other objects that i needed when nursing (gloass of water, breastshield etc) - to keep the table near the bed means that the co-sleeper moves further down the bed - then the baby is further away!!! There are pockets to keep things - but at 3am who wants to be digging around to find necessary items."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pointless","review":"Perhaps if our baby had been interested in sleeping in it, it would have been somewhat useful. But the assembly/disassembly is so impossible as to render the product worse than useless as it takes up valuable time. Given the mixture of reviews, I can only think that there's variation in the manufacturing so that some of the cosleepers end up with locking mechanisms that simply don't work. PITA. The instructions are good for a laugh, but not much else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Recall","review":"I believe this product has been recalled. I can't include a link in the review but co-sleeper models that begin with 8111 were recalled in 2011."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to Assemble - Good Option for Newborns","review":"I was hesitant to purchase this as reviews made it sound difficult to assemble. Even with new parent sleep deprivation, it only took me 20 minutes to put this together. The trick is to go to the help section of the Arm's Reach website, where they have actual photos of every step and what it should look like. It made assembly quick and easy. The mattress isn't super soft, but since most crib mattresses are firm due to SIDs risk, it doesn't seem like a firmer option. The sheet is fine, not super soft, but not terrible. Since our baby is usually swaddled and sleeps on her back, she doesn't have much exposure to it anyway. I also accidentally dried it and it didn't shrink too badly and still fits fine. With that said, my American Baby Company Pack and Pay sheet fits it as well and is much softer. I am very happy with this product, it's a great compromise between co-sleeping and a bassinet."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT! Best purchase I have made for baby!","review":"I bought this as we are short on space right now and I was hoping to breast feed. Although the breast feeding didn't work out very long, we continued to use this as my son's bed and although he is 15 months old, still use it in the living room now as a playpen, or napping bed when needed. (My husband works nights sometimes and needs to sleep during the day)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite.....but works","review":"The Co-sleeper has worked out well for us after we made some modifications. The mattress is too firm, so I bought a softer organic mattress and an organic mattress pad. This new setup mimics my own bed more. Therefore, when I make the transition each night by placing Baby from my bed in to his, he does not wake up as easily. The originial mattress would wake him up instantly.Also, with Baby so close to my bed, he still ends up next to me most of the night. It might work for your baby, but my baby wants to be right up next to me. He is 5 weeks old and has spend about 1/4 of the nights in the Co-sleeper and the rest of the night next to me. So the product is not a miracle, but it is nice to have. Maybe when he is older and a little more independent he will sleep in it just fine. Overall, this is a great product that helps us with our attachment parenting ways...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love This!","review":"We bought the co-sleeper instead of a bassinet due to it's flexibility. We decided to purchase the orginal co sleeper and use this as the babies main crib until the baby is ready for a regular crib. My complaint is that it is difficult to change from play pen to co sleeper the lock on the bar is hard to figure out and the instructions are pretty vague (this is why I give the co sleeper 4 stars). Over all it took me 20 minutes to set up and no tools required."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor product","review":"I really love the idea of co-sleepers and I'm glad that we went with that option. Unfortunately, arms-reach was a disappointment. The product's quality is really poor. The \\"mattress\\" is a fold-able board with less than an inch of padding. The bed is also not usable as a play pen or travel bed because on the lower setting, the sleeping/playing surface is very uneven. There is a plastic stump in the middle. Because the mattress is so thin and wobbly, the four corners end up being significantly lower than the center part. Assembling and disassembling is a pain, and some fabric parts cannot be taken off to be cleaned.Go with another product if you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Received Yesterday, Returning it Today","review":"I just received our co-sleeper yesterday but am returning it today. I purchased the co-sleeper because my seven-week old son sleeps great when he sleeps with us, but slept very poorly in his bassinet. If you haven't bought a bassinet yet then I can see how this product would be just as good, but it basically is a large bassinet. I thought it would be directly even with our mattress so I could snuggle my son at night, but the mattress sits a couple inches below the side of the co-sleeper, making it impossible to cuddle up with him. ALSO...the mattress it comes with is EXTREMELY HARD. I know babies are suppose to sleep on hard surfaces, but this is so hard it has to be uncomfortable. VERY DISSAPOINTED. We also have a pack n' go bed which is pretty much THE SAME thing as this co-sleeper. The only difference is the co-sleeper has one side that folds down."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE OF SUFFOCATION","review":"Just went to the ER today after I found my 4 month old with his face wedged in the corner.This co-sleeper is not safe once they can wiggle around at all.

It's awkword because if you lay the baby in there lengthwise, it's really awkward to get him out at night. If you lay him in there sideways, then he's too big for it in about 2-3 weeks. The mattress is really hard, and the sheet sets are a fortune. My baby slept in it for 3 or 4 nights and refused to be left in it. Plus, having the cosleeper makes getting in and out of bed a pain. I'll be using it as a play yard once our baby gets bigger, I'm glad I got mine used instead of buying it new!A play yard with an infant sleeper would have been the same if not better!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to assemble","review":"This review is strictly about the assembly and sturdiness of the item. I haven't delivered our baby yet so I can't comment on the use...This product was very easy to assemble. It took all of about 20 minutes from beginning to end.

Excited to start using it =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to dissasemble","review":"Despite the fact that the product serves its purpose being a compact co-sleeper, I just cannot recommend it to my friends as it is very hard to dissasemble.

We were really looking forward to using it. However, we didn't realise it was only for babies up to 3 months, and it proved to be just too big for our little 'un. He just couldn't settle in it, and after a few attempts, we had to use a bassinet instead. We'll still be able to use it as a playard, but that wasn't what we bought it for.I'd recommend getting the mini co-sleeper, one this big just seems a little pointless, as well as expensive"},{"rating":"2","title":"So Happy I bought it!","review":"I am so happy that I bought the co-sleeper. I went through all of our bedding options before the birth of our son. This was a safe way to keep him near by. I can check on him and hear him breathing without getting out of bed. I would recommend buying original co-sleeper instead of the mini co-sleeper. The original version can hold several more pounds. I did not buy the extenders, so it has always been too short for our bed. I have used the side storage pockets to hold diapers for nighttime changes. I am very happy with this purchase.

I wish I could get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"sly 2 band of boringness","review":"this game sucks!!!!!! one hit from an enemy you die. You can't swim or anything either.

There is also a new system called the Thief Net that allows you to sell your loot for moves online.The game is longer and more complexed this time.In the game, the Clockwork parts are stolen by the Klaww gang and you have to get them back or face the thousand year old menance again.So far I am on episode eight, the last episode.This game surpasses the first one by far.Oh, and Carmilita has a new partner,who is a quadrupel-crosser.Buying this game is a must."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skip game #1 and start here!","review":"This game is leaps and bounds above the frustration-fest that is the first game in the series. No more 1-hit deaths, we finally have a health meter! You really have to be careless to have an instant death as well, such as falling from a platform into water. This game is SO much better than the first. The only other area that needs help is the camera. It seems to shift into an awkward position when you least expect it. Otherwise, this game is almost flawless!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game!","review":"This game made a nice addition for my nephew's birthday. It arrived in record time with free shipping. Thanks!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Ratchet","review":"The series of Sly games remind me of a simpler version of the Ratchet and Clank games. The graphics and storyline are a bit more cartoonish, but Sly tends to lean more on the problem solving side and less on the violent shoot em up side. Though my son loves both series of games, I think the Sly series is a bit more kid friendly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Totally Awesome!!!!","review":"This game is the most awesome thing I've ever played! I love it! It is so cool.. The cool thing about it is you are playing as a bad guy and you get to steal stuff. I want to make it clear ,however, that I am not a thief and do not wish to ever be one, I just think it was cool to play that side of things. My favorite characters are Sly, Murray and Dimitri.

I would recommend that other kids buy this game. \\"So that is what I think about this game\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Grand Larceny","review":"It is like Sly Cooper vs. Clockwerk Part 2.

The bluetooth stack on my Lenovo T61p sees the device and takes the passcode, but the sled never binds with the bluetooth stack. As a troubleshooting step I tried to bind the unit to my Windows Mobile 6.0 phone and the same results. The BT stack sees it but the device won't pair with the phone.I called Pharos and thier support agents will only tell you its a problem with Vista and Microsoft knows about it, they will then tell you to download a piece of nagware to test. Using this software confirms what I already know, and that is that the sled won't pair and Pharos response is that it can't be thier problem, it has to be a Vista/Microsoft problem. This is hardly possible as I use this machine and its bluetooth stack all the time to connect to mice and headphones, so I had no recourse but to return the unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it !

There are many things in this game that the avid medieval reader will recognize. If you want a mostly historically accurate game, I suggest this game for you. There is even the option to forgo commanding battles yourself and keep the game focused on the strategic level. I only have one problem with this game: the strategic portion is single-player only. That prevents this game from being the best strategy game I ever played. Of course, there's nothing more satisfying than outmaneuvering your friends on the battlefield and then mercilessly slaughtering their captured soliders with a voracious war cry just like your ancient ancestors and laughing at them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Turn based, RTS, Casual or Hard core you decide","review":"The great thing about the Total War games is the ability to play the game many different ways. You can play it like a Risk type board game or you can play it as a RTS(real time strategy) game and micro manage each battle. You can play it as a one session casual game or an in depth hard core strategy game that takes days to complete. What other game can you say that about other than the other Total War games?M:TWBC with the Viking Expansion(which is a must have because it adds so much to the game) is another realization of the castle games we played as kids and could only dream of this kind of interactivity.Don't dismiss this one because there is a Medieval Total War II. Total War II is an upgrade in graphics but is really a continuation of the time period that the first installment started. Trust me when I say this, you will still be playing M:TWBC years from now."},{"rating":"2","title":"i agree with both of the above","review":"while the second reviewer is right to give this game the best review of the century, the first reviewer has a good point too. this game is amazing. shogun total war was excellent but this blows it out the water. the graphics, the handling everything is incredible well made. but like the first reviewer says, prepare for rebellion. if you are frustrated easily with games then dont get this. i had the same problem with rebellion. just as i was about to conquer the world, i was beset by several beaten kingdoms all wanting their land back at the same time. and as for the papacy... it just doesnt make sense when you knock them out the game, only for them to come back three times as strong a few turns later. this stops me from saying this game is perfect. it does have flaws. but those flaws can be dealt with using determination and heavy cavalry."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is da strategy game for anyone.","review":"Medieval: Total War is super easy to learn. Gamers who are starting to be attracted to strategy or war games should begin here. The whole object of the game is to either dominate the world or stun the world with glorius achievements. The graphics don't compare to that of Rome: Total War's, but the gameplay is better. The Expansion Pack: Viking Invasion adds a Vikings Campaign, new civilazations along with new army units. Anyone will be thirsty to DOMINATE THE MEDEIVAL WORLD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but don't use it anymore","review":"This is a nice product, however, after using it a few times I opted for a different style harness. My only gripe is that the harness wraps around the dogs neck, and with my dog already wearing a break away collar with his ID tags, it gets in the way. I either had to take the dog's break away collar off each time or leave it on and wrap the harness around it which seemed uncomfortable to the dog. Other than that I think it's a good product. It did stop the dog from pulling too much when walking and it fits my dog comfortably (if the break away collar is off)."},{"rating":"1","title":"I love sporn generall but this was badly described","review":"I have several sporns for other dogs -- and even the one with the front net for THIS dog. But this 'small' regular sporn has a collar FAR too small for my pug and it's useless for her. I will simply donate it to a shelter (the shipping would be almost more than the cost of the halter). But I'm getting a bit cranky about things that are not fully described. These descriptions need MEASUREMENTS. Like the collar is X-inches long! In this case \\"weight\\" does not help -- the collar is far far too small to go around her neck and there is almost no leeway to adjust it at all.I love the sporn concept, and I hate to leave a crummy review -- but even the picture is misleading -- on a standard poodle the width of the collar would be appropriate. But on a small dog it's the SAME 1.25\\" wide collar as is used on the large and extra large so it's way too wide on her neck as well as too short -- I shouldn't have believed the picture!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very handy book for physicians","review":"This is a nice book for family physicians ,who are just new in their private practice.

I really believe that had she not been under the influence of Methamphetamines, she would never have done what she did. That doesn't excuse her actions in any way, but it's a shame. I get the impression that once she came out of her drug induced mania she must really be sitting in that cell kicking herself. What a shame...for all involved. Her poor parents. They really thought that they'd be able to talk her out of jail. The only remark I have that would be a downside is the 'hole' left in the de Ville's family portrait, outside of a few brief passages, I was left with little of an impression of the family. It was truly all about Kristen and her family. But this is an excellent read - perhaps Rother could become the next Ann Rule.

I checked into yoga after suffering a knee injury.If you're looking for a fitness type workout and have never tried yoga, you will probably enjoy this video. If you know anything about yoga and practice with a good yoga instructor, you will hate this video. Not enough time is spent on proper form, and I found the instuctor to be annoying.

Not only does it feel wonderful to do from a fitness perspective, I always feel so relaxed and calm after doing it. And, this calmness has really extended into the rest of my life--I am better able to handle stress. Another great part of it is that I am constantly improving. I love being able to notice the progress I make each time I do the workout--each time making it a little further into each of the poses.

They need to get to know each other. They need a chance to understand that there is a way out through understanding, sharing, tolerance, friendship, love, laughter.

That's not to say it's rosy - the children depicted in the film often exhibit anger and intolerance, but the mere act of recognition between the children of these two warring groups is enough to inspire faith in their futures. This film is a beautiful document of a precious, brave and tenuous experiment on the part of the filmmakers. May we all have the courage to try to guide the next generation into a more peaceful, more understanding world.If 50 stars were possible, this film would have earned every one.

Also whether it was intended or not this movie is pretty much a play by play of the Tupac vs. Biggie fued but with a few twists . For instance while it is obvious that faison is suge && toni is faith and so on, i think tupac && biggie are a bit mixed. jaxx was pac because of him qoinq to the west coast nd being play'd by domino breed (also notice how the record label was called the block i wonder if that was like the row or whatever). but the fact that he had a wife and mistress and mayhem made the \\"i f**ked yur wife\\" sonq lol it mixes thinqs up. all in all i loved it =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Filmmakers droped the ball in this one.","review":"Well to start I have to say that I am a devoted Toni Braxton fan. I would not have taken time to see this film if not for her. Nevertheless, I did find the story line old and worn out and the acting in it weak but the music was good it was the redeeming quality of the film. I myself am not a fan for rap music nor am a hater of it. My take on the film is that it was an ok film but nothing really good. Just wish that Toni Braxton had done some of the singing in the film, but she did not. She did not even do any of music for the credits, very disappointing. They, the filmmakers, missed something there to have one of the greatest voices of the time in the film and not have her sing one song. Dumb, very dumb. Even if they had to pay her more it would have been worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great starting model","review":"This is a great tank to start with if you want to build models.

Then at least 2 or 3 times a week I simply partially fill the tub with a bit of tepid water from the tap and anchor it into their cage by dropping the key shaped tub base into the slot in the bracket, and then twisting the tub to lock it in place. The bath is very stable. Within minutes both birds head toward it. One of them is a bit pushy and doesn't let the other get in first, but I guess they work out their own politics. They perch on the edge, walk and flutter in the tub, and even hang upside down from the perch above to put their whole face into the water. In any case, both seem to enjoy it but particularly the pushy one. Since the water gets dirty quickly, I don't leave it in for more than a couple of hours.

But once you know the sources for the tracks the collection makes some sense and gives you a good sense of the history of the Groovies. The first section contains studio material from the mid-seventies and shows the influences of punk on the (post-Loney)band's sound. The live tracks that span the second half of disc one and the first half of disc two come from the nineties Groovies. The sound is pretty good for a live recording and is fun enough for a casual listen.

I installed it using the velcro and allowed the velcro glue to set for 24 hours as per the instructions. Within 4 days of use by my cats, the Kitty Sill came crashing down with my cat on it. Thankfully, my cat was uninjured. I contacted K&H Mfg and their first reply was that I did not install it correctly.

I am going to try to use the screws it came with, hopefully my cats will not be too fearful to try to get on it again.

Do not buy this product as it is cheaply put together. While the faux wool bedding is nice and comfy, the handles on the bottom do not set well against the wall and there is no easy place to put velcro tape on the bottom of the bed.We bought ours and once we saw how it is to be installed, it went into our \\"donation\\" pile.

U also have to think about weight of your cat because jumping requires landing which can pull it loose. My siamese are also \\"sprawlers\\" and nap stretched out alot.

I liked this film as it was pure satire. It makes fun of many memorable sports lines from over the years. In your face slapstick comedy. I liked the way \\"Rocky\\" disintegrated in the boxing ring! A great watch when your laugh reserves are running low. Not for kids, as the suggestive content is more suited for adults. If you are looking for a film to critique, look further.

Lodge sure does em up right. The only qualms I have would be the handle design and the width.

And it would be nice if Lodge offered a 9 qt. model without the top wire handle, but with the wide side iron handles like they offer on their pro-logic series 4 qt. and 7qt. models.

I was really excited that I could save myself the process of restoring and re-seasoning it and used it that night to cook my birthday dinner!However, even the addition of a small amount of water while scrubbing it out resulted in rust on the inside bottom of the pan. After scouring and another round of seasoning in the oven it hasn't happened again, but I was a little disappointed in the factory seasoning process.Since then, however, I've had nothing but good luck with it, even roasting veggies that have gotten a little watery. As a bonus, the lid fits many of my old #8 pans from other manufacturers.

There are a lot of hats included, but most of them are, in my opinion, ugly. Most are based on old styles (circa 1960-1970) and I can't imagine anyone wearing them. A few patterns are okay....but mostly, this book left me stone cold.In fact, I went back to it this year, when preparing to knit hats for xmas presents for my friends and my opinion hasn't changed. So what am I knitting instead? A beautiful pattern featured in Vogue Knitting's winter 1993 issue.Note: this book was ordered before Amazon offered the peek inside feature.

I Couldn't Even READ it.","review":"The Seven Sister's jacket blurb pulled me in with excitement and a plot I could specifically relate to being about divorce and moving to an urban dwelling, really different from times past. So, I could relate to the character, right? Not! The stereotypes, especially the racial stereotypes made me just stop. I don't know much about the author so I don't want to assume she's a racist but I think in order to add and edge or danger to her story, she played that dreaded race card. I didn't want to know how else negatively she felt about what she called \\"coloured\\" people so I stopped reading. Are you 150 years old, Drabble?

It is dreadful. Dull, obvious, mean, depressing, time-wasting. I abandoned the Red Queen halfway through and felt guilty, so stayed with this one to the end. A sadly wasted afternoon. I am all for writers making an attempt at something different, but this? No. Why would anyone want to listen to the voice of a bitter woman whine to herself? Characters should come out of a novel changed, for good or ill. At the close, Candida still whines, just waits and whines, although at the end she enjoys knitting. Really? When the best thing to happen to a heroine is that she learns to purl on Finnish wool, you know it's a snooze of a book.

I was able to mount a 21 inch flat panel to the lid of the case with no problems. The case was suprisingly rigid even after all the modifications I made. I was worried the weight of the monitor would break the joint holding the lid but it had lasted for 4 months before I removed my computer from the case(Upgraded to water cool system). The only complaint I have about the case would be the plastic/cardboard sidings. I wish there was at least a layer of sheet metal to make the case even more rigid. Of course since this is a camera case the actual weight of the equipment would not be as much as a full size computer (final weight of the case with computer was 50lbs).

I found this southern chick lit style book to be the least-believeable of all the chick lit books I've read that are set in the south.The intimate scenes were unnecessary as far as plot or character development goes, and the friendships on the whole were fairly two-dimensional.The main scenario with the daughter being afraid to 'be smart' in front of her mother and share her inventions was highly unbelievable. And the reason for the mom being afraid of her daughter being a smart girl and woman was frankly stupid coming from a clever, manipulative woman that she was, especially after said daughter was now an ADULT and not a vulnerable child.The twist at the end was beyond ludicrous, and that is putting it mildly.The only thing that kept me going was my innate urge to finish what I start - not always a useful trait, in this situation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ignore some of these BS reviews.","review":"These people can't think for themselves.

But, this newest atmosphere album isn't as dark or thoughtfelt as his earlier efforts which every emo kid (including myself) from the suburbs was loving.

It is clear that this album is meant to appeal to angsty suburban teenagers and no other demographic.I'm not trying to write a nasty review here, and I must say that \\"OverCast\\" was actually a good Hip-Hop album.

This is executed without sacrificing quality here and by emphasising true hip-hop. Listen to it for what is, not what isn't. If you do this, Atmosphere will always shine.

The story has nothing to do with the one in the first game, other than a brief mention of what is going on in Neverwinter. It is still interesting none the less. You have much more flexibility with your character this time around so you can play as good, evil, lawful, or chaotic as you want. You also have more choices on how to handle things.

I own practically every Bioware game ever made, and have loved every one of them... except for this one. I have downloaded and played mods that other players have created that were more exciting and more thoughtfully created that SoU.

I hope it lasts a while I am tired of buying scales for my business. You really need to read over what you are buying on the internet.

It more expensive than the others I saw on Amazon., but, you get what you pay for! I need an ACCURATE scale. This scale has a removeble top for easy cleaning. There's also an option to buy power cord so you don't have to rely on batteries (although the scale will let you know if you batteries are weak). With most scales you don't have a power option.Some ingredients are hard to measure by cupfuls, such as chunky ingredients that take up space but leave gaps. Messy ingredient (such as peanut butter, shortening, etc) are a snap to measure! Nowadays, most receipes have weight equivalents displayed right next to them. Plus there are lots of websites that have weight/cup charts."},{"rating":"2","title":"DVD case","review":"Very nice, VERY roomy, easy to put together, doesn't come with enought nails to properly secure rear of cabinet.Thinking of getting another one."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly constructed and expensive","review":"I gave this toy to my dog and it was ripped along the seam within 10 minutes.

I am not talking about his vocal skills only but about his extremely good taste choosing how to interpretate and performe those excellent songs. THIS DVD IS A DIAMOND AND STEVE PERRY IS HIS BRIGHTNESS. I WOULD BUY IT AGAIN FOR THE TRIPLE OF THE PRICE. IT'S WORTH IT.

There is a good mixure of older songs and the ones written more recently. Seeing the band (especially Neal Schon) in the early days is beyond entertaining. An extra treat was seeing Randy Jackson (one of the judges on American Idol) playing the bass guitar and singing backup vocals on three of the performances (that was cool dawg!). If you like Journey you will love this DVD, and you'll find yourself watching it over and over again like me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best DVD Ever!","review":"Excellent DVD! Its finally nice to see that Journey came out with a DVD that includes the old stuff from the Perry years! This DVD totally rocks and includes all the great radio hits. Cant wait for the next DVD's to come out especially the Raised on Radio. Steve Augeri just doesnt get the emotion and feeling that Steve Perry did. The sound on the DVD is also really great despite the old videos which are now really clear and very impressive. Now maybe someday Steve Perry can rejoin with his band someday and reunite the magic that they once made. Steve we have enjoyed your music and stand behind you. We miss your amazing voice and hope to see you on stage one day again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it !","review":"My son is crazy about this Barney Sing and Dance.

This is my 20 month old son's very fave. There is no filler, they basically jump from one song to the next so even a child with zero attention span like mine won't get bored. The production value is high and all the songs are so cute! Defnitely worth adding to your library.If your child is a Barney freak, also try searching for Sing Along with Barney, which is a CD personalized to many children's names. For example if your child's name is Michael, Barney will put the word Michael over 80 times in the songs within the CD. They have a lot of names out there. SO CUTE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Granddaughter LOVES THIS","review":"Now, my granddaughter is only 20 months old but she adores Barney.

Now, her Dad can't stand Barney, and was totally against her watching Barney to begin with ... but as she has learned so much from it and is so cute ... he has gotten to appreciate all she has learned and I have noticed him putting the DVD on for her from time-to-time ... NOW THAT IS A RECOMMENDATION!!! It was also cute for my daughter and I, to see so many of the kids that had grown up ... as she still has VHS Barney videos that were her son's that are almost 10 years old.

A friend turned me on to this product and as soon as I tried it for the first time, I knew it was for me. And I've shared mine with other friends who have oohed and ahhed and then bought their own. I've discovered this product has somewhat of a cult following even with men, especially construction workers who are especially hard on their hands.

I have a Zen Remote also, which I really enjoy (it has full mouse functions also), but when I have students present, the Zen Remote is too complicated. The LPP is great and has a location to put a spare battery as well. The only reason it did not get 5 stars was due to the fact you can't change the 'address' of the remote, so if you have several being used in the same area, you may be changing the slides of your friend inadvertently."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD is ok.","review":"This Cd is pretty good.

Vertosick is able to successfully synthesize a completely different, yet strongly persuasive argument for the basis of life itself.

Bad decision on my part. I wrongly assumed that the stud detection feature would be as good as on the older models. Not even close. Brand new out of the packaging, I tried to install a wall cabinet in the garage this morning. Even trying it in both modes (stud scan or deep scan), the thing was just not able to consistly pick up up studs. I even brought it into the house to try on other walls. I'm not sure if the AC feature is having some effect on the stud sensing capability, but I really don't care now. I ended up having to go back to the old fashioned way (hammer tapping, trial nail, and tape measure). I'm really disapointed in this Zircon. Now I'm not sure if I even want to go back and try one of the simple models that I've used before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slim design; questionable performance and durability.","review":"I've owned this stud finder for over a year now and use it periodically for various projects. I recall that I bought it for it's small profile and apparent 'pro' qualities. After about a month, all but the two bottom l.e.d. lights stopped working- the 'beep' is the only way for me to know where the stud edge is. As mentioned by others, the a.c. detection is laughable. As for stud detection- yes, it's a dark art even with a finder. I can't say that this unit does better or worse than the many others i've used for this primary purpose."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless junk","review":"I had to install some shelves in an area near electrical wiring. Because it was a one-time project I looked for the least expensive stud finder with AC detection I could find. Alas, you get what you pay for... This device found AC all right, everywhere I tried to use it on the wall. Since this was not exactly believable I tried other locations and found that it even detected AC on the back of my hand and in the open air. As an AC detector it is completely worthless. As a stud finder it is marginal but it takes several tries on each spot to find where the stud really is, moving right to left on one side of the stud and then left to right on the other so that you can estimate the middle of the board. It was correct 3 of 5 times so I had to patch some extra holes in the sheetrock. Ultimately it would have been easier and faster to simply measure 16\\" on center from the edge of the wall and not even bother with this tool.

It's the least expensive piece of cookware in the house. It's also the most frequently used. Anodized aluminum, multi-ply stainless, Teflon this-and-that...this little cast iron skillet is now the workhorse for two. It came pre-seasoned and that was good enough...almost as easy clean-up as the non-stick; just abide by their instructions and keep the detergent away. Downside: heavy and hot. It takes some wrist strength to wrangle this guy full of food with confidence, and the relatively small handle is part of the casting...the highly conductive and heat-retaining casting...so get an insulated gripper unless you're used to working with a towel at hand.

It would have been nice to have a smoother cooking surface. I'm just hoping with use it will smooth out.

It is LARGE, and takes a while to properly warm up. Because of its size, it seems to hold heat well - great for searing, which is why I bought it. The only down side to this pan is the weight, due to its extreme size. While I can muscle it from the stovetop to the oven and back without problems, my wife has a lot of difficulty moving it, especially when hot and full of contents.

This pan skillet is good for single fast frying dishes (no deep frying) and for preparation such as sauté for main courses.

This one is a two inches too big for my stovetop burners, but I mostly use it for frying (the cool spots around the edges are good for keeping fast cooking things from burning) in the oven as a makeshift baking stone for pizza and bread. I didn't like the pre-seasoning as it wasn't as non-stick as cast iron is supposed to be, but that is easily fixed by adding a few more layers of seasoning at home or making some fried chicken."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love cast iron. Size & weight can be an issue though","review":"Cast iron is awesome, but remember if you use a stove with electric coil burners instead of gas you could actually damage your stove by putting a pan that's larger than your burner -- I would recommend this for gas stoves only.

The fish is very thin and I did have trouble with sticking. I washed it, oiled it, and dried it on the burner. A few nights later I tried the sole again for a large crowd. I used my teflon pan along side it because I was cooking so much. I continually had trouble with the cast iron pan sticking. I could walk away from the teflon pan and it consistently gave me evenly browned, non-stick fish. I can't say that about the cast iron pan. I kept having to add more oil. It was frustrating....but I am not giving up. I am really holding onto the hope that it will eventually become non-stick.

Even thought it is pre-seasoned it helps to be generous with oil or shortening the first few times, and do not overheat the oil (the pan can take it but the oil cannot). It is okay to wash with warm water and a very mild soap & brush every once in a while (which you want to do because oil can go rancid after even a short time and it will affect the pan's quality).Deep enough for simply frying, but not for doing large meats or dough items."},{"rating":"2","title":"Consistant Results.

Don't let the reputation of cast iron scare you off - it's easy to cook with once you get the hang of it. And it's easy to clean too.

I like non-stick surfaces and couldn't see how this would fit the bill. How wrong was I! I love my skillet. Once seasoned, it is non-stick and it browns like nothing else. I originally thought I would season the skillet and let my then-11-year old daughter take it with her when she moved out. Now that I have a well seasoned cast iron skillet, I know she will have to pry it from my cold, dead hands.

My hope was that a heavy pan like this would heat evenly allowing me to cook multiple pancakes or a large number of pot stickers all at once. But no such luck.

It is a wonderful addition to my cooking utensils. It is a large fry pan and for that fact alone I love it. I do agree with most of the reviews on the cast iron products that the seasoning on these pre seasoned pieces could be better. HOWEVER, let it be known seasoning is so simple. Also just using the pan frequently makes it improve with age. I have been familiar with cast iron pans since I was a child. They are heavy pieces but so worth the lift. :) Cleaning the residual food off, as you never use soap, is so simple. Use a plastic card, for instance an old credit card, to scrape the pan. However I do not necessarily say to use a credit card as I do not believe in letting them lay around. I just wanted to get the idea of what type of card across to you. Nothing beats cast iron cooking. I am trying to replace all my pans and pots with cast iron. Obviously very satisfied.

I enjoy the size. And I especially like that it came preseasoned. Very well made."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Made!","review":"I was impressed how well made this product is manufactured. And the price is very reasonable! I have been in manufacturing for 10 years and have made consumer, automotive, industrial, and agricultural products - so I often spot more than just the obvious defects...such as workmanship, design, etc. I recently bought a Chinese made castiron product - it had a weird metalic/chemical smell...makes me want to heat it up, clean it several times before I'm comforable. This skillet - the casting is smooth, consistent, and doesn't have any nasty smells. Lodge takes pride in thier products, reasonably priced, and made in the USA. By the way, this thing is huge and heavy...in the real world. Sometimes, it is hard to judge when looking on line. I might have dropped down to the next size smaller if I had to do it over. But I'm still very happy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Met my expectations","review":"I had expectations for a very good skillet and these expectations were met.

It is heavy for me to lift with one hand and it is a bit awkward to lift with 2 because you need mitts. However, it cooks evenly and heats quickly. Cleaning is fairly easy, though you should clean it pretty much immediately and not with soap. DO NOT let it drip dry as you'll end up with rust marks in your sink/on the pan.

It comes ready to use but you still have some seasoning to do (that just makes it your own). By serious cooks I mean people who have to cook not recreational or weekend cooks. When you have family and children to cook for daily you don't have time or the patience to worry about kitchen equipment. Non-stick pans are so fragile that you have to constantly worry not to scratch the surface, and then after being as careful as possible they still scratch and wear out. You also have to be concerned if any of those chemicals in non-stick pans will leach out into your food (Especially when cooking for children). This is old school non-stick - no worries.I recommend using a good oil spray at the beginning after that it will be 100% non stick on its on."},{"rating":"2","title":"30% Cheaper at Walmart","review":"I've just ordered it and after receiving shipping notice thought I would check Walmart.

I use several older cast iron pieces, from Griswold, Wagner, and Le Creuset, so I'm used to hefty weights. However, this 12\\" Lodge skillet nearly broke my wrist when it was filled with ingredients! Furthermore, I was dissapointed in the pebbly texture, which made it harder to clean than my older, smooth-interior cast iron pots. After trying to use this for about 6 months, I gave it away and bought a 12\\" All-Clad skillet instead, although the price was much, much higher.

Just add the ingrediants and put a lid over it and set in oven and come back 1 hour later and it tastes as nice as a dinner at a high priced restaurant.Btw would recommend getting the lid that goes with this by Lodge too...but problem is it weighs as much as the pan..so look at another 5 lbs added to already 8-10 lbs of pan and food to lift out of oven.

And by stick I mean you'll be scrapping the pan for 5 minutes and it still won't be clean.Second, the 12-inch is too large for regular stoves. There'll be a hot spot in the middle and the edges will be at a lower temperature. Haven't had this problem with regular frying pans. Maybe this frying pan is for those who are experts in cooking with cast-iron skillets. I don't know. I'm surprised it got such high reviews.On a positive side this pan should be good for cooking burgers, steaks, and chicken breast. But for everyday use it's not the right pan."},{"rating":"2","title":"How did I live so long without Cast Iron??","review":"I received this Lodge Cast Iron pan for Christmas, and I couldn't be happier! As read in other reviews, it is required that you season your new pan with oil for the first 2-3 uses. It takes a healthy amount of oil those first few test runs, but it is well worth the wait! After my initial oiling, I have been using my pan for months now without having to use a single drop of added oil. My crispy tofu has never been better :).

You have to keep it oiled often and even the tiniest drop of water will cause rust. Once something rusts, I get way too nervous to even consider using it. If you are up for the challenge of maintaining, I think it looks very nice and heats well, especially on a bbq or gas flame."},{"rating":"2","title":"My first cast iron pan -- I love it!","review":"I have used cast iron before, but I've never owned one myself, so I was hesitant to buy one -- especially since the price is so affordable. I worried about the quality and weight. As soon as the package arrived I knew that my worries were moot -- that puppy is heavy duty! I have cooked with it three times (beef, chicken, and eggs) and it cooks perfectly every time and is easy to clean (I use rock salt as my \\"scrubber\\" and it cleans easily with a paper towel; then I just dry it, oil it up, and it's ready to go!) The 12-inch size is really perfect for just about everything.And call me a crazy patriot, but I absolutely love that this beautiful, functional, affordable product is made in the U.S.A. :) I highly recommend this for everyone, and I will definitely purchase more from this company in the future.

It takes some getting used to, like needing to preheat, but a well seasoned skillet like this one should provide a great non stick surface for basically forever. Never wash it with soap, and always let them dry completely and put a light layer of oil for storing them. I rinse mine in the sink and scrape the big chunks of food off, then I place them on the stovetop on high to dry them thoroughly, then using a paper towel I put a very thin layer of bacon grease over the surface."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cast Iron Performance","review":"Recommend to others; bought to use for a special recipe.

I was able to return it without incident, but was somewhat concerned about receiving items for food preparation that weren't even wrapped in plastic or something similar.

Two times with organic Coconut oil.I guess I was expecting it to be like my old Griswold castiron.To me, it will never be like the old skillets.I sautéed/fried sliced potatoes with coconut oil, and they stucked. I tried a egg, which wasa big mistake also.I find this pan very heavy compared to my old Castiron pans. Although with thehelper handle it did help. It is also a thicker castiron then the old skillets,which are not as heavy.Maybe I did something wrong, but the pan said it was pre-seasoned, and I seasoned it.The in side is very lumpy, and I could not get it smooth..

I always leave a cheap (99c from Ikea) oven mit on the handle.Amazon.com is the only place (that my friends & I know of) that sells these wonderful cast iron skillets for price this low.

So far I have used it twice to make a paella recipe and it has performed like a champ! I have been careful about putting a cold pan into the oven when it is really hot (800-900 F.) since I know I could crack this thing with extreme changes in temperature. My strategy has been to start the paella on the largest burner on my gas range, first browning the chicken and chorizo and then sauteeing the sofrito. After I add rice and chicken broth and get it to a boil I put the pan into the fairly hot (550-600 F) oven, right on the bricks, and close the door. I check it frequently, adding the shrimp, mussels, etc. and finally a handful of green peas at the end. The paella has turned out fantastic both times, the oak wood gives the paella a subtle smoky flavor. I have lots of other ideas for using this pan, many inspired by the \\"Seven Fires\\" book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pan!","review":"Love it!

Checking my local kitchen stores, I found none this particular size so I ordered from Amazon. What arrived was a skillet with a surface flaw at least 1\\" in length at the top of the skillet rim. The flaw is due to the lack of coating which was applied in this area. It was so obvious that I couldn't believe the vendor would allow it out the door. I was dumb founded. Is this a second in disguise? Are us customers supposed to be so duh that we don't even see these things???? P-l-e-a-s-e. An ebay seller who sold an item in this \\"new\\" condition would be down rated big time.

I can make an omelet on mine!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Lodge cast iron but....","review":"First off, let me say that I really love Lodge cast iron. I've been collecting it for the last few years and love the quality and that fact that it's made here in the US. Having said that, I wish that the marketing people at Lodge would be a little bit more honest in their sizing information. I purchased this 6-1/2\\" skillet but the actual cooking surface is 5\\". Barely big enough to grill a sandwich on. Maybe a small piece of fish or a couple eggs. Some people need to know the larger size, perhaps for storing reasons, but it would be nice if they would include the information that that is the top edge, side to side, and then include the information on how large the actual cooking surface is. I have found it most helpful to actually check out the pieces you want to purchase in the store first, then come back here and order, if you like. For that reason alone, they have lost a star. Other than that, it's a fantastic product."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perfect size for pie","review":"I got this skillet so I could bake pies in cast iron.

It's a man skillet IMO. You need a good strong arm to pick it up with one hand. A large, wide object that has been super heated is not a good thing to be just barely carrying around the kitchen. Keep in mind the handle gets hot too so you need pot holders to grab the handle.-Oiling it up every time is somewhat annoying. Have vegetable oil on hand if you plan to use it.Is it worth it?:Yes, everyone should have at least one of these, if anything just to try it out. The Lodge Logic pan is a cheap option for a great solid iron pan. These are expensive but amazon has a good price on them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pre-seasoned you say...not so much.","review":"If these are pre-seasoned, it must be a short season.

OURS BLEW UP. :(","review":"As is true of several other reviewers, my husband and I are fans of Lodge products, and we owned several before buying this skillet. Tonight, maybe the sixth time we have cooked with this pan, my husband was using it to sear vegetables when we heard this loud BANG! like a gunshot--and the pan cracked down the middle nearly from edge to edge. The pan was at room temperature and placed on a cold burner before being heated. Nothing about the conditions of its use should have caused this to happen.Thankfully, there was not enough oil in the pan to cause a grease fire when it ran through onto the burner. However, I will not be buying any more Lodge products and we will be wary of using the ones we have already purchased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Kitchen Pan I own!","review":"I was always skeptical about Cast Iron pans, because they just sounded like so much work to keep up with - seasoning, don't do this, do that -- For years I just stuck to my regular pans thinking I wasn't missing anything. Boy was I wrong!The pre-seasoning part was also a big skeptical point with me, but true to words, it is. I love this pan. It's heavy, but thanks to the helper handle I never feel like I'll drop it. Cleanup is so much easier than I thought, and it really keeps it's tempature, even on a flat electric stove.I have yet to make something in this pan that didn't come out great.

The cooking surface has a \\"rough\\" texture which causes food to stick unnecessarily, whereas it should have been ground smooth before leaving the factory.

The \\"loop\\" handle was a good idea, otherwise most folks would likely strain their wrists trying to lift this pan off the stove with one hand. The construction is heavier and \\"clunkier\\" than it needs to be to perform its job properly. Overall, this product is just plain lousy and cheap.

What a dream pan! Heat is evenly distributed throughout the surface. I got it really hot and then added my olive oil before adding my ingredients. It sears beautifully. I love to deglaze a pan and with a little white wine in this pan all those crusty yummy bits came off and formed the basis for a delicious sauce. Clean up was easy the first time. I oiled it and put a paper towel in the pan before I put the lid on (the lid is a separate purchase). The next time I used it, it was easier to clean. Now it's easier to clean than any teflon pan I've ever owned. Get this pan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pan - recommend 10 inch size","review":"I bought this because of Alton Brown's rave reviews and was not at all disappointed.

It's wonderful, but I wanted something larger. When I got this Lodge skillet I was disappointed to find that I had a much bigger problem with food sticking, even after repeated use and seasoning. I learned that these modern skillets have a much rougher surface than the old skillets and that was creating the sticking problem. I got some sandpaper and after hand sanding the skillet for an hour it's much improved. For the first test of the skillet after sanding, I scrambled some eggs and there was no sticking whatsoever.Next time, I'll search ebay for an antique skillet over a modern one.BTW, I'm of the opinion that you never clean a skillet with water. To clean my skillets, I scrape the pan out with metal spatula and/or a pot scraper, and then wipe the pan with an old rag.

Not really preseasoned","review":"You must cook a lot of fatty food in it to start out. Did my first skittle steaks the other night - utterly fantastic. Took less than 8 minutes to cook, set off all the smoke alrams in the house, but it was the juiciest steak I have ever eaten in my life (medium cooked). I still wipe it down with oil after each cooking and if I ever have the oven on, I put in there for the ride to keep somewhat seasoned. Still not non-stick yet (unless a lot of greese in the pan) so I hope it will work soon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the few pre-seasoned cast iron cookware items that doesn't suck!","review":"Despite some of the bad experiences I've had with pre-seasoned skillets that didn't have a very good seasoning on them, this one was actually pretty good. It's held up for quite a while and the seasoning (original+time added) provides better non-stick cooking than my Teflon coated pans.It also does a great job evening out the pan's temperature. Since I have an awful electric cook top, this is a must-have for me. Finally I can cook up hand-made pirogies without having half of them burn before the other half is cooked at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"not flat","review":"I just purchased this pan here and have used it only once, to cook bacon and sausages this morning.It's not flat on the bottom!!! The grease pools around the edge of the pan.Moreover, it did not cook evenly. Perhaps the diameter is just too great to use at low heat, but I thought the cast iron was supposed to solve that problem with good conduction and heat retention.The surface is not smooth like old cast iron pans, but gritty or sand-like texture. I do not know how this will affect the non-stick quality, but so far, it's not as pretty."},{"rating":"2","title":"useful","review":"The pan is great for frying. It's just so heavy. It's hard lifting it and washing it and storing it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good","review":"Bought this and the 8 inch skillet because I want to get away from teflon. Some things don't seem to cook as well in cast-iron but for the most part they're both great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Had no idea","review":"I had no idea how much I would love this skillet. I bought this as the same time that I bought a set of cooking pans. I use this skillet so much. Had I known, I probably could have bought this one and just a couple of individual pans, instead of a whole set. I can use it for so many things and I just love the cornbread it makes. I am not going to comment on the seasoning as so many others have already. Just know what to expect and the only suprise will be how much you will use it. I don't think it gives an \\"off taste\\" to my food at all. Mmmm, now what to make in it tonight?"},{"rating":"2","title":"An A+ product!","review":"This skillet arrived in two days.

A terrific product = a happy customer."},{"rating":"2","title":"A man's skillet!","review":"Not too heavy and the pre seasoning seemed to hold up pretty well to my first meal of ribeye steaks.

Nothing sticks, easy to clean, cooks evenly and doesn't burn like my teflon did at high temps. I had been skeptical of buying one because I didn't think I would know how to season it correctly, but this pre-seasoned one is holding up well. I just clean it with a brush and hot water, dry it, and spray it with non-stick and it's good to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST skillet for steak!!!","review":"Wow... I cooked two bone-in rib eye steaks with this skillet and it tasted way better than when I ate at a fine dining steak houses. This skillet cooks the steak evenly throughout every part. My only complain is that it is too darn heavy but I guess cast iron skillets are all heavy.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love all the Lodge cast iron products","review":"This is the 4th Lodge Logic brand cast iron pan I have bought and I love them all. This one is perfect for sauteing small items or for cooking 1 egg. Love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great skillet by Lodge","review":"I especially appreciate these small cast iron skillets by lodge. They are wonderful for melting, reheating foods. I don't have to bother with a large skillet, clean up, etc, when wanting to cook or reheat a small amount. They're also fun for baking small amounts of cornbread and cakes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Pan","review":"It's a pretty good cast iron pan. The factory seasoning isn't worth much, and I would love it if it had the old style \\"Machined\\" bottom. Aside from that, it's big enough to handle a lot at once. Heats fairly evenly; though if you have small burners, or bring it up too fast you will get hot spots. And once you give a real layer of seasoning it's pretty non stick. How non stick you ask? As in I have filled the bottom of this large pan in solid egg, and managed to flip it in one piece. No sticking and no breakage. Don't try it until you re season it though. I have also melted cheese right to the bottom, and was able to pull that off in one piece to make a nice crunchy \\"cheese bowl\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love to cook with this pan","review":"When looking to purchase this pan, I read all of the reviews. Amazon has sold this product for several years now and it seemed that most of the issues were some time ago. I purchased this about 6 weeks ago. The pan arrived in perfect condition and I have loved cooking with it ever since. Stove top, oven and both. I have cooked chicken, beef, seafood, oven and stove top casseroles. It heats evenly. If you like to cook with cast iron, this pan is wonderful. I highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, versatile cooking pan","review":"I use this pan almost everyday, for all sorts of items. It is heavy, but what do you expect from a cast iron pan this large. It gets nice an hot and cooks really well. The only issue that I find is that because it is so large, and the flame under it is not nearly that large, it does have an uneven area in the middle where it is MUCH hotter. As long as you keep that in mind when you cook though, you should be fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"6-1/2 inch skillet","review":"After reading reviews I seasoned it again - I decided it wouldn't hurt. and it didn't. The skillet is good when cooking for one. I would recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Past to Present with Cast Iron Skillet","review":"Well, grandmother was right. Everything is better in a good cast iron skillet. Wish I had hers but this one by Lodge is easier to clean for sure. The skillet arrived the next day and was ready to go. I've used it for 1-1/2 inch pork chops on the stove top to brown and then into the 400 degree oven to bake like a roast. Delicious. Skillet was easy to clean and ready to go again. Made cornbread in it and then chicken breasts. Love it! Why did it take me so long to go back from the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best kitchen purchase. Ever","review":"This pan is the only pan I use any more. I just finished washing it tenderly and was saying to myself how much I loved it. It's almost a sickness the way I love my pan. I have a great collection of All-Clad that I have loved, but this thing tops them. It is SO easy to clean, nothing sticks, and it browns to perfection. Unlike stainless steel that has to be seasoned over months of heavy use to get a nice non-stick surface, this pan came seasoned and is so much cheaper. Buy one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"This is the first cast iron pan I have ever had. I was tired of the non stick peeling and was looking for something healthier. After reading about cast iron I decided to give it a try and I love it. It is easy to use and clean and the price on Amazon was about $40 cheaper than at my local kitchen store. After I wash it with hot water and a pot scrubber I completely dry it and just spray it with olive oil for the next use. You have to wait until the temperature is just right before you put in your food or else it will stick. I am now going to buy the bigger one too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great skillet in my arsonal!","review":"Great quality as expected and experienced before from Lodge and Amazon.The seasoning on the skillet is just a start, but I will soon have it like the rest of my cast iron cookware.....Slick as glass and black as coal...If you cant get your cast iron nearly non stick, you just aint doin it right!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect small fry pan","review":"If you are cooking for one, this cannot be beat! Heavy solid and already seasoned and made in the USA."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mighty Skillet","review":"After loving the performance of myLodge Logic Dutch Oven with loop handles, I knew the next thing I wanted to pick up was a good-sized cast iron skillet. I own a few cast iron pans inherited from my grandma, but they were all on the smaller size and I wanted something that could handle a couple of steaks side-by-side.This 12-inch Skillet is a bit of a monster, heavy to wield and almost unmanageable once it is down on the stove, but it delivers some great flavor. Even though I love my Calphalon non-stick pans as well, for putting a crust on a seared steak cast iron can't be beat. Plus, it can go straight off the stove top into the oven for a nice quick finish of the middle.\\"Lodge Logic\\" puts out really nice cast iron cookware, at a reasonable price. I was thrilled with my Dutch Oven, and now I am thrilled with my Skillet as well. Take everyone's advice on seasoning it, and you will have a pan for a lifetime. Or maybe even a couple of lifetimes, when your grandkids inherit it."},{"rating":"2","title":"13.25\\" Skillet","review":"This skillet seems to be a little better made (thicker) than the 15\\" skillet.

I usually cook for a family of 3."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great all purpose cast iron skillet","review":"While this baby is very heavy, the size is perfect for many kitchen tasks. Great for frying but doesn't have a pouring dimple as pictured. Handle is rather short but better as it fits in our oven as well. Wonderful for doing steaks on your stove top. As it's pre-seasoned, you can immediately begin to enjoy it and cleanup is simple but you need to follow the directions. I never realized you should not use soap products on cast iron cookware. This is our first kitchen experience using a cast iron skillet (sure wish I saved some of my Mom's) and we can't figure out how we cooked without it. A must have for anyone who enjoys cooking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice once it's seasoned","review":"I don't know why they say this skillet is pre-seasoned. My test for seasoning is to fry an egg which I did with this skillet when I received it. The egg stuck. I seasoned it and tried again and it was perfect. I have a smaller cast iron skillet which was my mother's until she passed away at 91. It has a wonderful smooth surface. The pre-seasoning on the Lodge gives it a crinkled or bubbled effect. I can't understand why they couldn't have just left it alone, especially since you have to season it yourself anyway. Once you get used to the idea of the surface not being smooth, it's a great skillet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cast Iron Pots","review":"Purchased Lodge 12 Inch Skillet and Cover. Used to make Pommes Anna recipe. Though it cooked well had to put the final product under the broiler after removing and inverting from the skillet to brown the \\"top\\".

I learned how to use it, I treat it right, and it pays me back with the best performance and most delicious dishes ever. Dutch babies, giant chocolate chip cookies, banana bread, apple bread, searing salmon or tuna, any style eggs, caramelizing onions, heating tortillas, pancakes, fried plantains....... perfection. If you learn how to use it with your particular heating element and how to care for it well- perfection. Bought my 12\\" Lodge from Amazon and I couldn't be happier with it. Will buy more. Would like to have a smaller skillet for smaller jobs (just scrambling a few eggs, sauteing a few veggies). Take the time to learn how to use and maintain it, and it will reward you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Skillet, The best part is that its MADE IN USA","review":"The skillet is great for for frying huge amounts of chicken cutlets when you want them all done at the same time. The quality of the cast heats evenly and stays hot as you add food into the skillet. Its much better then using teflon... (Did you know if you burn teflon it kills birds, especially parrots) Well I never liked cooking in teflon and I have always loved a set of skillets that was passed down from my great grandmother all the way down to me. I am able to sear meats and gently cook scrambled eggs to perfection. Its important to realize, looking back to people that traveled the country on horse back carried a cast iron skillet and a dutch oven... Those same skillets are still in use today.. Try so to the same about your teflon or stainless steel pan from china. Just a good american made cast iron skillet and its very affordable to!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shipped with broken handle?","review":"I'm not sure exactly how this is possible, but when I opened the package yesterday, I pulled out an extremely heavy, solid cast iron pan.

After reading many other reviews I didn't have much expectation of the pre-seasoning and after having the product in hand I decided quickly to start the seasoning from scratch. I've used cast iron before so I was surprised to see the pre-seasoning remove as easily as it did with hot running tap water and rough scrubby pad, no matter though, the intent was to remove it. Since then and with heavy use the seasoning has been building up very nicely and the cooking experience has been exactly as was expected. It's awesome to go straight from having cooked a full meal in here to throwing in water, baking powder and flour to stir up an awesome gravy right after. Sure this could be done in any pan you cook in but it's just so much more satisfying done in a cast iron skillet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Woot","review":"For a simple skillet this one rocks. Worth the money and makes my food taste delicious :) To take care of it I rub oil on the inside when not in use. Don't scrub with a lot of soap and water.

Be sure to dry off completely of water."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Value-Right size!","review":"Lodge Logic has a good reputation for their cast iron products. We have a wood stove and I was looking for cast iron products that we could use if there was a power outage of some kind.

I wished it was longer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't hesitate, read this book now!","review":"What a page turner, nothing else got accomplished for a couple of days because I couldn't put it down! Set on the homefront in the Civil War, and written as a series of letters, you will enjoy it, especially if you favor historical fiction and like old time crafts. This was the first of Sandra Dallas' books that I read, and I have liked everything she has written, but Alice's Tulips remains my favorite. Do you know how sometimes you read something, and afterwards think to yourself, \\"how could I have not discovered this author, and this wonderful book, before?\\" Well, Dallas and Alice's Tulips are in that category. In fact, I wish I hadn't read this book yet, so that I could re-live the pleasure of that delightful very first read. I have lent this book to several people, and they have all loved it too. Don't deny yourself, get a copy of this book and read it now!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointment","review":"This is a story of Alice, the wife of a Union soilder and herstuggles during the Civil War. It is told in letter fashion. We(the readers) read the letters Alice has written to her sister over a 2 1/2 year period. I have read all of Sandra Dallas' works and this was a disappointment. It took story lines out of her other books and placed them in a Civil War setting. The \\"letters\\" included lengthy quotations of conversations and copies of other letters therefore making them unlikely to be in a letter. There were many explicit references to sex in the letters which were not necessary.It should have been written in a different format. The \\"letters\\" did not seem like letters. The characters could have been developed better. It was easy to guess the mystery and know what was going to happen next. I would suggest reading Dallas' other works and leaving this one on the shelf.

It was my first of Dallas's books and I just couldn't wait to read more. It was such a satisfying and engrossing story. The historical background was facinating as I love to learn about the civil war. The main character, Alice, was so honest one couldn't help but love her. A story of integrity and friendship, love and tolerance. Very genuine and beautiful. I love the tender and ever-changing relationship between Alice and her mother-in-law. Although some may feel there are too many events in some of Dallas's books to make them believable I disagree. That is what makes them so entertaining and delightful. This book is one of my all time favorites, and I read a lot! A true love story of dedication and sacrifice.

All-in-all a fascinating read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to her usual standard","review":"I was so thrilled when I saw that Sandra Dallas had a new book out, having enjoyed all three of her previous novels.

It was as though she wanted to publish another book without having to go to much work so she just rehashed her previous books.The best part of the book was the quilting information interspersed thoughout.Don't make the mistake I did and buy this in hardback...borrow it from the library for a light, marginally entertaining afternoon read when you have nothing better to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Written in letter form....","review":"This book follows three years in the life of one woman, married young and left with her mother-in-law as her huband goes off to fight in the Civil War. Naive at the beginning, and a voracious flirt, she soon learns the consequences of her actions. Though I really enjoyed this book, at times I found Alice to be so extremely naive that it was almost unbelievable. To be living in such a rough/hard time, it was amazing that she could remain with such an innocent attitude for so long. What really saved this book was the twist at the end....a man is found murdered and several women claim to have done it. It was a real twist to learn what really happened!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Civil War Letters","review":"Alice's Tulips is the story of two sisters during the American Civil War. The book is told through a series of letters, mostly from Alice. She talks about the pain of having her new husband go off to the war and then the terrible experince of lossing their baby while he is gone. She lives with his mother who appears cold and almost indifferent but the reader eventually finds out that appearances are not all they seem. Dallas shows clearly how difficult it was for women of this time, how vulnurable they were without their men folk and the hardships they faced. The characters are well developed and the action is steady and fast--staying home to take care of the homestead is anything but easy. Anyone interested in this time period will be fascinated, most especially at women's roles of this time.

Considering that, how can anyone take this guy seriously? This type of so-called advice will only fill your head with bad ideas and ruin you for years to come. Instead, I suggest, you look up writer/directors like Joe Carnahan and find out how they did it and what they have to say. Listen to talented and accomplished filmmakers who are actually doing it (and then devise your own system), but stay away from guys like Syd Field who has never written anything that was produced.

The hints and tricks that I found to be very helpful:1. Use Cake-Release or something similar. It's a butter/flour combo. Brush it into every single little crevice.2. Use a specific bundt cake batter. That type of cake unmolds more easily.3. Follow the directions in letting the cake cool for 10 minutes in the pan, and then unmold. This helps the cake retain its shape by cooling slightly, and the butter is still liquid so it hasn't hardened into the pan."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lovely pan-with a flaw","review":"This is a lovely, well-made pan-but it has a flaw. Each cake I've cooked it it has overflowed into the oven through the funnel. The first cake I cooked was a homemade pound cake, so I thought maybe there was too much batter, which was strange because I had cooked this cake in a smaller bundt pan with no problem before. Then I tried a box cake mix and the same thing happened. Now, why this happens with this pan and not my other bundt pans is a mystery to me, especially since this pan is actually larger. It has to be in the design. The next time I am going to plug the hole with a piece of foil. If that doesn't work I am giving up on this item because I am tired of cleaning my oven!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rose cake pan bakes up a perfect bouquet!","review":"I bought my rose Bundt pan last spring to make a cake for my mom for Mother's Day. She loved it, and so has everyone since then that i've baked a cake for with it. It just has a really cool looking shape to it, and it really truely does look like a rose, not just some big cakey blob when it comes out of the pan. When we bake with it, we just brush a little butter or shortening inside of it, and the cakes always pop out with no trouble at all, because of the nonstick coating inside of it. Try adding a little red food coloring to a yellow or white cake batter to make it look like a real rose. Another thing we do is put real leaves around the edge of the cake when we serve it, for extra pizzazz--it looks awesome."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cake always stick","review":"I own this pan and the Bavarian and Chrysanthemum models too. I think Nordicware makes very innovative designs which makes their flaw even more disappointing. After a few uses, everytime I bake with these pans the cake always stick. I grease AND flour these pans before baking and the cake still sticks. One reviewer said to LIBERALLY grease these pans, but I don't understand why there's so much work for greasing a \\"non-stick\\" pan. I had less worries when using a regular tin pan with no \\"non-stick\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"This pan does not work","review":"I have tried to use this pan over and over, and it does not work. I have coated it with every type of non-stick grease I could think of, and the cake completely sticks every time. It even takes 3 - 4 washings in the dishwasher, plus hand scrubbing to get the pan clean again. I keep trying to get the pan to work because it was an expensive gift from my daughter, but I've given up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must use Baker's Joy!","review":"I have used this pan 4 times, and have finally perfected it on the 4th attempt. I swore that if it stuck on my last attempt that I would through the pan out the window. The first several times I only greased the pan and the cakes stuck 3 of the times. The key is using \\"Baker's Joy\\", a cooking spray you can find in your local grocery store or through the Nordicware website. This spray greases and flours in one. I used it last night and my cake literally fell out of the pan--it was wonderful. It also made the pan cleanup 100 times easier. Also, you can only fill the pan 3/4 of the way or it will spill over."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Beautiful!","review":"This pan made a gorgeous cake (using a plain box mix)! I made sure to spray the pan with Baker's Joy (has the flour mixed in already), the cake came out with no problems at all. I made a strawberry cake (for the pink rose affect), made a simple glaze using pureed frozen strawberries w/juice and powdered sugar. Then I added under the cake some hydrenga leaves from my garden for a true rose affect. It turned out so lovely. If you are considering this pan my recommendation is to go for it, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addictive","review":"I have not heard an album this great in years.

About two hundred pages into the book I reached a dreaded point; the point where you are not far enough into the story to actually accept giving up on the book, and subsequently the point where you are too far to accept the fact that the first two hundred pages were a waste of time. The character development was non-existent. I didn't even feel like I knew these people. The ending was even worse. It was as if the author got to a point and finally said, \\"this book is long enough, let's end it here,\\" and snap!, the book ends just like that. I gave the book two stars simply because I finished it. All I can basically say is do not waste your time. There are too many other great (even good) books out there.

And the vignettes become repetitive, but entertaining nonetheless.What is intriguing is that Paris was the centre for art, culture and experimentation from 1900 thru the 1930's, but was gradually replaced by New York (the occupation during the war accomplished the final transfer)."},{"rating":"1","title":"conair straightener","review":"I was excited when I first got it but then i noticed it had curved plates and got sad because thats not what i wanted. but i already opened it so it was too late to return it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give it a try","review":"This iron was surprisingly good!

And, yes, there is often a definite link between sadism and sexuality. But that's all besides the main point. There are many versions of this tale available. What sets \\"Horrible Secret\\" apart is the author's use of multiple perspectives: a contemporary curiosity seeker, a descendant of Madame Delphine, a disgruntled neighbor, and, most importantly, the 12-year-old daughter of Madame Delphine. The author's emphasis is on the \\"secret\\" and its effect on others. Incidentally, the short story (but not the screenplay) is available for free on the Net. So, readers can preview the book simply by spending two minutes on a web search without paying a cent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much smaller than I anticipated for a child sized hat.","review":"This hat is very small.

I read every page of it and worked through every example, and by the end of the week I understood the basics of using SAS, but not much else. This is an excellent book for someone who has never seen SAS before in their life; it assumes no prior knowledge and teaches everything from scratch. However, your average SAS user isn't going to be using this program to simply calculate means and variances, and this is where this book fails. The most complex statistics this book covers are simple things, like means and variances, and it is necessary to purchase further manuals if you are interested in learning more advanced techniques. By all means, buy this book, but be aware that it is likely that you will need to buy other books to accompany it."},{"rating":"2","title":"SAS Primer book","review":"This book offers instruction through definitions and examples. I constantly return to it (since im still learning how to use the program). The way that the chapters and index are listed makes this book feel like an excellent reference guide.

I never seem to get things on the first try and this book , through the content orginization, allows me to find and return to the exact section I need to re-read. The price is worth it in terms of both the content presentation and the chapter organization. My favorite part of the book is the example section. You can actually see the code needed to carry out the commands as well as the results that the commands would give. Coming from SPSS (menu driven format) I was very fearful of having to learn a computer language. This book took that aprehension away in no time.

Fame and fortune follow. This story has been done over and over and been done better. The opening court scene is a ploy to set up animosity between attorney Ben Kincaid and the prosecutor, his former friend, and is just plain silly. There are attempts to bolster the main plot with side issues...Kincaid's sister unexpectedly leaves her baby with him...his mother shows up...his ex-brother-in-law is tracking a child molester. The main story line, which was mildly interesting, could have been expanded and stood on it's own.

Lasts maybe 4 hours of continuous play, which isn't long enough for me.- Fit is horrible. My ears ache after wearing them for 15 minutes. They don't sit on my ears right, constantly having to fiddle with them and adjust them.I would not buy these headphones again and would not recommend you do so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Headset - Love its light weight!","review":"The headset works quite well. I am most impressed by its light weight. The sound quality is very good. You do need to adjust the ear loops for a comfortable fit. Once you do that the headphones are very pleasant to wear for long periods of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not for recording use.","review":"I had intended to use these as part of a home recording studio setup -- not having wires in the way as I played guitar with headphones on sounded like a great idea!Sadly, that doesn't work. It turns out that the sound that comes out of the earpieces is delayed, by as much as half a second. So if you're trying to hear yourself as you play, you'll find what you hear isn't what you're playing, but rather what you played half a second ago. Which is rubbish for recording.Otherwise, they're great, ideal for walking around with your ipod, etc. Still glad I got these ... lack of wires makes a surprising difference, the sound is okay, and they're comfortable and unobtrusive. Recommended for listening to music, but not for making it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound great but VERY uncomfortable","review":"I was torn if to buy these or not; everyone admitted they sounded great, but half the ppl said they were uncomfortable and the other half not. I was hoping to be in the latter...not. I can barely make it through 30 mins and then they become unbearable to wear. i have tried adjusting, to no avail. unfortunately Buy. com will not exchange for a different model(even though it's only been 3 weeks since shipping), so Im basically 90 bucks out of luck. if u happen to be among the ones that can wear these comfortably, then you'll be probably be happy. they cut out (for a sec or two), but not that frequently to really be bothered by"},{"rating":"2","title":"Headphones","review":"These headphones do hurt after a while.

I am now on my 5th, yes 5th, pair of these poorly constructed head phones and while the sound is adequate they continually stop working. I am not working out, running, or doing any motions which may seem aggressive so if that's your purpose then stay away. When traveling I have a backpack designed to carry photographic equipment into the field and the headphones have a small space designed for a lens, so needless to say its highly protected and padded.

Its a great concept but everything kept going wrong! They are uncomfortable if you wear them for long periods. The range was horrible. I would have the adapter and my ipod clipped to my belt and wear the headphones; when I would bend down the music would stop. I believe (if I remember correctly) the manual said it had a battery like of 6 hours, I had only 1.5 hours.

They sound good, have a bass boost option which is nice. Other people have said that they are hard to figure out how to get them on and off, not true. Just read the instructions that comes with them and it clearly states that you have to hold the buttons on the doongle and the headset to turn them on and off. I wear them around the house and they work well, again as long as they dont go through many walls. They also phased in and out slightly when I had them in my pocket when I was walking around.

No, I'm not talking about over the head versus behind the neck (behind the neck is the only way to wear these due to the small band *won't fit over your head and reach your ears* so there is no mistaking there). I'm talking about wearing the 'phones not only behind the neck, but UPSIDE DOWN compared to the way everyone is used to. OH SO THAT'S WHAT THE LOOPS ARE FOR! To hook over the TOP of your ears!

The construction is solid and definitely much better than the less expensive model with the plastic band support that easily breaks. The controls (volume, on/off and base) are simple and straight forward. The duration time of the built-in batteries seems to vary depending on time in between uses.Overall these are good headphones and definitely better than the hassles of having wires to deal with. Maybe Logitech can get the comfort value figured out for the next model."},{"rating":"1","title":"UNCOMFORTABLE - NOT GREAT SOUND","review":"I have to agree with most reviewers: These headphones are uncomfortable and the sound is not great. It's hard to understand because I have behind the head headphones from Sennheiser (portable with wires) which are very comfortable with good sound, and also remote headphones from Sennheiser which have much better sound than Logitek (unfortunately they are not designed for a MP3 player).It's too bad because I've always had good results with Logitek."},{"rating":"2","title":"Distance leaves something to be desired, quality great","review":"My son really enjoys using these headphones when paired with my laptop computer. He can play all his music while not worrying about wearing cords and having his earbuds fall out of his ears. Overall, they're very comfortable to wear, pair up nicely with bluetooth enabled devices like my new laptop, and the sound quality is excellent. My main complaint is that as with any other bluetooth device the range is not spectacular. I wish the sound could extend to the yard so he can mow the lawn while sporting these, but for now he'll just have to use his mp3 player for that. My husband originally purchased these to help block out household noises while on the phone with clients, but he usually forgets to pair them with his cell phone when he comes home so my son has ended up inheriting them. Also, they're very durable."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very good","review":"I am not a sound expert. I bought these about 9 months ago to be able to walk on my treadmill and listen to my stereo. The treadmill is in the bedroom and stereo is in the living room. When the sound is working the quality is fine, but the problem is it cuts in and out often. It has gotton to the point that I have quit using them.Also they are not very comfortable to wear. I pull them down to the bottom of my ear, which has made them more comfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elastic loops for ears","review":"Overall the sound is nice, but the comfort level is terrible. I think it's for specific types of \\"skinny\\" heads. After about an hour, I can't wear them because there is zero padding.Also, I've had mine for about a year, and after about 3 months, the elastic pieces that loop onto your ear gets streched out and constantly comes loose from the headset.

It is much better than RF headphones atleast no hiss sounds though the range is less but at least covers my small home. It is much comparable to good quality wired headphones, the bass is good and it is easy to pair with dongle.Few points that could have helped improved this product and raise my ratings are being more comfortable to wear, you can't wear it for more than 1 hr without pain ;) second improve battery life ( mine gives 6-7 hrs) and lastly USB charging, its charger is custom so I have to carry it with me always.

Easy controls and good sound. Takes a little getting used to on the ears. I highly reccommend them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problem with Quality Control","review":"I tried two sets of these headphones. The first stopped charging when plugged in. The second just stopped transmitting sound. Both failed within the first week. Other than that, they are a little uncomfortable, but not much. They work pretty well, but they have a fair number of dropouts. Sound quality is decent as is the volume.

Now of course I've given up on them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short battery life","review":"I have a small MP3 player that I clip to my belt at the gym and thought this would be a great complement to elimnate pesky cords.

I called Logitech and they confirmed it is susceptible to this if not drained completely prior to recharging.

I can see how the headset might make your ears a little sore after long usage but I really think that it is going to be a matter of breaking them and my ears in. The transmitter that goes into the iPod is a little bigger than I had imagined but at the price of getting rid of wires well worth it.

Excellent sound quality, solid 30' range in areas you would expect a lot of interference and pretty comfortable.The deal breaker for us is the short battery life. Can't get more than two hours out of the system without a recharge. To add insult to injury, when we called Logitech to find out if we could use a portable battery pack to extend the life the support tech was rude and indifferent. Basically, acted like everyone should know these things have a short battery life and there is no way around it.The Cyber Acoustics ACM 500 headphones look like they have a similar form factor and are rated at a 7 hr battery life.

This has happened two times and is soooo frustrating, especially since the other phones in the house that are corded could not be used.You can't use the 2 phones at once so that is a bit of an inconvenience as well. The reception is ok but it has it's moments. I have had the phone for about 6 months so it's broken in and the honeymoon's over.

It sounds like minimal techno, acid house, 8-bit Tetris synths, and vocal-driven deep house put in a blender that can't quite liquefy. Producers like Dub Taylor and Luomo do this stuff smoothly, but it's real jagged here. Sometimes it works, and sometimes it doesn't. There are few things like grooving along to cool hipster Kompakt techno, and then getting hit in the face by male divas and house pianos. The brazen juxtaposition of analog and electronic elements is charming, though, and strangely addictive.

A local Bay Area group led by Shirley Muramoto on koto with Alex Baum on bass, Matt Eakle on flute, Jeff Massanari, guitar, and Vince Delgado's varied ethnic percussion, their light-hearted, lyrical melodies are somewhat akin to Andreas Vollenweider's New Age jazz but are more mainstream jazz with a Japanese flavor.

The three episodes included in this DVD edition are: (1) Arthur's Lost library book-about Arthur losing the latest Scare-Your-Pants-Off book from the library; (2) D.W.'s Imaginary Friend-D.W.'s new imaginary friend, Nadine, moves into the house and follows D.W everywhere, even to the Amuzement Park, much to Arthur's dislike; (3) D.W.'s Libary Card-about D.W. getting her first library card."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the map?","review":"The Great Fire of London by Neil Hanson traces the progress of the conflagration street by street, building by building on all its fronts. Unfortunately the publishers did not include any useful maps so the reader could follow the progress. This oversight detracts fatally from Hanson's exciting and dramatic narrative.Hanson does not give a proper examination of the long term effects of the fire. His examination of short terms effects is cursory. The book ends with a discussion of pyromania.The Great Fire of London is enjoyable (what a complement to give a disaster), but not completely satisfying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much fiction","review":"Too much novelesque fictional fluff obscuring the facts. A whole paragraph devoted to how someone tosses a loaf of bread is too much. I fell asleep after page 4 and couldn't go on. I want to learn about the fire not read a bedtime story about 17th century England. You can tell the author did a lot of research, it's a shame that he fluffed it up so much with his own fictional image of 17th century London life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware S & W knives","review":"I bought a Smith & Wesson folding lock back with black handle nearly like this one. It was the Cuttin' Horse. The handle broke in no time. The seller (dealer) said I would have to deal with S & W for repair or replacement. And then S & W said that I would have to deal with the knife manufacter. And the run around starts. Now I just hang it on the wall to remind me to never do business with knives from S & W again, and any other items that advertises S & W that they don't actually make them selves.

As a child I really enjoyed theses stories, but this version just really turned me off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warped well beyond needed..I would rate it lower if I could..","review":"Wow this is a warped book. This book contains two versions of the classic text Struwwelpeter. One is the classic Old German version. The other is a more modern gore filled crap-tastrophe. The Old German text is like Aesops Fables on acid. It's good but you have to ready for it. The more modern version is 100% overkill. It is a badly done, tasteless piece of crap. To sum it up I threw the book out because I wouldn't want my relatives to come across it in my house. In the middle of a book is a S&M horrorfest of a picture. (Those warped gore fans who might be intrigued, trust me it's lame and creepy) If you are interested in this book seek out a classic version of the book with the original illustrations. Leave this crap alone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Updated version and based on original","review":"This version is a letter sized paperback, with heavy, slick paperused. It claims that the only other english translation is severely edited. Sarita Vendetta offers up her new illustration,and are just as, if not more disturbing than ever. There is just a hint of Goreyin her drawings. The latter part of the book offers drawings\\"based\\" on the originals of Hoffman. So if you are looking for something old and something new this may be for you. Also theIntroduction by Jack Zipes gives biographical info on Hoffmanand his writing of Struwwelpeter."},{"rating":"2","title":"So glad this is on DVD now","review":"Anyone who likes Adult Swim's Home Movies and stand-up comedy will love Dr. Katz.

I cannot believe she is allowed to get away with this trash she calls cooking. What is with that mess she calls a stage cake? just a bunch of canned icing thrown on some boxed cake mix and decorated with derranged looking plastic clowns. PLease Sandra Lee stop insulting us with your ridiculous recipes."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Advertised","review":"I have a whole host of cookbooks in my pantry. I am glad I added this one to the collection. I have made 4 or 5 recipes out of it and they have turned out exactly as pictured, and tasted wonderful. There are clearly recipes in this book I will never make and that don't appeal to me - just like every other book in my pantry. But I say without a doubt that this book met my expetations. As a busy mom of twin toddlers I for one apprecaited the shortcuts, the simplicity, and the call-out of specific brand names so I knew exactly what to get. The recipes are quick, easy, and turn out exactly as pictured even if you aren't Martha Stewart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"All of Sandra Lee's books are beautifully done! I love how she has a picture of every recipe in the book, makes you want to get into the kitchen and start cooking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Time Saver for Busy Cooks!","review":"I absolutely loved this book! I have made several recipes form it and have had each one turn out as delicious as the next. I personally enjoy the brand name recommendations so that I can be sure to get the right product, although I will substitute from the store brand if possible, to save money. As I am not a creative person when it comes to cooking desserts, I love how fancy the finished products look. I get rave reviews from my husband and my children. And each one takes such a short time to prepare, it makes me feel almost guilty! Definately try this product if you are like me and love desserts, but don't want to spend all day making a fabulous one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhealthy, Unappetizing","review":"I got this book because dessert making is not my thing. I wanted some easy, good recipes. I was very disappointed. I cannot understand why anyone would want to eat or serve this stuff. Containered frosting and refrigerator dough are pretty much fake food. Some of these desserts, like the Bunny Cake, are embarrassingly silly. Nothing I tried from this book came out like the photos and they all were at best, bland, or at worst, awful tasting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sugar overload!!","review":"As I browsed through her cookbook for a possible addition to my marathon cookie making week, I noticed that her recipes were as much work or MORE than recipes that I was using from Gourmet, Bon Appetit, and other magazines and cookbooks that you would assume to be \\"labor-intensive.\\" I used one recipe from this cookbook- harvest walnut. Compared to the 6 other cookies I served one night, the harvest walnut tasted so much like preservatives and butter (NOT a good thing!), that I was tempted to toss them out. The rest of her recipes are laden with sugar and obvious preservatives, and some of the recipes are just gross looking with the amount of frosting or pre-packaged foods-- I HATE those store-bought packaged muffins, and she uses things like that all the time! Gross!Do yourself a favor and stop using the prepackaged mixes and try doing it from scratch-- it will be well worth your time and this cookbook is a waste of time, money, and your health!"},{"rating":"1","title":"More sour than sweet...","review":"I had a good laugh reading this in the bookstore the other day. Just looking at the pictures made me want to puke. Crisco for lipgloss? Chocolate box with \\"mousse\\"? Truffles made out of frosting and powdered sugar? You call those frickin' truffles? Seems more like a fat kid's dream come true than gourmet cooking.What really took the cake (okay, pun intended!) was the infamous Kwanzaa cake. If my memory serves me correct, that freak of nature had Corn Nuts on it! Corn Nuts! On a damn cake! That was about as bad as those powdered-sugar-frosting confections that she calls truffles.Save your money and don't give this so-called \\"cook\\" any more money than she's already made off this shill. Dig out your old cook books and make healthy, homemade recipes, food that won't prematurely drive you to your grave. The Joy of Cooking, Fannie Farmer, and all those good old cookbooks are your best bets. Heck, even the White Trash Cookbook is better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific Dessert Book!","review":"I have always been cooking challenged in the kitchen. So when I tried making something from this book, I was sceptical. But the recipe turned out terrific! My date loved it, too, and couldn't believe I made it. I had to show him the book to prove it! I can't wait to try another recipe from this book. Maybe my inability to cook days are over!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I recommend this book to everyone!","review":"I have heard so much about this book, and was so excited to run out and buy it! I am so glad that I did! I bought it just in time for Halloween. My children and I enjoyed making the Halloween treats together so much that we have made cooking in the kitchen a weekly family event!Ofcourse the crunchy dounut eyeballs were their favorite. We made the caramel parfaits, (which were so easy) and the pumkin cake with the ghost on top. Only you Sandra would have thought of that! The recipes are so simple and easy that I would recommend this book to everyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Breathtakingly Bad","review":"OK, she recommends using flavored Crisco as a lipgloss!!That should be enough to scare you away .. but there's more. And it's NOT good.Cool Whip, oodles of canned frosting, canned biscuits. Dream Whip!! Yes, they still make it and she commands you to use it.Anyone with a first grade education can buy an angel food cake and slather it with canned frosting. You do not need her 10 or so \\"recipes\\" for how to do this.This is not a book for busy people who want to make something quick and tasty. It's a book for people would apply canned frosting to twinkies and serve it to guests."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your time or money","review":"This book is filled with recipes using name brand pre-processed food items. You don't eat a dessert everyday so why not use fresh ingredients without all the trans-fats, additives and preservatives that pre-processed food contain. Her idea of the a berry cobbler used canned berries and packaged sugar cookie dough, that would be so cloyingly sweet my teeth hurt just reading it. Please do not waste your money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did she write this on a dare?","review":"I think somebody must have dared her to use as many brand name products as possible. I've got nothing against using mixes, but she takes it to extremes - in less time than it takes to thaw Cool Whip, you can toss cream and sugar into a mixer and have real whipped cream; if you have a stand mixer, you don't even have to pay much attention to it. And if you don't have a stand mixer, you should - that's something that really saves time and money. If you make desserts often, \\"from scratch\\" (generally just sugar, eggs, and flavoring) is cheaper than Cool Whip and frosting cans, even when you include the cost of the mixer.Save your money - look on the sides of your cake mixes, they generally have ideas just as good as hers."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wish there was a rating lower than 1...","review":"if I could use negative number I would. This woman and her way of not cooking is meant to encourage a distain for cooking. Too many people already avoid cooking and feed their families a steady diet of bad food, takeout and foods filled with fat, sugar and preservatives.Please, if you love your family, don't buy this book. It belongs in the garbage right beside Sandra Lee's food."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bah.","review":"This dessert book was awful. The bizarre combination of ingredients left you with a big blob of \\"too sweet\\" in your mouth. The other posts I've read here are obviously employed by the \\"lifestylist\\" herself. Bah Humbug. This book goes in the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Run! Don't Walk away from this book","review":"Amazon really needs to let you give a negative rating. I've seen the \\"author\\" on Food Network and was amazed at what a horrible show she has. When I saw her book I had to check it out. It's just as bad. If you really don't have time to cook do yourself and your family a favor and find a good local bakery, or at least choose Sara Lee over Sandra Lee.P.S. If you think that Katie Couric really does her own cooking I have a some beachfront property in Oklahoma I'd love to sell you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Waste Your Time or Money","review":"What a pointless book! It is clearly nothing more than a marketing ploy. After all, why make something using expensive, bland pre-fab ingredients that will not save you any time and are expensive. In most instances cooking from scratch will at worst take no longer, will cost signifigantly less and will contain higher quality ingredients. You have to ask yourself if this woman actually cooks. And then to promote the pollution of the environment by suggesting disposable dinnerware as a matter of course so as to save washing up...? If you want a pre-fab food book, there must be others out there that are better but there are certainly none worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Second one I've bought.","review":"The first one I bought came in a gold panning kit but my son in-law didn't have one so I bought this one for him.

Today we heard a loud crash. One of the globes had shattered into our sink, cracking the sink which will need to be replaced. We own many light fixtures that involve a globe being held in by screws and have never had a problem before. Inspection of the fixture shows that all the screws are still holding the ring of the glass as should be, so we ruled out installation error. The globe seems to have simply shattered and fallen. This isn't the cheapest fixture to begin with, so I would expect significantly better quality. Now I'm out a sink on top of the cost of this fixture, which I'm hesitant to leave installed after the sink is replaced, as I'll continually fear the day when the second globe will drop.

I quite quickly upgraded to champion plastic, but was faced with a choice, stay with my 150 that I was throwing so well with, or upgrade to around a 170. I decided to stick with the 150, and man am I glad I did. I really perfected my form with this disc, its light enough that you don't have to huck it down the course, meaning you can get your grip, stance, and throwing technique down before having to work on your power, which should be worked on after you become aware of what you're doing.

I decided for the Uniden because it looked nicer, lighter and the 2.4GHz is newer technology. Well, the problem is that this is the same frequency used by the 802.11 Wireless Cards. So, to make it simple, if you have a laptop with a Wireless Card (or intend to have one) do not buy 2.4GHz technology phones. Keep using the 900Mhz stuff.BTW, I called Uniden and they confirmed this story and told me there is nothing that could be done.

I highly recommend this cordless phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great phone except jack connector shorted out in 3 months.","review":"No complaints about the phone except that it's now useless after 3 months because of poor engineering with the headset jack.

First of all, I thought the phone would be much bigger...the main reason for not picking the Plantronics.The bigger issue is that I have used the phone for under three months and the connection between the phone and the headset has become loose. My phone conversations got very static filled at first and now the phone just cuts in and out!! I am so disappointed.To make matters worse, their warranty requires you to UPS the phone in yourself and then wait for it to be repaired and sent back...unless you want to pay ..., and receive a \\"like new\\" phone in return.

Director (and cameraman) John Dirlam gives the film a clever twist with style under George Putnam's screenplay. It works reasonably well due to good performances from both leads. It may not be the film alive, but I recommend it to anyone in the mood for a late night thriller.BTW: Yes, there are lovemaking scenes!

I don't think that the average person is turned off by learning about investing; I do think the average person is turned off by having to cut their way through dense jungles of jargon and puffery to get to some sort of universal truth about investing.

Burton concludes Investment Titans with observations about common themes - diversifying, investing now and staying invested. This solid book avoids repetition by focusing on different investment issues for different investors.

It is a rambling ambient composition cut from the same mould as Sylvian's earlier collaborations with Holger Czukay (\\"Plight and Premonition\\" and \\"Flux and Mutability\\"). Consequently, I was just as disappointed with \\"Approaching Silence\\" as I was with its two ambient predecessors. There are times when I like ambient noise -- just not one hour of it. And I certainly find no need for three albums of it. After about 15 minutes, I wished I were listening *to* silence.This, coming on the heels of the news that Weatherbox would not be re-released after all, was quite a let down.Here's hoping the the next time David decides to get ambient, he balances it with vocals and melody as well as he did in \\"Gone to Earth\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"One star is too much","review":"Like nearly everything that Mr. Sylvian has recorded since 1988, this record is terrible.

I give the book 2 stars for the other 2 stories in the book that are not Madeline stories, but are quite cute. If you purchase this book, you may want to 'write your own story' to go along with the pictures in Madeline in America.

I bought this phone from [local store](before realizing it was here at a lower price), so I was going to return it to [store]and then repurchase it from Amazon.com..... HOWEVER, that is not going to happen now.. This is ABSOLUTELY the worst performing cordless phone I have EVER had. I live in a old farm house (so the walls are rather thick); however, my old 2.4 GHz Panasonic had no problems and neither did my 900 MHz phone... The only reason why I was upgrading was to add multi-room support- I will DEFINITELY go with a different brand now (possibly to a 2.4 GHz multi-room)!!! I cannot believe how poor the reception was on this phone- everything was fine IF you stayed in the same room, then things got worse the next room over and finally, just two rooms from the base, it would get so bad it would almost disconnect!!!!!!

However, the range is not twice that of 2.4GHz phones. In fact, I would say that it is worse. I suspect the fact that it has no raised antennaes on the handsets or the base unit contributes to the poor range and sound quality. RADIO DEVICES MUST HAVE ANTENNAES TO RECEIVE/TRANSMIT SIGNALS, UNIDEN!!!One thing to definetely consider is that you cannot use both handsets at the same time!!! This completely nullifies the point of getting a dual handset setup.Batteries...This thing seems to go through a full charge liek crazy, even when it is not in use.I would avoid this product at this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had it one year and audio cuts out -- no help from Uniden!","review":"I've had this expensive system for one year and it is currently not functional.

I literally had to just hang up on everybody i called because they couldn't even hear me and i couldn't hear them. I was very disappointed with this phone.

The sound on the handsets is like that on a wired phone; very clear. And they work flawlessly everywhere in our apartment. There is no loss of performance or static anywhere. Three speakerphones (each handset as well as the base) is a great convenience. Also,we find the ability to store 100 different numbers in each handset a plus; especially when they are used by two different people.The answering machine also has excellent sound and is easy to use. Was surprised to read that the message capacity is approximately ten minutes, and consider this a limitation. Most of the current machines have a capacity of 15 to 30 minutes. However, if we keep up with the answering machine on a daily basis, the ten minute capacity should suffice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great looker but doesn't perform.","review":"Bought this phone almost based solely on looks. Probably the best looking cordless phone on the market right now. HOWEVER, the range on this phone is HORRIBLE. It is much worse than my 2Ghz phones. I actually found out that the 5Ghz range is probably supposed to be worse than 2Ghz since that's what I found out while I was setting up the wireless network in our house.

It's been a workhorse and I love using it. Having said that...the only real problem I have with it...is that I can ONLY have 2 headsets with this system. Because of this I will probably be changing my phones soon to the TRU8885 series which supports up to 10 handsets.I haven't yet tried them, but if you're in the market for a new phone system I would probably check out the TRU8xxx series phones instead (i.e. TRU8885-2 or similar - all of the TRU8xxx models are the same handsets, as each other NOT the TRU5885, but come in multiple configurations depending on whether you want an asnwering machine, the number of handsets sold in a pkg, etc...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good, not perfect","review":"Good:- Like the hi-tech looks- Good hand-feel- Good sound quality- Dual hand sets are great- Sound quality of the answering machine is good.Bad:- The orange display is OK, but don't love it.- No paging or waki-talki between the two hand sets.

I actually work in the telecommunications industry, and I sell several different phones...this one beats all of them!

I was initially skeptical, because of some people's reviews I saw on here being less than positive, however, like the old saying goes, everyone has an opinion (it doesn't mean it's right). I'm just glad I go with my instinct...the range and reception on this phone is phenomenal! The ring tones add a nice \\"perk\\" to it, and especially since you can program a specific ring tone for specific people calling in, the orange lighting is different as well.I've been selling telephones & working within the telecommunications industry for years now, and I haven't seen anything better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth the Price","review":"I bought this to replace an old 2.4 GHz phone. The sound quality was OK but was actually worse than the 2.4 GHz. I was expecting much more for the price. The features are generally good, but the most annoying thing is that only one handset can be active at a time. When talking on one handset, the other handset will NOT operate.In the end, I returned this phone and got a Panasonic 2.4 GHz that sounds great, was cheaper, has 3 handsets, and more features."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful Phone - Terrible reception","review":"Yes, you will be tempted to buy this phone because of its looks, and because it is cheaper than the Panasonic 5.8Ghz phone.However, I couldn't go more than 10 feet out of my house without the call breaking up. Even inside, right next to the base, there is a slight, but noticable white-noise hum in the background of every call. I should note that I tried this phone at my office, and at home with the same results.The other problem, as other reviews note, is that you can only use 1 handset at a time. I exchanged this phone for the Panasonic 51xx series. I am now satified. There is no comparison, as far as reception goes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Your Mileage May Vary","review":"While I was satisfied with the audio quality of the phone, the range was actually much worse than my older 2.4 GHz or 900 MHz phones. Worse, the Uniden would cut in and out when I neared the end of my indoor range, meaning I would actually lose parts of the conversation. My Panasonic 2.4GHz just clicks a bit when I'm near the end of the range. The Uniden could not cover the length of my large two-bedroom apartment. Frankly, I expected a lot more from this phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Severe limitations....","review":"Limitation #1: A maximum of two handsets for the entire system. Limitation #2: only one handset can be in use at a time. If someone calls in and two people want to talk, forget it with the UNIDEN TRU5885-2 system. Poor design compared to others on the market. Limitation #3:The preprogrammed phone numbers have to be programmed into each handset separately and the Caller Id Numbers have to be cleared on each handset individually.On the positive side it has the best backlight display of any phone available, uses NIMH batteries.The limitations were to great, so I returned the telephone."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great phone!!","review":"I recently purchased this phone as a replacement for an older Sony model that I had. What a wise purchase it was. For starters, 5.8 ghz is the latest in cordless phones. The reception is much crisper and clearer the the 900 mhz Sony. The digital answering machine works so well that I cancelled my voice mail. The second handset is so convenient; it has it's own seperate phone book memory, perfect for roomates sharing a single phone line. The ringer tones are pretty cool too, there are 10 different tones to chose from, including Merry Xmas just in time for the holidays, plus you can change the volume of the ringer to ring low or high, which is great for me, since the low volume is low enough to not wake up the kids during their afternoon nap. There is nothing about this phone that I don't like. The price is a little steep compared to some other phones out there, but well worth the price. 5 stars!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent, much needed tribute","review":"Informational and very interesting to watch too.

However, the narration that accompanies the interviews is full of basic factual errors (e.g., the ancestors of the Navajo were not the Anasazi; Philip Johnston did not, by his own account, get the idea of using code talkers from the World War I Choctaw or Comanche; the U.S. military did not create increasingly complex codes in response to an elite group of English-speaking Japanese code breakers; the code was not kept top secret for 20 years (it was featured in a movie in the 1950s), etc.).

Blame this guy, he has his formula and every script needs to follow it or it is no good. I don't think so. The irony of this book is that the films he admires the most are the ones that don't follow his writing formula. The other thing that bothers me, is the book is all about drama's. There is little or nothing on action, sci-fi, comedy, westerns, animation. There are so few insights that I really felt this book was really more about the writers ego and the 'look how great I am' attitude than providing the real nuts and bolts that an aspiring film writer needs to know. I threw away his formula and guess what? See you at the movies!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive, boring","review":"How useful is it to have extremely vague and rambling prose accompanied by already fixed examples? Answer: not useful at all. If Sid wants us to learn, he has to show us flawed scripts, then what happens when he fixes them. I personally found this book full of lame advice, describing problems only complete fools would run into. Maybe that is the point. The two things I salvaged from this book are: a) Do an outline of your screenplay first, then write around that. NEVER start writing from scratch, no matter how bold an approach it seems. b) Put lots of action in your screenplay, avoid dialogue driven plays. Think Dogma. Apart from that, I liked how Sid harped on cruddy movies like Die Hard 3 and Broken Arrow... but he never shows us how or where they break down... he only says that they do. Now that you have read my review, you got all the good stuff from the book, so I just saved you money.

Unlike most screenwriting books, which are about building your story from the ground up, The Screenwriter's Problem Solver is for the writer with a story-in-progress, exploring the relationship among character, plot and structure, and how each fit into the whole story -- and ways to troubleshoot if one or more of these elements needs to be strengthened. Field draws examples from screenplays that worked (and those that didn't), with liberal examples from a variety of popular films, including The Shawshank Redemption, Thelma & Louise, Crimson Tide, How to Make an American Quilt and Terminator 2: Judgment Day. The end result is a useful text for any storyteller wanting to build a better story."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is literally a problem solver","review":"This book is the best tool to assist screenwriters in getting the most out of their scenes and characters. Field's simple, straight forward sentence structure allows the reader to easily find and understand any problem he or she may encounter in the screenwriting process. Field tosses out the technical lingo and explains things in a basic way that anyone could comprehend.

I think the concept is great, but the product falls short of what it promises. I am a woman with 11 wide feet, and the moister gel insole portion doesn't cover my heel, so only my toes and part of my sole is moisturized? Whats the point in that if I have to lotion my heels following use? I would say at most it would work a size 8 in a woman, and a size 7 in a man. Also, no instruction as to which way to wear them. Does the Choice insignia go on the top or bottom? I tried both ways, and still neither covered my heel, and both directions left a lumpy (like needing a heel) on the top of my foot. This is definately not worth the nearly sixteen dollars that it cost. I gave it one star for the concept."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what I ordered","review":"I ordered what is shown on the picture. I received a flat rubber key chain with a mean look to it. Not a cute ball and glove"},{"rating":"1","title":"the cool tin case doesn't even make this worth it","review":"I thought I was getting something \\"cool\\" when I found this one. The front gleefully says \\"an uncensored biography\\" and \\"the full story with interviews\\".For one. There's just this guy reading information about Nine Inch Nails. No surprise there and nothing new and noteworthy either. Well, there is one surprise. . . there's this somewhat cheesy music that plays on the even numbered tracks (between the narration tracks) that is almost a parody on Nine Inch Nails.For two. The ONE interview (not interviews like the cover says) is the exact same interview as the first one that appears on the interview cd called \\"Disturbed\\". What a rip off.Oh, and don't get suckered in by the somewhat cool looking metal \\"limited edition packaging\\". It's definitely not worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"no good","review":"i ordered this item hoping to add another audio documenatry to my collection. i can't say this cd sux because there is no cd! all i got was the outer cardboard case and a crappy metal tin that was EMPTY. no cd here. i dunno if thats really what i ordered or i got ripped off but this just goes to show, while there are many quality unofficial items out there, buy them at your own risk because trent hasn't approved any of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Price","review":"First of all I found this cd in an audio store for... second it sucks I use the special case for other cds. It is really boring and truthfull doesnt tell you much about trent reznore in whole."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hobbies are fun!","review":"Fantastic photos in a well constructed book. Mr. Steacy has quite a collection of chrome doo dads from old American and Canadian autos. They are grouped together by category. The author also adds historical and social highlights shedding light on the styles of said parts and why they were designed and made the way they were. Lovers of older advertising and old autos will find this book interesting. The American/Canadian motoring experience has certainly changed over the years. One can see why so many people did develop such a love affair with their conveyances. Fun book. Easy read, too. Steacy includes a picture of his basement and his collection. I am envious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touched by the Spirit","review":"I always find Touched by an Angel giving me a lift to my spirit.I always walk away from it feeling uplifted.I gives me boost and makes me feel good.Cheers, Allan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful TV Series...","review":"I love it. I hope everyone could watch it. I know people never regret to buy it. I know I don't. Hopefully I will have all the 9 seasons soon when Amazon sell them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really liked it","review":"This was a good DVD and it really had a lot of good episodes on it. Not all of them were the best but you did get a message out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun & Beautiful Invitations","review":"The projects in this book range from fun and quirky (like my favorite - The Bride in a Can) to beautiful and classy. There are ideas here for weddings on the beach, old fashioned weddings, nuptials that include travel, and for simple ceremonies too. A lot of the ides in this book could be converted for use for other kinds of invitations, I used one of the pretty ones to make invitations to a party for my mother's birthday. Lots of color photos inside (nicer than the photo on the cover would make you think!) There are also illustrations & templates. I also gave this book as an engagement gift to a friend and not only did she love the gift, she made her invitations based on a project in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"impractical","review":"There were a couple cute ideas in this book, but overall I found it dated looking and very impractical. You can find a lot of better ideas online, for free. If you're going to invite 15 people to your wedding and hand-deliver the invitations then you should get this book. Am I going to send my invitations on wine bottles or with a sewn zipper? Not likely. The amount of time to create these is ridiculous and the mailing would be prohibitively expensive or impossible. I thought it funny that the authors include a note about how you shouldn't devote your existence to ephemeral invitations that most people are going to discard . . . and then tell you to spend half an hour crafting a pop-up bride in a can invite that will cost you $6 to mail.I think a lot of these invites are better suited to small parties."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wedding Invitations","review":"This book was not very informative. If you have a good eye for decorating and a minimum of taste, this book was a waste of time. It's feeled with very limited ideas. The book is a rip-off. Don't waste your money buying it. I would send it back, but the postage alone, cost more than the purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short","review":"I am pretty disappointed by how short this book is. What is there is nice but not enough to justify buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth Buyng","review":"We purchased a few wedding craft books from Amazon, and this was definitely our least favorite. There aren't many practical projects to make, and nothing in the book really appealled to us at all. Spend your money on something else for your wedding."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pool cover was very thin","review":"When we first opened up the box and opened up the pool cover we couldn't believe how thin it was. Because we the leaves are falling and the pool is ready to be closed we put it on the pool. We will wait the winter to see if it holds up. I am very skeptical that it will stay in one piece through our windy Wisconsin winter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look for something else to learn Computer Vision","review":"This book was very confusing even for a first year grad student like me...it is not a good book to learn Computer Vision from the beginning. I had to turn to other texts to better understand the material. I was highly disappointed that my professor chose this text for first year grad class in Computer Vision. Unfortunately, I cannot recommend this book. There are other books out there that are so much better to learn Computer Vision."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy this book","review":"this book sucks! terms are often inconsistent and expressions always unclear. Many simple concepts are written in very complicated ways. Perhaps this is because the author want this book to look more \\"academic\\". Don't buy this book unless you are already an expert in this area"},{"rating":"1","title":"inaccessible and expensive paperweight","review":"I have to heartily agree with the previous reviewer. This was the assigned text for my postgrad Computer Vision course also and I found it completely incomprehensible. From a practical perspective I don't see how any use can be made of this book.In contrast Gonzalez&Wood's 'Digital Image Processing' was a joy to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible book, Hard to understand!","review":"It is hard for me, as a Ph.D. graduate student to understand this book. The content is not well organized and many terms are not defined before using.Not recommend for any person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many jargons to understand.","review":"The Authors used too many technical words without definition, and beautified each sentence by using complicated structures. Because of that, it took so much time to read and understand than any other similar books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Digital version a pain. errors. unapproachable.","review":"I bought this without reading the fine print (shame on me). Apparently, the \\"kindle\\" version doesn't actually work on the Kindle. Nor does it work on any android device except the Kindle Fire. It does say it works on \\"PC\\", by which it means Windows only... This is an unacceptable delivery method. It has a relatively large number of errors. The material is presented in an unapproachable way, such that it's probably most useful as a reference for someone who just needs a reminder of available techniques. I used this for a semester course in graduate computer vision. I'm also a math major, so my problem with the book is not a lack of proper background."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book review","review":"The book has almost all the things anyone who is interested in computer vision. I love the way each topic is linked in the book. But it does not some of the topics are vague. I think some examples would have made those topics more lucid. It is an important book to keep for anyone who wants to work on computer vision."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very difficult to understand","review":"The author has good mathematics, but not the abilities to explain something clearly to a student or a beginner. I need to buy another book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is very difficult to read, specially mathematical notation. Authors use some strange notations very awkwad expression!","review":"This book is very difficult to read, specially mathematical notation. Authors use some strange notations very awkwad expression!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really a great book! How wonderful!","review":"It is unfortunate, but the current computer vision research becomes inaccessible for the person who does not have solid mathematical and statistical foundations. This wonderful book shows comprehensive summary of the correct figures of this \\"frontier\\": very scattered, disperse, and generating thousands of practical ideas. There have never been such a book which explains the logics of so many valuable ideas from old to new in this broad area in self contained and accessible manner. This book really helps a lot to approach to the state of the art papers, such as PAMI, ICCV, and ICPR. This book is trully the shortest cut to those state of the art research activities. I appreciate these authors' endevours a lot!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read","review":"If you're into Computer Vision this is a must read. The concepts are well explained, and the topics covers all the basic things to know about CV. The edition is very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"How to Live a Life with More Meaning","review":"I find myself giving lip service to my desire for community involvement and feeling genuinely grateful for our environment and freedoms--yet not putting my thoughts into action. With MAKE A DIFFERENCE, I can finally begin to search for ways to contribute. It provides contact information and an overview of many organizations, whether they are year-long commitments or just several hours a month. I appreciate the resources it provides--the list of important and wonderful novels and the information resources. The author's impassioned plea to us to be responsible citizens is heartfelt and inspiring. It reminds us that those who give are the true receivers...of the gift of meaningful experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Women's Tee","review":"We were looking for a nice METS Tee to wear occasionally around the house or to play some tennis & this fits. Not complex but not supposed to be, had a purpose & we're able to represent out team. Would definitely buy another one if & when I need it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skeptical at first","review":"I work at Sears selling tools and with all the gimicy tools that are out there, I was skeptical of the Drill Doctor, until I tried it. It takes about 30 minutes to really get the hang of it, but after that, it is wonderful.I was drilling through ratchet handles to make a display. I had taken a brand new cobalt bit off the shelf and dulled it after 2 1/2 ratchet handles. I pulled out the Drill Doctor as a joke. But the joke was on me. After about 5 minutes of figuring out how it works, I was able to finish the next three ratchet handles after sharpening the bit.I have done tool demonstrations at Sears with the Drill Doctor. I have taken drill bits, ground them down on a grinder so they wouldn't drill into Jello, then sharpen them and go through 1/8 steel without a problem. I must have sharpened nearly a thousand drill bits at Sears and the unit is still working.The price is a little steep, but you won't need to buy drill bits again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paid for itself","review":"Not as easy to use or as quick as I had hoped but still well worth the money if you drill lots of holes! It is a pleasure to sharpen a drill just before using on a jobsite and getting a first class hole drilled in quick time. We keep this on the jobsite every day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to use","review":"The \\"brush\\" part is shaped like an \\"h\\" so that if you were to fit in in the babies mouth around their teeth it would fit something like a mouth gaurd and then you'd have to slide it over the teeth back and forth for the brushes to hit the surfaces. I would think it would be much more useful if the end with the bristles was flat with bristles on both sides. We had an easier time with a toddler brush than with this thing.adding this later....while it hasn't been a great toothbrush it's been useful for teething for my toddler."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good size and good quality","review":"I bought this product for my 10 month old daughter. I could easily leave her chewing on it unattended because it is not small so I knew there was no chocking risk. She really loves it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My 20 month old likes this","review":"I have trouble with my 20 month old letting me brush his top front teeth. With this it makes it easier. He holds onto it and i hold it over his hand and brush his teeth.Pros- bristles that clean all around, handlecons-a bit small"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheaper at walmart","review":"I paid 4.88 plus tax at walmart for this toothbrush.As far as the choking hazard goes, I.m not worried. The handle is 2.5 inches long. The part with the bristles is about 1.5 inches. my son is 11 months old and has a very large head for his age. There is no way he could get this whole thing in his mouth to choke on it.Some people have commented on how soft the handle is. There is a part that's soft for the baby to hold on to, but right up by the bristles is a part that I think is designed for the parent to hold on to"},{"rating":"2","title":"Your baby will use it at some point!","review":"I first tried using the Spiffy toothwipes with just my finger wrapped in the towel and that worked before his teeth started to hurt my finger. I then used the fingerbrush (from Gerber grins & giggles) wrapped in the Spiffy wipe. Well at 12 months, my son decided that he no longer liked my finger or a fingerbrush wrapped in the Spiffy in his mouth. I then tried putting the Gerber toothpaste on this Baby Buddy toothbrush and he LOVES it! He even uses it correctly, holding it in his mouth and chomping down with his front teeth and then he moves it back to his rear molars! I don't have to do any work and he even gets upset when I take it away! I think it will give him a real foundation for how to use a regular toothbrush. Best of all this is safe (approved toothbrush on SafeMama site, which I love for quick info on organic and green products for baby). Sorry for all of the exclamation marks but I love this toothbrush as much as my baby does!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It is ok","review":"My eight month old son uses it sometimes, but not very like it. It is very soft and I like it.It supposed to be a tooth brush, but my son never use the right side. He always put the handle side into his mouth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby likes it-helps back teeth...but risk of choking-watch out!","review":"My 10 month old likes this toothbrush/teether but she also likes to chew on the handle part which is thinner than the toothbrush part. If I left her alone with it, I'd be afraid she could choke on it. It's fine if the baby is supervised by an adult while using. I wouldn't use it in place of a pacifier tho."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorta Pointless...","review":"My daughter hated having her teeth brushed. I saw this in a catalog for baby safety items and found it cheaper on Amazon. I ordered it, thinking it would be a great choice for my teething baby.This thing is TINY, like as long as my finger. The entire thing is made out of soft sillicone so the handle is a bit pointless - you can't really maneuver it at all. Once the baby bites down on the bristles, you can't move the thing anyway. It would make more sense if this item had a larger handle so baby could hold it and it wouldn't be as easily a choking hazard.I found it pointless - if this was to clean her teeth, well she was cleaning her teeth just as well by sucking on her washcloth in her bath, or chewing on the edge of her blanket. Also, do know you can't pick color. We received pink - I didn't care as that we have a daughter but another may not be happy with lack of color choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"son loves this","review":"I don't think this works so great as a tooth brush but it is a great chew toy in the tub.
