Example, Madam hooch is the one who puts you on the quiddich team, and you get the book on Nicholas flamel in the restricted section. And you have to make a potion, not choose one for Snape's challenge, and you don't play chess on the chessboard. And to learn a spell, you just move your wand up down left and right!

Good stuff- the graphics are excellent and game play is good. The bad is if you like fishing it's pretty frustrating for a couple reasons. 1)You can't fish the lures, especially the plastics the way they are really fished. Everything is reel in as fast as you can to attract fish. 2) When fishing in a tournament the game targets largemouth, spots and smallmouth. You catch a lot of \\"florida bass\\" which are not target fish and have to let them go. Florida are largemouth. 3) You can catch snakehead, which looks like a dogfish but is actually an Asian fish (Konami programers?)Anyway at 1/2 off it's not a bad deal, just not accurate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality Build","review":"I can't comment on the optical quality of this filter, but the mechanical quality is astoundingly bad. There aren't a whole lot of parts for one of these filters, so I don't know how you can do a job this awful. Mine arrived with the retaining spring unmounted, so the filter was just laying in the holder. I finally got the spring in place (which is harder than it sounds) so that the filter was secured. The second time I used it the spring popped out, and the filter hit the pavement. End of usable filter.

Unfortunately the DVD picture suffers greatly from frequent frame stuttering and staggering - most prominent during the many animation sequences. What I recall as a smooth animated glide through the Eagle Nebula is now more of a bumpy bus ride. It's too bad, because other than that, the picture/color/clarity is greatly improved via my s-video connection, and the dolby surround, though not 5.1, does the soundtrack justice. Whether it's a flaw in the original transfer, or just bad duplication, I do not know, but I've now tested two copies on two different DVD players, and the flaws are consistent... and ohhhh so frequent.

The three wheel design allows for greater balance and control. I bought this for my 5 year old who has some motor challenges and she loves it. The simple color scheme is great because it helps her feel mature (as opposed to similar scooters with preschool cartoon character). She has difficulty riding a bike but likes to play outdoors.

Furthermore, the callers have a very difficult time hearing me. They report that they can barely hear me. I have to switch to my old phone for the sake of the caller, but I'm out of luck hearing them.I really regret buying this phone and feel that it was NOT as advertised . . . not even close.

It does not keep the pictures in their places. The instructions are minimal. Maybe if I were skilled at model building and art projects I could figure this thing out.

If the grout is old and hard it simply doesnt do the trick at all.Unlike some of the reviews, my guide tabs and the bit lined up perfectly.Yes, you can do a tile or two but that is pretty much it. Bit seemed fragile and I agree that this kindof work for the Dremel will wear it out quickly as well as the bits.I am returning the product.Back to the drawing board."},{"rating":"1","title":"A completely ineffective tool!","review":"I purchased this tool thinking that it would be faster than removing grout by hand. But it is not. It is extremely slow even with a full 1/8 inch carbide tip bit - not supplied. The included bit is even smaller. By hand, with a double bladed hand-held small grout saw I was able to remove 1/4 inch grout at a 3 feet per minute pace. With this tool, it takes ten times that.In addition, the plastic base has two notches to guide the tool in the grout joint. But the grout grinds away these notches after about 10 minutes of work.A completely ineffective tool! Sounds like a cool idea but a complete waste of money. Do yourself a favour and don't buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke within 2 minutes","review":"I purchased this in order to regrout a tiled tub surround. Since the regrouting was to be primarily cosmetic, I planned to only skim the surface of this soft grout, so figured I wouldn't encounter some of the problems I'd previously read in the reviews here. Wrong.While the collar did keep the bit in place, that didn't keep the bit from breaking less than 2 minutes into the job...Total waste of $20."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money!","review":"As mentioned in other reviews, the guide is worthless. With a steady hand and an angled approach, you can do better than with the guide. The bits are close to the same: I have 2 x 2 tiles in my shower. The bits do remove the grout, but they only last for about 6 [2 x 2]tiles each! At $10 each, it would cost less to sledge hammer my floor and put in new tile! I am yet to find a good grout removal tool...next is to look at a product called \\"The Grout Grabber.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"small changes would make it much, much more useful","review":"the product is a dark grey (almost black) piece of plastic, designed to hold the cutting tool and keep it from straying off the desired cut line. since it goes over the work area and covers about 70% of the hemisphere, it takes away a lot of the available diffuse natural light, making it difficult to see where one is cutting. as this tool is intented to be an accessory when cutting grout from in-between tiles, there are black-on-black marks to aid the alignement. painting those markers while (for example with an office whiteout pencil) allows a much more precise control of the tool. It is a small change and easy to implement; why doesn't Dremel consider adding two white markings as a feature?use of this accessory makes it very difficult to work in small areas and corners (e.g. where a countertop joins a splashwall)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not built for serious use.","review":"Like many other reviewers, I picked up this attachment to remove the grout from my shower surround prior to regrouting. The biggest problem is that the attachment deos not keep the bit centered. The plastic guide \\"nubs\\" wore down to almost nothing before the job was 1/2 done, so most work was basically performed freehand.I did not experience any problems with the bit breaking. Don't force the tool, as with any other dremel work, and it should be fine.Overall I don't reccomend this attachement for more than a few square feet of tile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not O/P in Australia","review":"This is a first-rate book.

I was just looking for something that could sew a seam and would let my daughter accomplish something fun. What a complete waste -- of our time, her anticipation and enthusiasm, and landfill space. What a bummer. Though the included kit and projects were cute, and what I have come to expect from Alex toys (which I have otherwise been delighted with over the years), the machine is awful. I don't see how the suggested projects could be adequately completed with this machine. I recently purchased a full sized, beginner machine for my daughter and certainly wish I hadn't spent the money or bothered with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"It doesn't work!!! My grandmother has been sewing her whole life and she couldn't get this machine to work. My daughter is so, so disappointed!"},{"rating":"1","title":"fragile mechanism","review":"When this machine worked, my daughter loved it. It comes with nice accessories that allow you to start working right out of the box. But it didn't work for long.The bottom bobbin was a pain to re-engage and repeated efforts to grab the thread may have stressed the internal gear mechanism. At one point the needle simply didn't cycle up and down. Eventually, I opened the machines and could see the drive gear had popped up. I pushed it down and it seemed to be fine. Until it disengaged again.After 5 tries of opening up and re-sealing the machine after pushing the drive gear back in place, the plastic threading you drive the screws in began to fray and wear away.I'm ordering this again because it was on sale cheaper than the first purchase and because my daughter got used to using it and I'd rather not start the learning curve over. But 2 purchases of this machine will be my limit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for 2 stiches then stopped working","review":"I agree with a previous post that the toy had great potential and my daughter loved receiving it for Christmas, however, threading the bobbin in the bottom does not work as instructed. I returned this item for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Purchase unless you want disappointed child","review":"I am a sewing teacher and have had 2 students frustrated, dejected, and upset after attempting to use this toy. Because that is what it is..a TOY...the threading mechanism is too small or difficult to access, the tension cheap, and without a light its impossible to see what you're doing. I have advised these parents to send this back and purchase a 3/4 size Janome, the Hello Kitty version if available instead. The foot pedal is under powered, the arm of the machine so small and shaped to make it difficult to move fabric through it..I was sadly motivated to post this review when my second student was unable to sew a stitch due to the poor quality of this product. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"SO disappointing.","review":"My six year old received this as a Christmas gift from her grandmother. She is very interested in sewing and is capable of doing a great deal independently, but this toy 'sewing machine' was a major frustration for us both. It continually came unthreaded, was very slow and noisy, and generally did a lousy job of stitching. As a replacement (before her interest in sewing was completely destroyed by the frustration of using this), we purchased an inexpensive Singer sewing machine for her which works nicely and will last her much, much longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy!","review":"I bought this for my 10 year old daughter. She was so excited and couldn't wait to sew. She had fun for the first few squares she sewed. Then the tension started acting up. We could not get the tension right. We tried everything. When I had purchased this I read the reviews and there were a lot of people complaining about the tension. I thought I would be able to fix it. Now my daughter is very disappointed. She had a fun Christmas gift all of 15 minutes and then disappointment. Find something better!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"don't buy!","review":"I am an experienced seamstress and wanted to teach my 7 year old granddaughter to sew on her own little machine. I fought with it and gave up when the bottom tension would not adjust, then the spring flew out nad I couldn't find it! No way would I recommend this machine. The time on return had expired since she doesn't get to visit often so I am stuck with a machine that does not work for $78 when I could have bought a real machine for a few more dollars. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb Score!","review":"Christopher Young has outdone himself with this one! Blending orchestration with choirs singing latin has always been my favorite (when it comes to movie scores) and this has it all. From Introitus (Entrance) 8:28, track one, all the way through to Lux Aeterna (Eternal Light) 6:44, track five, kept me on the edge of my seat! :~) Anyone who loves collecting scores should definitely add this one to their collection as you will not be disappointed!! Here are the track listings:Track 1 - Introitus (Entrance) 8:28 Track 2 - Kyrie Eleison (Lord Have Mercy Upon Us) 11:53 Track 3 - Dies Irae (Day of Wrath) 12:48 Track 4 - Agnus Dei (Lamb of God) 13:22 Track 5 - Lux Aeterna (Eternal Light) 6:44"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money.","review":"The installation is full of bugs. It partially installs but then you can't run the program. Tried it on Windows 7, Vista and XP with negative results. Removing the bad installation is a nightmare and the support for Resume Maker products is horrible. I can't believe I wasted money on this garbage. If I could rate it a zero I would."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT & EXPLOSIVE ACTIONS !!!","review":"This is an action-packed thriller for readers who like fast actions and war scenes. Unlike Tom Clancy, (who slow down the actions with too much tech-data), Richard Herman does not waste too much time to bring the readers right into the actions. The flow of the story is smooth and the writer keeps readers interested at all times. I would recommand reading Dark Wing before reading Iron Gate (although the story is not as smooth, it gives you more information about the main characters)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"I found this book to be a very entertaining read however I do get concerned at the way Mr Herman disposes of his main characters when they no longer suit his purposes.In real life people do retire and live happily ever after-not every person has to suffer a horific death to keep readers enthralled in the tale being told."},{"rating":"2","title":"As always, a can't put the book down till finished.","review":"I can't wait to read more, I also would like to know about the continuing war with Nevers."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE GREAT PREMINGER RATES ZERO STAR!","review":"Why did you do it, Otto? A bad screenplay by his son (with GYPSY ROSELEE, a brilliant woman) about terminally bad Palestinian terorists (even FOX TELEVISION wouldn't dare use characters so ridiculous). It was shot in 1975, starring PETER O'TOOLE and RICHARD ATTENBOROUGH.

And when stacked they aren't as effcient as a large single filter. But if you can't find the larger single replacement filter these will do."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Filter Stinks - Literally","review":"This replacement filter smells putrid. I mean really bad. It is the soft black rubber material that houses the pleated filter, which is different from the hard plastic material in the original 17000 filter. It stunk so bad in two minutes that I had to shut the filter off and return the replacement filter. It took an hour for the smell to go away. I am going to buy the envirocare original replacement instead; there is no use getting a \\"permanent\\" replacement filter if it smells so bad I can't even stand to run the unt. I'm not kidding - it smelled like burning rubber."},{"rating":"2","title":"if you get it, you'll get it","review":"first off, these are two excellent essays concerning photography, one by gregory corso and one by ginsberg himself, and these writings are almost worth the price of the book itself (which you should consider buying used, it can be found even in the used section of amazon for cheap - and they are limited printings from what i understand). as for the photos, this is like van gogh's 'bedroom in arles'. there is a sense of history in these pictures, and as ginsberg says, he knew. here is kerouac, burroughs, cassady, allen, and on top of that, this was early post-world war 2 america. you can see it in the people, the apartments, the streets - i could go on and on, but a truly valuable book."},{"rating":"2","title":"a success.","review":"epstein does not shy away from the ugly, the raw, the core. with wit, eloquence, sensitivity, and a profound insightfulness unique to only a few writers, he has created a a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"modern philosophy","review":"john searle is a great addition to the studies of philosophy because he adds a modern perspective which is easily identifiable and agreeable.

I purchased this vacuum after my hard-wood floors were refinished to keep then nice and clean. The first use must be after 24 hours of charging so I waited. The first use was ok. The battery ran out quickly (less than 15 minutes) and the attachment kept falling off. This was the best experience I ever had with this piece 'o junk. Later the battery life got even shorter, the attachments dared me to use them and the attachment with the spinning bristles stopped working altogether. I was so mad! My husband took it apart and was able to get it working again, but it still wouldn't stay attached. I finally solved my problem by buying a new vacuum. I now own one awesome vacuum and one great doorstop. If you are bent on getting this vacuum then you should just mail the money directly to me. You would be far less frustrated. Try the Bissell butler revoloution instead, I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good value, nice vac","review":"This little vacuum has a good bit of suction power compared to others in its price range. A single charge gets me a long running time. However, my wife puts the vacuum back on the charger after she uses it for 1 minute... so, the battery has now established a memory.... so it only last about 5 minutes per charge now. Like anything with a Ni-Cad battery, the power must be full drained before recharging. I wish manufacturers would start using Ni-Mh or Li-Ion batteries.. or a smart charging system... I digress...The attachments all work great... The motorized brush really works well. I have used it a lot to clean our stairs. For a $40 handheld cordless, it's a great value."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used twice doesn't work","review":"DON'T BUY THIS MACHINE!!!! I recieved this for Christmas and after using it twice, it quit working. I have made a number of calls to the company, but keep getting cut-off. They won't answer my e-mails. The only thing I can find out is on the warranty that says they will repair it for $9.95 plus shipping. I have only used it twice and it only costs $40, and they want $10 plus about $8 to $10 shipping to repair it. All they care about is selling these things and then you are on your own."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"This vacuum doesn't do anything. You are throwing money out the drain.

I had to park in a parking lot of a superstore and unplug a kiddie ride to charge my notebook enough to send it. I bought this adapter and I am very happy with this product and have yet to run out of battery. Also, it is an AC adapter that plugs into your lighter...you dont need to plug in a notebook, how about an electric cooler, or a recharger for your kids' batteries from their handhelds?

This book stands out as one of the best, both for it's message, it's illustrations, and writing style. I now use the book in the anti-viollence program that I teach in schools.The story sends a powerful message to children (and adults) about taking action to change injustices that we see. There are times when we notice things that are unfair or mean, but we believe that we are doing enough to feel sorry for those who are the brunt of such unkindnesses. The story clearly demonstrates the importance of moving beyond feeling sympathy to feeling empathy. We must speak up for others and do something that makes a difference.The ending provides the students with provocative food for thought to initiate a reflective discussion.

My daughter is still 2, and just recently started pulling this book out again to read, but we are both disappointed that most of the scents are completely gone now. This book was only gently used, no rough scratching of stickers or anything like that. Only the pine and chocolate chip cookie scents are still there.

I bought this one because they love all the different smells from my older version ones and thought this would add to the collection.

Some say they aren't for traveling because of their bulk, but I disagree. These are not meant to be stored away...they are an accessory as much as a headphone, and are exceptionally light (id imagine they'd be great for skating or boarding). Plus, they come with a case.The only downside I found was that because they fit so tight on the head (which is a plus), it makes it so wearing them around your neck is a bit snug too (cant look down too easily).

The pxs lasted me more than two years but it was time for a new pair, so seeing the half decent reviews on this site, I went and bought the hesh.these headphones are huge and aren't comfortable on the ear. the pads feel like they aren't even padded. when you put them on it feels like you're putting two huge cheerios on your ears, except that they're super stale cheerios that don't break. instead, they squeeze your head and give you a headache because the top band is too tight.i'm so happy with the px100s and so unhappy with this (the difference in sound is ridiculous...) that i'm going to ditch these (give them away or something.. to someone with a TINY head) and buy myself another one of these. check THESE reviews.Sennheiser PX 100 Collapsible Headphones"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good quality, Great sound","review":"very good product.The headphones fit nice on the head, so they will not slip easily. These headphones look very attractive, i took them to school the first day i got them, and I received many compliments.The sound quality is amazing, especially for the price you pay. Awesome bass, and great treble. It comes with a volume control wheel on the cord. The only minor problem is that the cord is only three feet long, but thats only minor. Warning: these are super loud! They are like mini speakers.Overall, Great value for the price you pay."},{"rating":"1","title":"Echo-y and uncomfortable","review":"I'm wearing them right now, trying to listen to them and talk myself into believing that I didn't just get robbed. Midrange is poor. Sounds like I'm listening to a boom box in a pulic restroom. And for all those that say they are huge, well, I must have giant ears because I can hardly cram my hearing appengages into the plastic cups, round like a circle.I work in a cubicle and wear headphones 8-9 hours every single day. The padded headband seems comfortable enough, and by sliding out the adjustable arms on the cups makes them comfortable enough.But given the sound, if what you really want ot hear is good sound, these are not the ones to get. Maybe an EQ could add what's missing, but why would you buy a product that requires compensation just to make acceptable?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great sound, poor construction","review":"I used these headphones at a desk job, listening to my iPod or NPR streaming online. The sound quality was great, I had nothing to complain about there, however the construction was junk. One of the ear pieces completely broke off the band while I was simply putting them on.I liked the headphones (although the design is gaudy), but I'll be switching to a pair of Sennheiser HD202's next for the increased durability."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product for the price...","review":"I'm not like a professional or sound engineer or anything... :P... but I really like these headphones! The sound quality is great and the Bass is incredible... I've been through like a handfull of headphones, and these are the best buy yet! Very powerfull sound! Impressive...I wouldn't shed out 50 bones for them, but you can get them at a really good price of >> $35 << if you get them from RCS Experience through Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"the skullcandy hesh headphones black are awesome. the sound is great and they're really comfortable."},{"rating":"1","title":"flimsy","review":"i bought two one for my friend one for me.they both broke at the slider/extender.only had them since mid aug.all we used em for is listening to music at a desk top. the slider is so thin and the audio wire is right next to it.the sounds was good but you know sumtim is wrong if both broke in the same place.hers broke taking them off and mine broke picking them up. now i got a RMA# to send em back. what a effin pain.shoulda got ones with a metal slider.you get what you pay for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece Of S#@* !!!!!!","review":"Although I would give the sound of these headphones 5 out of 5 but the overall quality of the materials of it are CHEAP!!!!!!!!!! The plastic that lets you level the headphones broke on both sides within 2 months which is infuriating because i paid $50 for these suckers and they didn't even go through allot of mistreatment. If you wan't good sound go rite ahead and by them but make sure you baby them or they will break pretty soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skullcandy Hesh Headphones are SICK","review":"What can I say these things are some of the best headphones i've ever purchased. i read reviews from people saying that they break easy and the sound quality is poor...those people are wrong. These phones have suffered some pretty hard falls lately and they hold up great, not to mention the bass that will shatter your skull."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke and broke","review":"While I agree that the sound quality on these headphones is good, the physical product is cheap and breaks easily. While adjusting the head setting, one of the sides snapped. I duct taped it and another month goes by before the other side snaps. You can't really enjoy the sound of the headphones if you can't wear them anymore. The company only offers a 50% discount for physical breaks. If I had been doing something crazy when I broke them I might take them up on the offer, but I was simply adjusting the setting. Now they want another $25 so I can get another pair that will probably break. It is completely laughable that they advertise these for active people.Read the other reviews on Amazon and notice the trend that these things are cheaply made and WILL break."},{"rating":"1","title":"They're actually not worth the price. Horrible construction.","review":"Simply put, these headphones have a tendency to fall apart/crack far too easily - I owned a pair for less than a month, and one of the sliders had somehow cracked open, even though I did my best to take good care of them. A few days later, the sound in the right ear started to decline/go out. Needless to say, I'm not too pleased.The sound quality was decent, but as other reviews have stated, I heard next to no difference between these and the ~$15 Sony Monitor headphones. I ended up paying $50 for the Hesh headphones - I can safely say that I will never again take my business to Skullcandy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost perfect","review":"the Skullcandy SC-HESH Hesh Headphones have awsome sound quality and block out most noise. they look really cool also. the only problem is, is that they are a little small around the ears and i already have pretty small ears, but it is still pretty tight. as long as you can live with your ears being a little squished than these headphones are a great buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"cool headphones, ok price.","review":"Ive never had nicer headphones than the ones that go behind your head and are about $14 dollars so when i got these they sounded really good. The bass is a good middle, not background sound but not overpowering. if your looking for extreme base look at Skullcandys, skull crushers. They fit snug on your head but are still comfortable because of the padding on the head. The ear pockets are a good size and secure the music in and keep the other noise out. it came with everything it said it comes with.The only con is that the cord is shorter than most headphone cords ive had before but you can buy an extention if its that big of a deal.overall, im pleased with my buy and if you are looking for some headphones that look cool and have pretty great sound, these are good for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good headphones","review":"Not the best headphones around but for the money they are rather comfortable, stylish, and sound descent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"Note: I own the Metallica Death Magnetic version.BUYER BEWARE. This piece of junk is NOT sound canceling, and it can clearly be hear by other people in the room. The quality is below average compared to buds, and rest on the ears weirdly. The \\"amazing bass quality\\" that people rave about is sub par. Do not buy, go sony instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great quality","review":"Product is outstanding in construction quality and audio quality plus blocks out virtually all noise. I use it during workouts at the YMCA and it keeps the ambient noise to a minimum."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look Good, Built Cheaply","review":"I bought these headphones three months ago because I was really digging their look. Most headphones are kind of boring while Skullcandy admittedly makes some beautiful/edgy products. However, these headphones have been a big disappointment. First, the fit actually hurt my ears if I wore them for prolonged periods of times because of their circular shape instead of oval shape. Secondly the plastic piece connecting the earpiece to the band just split in two. Cheap construction. I haven't given up on Skullcandy simply because I love their designs, but I would recommend checking out other brands if you can't spend extra money on getting Skullycandy's more expensive/hopefully higher quality products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Feels cheap and squeezes head","review":"Headphones look good, but feel cheap, especially the cushion around the ear. I don't have a huge head, yet these were still too tight and uncomfortable to wear for longer than 1/2 hour. Overall, I would not recommend these as there are much better ones out there for the same price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth even $50 dollars.","review":"Don't be fooled by most of the favorable reviews on this product. If you plan on using these headphones on a daily basis they will eventually break on you within months. They are uncomfortable for extended periods of use and make it a chore to even have them on for more than 5 minutes. After having them for about 2 months I started noticing that they were cracking, in the same spot on opposite sides just about the first indentation line. 2 days later they broke completely. This, after being stored in their carrying bag all the time with minimal handling."},{"rating":"2","title":"let's see how it goes this time","review":"this is my 3rd pair in 3 years. let's hope this pair doesn't snap in half after like the other 2 skullcandy headphones. other than that, i like the design and they have decent enough sounds quality for the price. one draw back with this series is that the ear covers don't swivel. but otherwise what i expected from skullcandy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could give him a minus rating for this book.","review":"If there was a minus rating I would use it.

The plot, about a man, Jim, who is injected with a mysterious drug, sounded interesting, but the story was not well crafted at all. The first problem is that Jim never seems to be in any real danger. He's just having occasional nightmares. The only real danger is when he starts to try to find out what happened to him. The pharmaceutical company has some big conspiracy against him, but the potential of this plot is never fully realized, and the same is true for most of the subplots. The result is a mix of rather uninteresting, slow paced plot elements, leading up to a rather confusing ending. Not recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent DVD - Intermediate & Calming","review":"This is a good intermediate flow DVD to add to your collection. I'll be reaching for this one often. Zyrka is very calming in her vocal tone, so while this is a solid practice, I tend to practice with this DVD when I need a calming influence as well as a good routine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Backgorund music makes it hard to hear the instructor","review":"Great workouts. No mystical stuff. The transitions from pose to pose feel good. The instructor explains poses well, and the camera captures the moves so you can easily follow along. My only complaint is that the background music is so loud that it is sometimes hard to hear the instructor. I'm sure this won't matter much once I get used to the routines, but the first time, it was hard to follow because I couldn't always hear the soft voice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Instructor","review":"I really like this instuctor. At this point it is a little beyond my capabilities but I got it for the Yoga Nidra in which she allows for a sankalpa to be made.

Es la historia de una obsesión, la de G.C. Camargo, poderoso director de un importante diario bonarense; por Reina Remis, joven periodista que se inicia bajo su tutela. Corren tiempos turbios, donde la ilegalidad, la corrupción, los abusos de poder sirven como telón de fondo para esta pasión obsesiva que corroe las entrañas del viejo periodista, que le hace perder todo tipo de sensibilidad que no sea aquella que lo conduzca al completo dominio de la independiente Reina. La familia deja de existir, el trabajo sólo vale como medio para un fin, humillar y someter a una pasión que deja de ser correspondida. Excelente retrato sicológico donde los escrúpulos se pierden, los protagonistas dejan de ser heróes y puede que el mal triunfe al final."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suited for 99 cents stores","review":"This should be sold at 99 cent stores. non-uniform surface.

Yakov Rambsel makes grammatical mistakes, or chooses to translate his \\"codes\\" to fit the meaning he prefers. A few examples: He may ignore pronominal endings: \\"kadshi\\" on page 54 is \\"my,\\" not \\"his\\" holiness. He calls \\"dakar\\" on page 55(4), a verb: \\"they have pierced,\\" when it is really \\"he pierced.\\" It could also be the gerund: \\"piercing.\\" The name Melchizedek on page 213 should be spelled with a tzadi instead of an ayin. \\"Messiah, Tabernacle\\" at the bottom of page 124 could easily be translated, \\"A messiah lived in a tent.\\" Other code phrases could be interpreted with wild variations.

A reader can instantly connect with the lead character of Astha, as she experiences the trials and tribulations of being a teenager, puberty, losing a parent, entering an arranged marriage, economic dependence, raising a family and finding her true passion through art, activism and love. Kapur's realistic style and emphasis on painting a detailed picture of a character's environment only make this novel all the more readable, and one of the most interesting fiction pieces I have read in a while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable...","review":"The story is much more than Asta's relationship with another woman, that only comes along near the end of the book. Kapur does a wonderful job dissecting the the everyday of an ordinary life, showing how even the ordinary in this generation can be claustrophobic. Kapur highlights how women were taught that caring for anything outside the small world created for you (whether it is in an ashram, your parent's house, or your husband's house) was not normal. The character of Asta struggles with this throughout the book, using her art and then eventual political activism to be a part of the world. Her affair is another outlet for this connection. I found the history fascinating and the story well written. This book does not have a packaged ending and offers no excuses for its story, so is refreshing and a fast read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magical Glass?","review":"I'm very impressed with my intial results with these filters.

Musicianship is much better than on most punk albums if you can classify this as part of the genre. Really more like a cross between metal and punk, but not as overtly metal as Wendy's later releases. At it's roots, this is just 3 chord rock 'n' roll with a healthy shot of nihlism & narcissism to kick it up a notch.

The text book won't help too much on the state exam since you can't bring it in. The calculations sections relies heavily on a work sheet that you cannot bring into the test site. Its nice to have, but no use with the exam. The diagrams and illustrations have letter marking that have corresponding informational paragraphs, but i found them to be list in a convenient circular pattern instead of listed in an easy to follow line-of-thinking method. You have to have it for your class, so just pay them the money and work some overtime to pay for it.

In doing calculations of commercial and dwelling units one deals a lot with NEC Table 220.55 and the associated FNPs (foot notes). These FNPS are horrible cumbersome to explain the solution when dealing with multiple Ranges with different values of range's KWs.

The set is very sturdy and the spring feature to hold the rings in the jaws while getting them in place was great. The price for the set was less than one pair on other websites, and I had them in less then a week.

I know that its focus is on cultural aspects, but it completely ignores ever putting in dates, so I tend to lose my grounding on when exactly Barzun is speaking about. The only part I liked were the \\"windows on time\\" where he describes life in a particular city at a certain moment in time.

Obscurity doesn't depth(wisdom) make. It's penetrating insights, which he doesn't have. Barzun's book is like those profiles from The New Yorker: a lot of words, but not touching the truth. Another way to think of Barzun is that he is like a big puddle of water, very big, covering a lot of ground, but shallow. Extremely shallow.Yet another way to describe this book: the author made a portrait of someone, but you don't know what that person looks like!

I find Barzun's work uniquely catholic (universal) and non-sectarian. Here is History written without bias, jingoism, sectarianism, and the other usual limitations in an author's mind. Barzun not only knows, he can express it, without the usual academic self-consciousness. This book tells us living in this age of decadence: we have nothing to be arrogant about; but also that it is great to be alive.

I, therefore read his latest book, an ambitious project,to say the least, with much anticipation. While his approach is a refreshing departure from the relentless recounting of facts and events that characterize most history, I found his colloquial style distracting. Too, grammatical errors in the text left me with the impression that the manuscript had been published as dicated, without revision. After finishing it, I can only give this book 4 stars. It is brilliantly concieved, and magnificently executed, but in publication was separated from greatness by perhaps one more pass under the editor's pencil."},{"rating":"2","title":"History for the philosophical","review":"Great book for the history buff who enjoys the text for style.

A view of the past five hundred years from the point of view of a crabby, old Frenchman.

Unfortunately the manufacturing precision is less than brilliant. I purchased the chuck for diamond drilling my wife's quartz crystals and gem stones in a water bath. The chuck jaws are eccentric (out of true) and a 1 mm diamond drill tip actually moves in a noticeably larger circle. This makes it difficult to start the drill in a hard surface and also causes water to be splashed about when drilling. I have owned large drill presses which are much closer to being true than this chuck. It might work OK for softer materials but I don't understand why it couldn't have been manufactured true in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"Also compatible with the Dremel 1100-01 Stylus","review":"This is a useful addition to any Rotary tool.

It wobbles terribly at low speeds, so much so that I refuse to keep it on my tool because I am afraid it will be damaged with continued use. Other reviewers mentioned this problem, and I agree with them completely. It simply does not hold the accessories straight, and it is therefore useless to me.

It's super handy to have a \\"one size fits all\\" collet instead of having to change them out. That being said, it should be noted you DO still need to tighten this about a quarter turn or so with the wrench after you hand tighten it so I think the \\"keyless\\" part is a little misleading. If you don't do this your bit will probably become loose as you use it. It even has the flat sides for the wrench so they obviously knew this would be needed. Additionally, it is a little larger than the normal collets so if you are using this in a very tight space where collet size could matter then this might be a problem for you. For most applications, though, I think this is much better and more convenient and would highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"useful chuck replacement","review":"I bought this to replace the single collet that we had with our 2nd hand dremel .It is so much easier to use and means we can now use all the bits that are for our dremel model instead of only the ones that fit the collet we were given.Finger tightness is good enough for using the cutting discs to cut steel .You do have to push the end of the bit against a flat surface to release them sometimes,rather as you do with an electric drill so dont push them in completely when swapping bits,leave a small space.The chuck does make it slightly less easy to get in really close sometimes when doing more intricate work as the chuck rubs against the surface more than a slimmer chuck would so it means holding the tool more at an angle .We bought a multiclick set (bits and mandrel) not long after we bought this and it makes our old dremel much easier to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product","review":"Worth getting.

I'd recommend it for anyone working with (or struggling with) PTSD when used in conjunction with therapy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe for the young or clueless?","review":"I ordered this book because it claims to cover C-PTSD, the form I have. However, all the author has done is take questionnaires applicable to the single-trauma type of PTSD and assume they are pertinent to C-PTSD people. They aren't. That is, they ask you about single traumatic events, but these questions are unanswerable for C-PTSD because the traumas are varied and often continuous and no single answer applies. I ended up believing the author actually has little or no experience or education with C-PTSD and is not qualified to write about it. This makes me angry because it is dishonest.In general I agree with the other one-star reviews. An absolutely clueless or young and inexperienced person may learn something by filling out questionnaires, but if you are a mature, intelligent adult I suspect you will feel like you are in grade school again.I sent the book back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Help is in these pages","review":"This is a workbook designed to help anyone with traumatic disorders break down the strongholds but does require effort and lots and lots of patience. Not every person who has endured trauma may be ready to face their demons and break down the strongholds within themselves caused by their debilitating experiences.

It would also be a great tool to have with a professionally trained PTSD counselor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for military IMO","review":"This is a general purpose PTSD workbook.

Chalker has made possibly his most accessable book for a decade. The race aginst time to defeat an unstopable foe really sets the sequels pace. I thought it was great that Chalker finally explored the water races in greater depths(No pun intended). Whilst the story may lack the epic feel of the last Well World sagas it makes up for it with fantastic storytelling and some of Chalker's best character work ever. A must for fans and non-fans alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"Formulaic But Fun","review":"While on my recent horror kick, I rediscovered Bentley Little. I read The House a few years ago but don't remember being overly impressed. However, reading The Association recently changed my mind about Little and I became a believer.The Store, like The Association, is a great deal of fun to read. Little has a gift for making the reader uncomfortable and he uses this gift to great effect. The plot - discount chain opens a store in small town Arizona and strange things begin to happen - is simple enough but very creepy. Little capitalizes on reader's fears of the horrible taking place in everyday life, in everyday settings.The Store is not as good as The Association (and if you're wondering why I keep making the comparison, read both and you'll find out) however The Store has a more satisfying ending. This is not Nobel-winning stuff but it sure is fun!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rediculously unbelievable","review":"I picked up this book after reading a positive review by Stephen King on one of the book clubs I do business with. What a mistake. I'm a big King fan, he's made me laugh, cry, frighten me to the point of almost soiling myself and invoked many more emotions. I had never read anything by Bentley Little and should have kept it that way. I kept wanting to through this book out, but I just thought it had to improve....it didn't.I think he had a good idea with this book but didn't know how to tell it. Most of what happens in this book is just too farfetched for the mind to accept. It dosen't scare you or make you think. It just pisses you off."},{"rating":"1","title":"If Michael Moore wrote schlock fiction novels.","review":"Wow, this one's bad.I pushed past 220 pages of liberal preaching before the horror started, only to discover that there wasn't going to be much horror.Nothing much happens: The Store lowers it's prices below the local businesses, threatens it's employees, and occasionally kills someone, mostly off scene so that you're not sure what exactly happened. Although there's not much action, the protagonist gets plenty of space to complain about everything from organized religion, to the environment, to the shallowness of his kids' music - page after page after page of that.If you have to keep reading Bentley Little, skip The Store and read The Resort instead. At least it's a horror novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull and definitely not scary","review":"If you are interested in a diatribe against Wal-mart and how it's ruining all the small towns in the country then this book is for you. Their is very little suspense ,if any, and apparently the only way the author could keep his own interest level up was to throw in a fair amount of vulgar, gratuitous sexual content. Poor effort, the \\"story\\" could've been told in less than 100 pages and was predictable from beginning to end with little character development."},{"rating":"2","title":"THRILLER","review":"My first Bentley Little book and I hate they're so difficult to find.A true horror tale about a chain of stores that take over small townsall over the country. They control every aspect of the citizens' livesand some of the control is on the down and dirty.Can one man fight this system and win or will he be taken downwith the rest of them?A thrilling book that was difficult to put down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total rubbish","review":"I just finished this book and although I found the concept of it intriguing and scary, the book as a whole was laughable rather than frightening. As if a store could take a newborn baby from her mother in the hospital because they missed a couple of payments on their microwave! Where was the President of the United States, police forces in other counties/states, the media? I enjoy suspense and horror novels but only if they're in the realm of reality, which this whole book was not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Creepy!!!","review":"I found this story really chilling, and I couldn't put down this book. It's also quite thought provoking, which is unusual for this kind of book. While the idea is excellent and the story gripping, the last few chapters are disappointing and definitely not at the same level as the rest of the book. Definitely worth reading though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Price of Admission","review":"This is my third Bentley Little book, and I come to realize what attracts me to his work. He's entertaining. He's no Hemingway, nor Steinbeck, and never will be. He's a writer with a twisted and off-kilter perspective on our society. He doesn't seem to take himself seriously, which is a good thing. The Store is a great little diversion for a few days, and it's worth the seven bucks. You can do much worse with the money. Like going to see any movie in the theaters these days."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT BOOK!","review":"Though the first book I ever read by Bentley Little, The Revelation, was not very good, I'm glad I gave him another chance. I read the House, then The Store, and let me tell you, it was great! The characters were unique, the plot one of the most original, and the book in general never gets too slow. The story catches your attention at the very start, and leaves you thinking until the end. This was a book I was \\"stuck\\" in ever after it was over and I was reading something else. Oh, and it made me look at department stores in a whole new light!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Little","review":"The Store is, in my opinion, Bentley Little's best novel and not one to be missed. While the scenario at first appears to be over the top, Little has a way with drawing you in to the story where the inplausible becomes suddenly plausible. That's what makes this not only a great horror novel, but a brilliant satire and a novel of extremely black humor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun! Awesome original idea!","review":"This was my first Bentley Little book I ever read and I honestly had no idea what I was in for. It took me less than a week and even after it was over I was ready for more! Little can weave the strangest of tales and interloop the oddest of events and characters together to make an awesome story. Very original and very scary! Loved it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE ENDING","review":"I gave this book 2 stars because it had a great opening, and for the most part it kept me interested. Other than that though this is not a good book. As the story goes along it becomes more and more far fetched. It is more laughable than disturbing. The biggest problem though is the author has several bizarre story arcs he goes off on and he never resolves any of them. The ending made me wonder how this got published. I think the author could not figure out how to explain all the bizarre incidents that take place in the book so he just wrapped things up in a simple uninspired ending that left me annoyed.This book is not worth your time. This was my first Bentley Little book, and I must say I am very unimpressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent page turner, could not put down!!!","review":"This was a very good book that kept you wondering what other atrocities were around the corner. He is obviously talking about Walmart in many of his references to big chains destroying small local businesses(very true).He takes things to the extreme which is very entertaining. I loved the \\" Night Managers\\" also the sex scene I did not see coming at all- I will not say anything else on that subject.His books are over the top popcorn fun-pour on extra butter and enjoy the ride.Great fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Bentley Little's best","review":"\\"The Store\\" is the style of Bentley Little books I like: a typical family and town caught up in some sort of Being who makes things horrifying.As in other of his books, Bentley Little doesn't hold back on the black humor, his political views, sick stuff, gore.Great read with a satisfying ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing work from a talented writer","review":"I picked up a copy of THE STORE after having read some superb short stories by Mr. Little, hoping to find more of the originality and literary command he had previously displayed. I was sorely disappointed. The book is a stifling mess. There is nothing here to interest any discerning fan of horror. I hope his next efforts are up to the levels of talent and craft he has previously shown. This book is, quite simply, dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"Its greatly enjoyed..I am an avid horror book reader..and i would buy anything by certain extraordinary favourite writers...with this book i have added Mr.Bentley to my list as i would buy his books without any hesitation.. with my eyes shut:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"silly but entertaining","review":"This is a very silly book. The concept is scary enough, but it is done with absolutely no subtlety whatsoever....It seems like the theme could be addressed better in metaphor. Visualizing some of the things in this book just make me laugh--like the bikini clad girls that bring Bill his food...Honestly, I feel like the crappy Resident Evil movies did a better job with representing The Umbrella Corporation's threats than this book did. It definitely seemed influenced by some of King's cheesier bits.But, it's an entertaining enough read, if you are a quick reader. I read very fast and read it in one evening...however, if you are the type of person who takes a longer time to get through a book, I wouldn't recommend bothering with this. I don't think it would be a good use of your time.I might try reading something else by this author, just to see, though. Like I said--silly, but entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"absolutely third-rate drivel","review":"When an author receives such undiluted praise and wins book awards, I am naturally interested; in this case, my interest was short-lived: after 40 or so pages, it became clear to me that the author writes on a third-grade level. It's embarrasing actually. So why the hype: I suspect that there may be some political correctness lurking somewhere here. Intelligent readers - save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, but disappointing ending","review":"This is my first Bentley Little book, and I think it's great.

And not in that good meaning of bad. Just bad.","review":"From the very beginning, I was astonished at how bad this book is. It was not believable (I refrain from using 'unbelievable' so no one gets confused). I just couldn't finish it. I tried, I really did, but by the time a young mother was punished by the store for not paying the payments on her microwave, I'd had enough. It was bad. It was so bad. I can't emphasize that enough.A quick note: just repeating that something is creepy, does not make that something scary. I've read many excellent horror novels, such as 'It' and 'The Shining', and this was just bad.If you must read it, be sure your book store has a return policy before you buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Puerile and Ludicrous","review":"Can't anyone ever come up with a better conspiracy plot than at one extreme the government taking over and at the other capitalism?

She has always been able to use it pretty independently unlike some of her other software. It is definitely Disney quality and worth purchasing, especially if you have a Little Mermaid fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was alright","review":"I have to admit I wanted to read this book to learn more about female circumcision. I wondered what could possibly be going through a person's mind to even come up with such a barbaric tradition. Do these men really prefer going to bed with women that feel nothing but pain from them. Are they so afraid of a women's sexuality that they have to rip it from her. And what kind of brain washing does it take to get these women to go along with this. Etc. None of the questions that would come to mind when talking about this issue were answered. 95% of this book dealt with the US legal system and how they treat imagrants applying for assylum. I was really disappointed and had a hard time finishing this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I never knew of the atrocities in Africa as well as the US","review":"I do not get the chance to read often, but once I received this book I picked it up and never put it down. What an inspirational story of courage and conviction. It is also an eyeopening account of how the great U.S. treats people in true need for asylum.

This book gives us a good look at both sides of the picture. It makes us aware of our weaknesses and our strengths as a country, and made me understand that because I was born here I gain freedoms that others have to spend years fighting for.The difference is they come here seeking political asylum only to be jailed worse than some of our hardened criminals while suffering though the horrible INS bureaucracy. As Fauziya demonstrates in this book,good things come to those who wait.Even though her story brings some of our weakness as a country to light, she remains grateful to be here every day."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tea for one?","review":"Great gift.Ultimate tea set.

From his early troubles at school with a rancorous schoolteacher to his many adventures with his siblings, Mr. Burke gives readers an entertaining opportunity to experience firsthand his life growing up in Ireland. His colorful language and skillful use of native Irish dialect are music to the ears. And Mr. Burke does not disappoint in delivering that rare combination of comedy and tragedy that the Irish are known for! All in all, this book demonstrates that Mr. Burke is a superb storyteller.

I was expecting a insight into days gone by in a local area what i read was lies, gossip and fiction.I can only assume this was self financed, as how a book this crap got published is beyond me.If you do buy it anyway, then remember these words when your finished \\"I TOLD YOU SO\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Too dim","review":"This light is very dim.

Pure, unadulterated violence. My kinda game. Yeah, the graphics are way outdated, but the manner in which you can blast body parts off of your enemies is fantastic. I can't get enough of the dismemberment as they scream with their last breaths while being separated limb by limb with hot smoldering shotgun rounds. The \\"save anywhere\\" feature is a blessing. Overall, I enjoyed this prehistoric game. I had to cheat to beat the final boss, but besides that, the difficulty level was just right. Oh yeah, stay away from \\"No One Lives Forever\\". That game wreaks."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit too much hype over this game....","review":"Let me start by saying I have not played the PC version so I cannot compare the two. However, SOF for PS2 is...well...simply put, really dull. If you have played many first-person shooters, much of the game play will have a been-there-done-that quality, except not as good!The choices available in weapons are uninspired and the enemies are nothing special.Worse yet are the graphics. They are far below what the PS2 is capable of. There is little detail to textures and many objects look too simple. In fact, I have seen better graphics on some PS1 games!Text for the mission briefings is so small, you will need an enormous television to read it without going blind. Unfortunately, this is a port of a PC game that looks like a port of a PC game. Disappointing since so much better is possible (the PS2 version of Half-Life, for example)."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Game Does NOT Deserve The Hype It Gets","review":"All it is is blood and gore, no strategy, no intriging plot, not good ai, and poorly animated guns. Too easy also. If your looking for a good first person shooter get half-life. Its by far the best game i have EVER played. Great AI, guns, amazing plot, and gameplay. It full heartedly deserves it's many accolades such as \\"Best a game ever\\"-PCGamer and it got \\"game of the year award\\" by over 50 publications. You will thank me if u get it.

His hands do rotate so they can hold things better and Norbert will rest on his arm. The detail is amazing and of course, HE TALKS!The talking is a little muffled or maybe its the accent.

The main problem that I have is the driver software crashes, usually at least once per day. I reported the problem to Lexmark support and they claim that it is not a known issue. But when I search the web, I find that others are having the same problem (the driver puts a Lexmark \\"red diamond\\" in your system tray - when the software crashes, this red diamond turns into a \\"red X\\" and a reboot is required before the computer can print again). Also, the scanner/copier doesn't do too well with narrow items. I used to be able to make photocopies of checks for example, with my HP. Making photocopies of anything small is very difficult with the Lexmark x125."},{"rating":"1","title":"How hard is it to feed paper","review":"I've had my Lexmark X125 for almost a year now. I'm now shopping for an HP. At least once every 50-100 sheets, the paper feed mechanizm goofs and I have to open up the printer and pull out scrunched paper. And the lines of text on all pages are slightly slanted due to the paper pulling mechanism being on the paper's left side.The fax/copy feeder slot tries to feed as many sheets at the same time as it can. So to fax or copy a multi page document, I have to feed the sheets one at a time. What a pain.Ok, one more complaint. This printer, when it grabs a new sheet of paper makes a startling loud noise that makes some people jump.Pick another printer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Requires too many ink cartridges","review":"5 out of 10 print jobs are slanted, maybe because it grabs the paper so hard.

When I first got it, I was pretty happy with it. It did a good job at getting all of the small pieces that a normal hose would not pick up from my regular vacuum. But I did also notice that it was awkward in certain areas of my car because the hard plastic dust bin on the back doesn't fit well in small areas.

The author also lacks the thorough understanding of the involved issues. He pretty much never seriously presents the problems of the concept of soul, and thorough evidences and analyses against it (e.g., I would expect a comprehensive analysis of split-brain patients, phantom limbs, etc). The whole book is pretty much about beating a strawman that the author builds. Any of Ramachandran, Damasio, Flanagan, Ledoux, Wegner, Pinker, Dennett, Edelman, to name a few, would give much better information that this author. The book itself is very disappointing in this particular subject.

The book starts off great then drags on for the last two-thirds. The author does a great job of weaving in the history of the Dirty War in Argentina and the difficulty that followed during the transition to democracy. She also artfully shows the interesting conflict of opinions of those who ignored or even supported the actions of the Argentine military and the rationale of the \\"subversives.\\" In the case of the storyline, the truth is better than the fiction.

This song is a ode to the joy God gives us and is simply a musical masterpiece. The style of the music is Soft Rock / Pop and is very easy listening music - some of the songs such as Carry Me Through focus on some serious issues such as depression and hurt - but most of the songs have humourous lyrics such as Beetroot Stain where God's love is referred to as a beetroot stain that never goes away.

However the plastic is so soft that the teeth quickly srip, and then you can't aim the lamp. I also cannot really see how the lamp mounts to the side shelves of the stove as shown in the pictures, I tried and the mount will not clamp to the edge.

Then, over the course of the development of the series, we see the protagonist develop into a better officer and rise in the ranks. Michael Aye has done something different. His character starts as a post captain fresh from a major victory. There would seem to be little room for upward mobility with a start like that but the book is worth reading.Captain Anthony is assigned to suppress piracy in the Caribbean. He does so at a time when the stage is being set for the American Revolution. Tensions are running high but conflict has not yet broken out. The pirates are everyone's enemies and the captain proves to be an effective suppressor of their trade.The book is extremely fast paced and enjoyable to read. Some to the situation and solutions seem to reek too much of coincidence but it is a fun read. I look forward to more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good story, bad book","review":"This is a reasonably entertaining story in the genre of fighting sail. The problem is in the production of the book itself. Here's yet another example of a book which seems to have had no proofreading whatsoever. Typos abound, and on occasion words are simply used incorrectly.Here's an example from page 134:\\"Here, here,\\" they all said in unison as they drained their glasses.That mistake is made consistently throughout the book. The fourth lieutenant's name is usually spelled Witzenfeld, but occasionally it becomes Witzenfield.

I have read the first four books and getting ready to start the 5th. One thing that happened to me is that the phase 'the Fighting Anthonys' was added to the Kindle titles so I accidentally bought these a second time. Usually Amazon warns when you have already bought a book. I quickly got a credit, so no issue really. I originally bought the first four books in July 2010.

In older lamps, the entire metallic housing that the bulb screws into is exposed, allowing the two contacts (protected by the two tabs) to contact.However, with most (if not all) newer lamps, the metallic housing sits inside another housing, usually made of plastic or ceramic. So when you screw this product in, the two plastic tabs hit the plastic/ceramic housing on the lamp and prevents the two contacts from contacting your lamp's metallic housing.It's a little bit difficult to explain, but trust me, once you buy this and find out it doesn't work, it's easy to see why."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has an engineering flaw that is terminal!","review":"This is my third one to use in lamps. works as advertised UNTIL you get a bulb burned out.

It rivals William Cronon's \\"Nature's Metropolis\\" as the best environmental history book I've read. Anyone who spends time near/on rivers (especially the Columbia) will appreciate this book. White tells a fascinating, compact story (~100 pages) that will force the consciencious reader to rethink his/her relationship with rivers as a source of energy. The book is also a lesson in form and style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brief and Brilliant","review":"The Organic Machine is an ideal example of what great scholarship should produce. It's a short, beautifully written, passionate history of what we human beings have made of the Columbia River in the time since white people came to the Northwest. It is driven by an environmentalism founded on the understanding that man is not separate from nature and never can be. The protagonist of this book is the salmon -- a creature to whom we have done no favors by transforming the Columbia -- yet man is not the villain of the piece. This book is written, as White says, \\"to understand rather than denounce.\\" The profound depth of White's scholarship is made clear in the bibliographic essay that follows the text; the text itself makes use of massive learning in a graceful and accessible style. Anyone who cares about our relationship with the natural world, and who wants to think about it with some subtlety and historical grounding, should read this book. They don't come any better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed by the authors own expectations","review":"White says he \\"will measure the book's success by the extent to which is surprises its readers, catches them offguard, and forces them to think about new ways not merely about the Columbia but about nature and its relation to human beings and human history.\\"Well if this is his standard he failed miserably. The book is an absolute bore because it focuses so much on ancient history. White tries to bring in Native Americans and salmon as a way of bridging the gap between nature and humans - it does so, but it is painfully slow, dull and uninteresting. The book changes a little as it moves into more modern times, but his ending thesis would have been just as strong had he not tortured the reader with a 50 page history lesson.The last chapter also includes the term \\"Organic Machine\\" about a dozen too many times. We figured out from the title what the term meant, rampant repetition doesn't bring out his meaning any more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shootin' Envy","review":"I bought this for my fiance who loves to go and shoot pool.

The script did not detract from the humour and pathos, the suspense and the levity that make Thomas's portrayal of his flawed hero and those around him so interesting, including his love/hate relationship with his dog. Location shooting in the novel's setting added to the atmosphere of the time and place to create a believable film."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easier to scrub by hand","review":"I bought this item today at a home store, expecting it to clean just like on the HSN.

A lot of the dirt and oil had solidified making it extremely difficult to clean by hand. While I was a little dissapointed at how ineffective just using the steamer can be. The steam alone does little to clean. However, once you attach one of the three scrubbing brushes the cleaning became much easier.Because of the small size cleaning can be a little tedious especially on the wrist since you have to angle the steamer slightly to be able to scrub properly. As long as the surface of whatever you are trying to clean is something relatively low (ie a counter top) you wont have too many problems.

It cause more work and stress, by the constant need to pump and pump and pump, etc. My thumbs were sore, I was exhausted. Little cleaning was done.

It is obvious that he believes that retirement, in whatever form it takes, is a wonderful period of your life. A time when you can pursue dreams you couldn't when you worked 60 hours a week or had small children at home. A time to find your true purpose in life and fulfill it.

I now realize that it is entirely up to ME to create a totally new and exciting life for myself. If I get bored, it is MY fault.As you may have guessed, I've quit my job (my last day is tomorrow!), and I can't wait to get started with the next chapter of my life.Definitely read this book if you have any doubts about retirement.Onward and Upward...."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Argument For Leading a Balanced Life","review":"In today's world of workaholics, greed, and materialism, Mr. Zelinski offers a fresh voice of moderation and living life.Mr. Zelinski gives case examples of many people who have eschewed a lifetime of corporate servitude, and have chosen the road less traveled. Some people have learned to live on less money. Others retire early to pursue their dreams before the onset old age. The book is a compendium of people choosing to ignore the Pied Piper of Capitalism, and have created their own trail of life.The road to a life of fulfillment has few signposts, and is difficult for even those of intelligence and independence. Knowing that others strive for independence, and the efforts they needed to achieve their goals has given me new ideas for my own life.Mr. Zelinski, thanks for your breath of fresh air."},{"rating":"2","title":"You Will Love Retirement After Reading This Book!","review":"Zelinski paints a picture of retirement so enticing that you will want to retire early even if you are in your thirties or fourties.He covers essential non-financial topics such as the importance of friendships, lifelong learning, the right place to live, and interesting travel options.His retirement-planning tool called \\"The Get-a-Life Tree\\" along with seven pages of retirement activities for it are two extremely important features that you won't find in any other retirement books.Zelinski's approach is extremely informative, fun, and captivating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Master of repetition","review":"The author makes a number of good points regarding the challenges and creative responses to retirement, then repeats them ad nauseum throughout the book. The entire content of this book would be equally well addressed in a 3 page article."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not really impressed","review":"I quit reading it half way through. It focused too much on \\"Don't Worry-Be Happy\\". It is much harder to be happy if you don't have enough retirement money. It needs advice on money, insurance, wills etc. etc."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kind of a \\"what color is your parachute\\" repetition","review":"I should have read more of this book in the bookstore before buying. If you already know what you want to do with retirement, or at least have the basic ideas in place, this is an almost useless book. Started reading, then skimmed it and put it on the shelf. Nothing significant in it on the total package of retirement issues, and thin on substance. As others have commented, it could have been written clearer in one-third of the number of pages. A disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great idea but poorly written","review":"My wife and I are preparing for retirement in our mid-fifties -- twelve years from now. (Yes, we like to start planning early.) The title and summary on Amazon intrigued me so I purchased this one along with some other books that specialize in the non-financial aspects of retirement. This book is, unfortunately, not of the caliber we experienced in our other finds. It is poorly written to the point of being frustrating in its redundancy -- so much so that my wife stopped reading it after getting halfway through. The book does have one redeeming feature: the author has a very good idea on building an interest tree of what you'd like to do with your future free time. This idea is probably worth the price of the book, but don't bother to read anything other than that chapter."},{"rating":"2","title":"True retirement wisdom!","review":"The book was terrific - it made me think about the non-financial aspects of retirement and opened a view of what exciting things will lie ahead if I will come out of the box of my routine life! It helped me see that there is more to life than cashing the next paycheck! I have given this as gifts and recommended it to many - one person told me that he got it for Christmas and just a little ways into the book decided to retire within the year - mandatory reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Be aware of duplicate material","review":"This book is an entertaining read but there are large chunks of word by word identical passages with his other book \\"The Joy of Not Working\\".

Or there were for me. I pre-viewed 'How to Retire Happy, Wild and Free' on the internet and decided it was worth a closer look. And it was. I now have it on the bookshelf, already bookmarked at the page I know will settle me down the next time I start to lose my confidence and forget that I am on my way to following my dream!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The same as Joy of not Working","review":"This is pretty much the same book. So get one or the other but not both."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring read!","review":"I have never written a review about a book but this is an exception. I will have to agree with another reviewer. I found it to say the same thing throughout the book. Not any real help for those searching for creative ideas unless you have lots of income. He talks about money doesn't have a part in a fulfilling retirement and then turns around and writes about how rewarding traveling and other expensive hobbies and activities can be. Does this guy live in the real world? Reminds me of the song, \\"Don't worry, be happy\\".In other words, when you retire just throw resposibility out the window and do whatever the heck you want to do without consideration for anyone else or consequences."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pep talk for the clueless","review":"This book doesn't offer much in the way of nuts-and-bolts financial advice, other than to suggest (as others have) that you don't need piles of money to find happiness in retirement. Instead it focuses on how to craft a meaningful life, as opposed to vegetating in front of the TV for the next 20 or 30 years. Many bits, e.g., the value of friendships and the importance of diet and exercise, seem painfully obvious, though others may prove helpful. If retirement is drawing nigh and you're fretting about how to fill all those empty hours,the author provides an exhaustive pep talk. For the more resourceful and imaginative reader, it's heavy going."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I like this book because it focuses more on how to manage your time following retirement rather than how much money and assets you have accumulated."},{"rating":"2","title":"How To Retire","review":"Mr. Zelinski is a very prolific author and I have followed his work over the years.

Using a humorous style, Ernie covers just about everything that you should think about before retiring. Almost every page of his book features quotations from a wide variety of people and his writing style is filled with humor and an enjoyment of life. Most people will eventually retire, but not enough of them will enjoy their newfound freedom. This book should be required for everyone who wants to enjoy their retirement. If you like the cover, you will love the book. Incidentally, you might like this book and benefit from the insights that Ernie provides, even if you are south of thirty!

But many years in the workforce do take their toll in terms of time and focus on non-work options and opportunities. This book is helping me turn a great decision (early retirement) into a brilliant decision.The book is chock full of ideas, suggestions, cautions and enthusiasm.

The author has a great way at making you look at your retirement in such a different light.And the best chapter - about being involved in a community - on page 151-152, he talks about the great community of Sun City Center - which is the same community we have been visiting for over 8 years and finally purchased a home in 2009.It's a great over 55 community.It has to be one of the best books I have ever read.

I had a Rainbow vaccuum cleaner and was swept away at the thought of cleaning the air with water, but this device does not \\"clean\\" any air. It just throws scent into the air.

The oils deteriorate the integrity of the bowl and also cause irreversible staining. No one wants this item sitting out in the open for everyone to see when the bowl, even empty, looks like some rancid, never cleaned fish bowl. The first machine I owned, I thought it was my fault because I used authentic essential oils and figured the real oils were just too potent for the plastic to handle. Nope, the second unit did the same thing and I only used the air revitalizer refills made for the machine. I can honestly say $50 is over priced for the product quality of this unit.

Unfortunately, neither my husband nor I are one of those people! To me, all of the different scents of both products smell the same -- a very overpowering disinfectant type smell. I could not tell you if it is the vanilla, lime or citrus scent that is in the Brethe unit at any given time. Since I bought 2 units at the same time, I will try to figure out how to make them useful without giving myself and my husband major headaches from the smell! The recommended \\"dose\\" of fragrance is 2 capfuls. I will cut way back on that and hope for the best (and hope that the manufacturer comes out with a new type of additive)."},{"rating":"1","title":"dont waste your money","review":"Its just a giant room air freshener...and its a LOUD one. I don't buy pine cleaners as I don't like the smell, so I was very disappointed with the oils they provided with this machine. I tried using some essential oils and the smell was OK, but its cheaper and quieter using the essential oils by themselves. Too darn noisey and too weird with the ugly blue glow. Mine is going back for a refund. I am ashamed that I fell for this thing, but at least I can get my money back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Has potential but needs works","review":"Interesting product. I bought it as an alternative to another brand that i could not find. The other brand was in my hotel and it appeared to be very well made. This unit is made of cheap plastic and seems to degrade over time. It has not been moved yet cracks are building up for no apparent reason. I only just discovered the cracks after spending days tring to find someone who had the liquid in stock. The liquid is not readily accessable anymore. Had i known I would have not bought the machine. The lavender smells more like a household cleaner then say a relaxing spa like experience. Disapointed but teally wish it was like the one I had in the hotel room."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete junk, got a replacement and they both broke","review":"This device was not meant at all to be turned on continuously which is the way I wanted to use it. After a short amount of time, the plastic bowl gets cracks in it and the water leaks out. Amazon sent me a replacement and the new one had the exact same problem.

We have 2 dogs and although we sweep daily and bathe them often, we just couldn't get rid of the wet dog smell.

Just wish they would come up with some new scents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me?","review":"Like everyone else I got sucked into this product. I saw the video & a presentation while at Bed Bath and Beyond and thought it would be a great solution to my musty basement. I used it for 2 weeks for about 12 hours a day, I tried all the scents, followed the directions.What a joke! All this product is a continued air freshner. The scents are so artifical it's disgusting. The lime & citrus scents smell like harsh household cleaners (pinesol) and the vanilla smells like that cheap airwick spray can. It masked the smell while it ran, but the second you turn it off the musty smell returns and when I changed the water, it was never dirty like they say it can look like.Needless to say, I returned it and got my money back. This cheap plastic bowl isn't worth the $60."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just OK","review":"The Brethe Machine is just OK.. Not quite what I was expecting.

They recommend it in the bedroom for sleeping. It looked good. Well, I need a dark room to sleep in and the blue light is way to bright (and noisy) to sleep by and it cannot be turned off. The scent is pleasant at first but does fade fairly quickly. I made bacon and it did not get rid of the odor. It covered it up a bit when I added more of the liquid scent, but, as the scent faded, the bacon odor got stronger. It comes with a good warranty, but I had 2 units break down and had to send them back. True, they sent new ones, but both units died after just over 1 month each. Finally the third unit worked. A few months later, I was trying to clean the top of the unit and looked closely at the slots. Green mold had formed in the corners, a bi-product of the water. I didn't want something blowing mold spores around, so out it went."},{"rating":"2","title":"It really works","review":"I bought the air revitalizer because I have dogs and a cat and I didn't want my house to smell like I have dogs and cats! When I bought it, I lived in a one story house. It worked great. (The only scent I've used is vanilla.) I don't think the sound is too loud, but I lived in a large house. When my house was for sale, I used it everyday and the house had a nice scent. I moved to a two story house, and didn't think it would scent as much of the house.

It is the best thing I have found for fighting catbox odors and cigarette smoke. When the scent is first added, my whole 1100 square foot condo smells great. Later in the day, it seems to lose its effectiveness in the rooms farthest from the unit. Of the 3 scents that come with the machine, I like the lime the best. The citrus is good, but I didn't care for the vanilla at all. I wish a sample of the lavender came with it also. A drawback is that you can only buy the scents specially made for the machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the greatest","review":"This definitely smells up a place - and quickly.

I really thought that this was going to smell like... ya know.... like the 3 scents that it came with ( VANILLA, ORANGE, LIME).. but it doesn't.... it smells like PINE PINE AND PINE!!!! No matter what fragance you use, they all smell like PINESOL. I don't mind if I'm moppig the floor and I get that scent..cause hey that's the scent that I'm using. But if I'm expecting an orange scent then that's the scent that I should be smelling, but I'm not. Overall the product is eh!! I mean it has a pretty blue light that looks nice as the machine is doing it's thing but that's about it. Once the machine is off the water tends to look dirty ( even though I only have it for less than 10 minutes). It's not worth the $60 bucks she paid for it.

I do agree that the vanilla scent is horrible. The lime and citrus are ok, but I like the lavender the best. It smells wonderful. I thoroughly believe this does clean the air to some extent. When I turn mine off the remaining water had a brown tint to it a lot of the time. Obivously the Brethe is not going to be as effective as an air purifier, but it doesn't make those claims.

It does not clean the air, as they say, and it does a poor job of humidifying.The machine is ugly, with blue lights that shine on the water you can turn off, and a bright blue light on top that stays on continuously (even when the Brethe is off); which along with the loud motor, makes it obtrusive in any room.It comes with three scents, lime and citrus, which both smell like bathroom cleansers; and a nauseating vanilla. Lavender may be purchased separately and is a bit more tolerable.Don't waste your money... If you want an air freshener or oil diffuser, there are cheaper ones out that that do the job better and smell a lot better. If you want an air purifier, this simply isn't it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great when considered practically","review":"I suffer from bad alergies and this device has been a life-saver for my wife and I.

When considered with other air cleaning systems it functions quite well, and the humidifying feature is a godsent in winter. The emulsifing sents are a nice addition although not nessisary to feel the benefits. However, it is an air cleaning humidifier, not a de-humidifier. This device is for a normal to dry environment, not a moist to moldy (wet) environment. It adds moister to the air, it does not remove moisture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spend your money elsewhere","review":"I'd have to go along with the last 2 readers reviews. This book provides a brief summary of a lot of issues but provides no real substance. A lot of the examples just demonstrate the author's past experience with no explanation as to how you would apply them to your own.

I read the book after reading the online reviews which said it was 'Excellent\\" and a 'Must Buy\\", but it seemed to me this novel was something Mr Wilson put together on a wet Wednesday afternoon. In my opinion you'd be better off to save your money and wait for the next Repairman Jack novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable and poor","review":"This entire book can be predicted by the time you've reached page 5. Characters are hollow stereotypes. The adventures are ho-hum as you KNOW that the two main characters must survive. Even the eventual relationship that develops between the two would have been given a C- in a high-school creative writing class.Predictable, boring, poop. Was this really written by F.

ERICK V (DREAMBO)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Audio excellence","review":"Welcome back Jeff. It is great to see Jeff Lynee embracing the ELO legacy that he left behind. This collection is an attempt to reclaim ELO from the ELO II effort led by Bev Bevan. The included booklet on the band makes it perfectly clear that everything ELO did was Lynne's work with assistance from Richard Tandy and everyone elese was just players. The strength of this set is the exceptional audio quality of the remastered songs. Sonic details I have never heard come out clearly. You can rediscover these songs. The notes are sketchy and don't shed a lot of light on the songs or on the band's development. Afterglow had much better material included. The unreleased songs are okay, not nearly as interesting as the unreleased tracks on Afterglow but hey any new ELO is okay with me. All in all a good treat for avid fans with great packaging. Sets the stage nicely for the new ELO album in 2001."},{"rating":"2","title":"POW! Very strong remasters!","review":"One additional comment on the excellent job of remastering these classic recordings.As a musician myself, I could never quite get my rocker buddies on the ELO bandwagon back in the 70s, mostly because no matter how I loved the songs, the originals rarely had the \\"crunch,\\" in the form of bass and drums, that is the stuff of hard rock. In this boxed set, Jeff Lynne has \\"put the crunch in\\", and you can really hear it in the results! The drums and bass are upfront and a lot crisper, with the result that the songs have a lot more bite than they used to. Now they finally pack the wallop that they always aspired to.Bravo!"},{"rating":"2","title":"After All (4.5 stars)","review":"Just in time for Christmas 2000, ELO released their second career spanning three cd set mixed in hits with rarities, unreleased tracks and a couple of new performances. Jeff Lynne was finishing up work on what would become Zoom as well as remastering the band's back catalog of albums. The band's previous three cd box set Afterglow had been released in 1990. While that has some rarities that can't be found elsewhere, I like this collection better. Granted, there are some songs that I would've liked to seen used on here that aren't such as Jumping Biz, Whisper In The Night, From The Sun To The World and...well, you get the idea. No collection is going to be perfect but this one comes pretty close. I still think that this is still the best assembled collection and the remastering by Jeff Lynne, Al Quaglieri, Jeff Magid and Ryan Ulyate is about as good as it gets."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Set, But What About....","review":"Flashback is a lot of fun, I do love Xanadu, but where are Waterfall, Sweet Is the Night, and Boy Blue?

Or if you're just interested in a few odd facts about a few given movies, that's in here too...For me, I'm sticking to more contemporary naming books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eats batteries","review":"Sounded like a good idea.It's handy, light, easy to use.It also fades fast if you leave it on a little too long, and the battery gets drained way too quickly.

These handy lights are not designed to be task lighting, nor are they meant to light up entire rooms.

And they are a LOT safer than candles during a power outage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected...","review":"These tap lights require 4 AA batteries each. I bought 4 tap lights, so the batteries ended up costing me more than the tap lights did. The tap lights used up all of the battery life in less than 2 hours!

You cannot use them for any extended length of time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Both of mine quit working within 24 hours.","review":"Within 24 hours of buying these in a two pack, both quit working. I replaced the batteries in both and one worked four hours longer before going out as well.

Happy with my purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dead in three days. Do not buy these.","review":"I bought a two pack and both were dead in three days. Day two, the bulb housing snapped and it rattled.I disassembled them and they just aren't wired properly. The batteries are always being drained even if the switch is off, so they're not going to be useful for more than a few days at a time, then you'll be out 4 more AA batteries.I should also mention they use cheap solder and bad quality wires that had black soot on them. I really hope it was from the initial soldering and not because they got that hot.In short: If only they weren't wired so poorly they'd work just fine. They put out enough light for what you'd probably need them for, but having to replace the batteries every couple of days is just out of the question."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not A Very Good Recording","review":"I received a copy of this cd free at the show which my parents dragged me to. The cd itself is not of very good quality even for a live recording. It also is amazing how much this cd is going for on Amazon. This cd was available brand new with shipping at the official Society of Seven website for an amount much less than what it is being priced at here. I am not a fan of the Society of Seven as I find their act to be rather corny. I wouldn't go out and purchase one of their albums if they came out with one. They are exclusively a cover band. If you are interested in a local Hawaii act who has an album that is worth purchasing, you should try The Krush's Best of The Krush. They performed original material and did not rely on glitter or show like the aforementioned group."},{"rating":"1","title":"45 Dollars for 8 days?!?!","review":"I've taken several versions of this formula living in China. It has effectively treated me, and I would recommend this herbal formula, provided it's quality is assured, to anyone with appropriate symptoms. However, 45 dollars is an absurd price to pay for a bottle. The recommended dosage is 24 pills a day, which leaves you with a little over a week for a bottle. If you take this product for a month, you'll spend almost 200 dollars. That said, I've been spending between one and two dollars a bottle here in China, and I've seen it fairly marked in the US for between 5 and 10 $/bottle. But this is what they call highway robbery.

No marketing ace or designer can afford to do without Sevicescapes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bonhoeffer's general thought in an accessible format.","review":"For most people Dietrich Bonhoeffer is a difficult read. This is partly because his writing assumes a philosophical style which is not comfortable to many people. It is also because his thought it so complex and so rich that most of us are overwhelmed at first. This little book does an amazing job of extracting and encapsulating Bonhoeffer's principle ideas into representative snippets that beg for meditation and further reflection. In many cases the reader will also find here an impetus to seek out the more complete writings, which are carefully indexed at the back of the book. I can think of no better starting place for any lay person wishing to become aquainted with Bonhoeffer's overall thought for the first time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy and thought provoking...","review":"...I have been nervous about Bonhoeffer's work until I picked up this slim volume. Although it is meant to be read day by day, I finished it in under two hours. Bonhoeffer was so uplifting, despite his final days, and this book perfectly takes his thoughts and compresses them into enough snippets that make you want to read more. I am a curious layperson who strongly recommends this little book with big ideas."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work for me","review":"I put generic mountain dew in the bottom of a soda bottle, let it sit overnight, and the next day I saw a bunch of wasps flying around my backyard but none made it to the trap. :("},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this thing","review":"Ok, so I'm a 20 year old guy...and I own this model.

The model really replicates the real Jaguar 900 in a great way. I see the real ones all the time. I also own other Bruder toys. They are all plastic, but if you're a collector like me, then you don't have to worry about breaking them. I think this toy is for both kids and adults."},{"rating":"1","title":"problems abound","review":"The analysis is sound. This is to say, the examination of the relevant history and current structures, coupled with an examination of effects, is accurate and valid. However, the argument for implications is unsound - dangerously so. It seems that those driven to understand precisely why some people are faced with more challenges than others are usually willing to go the next step - to argue for engineered adjustments, blind to the fact that such programs engineer even more odious, systematic inequities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I will fully endorse this book because it sticks to the truth of the Gospel unlike many so-called evangelical preachers at Dallas Theological Seminary who grovel at Jewish politicians of Dallas. Don't they know that they are to give their lives for the Gospel? Whey do they serve Jews as masters. You can't serve two masters. I call on Dallas Theological Seminary to serve only Christ as King and God."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Is A Must For All Deacons","review":"This is an important book for those serving in the church as leaders, particularly deacons.

However, this is kinda a boring documentary box set. First the review of OK Computer I thought would be facinating. Nope. Just a bunch of people who are poorly introduced saying how great each song is, duh, and saying what they think about the lyrics. There is nothing about Radiohead here... it's not really about them and how they put the album together or their actual ideas behind songs. SO that first dvd was an hour wasted. Hoping for something better I popped in the other DVD, Homework, as it's titled. This one sucked even more. It's interviewing other people who love Radiohead... and once again really has nothing to do with radiohead.Don't waste your time or your money... go out, buy all the radiohead cd's and live performance recording you can and savor the music for yourself... you don't need anyone else to tell you what they think the music says."},{"rating":"1","title":"RUN AWAY FROM THIS DVD SET","review":"I wish I had read the previous reviews before purchasing. Incredibly boring, poorly shot interviews of a bunch of quasi-journalists saying absolute generalities that anyone who loved ok computer has already thought up themselves. All participants in these videos are completely or nearly completely unrelated to anything to do with the band. As for the band themselves - they are barely seen, barely heard.

This collection provides many of those wonderful tunes-whether love songs, patriotic songs or silly but fun novelty songs. I've played this 3 cd set for my mother and she sang along and reminisced about hearing these songs in her youth during WW2. I only have one small complaint and that is that I much prefer Dooley Wilson's version of As Time Goes By to Rudy Vallee's. One of the loveliest tunes ever composed, I have heard many versions by many artists and I'll always prefer Dooley Wilson's, perhaps because Casablanca is one of my favorite movies of all time. All in all a terrific compilation and a must have for anyone who is into collecting the music of the 1940s."},{"rating":"2","title":"WWII Songs: As Time Goe By","review":"I purchased the WWII songs for my mom and dad who met and married during WWII....we played them at our family reunion...they loved them...and listened to them for hours.

I tried bypassing the Export Wizard by right clicking on the selected photo and saving. This also inserts the transparency over the photo. I called Hemera in Canada and they instructed me to call Encore USA in CA for support. Encore USA said they couldn't help me. Encore's technical support is \\"limited to crashes, error messages and lockups\\". I also referred to their website hoping to find help in the knowledge base or FAQ's.

That is not how the traditional recipes are made! Her recipes are squarely based on the stupid cooking school she went to! Americans are not asking for the easier version they are asking for the REAL version. I accumulated better recipes than hers for FREE on the internet!

I did find a few faults with it though; the Maverick shoots really hard and could actually leave a welt or injury if you got close enough. Another pet peeve of mine that turns into a problem is that with any pull-back spring firing system, someone can leave your precious gun sitting around loaded, for someone to accidentally fire when reloading, or to wear out the spring. The final glitch is the trigger is excessively hard to pull, and when your opponent is spraying off rounds at you, it gets aggravating if you're having trouble returning fire. It has little educational value unless you're going to serve in a war soon.

I like this gun because it has good range, good accuracy, good reliability, and a pretty high rate of fire.

I suggest buying whistler darts and carrying extras into battle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Looks simple, but watch out!","review":"I really don't think that you can go wrong with a Nerf gun! With this particular model, I really liked the smaller size. It is quick to load and fire and is simple enough for young children to use. (My four and 6 year olds play with this and love it!) I mistakenly thought that I could escape being attacked with this model, but as a mom I should have known better! This model works great around the house and in the backyard. More serious players (older children & adults) would probably prefer a larger model - perhaps one that can feed more darts. However, I really prefer the simplicity of this Nerf gun! I rated 4/5 stars on durability because some of the darts inevitably get torn or damaged after many firings. I would recommend buying an additional pack of darts to have on hand if you do not already have extras at home."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great value for price","review":"This seems to be one of the cheapest nerf guns and if you like these type of toys you can afford to have 2-3 of these to your collection. Some folks have customized these and painted them in more realistic (actual gun-like) colors which enhance its appeal even further. It represents a basic six-shooter and its range is moderate. The only issue is that the cocking action is too stiff for a 5 year old. That being said, most nerf guns that require cocking are difficult for such young children to operate, and therefore I am exploring the battery operated automated ones instead for my son."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great addition to the line","review":"Frustrating, because not only does the revolver not open as wide as I'd like, sometimes either it doesn't align properly with the hammer or the darts just get stuck.

It's fun but the suction cups don't stick to the walls and it didn't come with any targets to shoot so the darts don't actually do anything once shot. He also received the Nerf Dart Tag Furyfire 2 Player Set which is much more fun because the darts are velcro and stick to clothes and the vests that came with it. I wish the darts were interchangeable with this gun. The dart tag darts can sometimes be used, but must be loaded very carefully to work.

I bought this for my nephew but decided to try it out myself first, glad i did, because it is embarrassingly nonfunctional as a revolver."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gun that doesn't work","review":"This is a terrible nerf gun. I bought this despite the fact that my sister's kids had 2 of them and the were always broken. I thought maybe it was a fluke. NO. I bought this for Christmas and the barrel gets jammed and does not fire bullets. It won't hardly fire one without a bunch of messing with it, let alone 6 in a row! I have also bought the single shot guns with the pull back trigger (also nerf - and use the same bullets). They work like a charm and my 3 year old can use it with no problem! Do NOT get this gun, it is a complete waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Takes some Muscle to Prep to Shoot, But Fun","review":"We bought this gun for my 4 year old son. It's lots of fun to shoot the tv or glass door (with someone standing behind it pretending to be shot), but it is difficult for a little guy to pull the handle back before each Nef dart is shot. I have to help him."},{"rating":"2","title":"I use it 'off-label' but is a cool toy","review":"I bought this for a bad cat that likes to bang the pictures on the wall- especially while I sleep. Don't want to use the old method of a squirt bottle and get art wet. This works perfectly and the right power to scare him a bit but not hurt him at 10-15 feet. Have to aim super-high but flies straight! Great kitty blaster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"My 5 years old son adores to play with it. Everyday and everywhere! I would recommed it for this age kids. Also my husband loves it. He says that in his childhood he was dream for the toy like this =)))))))))))"},{"rating":"2","title":"Steampunk Gun in the making!","review":"This was a great purchase for me. I needed a gun that was cheap and easy to mod into a Steampunk gun. This was perfect! The quality of the gun is actually pretty good, and after a little paint job, it looks as if it is comes from the Steampunk era. Also, you can rig the gun so that you can fan the barrel! A must have for Steampunk lovers!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Really fun","review":"The oncoming zombie attack! Hordes of insanies running around! What do you do?

Roar!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed! Does not Shoot well","review":"Cool idea, but the level of frustation generated by its inability to shoot consistently. We can go through the entire 6 bullet clip without one shooting. I would say we are very disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loads of fun","review":"I bought 2 of these for my daughters(6 and 11) for Christmas and they have been a big hit, playing with them everyday. Only problem is that I like to play with them too, so I guess I'll have to eventually pick one up for myself.The darts do come out of the gun with some force, so I have them only shoot at targets and not themselves. Not enough force to hurt the skin, but possibly an eye.Also, not meaning to brag, but I have developed a rapid fire technique by holding the gun sideways and can hit the target about 20 feet away in a nice cluster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best nerf gun I've ever had!","review":"Love this thing! A lot of my hallmates had nerf guns and I decided to buy this one to get back at them. My brothers have tons of guns at home but I've never used one so nice as this. It shoots really accurately and far, is super simple to load, really nice. The transparent color is nice too, so you can see how many darts you have left. Anybody would have fun with this thing :) definitely a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Durable","review":"When I was looking for a nerf gun, I wanted one I could modify. This is a great gun to get into the experience of modding nerf guns.It's a nerf gun, so how educational can it be? That being said, it's still educational in that you can experiment with making your own darts of varying lengths, you can test different springs (if you find some that fit), you can modify the barrel to slide out further, make barrel 'clips' (if you have a spare gun), etc... so there are things to be learned, if you wish. There are also a great deal of youtube videos that demonstrate the different mods, which makes it considerably easier (and somewhat safer).As a toy, it's great. It's durable, simple, and it shoots things. What more can you ask for?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Jam's alot","review":"It has become a Christmas tradition that each year we get all the kids (our own, nieces, nephews, and the uncles cuz let's face it- they're just big kids) Nerf guns and the whole family goes nuts after dinner. (I think the adults have more fun than the kids) This model has been the most disappointing. We thought it would be a great basic gun that the younger kids could use, and it is, except that it keeps jamming. We actually have several of this model (4 or 5 maybe) and they all jam up quite a bit. I wouldn't recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweeeeeeeeeeeet!!!","review":"I just got this thing and I love how the barrel turns every time you shoot, making it quick to reload. It shoots pretty hard. It also has superb acurracy. I could easily hit my sister from about 30 feet away. Buy this and you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, but not for FOUR","review":"I got this nerf gun for my son who is 4.5. He is not big enough to cock this gun to shoot it. I got one for him and for dad, we played with them when the kids went to bed. Very fun, I want to get bigger ones just for me and daddy, but I need to get a smaller one that our son can work himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of crap!","review":"I bought two of these and they both misfire. Nerf should be ashamed of putting out such poorly designed toys. I guess $10 a piece is not the price point for quality anymore. Need to spend $30?? Save your money on these devices and look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun with the kids","review":"These are a blast! The ability to have multiple shots without reloading is such a great innovation. The only issue is that occasionally you get a dart that only goes 10 feet and normally they will do 30-40feet no problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brand New Maverick Nerf jammed","review":"This Nerf Maverick did not work since the first moment we used it.The barrel is jamming and not properly aligning the bulletts with the firing hole, causing misfire every other time.No user manual attached on how to solve this problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"A REAL HIT AND MISS","review":"I purchased two of these nerf guns for my five year old boy who was ecstatic the day the box arrived.The reason I ordered this particular item was because you can load six darts at one time (although you have to crank up each time) however I was very disappointed to watch my son become frustrated by the fact that the darts only shoot out now and then and not every time like they should. Upon my trying to shoot the darts I experienced the same issue. I think its a poor design and that you are better off with the single shot nerf gun unless you enjoy becoming very frustrated."},{"rating":"2","title":"sticky!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I got this gun for my birthday party and a whole bunch of darts. in my opion it is awesome and it has not jamed for me yet,but its cocking handle sticks a bit but all you have to do is push it a bit. my bro and older sis have theers have not jamed yet so I am pretty sure that its just a manufacurte problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable","review":"I have many Nerf guns and have souped up quite a few too. This gun is simply a bad design which breaks often and even when it works it does not shoot great. The one saving grace is that loading and slapping the barrel into place is fun ala Hellboy."},{"rating":"2","title":"I ordered 15 of these for our office. It was the right choice!","review":"We have 5000 sq ft office space and 25 employees. I ordered 15 of and acted as 'arms dealer'. Every person in the office requested one after they saw it in action (I 'sold out' in 5 minutes. I have to say that this is the perfect nerf gun for cubicle warfare. It's small, cheap, durable, and shoots with the perfect amount of power (for the office). Buy extra whistling darts. It's hilarious to see a single dart whistle across the office followed by 15 reprisal shots coming from all directions. I will buy more as our company continues to expand.15 out of 15 that I ordered arrived well packaged and working perfectly out of the box.I have no complaints!"},{"rating":"1","title":"PLEASE don't buy!","review":"I'm sorry to anybody who disagrees, but my friend bought one af these and it doesn't work! One of the darts got stuck in the chamber and was split in two by the rotation.

I instructed them to be careful but I was confident in the safety of the toy. No where in the gun literature did it say that the gun would still fire even within close range. My youngest son suffered a contusion on the cheek and my older son had a red mark on his forehead for more than 2 hours. Beware - the gun DOES FIRE no matter where you aim it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great choice","review":"We have been happy with this Nerf gun that my son got a couple years ago. It is easy to load and easy to shoot. It has held up very well and we haven't had any problems with it at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"My kid loved it","review":"Gave this to my son on his birthday. He loves it. Nice firing range, nice spring cocking action. Got him extra nerf darts (36pcs) so he can shoot and reload.One thing we noticed is when you load the dart, you want to push it in all the way; otherwise air leaks when you pull the trigger and the dart gets stuck in its chamber. no issue though, just re-push the stuck dart in all the way and retry. should fire like normal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, but I prefer the Jolt EX-1","review":"I bought one of these, eight of the smaller Nerf-N-Strike Jolt EX-1 (Hasbro Nerf N-Strike Jolt EX-1 Blaster) and a large amount of ammo for my office. Although as adults we may be biased, our general preference is the Jolt EX-1 instead of this product.The Jolt is smaller, easier to use and more accurate. The smaller toy does require you to reload after each shot, but except in the case of an ambush the reloading is hardly a problem -- sniping is better with the precision of the smaller gun, and the slower reload of the larger gun in all out battles is just as big of a drawback. The biggest advantage of this gun is the coolness of the mechanical action.Either way, these toys are a lot of fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"I feel like a combination of the Terminator and Mad Max.","review":"Awesome design. My only real gripe is the range, which causes accuracy to fall off fast at anything over than 10 feet. Still, I've had one for over a year, and it's still going strong. I like it so much that I bought two more as gifts."},{"rating":"2","title":"might have been better in French...","review":"On first glance, this book is about a women, who waits 30 years for the return of her fiancee at war. She lives among the dying widows, the old, faithful ones in a life punctuated by startling moments of beauty and tenderness. The use of language is exceptionally beautiful in this book. The story takes on a dream like quality; colorful, vivid yet almost surreal at times. On a deeper level, The antagonist symbolizes the silent death of Russia, \\"the winner of the War\\"- caught in between the empty lure of Communist regime and the propagation of western filth."},{"rating":"1","title":"not up to expectations","review":"I thought the Fuller name on a product meant quality.

I was turned off by all the religious overtones (can't even call them undertones as they are so prominent).This book is for Christian people and those who like to be inspired by the Bible and passages from the Bible. I was looking for something else entirely and wish I had realized what I was getting before ordering. That being said, it is not very well written, and the \\"anecdotes\\" aren't all that believable in that they seem very simplistic (made up) and the advice or answers offered are direct Bible quotes...If that's what you're looking for, this book might be for you, if not, avoid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sent wrong book","review":"I was very dissatisfied with this item, because I never received it.

I haven't finished reading it yet - but have found that even just one page a night before bed does wonders in slowly opening us up to change and positive ways of thinking. It's difficult to do in a world that bombards us at lightening speed with so many mixed positive and negative, draining messages. This is a great way to keep your feet on the ground, mind focused on the important things and even if you aren't religious to explore yourself and spirituality. Like a pocket psychotherapist ;-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"enthusiastic about positive thinking!","review":"I enjoyed reading these three books in one.

It is so lacking in freshness and originality that I was bored to senselessness. I found myself skipping pages and pages in this book. It felt like it would never end. And by the way, skipping those pages did not detract from this slow moving tale at all. The characters are all people you have met before in other of her works and better portrayed. It is hard to say exactly what is it that makes this book so poor except to say that in reading it you definately have a feeling of \\"been there, done that\\".

It seems to me that whoever made this game honestly thought that the game would automatically be a success just because it's a first person shooter and thus never really bothered with such trivialities as gameplay. In all honesty, the only thing carrying this title beyond zero stars is the fact that it runs fairly smoothly. Otherwise, every other feature this game has ends up somehow disappointing. The environments are bland, the enemies look half-cartoonish, the weapons are nothing to write home about and the game's atmosphere is absolutely lacking. This title looks and feels exactly like the very first first person shooter for the GBA called Backtrack, and believe me when I say that this is not a very good thing. If you must have a first person shooter that you can play on the go, get either Doom or Ecks Vs. Sever.

Dark Arena is pretty much a Doom clone. What's the difference between the two? Well, hmmm . . . Doom is a better game. Dark Arena features enemies with zero intelligence which make them a breeze to kill even on the hardest skill level. The graphics in Dark Arena seem a little more bright and sharper than Doom but Doom looks better all around and is simply more fun to play. Dark Arena does offer a good variety of weapons, some neat looking enemies, and some fun levels but all of this is sub-par to the Doom games.

The advice in the book is solid, and the quotes from the pioneer women are especially interesting and informative. It is refreshing to hear their perspectives, and they provide wonderful information, ideas, and a sense of sisterhood.My main complaint about the book is there is no new information or anything groundbreaking. Most of the author's ideas are obvious, and she should let the pioneer women speak some more.Overall, I would recommend this book to young women just starting out who are not quite sure what to expect or if they are on the right track. The pioneer quotes are worth the price of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gorgeous listening","review":"Ordinarily I cringe when I get a CD filled with \\"arrangements\\" of music, great or less great. My reasoning is that a composer knew what he was doing in the creative process and who is so-and-so to alter it? <Russian Soul> on the other hand proved so beautiful at first hearing that all my prejudices went out the window. Here are 13 tracks of Russian music by Gliere, Tchaikovsky, Mussorgsky, and other lesser known composers (including \\"Folk\\"), played with melancholy love by violinist Cerovsek.

The wrap on this handle is comfortable and looks to be durable.I was able to cut the legs from a set of end tables down to a shorter length quickly, cleanly and accurately with a few precise pulls for each leg.I am very pleased with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"A+ quality and value","review":"I use this saw set primarily for finish carpentry. But have also used it extensively for cutting DWV ABS Pipe and other soft materials.

With the help of an experienced prostitute, they find a young 11-year-old runaway. Violence ensues and the younger woman and the girl are on the run.I have to say I didn't watch this all the way through. After about 45 minutes, I found the whole thing too upsetting to continue.

Lorraine Stanley is terrific as a London prostitute who gets involved in some nasty business involving a runaway girl and a wealthy client. The following day, on the run to Brighton, with her pimp in hot pursuit, she tries to scrape up the cash to put the girl on a train to Devon.Events, crammed into a single day, move much too fast finally for everybody, and two graves dug in the night are eventually occupied by the fated victims, though not until after the suspense has been drawn out to the breaking point. Photography and editing are as fine as the performances of the cast, and the music track is especially haunting. Rarely has the Moonlight Sonata been used in a film to underscore such a darkly grim sense of foreboding. A real nail-biter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Put Next to Bulfinch's","review":"Chapters 1 - 4 can be entirely skipped as they are a little slow and dry. Squire discusses the contrasts of the indigenous peoples, the Iberians, and the \\"new comers\\", the Milesians, before you have a clue who the Milesians are. If you decide to read the first four chapters, wait until after Chapter 15.But don't let that deter you from the book. Chapters 5 through 15 are well worth the purchase in and of themselves. The stories are well told and Squire fairly presents the discussion as to the nature of the existing historical ruins that so enamored William Blake.I would like to have seen the mythology from Britain separated out into its own full treatment as the mythology of Ireland is plenty to take all at once.

She loves everything \\"princess\\", and we love the story. This game seems as if it was created in two minutes - no real thought put into it at all. You spin the spinner to move up the spaces on the board. On each space, randomly, you may be asked to move up or back a space(s), maybe add a bed(s) to your piece or someone else's piece, until someone gets to the end (doesn't have to be exact count). Then, everyone counts up their beds, and the person with the tallest bed - wins. Mind-numbingly boring! I think what I hate most about this game, is all the reading. The girls that love princesses (3-4 yr olds) cannot read. My daughter spins the spinner, moves her piece, then stares at me, waiting for me to tell her what to do. Her friend does the same thing.

It sounds good, but not as good as their other 2 albums. They even remastered it and it sounded a little better, but still a little thin for a band this heavy! Needs way more bass, and a better sounding Kick for sure. Anyway, this album has less of a vibe than the other two in my opinion. All their albums have a concept type feel to them, or motif. This album feels more like a bunch of separate songs than a concept album if that makes any sense. The vocalist experiments on a few songs with certain vocals that can be a turn off to some, almost silly sounding, but after a few listens you get used to them and they are great. The music is some of the heaviest I've ever heard. For any of you Mastodon, Isis, Neurosis junkies, or old school Death Metal junkies, check this band out, they are AMAZING."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids liked them","review":"These were purchased for the kids!

This collection also features many games that were later scrapped like \\"Authors\\" which are exceedingly funny and far more intelligent than later episodes.For the price, you can't miss.

And don't be misled by pictures of Greg Proops and Ryan Stiles on the cover - they appear in very few episodes, and only near the very end of the set. I bought this curious to see the origins of the familiar Drew Carey version of \\"Whose Line?\\" - which this set delivered - but ended up mostly bored and disappointed. There's a reason most of these early British improv performers didn't show up on the American show. Yes, I'm a Python fan.

So i decided to buy another one, because the ones i had b4 didnt do that, so thinking that it would be like my old adapters it should be at the right settings, but nope.

The quality of sound coming out of the headphone jack is worse that subpar, it barely qualifies as audible noise. There is so much static, I can hardly recognize the original sound. The fact that I would rather use my malfunctioning laptop audio jack should speak volumes about the poor quality of this product. Also, the minimum volume is way too high for easy listening, even if it were audible.Even though it is cheap, don't get it.

I am close to buying a brand new laptop, which I cannot afford or I would have done that in the first place, just so I can have sound that actually works. Oftentimes, the sound card will just stop working, and no amount of unplugging and plugging it back in will make it work.

Feels extremely flimsy, and doesn't fit securely in the USB port. I've wrapped it with duct tape after reading the reviews about how easily breakable it is. That seemed to help. I down-graded from Vista to XP, and I couldn't find the right sound card driver. I originally got another sound card that was absolutely wonderful, but my cat broke it, and I couldn't find it at the price I purchased originally. So I got this to hold me over for a while.

I knew it wasn't going to be the best thing, but figured it wouldn't be too bad since I'm only paying a buck or two for it. Needless to say, you get what you pay for. This product is flimsy and cheap! It worked for a week before breaking. However, before it broke, it worked OK. Windows 7 recognized it and installed the proper drivers instantly/automatically. The sound quality wasn't spectacular and just OK. If you're in a bind, it may work. Just don't expect it to last."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks extremely easily.","review":"I purchased this because the headphone jack on my MacBook had stopped working. I received it and immediately noticed that it was just TOO loud! Next, the case came off after me barely touching it. Next, the left sound channel completely disappeared,and I was only getting sound from the right side of my headphones (note I tested the headphones on other devices and they worked perfectly). And finally my computer stopped detecting it completely! Upon further investigation, two of the badly soldered connectors from the USB plug to the sound card had broken. I re-soldered it, and after 2 days it has stopped working AGAIN! Spend a little more and get something that wont break after 5 days!"},{"rating":"2","title":"none","review":"the others must have gotten it broken in the mail. because mine was perfect and the sound quality for headphones and mic are great. it works great on my windows laptop! but the jacks on my laptop are still working so i use it on my PS3!!

Her audio ports went bad on her laptop. So instead of going through the hassle of having her ship her laptop to me and then I send it out for repair, we bought this USB adapter and it worked like a charm. We Skype all the time and I have had no issues with sound and microphone quality. Probably not for audiophiles out there, but if you're in a pinch and need a quick fix for audio, this is your product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprised in a good and bad way.","review":"I bought this for a friend who had snapped his 3.5mm jack in his computer. He needed a way to use his old headset. We plugged it in and it was plug and play. It worked but had 2 major problems. First, it had a light hissing noise coming from the headset/speakers. Secondly, this is a big one, the left and right channels were switched. The materials feel very flimsy and the QC seems very poor. However, if we want to switch the left and right audio channels now we can just plug this in."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good product. Treat delicately.","review":"This works as described. My audio hardware on my laptop went out (completely), so I bought this so I can at least use headphones. Works great. Installed correct driver after plugging in, no work required. There are only 2 cons I can think of.1. It IS flimsy. Be careful of hitting/bumping it on something while it's inserted into your computer.2. Must change volume from the OS/headphones, which sometimes takes a bit of time. Not a huge deal tho.I'm just happy that it brings audio back to my computer. On a plus side, it accidentally went through the washer, and it still works! I also have the other USB audio device that some suggest on other reviews, and I can honestly say that that is a better product, but this one is by no means bad if you treat it delicately."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get What You Pay For","review":"It broke in less then a week -__-....never tried out the mic jack just brought for headphone jack...but when it was working volume was stuck on playing extremely high"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work","review":"This is on the item only I purchased 2USB adapters and neither one worked.

I'm not a professional, so I don't know if its incredible, but do know that its just fine for normal household use. It was super easy to set up and works well. My only complaint is that the case is fairly loose. I have taped it together, and have no problem. Well worth it for a few dollars considering other units are $20!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Sound!","review":"The sound is scratchy, extremely shockingly loud. Adjustments to the sound mixer cannot fix the sound. It seems like there is normal good sound coming through but then there's this raspy 8 bit sounding fuzz that shadows the sound constantly. I am sure they could have eliminated the raspy fuzz with a simple filter but for some reason decided not to. I would not suggest buying this unless you enjoy raspy scratchy sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't waste your time with this","review":"Purchased to facilitate plugging/unplugging of a headset/mic combo for use with voice recognition. As others have said the speaker volume is way off and has to be adjusted each time. Fatal flaw is no matter what I did the microphone would not work thru this piece of junk.It is cheap but then so what. They should be sending them out free of charge or better yet dumping them somewhere in the Pacific between here and China."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does NOT work for recent Mac Book Pros","review":"Like the others who rate this product as one star, I found it to be totally unusable for the intended purpose. The seller does NOT list it as being compatible with Mac, for good reason, but based on other reviews I took a chance. It was a waste of money. My recent [Oct 2008] MBP did recognize the mic portion but there is a chronic 'clicking' noise about once per second as it cuts in and out that renders the mic feature useless. There is no documentation online or with the product, so it either works perfectly or you are hosed. The headphone portion will not work at all with my MBP regardless of the settings. I cannot tell whether I received a defective product that only half works or if it is truly incompatible with MBP but I would definitely tell other potential buyers to pay the exorbitant price for the Mac-specific adapters that actually work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not work with my microphone","review":"I purchased this as a small inexpensive alternative to a name brand audio adapter that I used to connect a the Boom microphone to my Vista-based laptop for Dragon NaturallySpeaking 9.5 voice-recognition.I could not get the laptop to recognize the microphone hooked through this device. The laptop does recognize the microphone through my other USB converter.It does work with headphones, but that's not what I bought it for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all USB Audio adapters are the same","review":"I have a more expensive Turtle Beach device that works and sounds great.

Highly recommend this to anyone interested in this community. Actually, I'd recommend it even if you weren't all that interested. The subject of Ephrata can either be terribly dry (to be expected of academia) or esoteric (Ephrata has a kind of \\"Burning Man\\" appeal among certain circles). The author brings the community to life and gives us a unique and penetrating glance into one of American History's best kept secrets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ittty Bitttty Case","review":"Looks great in pictures, but it is very tiny.

This software is OK, has a bunch of cool templates and project ideas, but that's about it. It also takes way too long to instantly load. Not a horrible software program -- especially if you get a $20 rebate -- but nothing to be very excited about either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forget About Tech Support","review":"I believe the PS 5 isa better prodouct than the 7.This version is very cumberson.

Since I was only going to say what everyone else has said, I'll cut right to the chase....DON'T BUY THIS PRODUCT!!!

It is so bad, acting, dialogue, camera work, etc. that they can hardly stand to see it. I use it as an example of how a great story idea can be ruined. I stress how artists make choices and how this is full of bad ones. I tell them that the stories we read may not be their favorites, but that they are at least well crafted works of art. This is not. Really, my favorite scene is where they replace the fabulously costly lost necklace with one they buy in a Hallmark Gift Shop."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Movie Ever Put to Film","review":"Usually students are happy to watch a video - any video.

Nicol Williamson's portrait of a spy forced to \\"go home\\" before his non-secret life can be fulfilled is really never forgotten. And Iman, in her first film role, is admittedly stiff and somewhat two-dimensional, but again, the portrait drawn lingers in a viewer's mind long after the celluloid's finished running. It was Otto Preminger's final film, and rumor has it that many of the cast were never paid; financial problems beset the entire production effort to the point Preminger had to sell some of his art collection to get the film released commercially. Well, he sure did the right thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"loved the series","review":"There are 28 books in this series. I have read 27 of them. I couldn't afford the 28th book.

After scrolling through so many pages you never find what you are looking for.If you play game for more then 20 min it gets really hot.Over all its not a bad deal if you don't need any help from customer service, can do without recovery disc and user manual and don't play games."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brian Garfield scores big with Charlie Dark!","review":"This is the second novel by Garfield that I have read (Hopscotch was the first). Although the book is a series of short stories, each one of them is filled with enough drama and intrigue to keep you glued to the end of the book. The individual characters of both the \\"good\\" and the \\"bad\\" sides (ours and theirs) are created with a good deal of realism, similar to the popular John LeCarre and Len Deighton works.

The focus of the film is on BUDS training, which stands for Basic Underwater Demolition/SEAL. Basically, what they tell you is that in order to get into a SEAL team, you have to be in good shape, and be extremely tough mentally.If you can avoid it, don't buy this film.

A long while back I played a Bandicoot game on the PS1 and liked it. However, this one has a few extremely annoying problems:1. Of course, the load time - very discouraging2. When paused in a level, sometimes I accidentally hit the analog control and press X, thinking that it's still pointing to \\"Resume\\". Unfortunately, there is no yes/no confirmation to go back to the Warp Room and it kicks you out, having to endure another 3 hours of load time.3. 3D perspective is quite bad sometimes. At times, you don't know if you are in front, behind, or aligned with an item.

There is so many vehicles! There is a copter pack, a jeep, a spacefighter, a glider, a little mechenical airplane type thing that shoots missils called the firefly, he has a robot suit with a water cannon and a bazooka called the mech, and he has a submarine. As for Coco, her not Crash, has a spacefighter, a scooter, and last a snowboard! This game is really great and the evil bandicoot with the elementals (evil masks of elements) named Crunch is cool. If you really like the Crash series and think you absolutely have to have this game immediately like me, than you should have fun with it and not be disappointed.

The graphics are not that great, and I hate the controls. When controlling Crash you feel like you are in a BMW M5 convertible that can only go a top speed of 30mph because of an engine problem.

I have been a big fan of crash since the first crash way back in 1891, or whenever it was. What is with the loading time?? The time it takes to load in between levels is unbelievable; in the time it takes to load you can hit the bathroom and make a sandwich!! Besides that the latest installment of crash is a continuing improvement from one to the next.

I've beaten every Crash game that has come out. I was so excited to get PS2 for Christmas that I could hardly wait to play Crash, that is until I loaded it. ***BIG DISSAPOINTMENT*** Aside from everyone's biggest complaint the load time, this is NOTHING like the previous Crash games. The character's are not even the same, the graphics are lousy too. I can't believe that Naugty Dog passed on the opportunity to development this game. You can't possibly expect Traveller's Tales to even come close to the brilliance of Daughty Dog. I did get Jak and Daxter THANK GOODNESS because that is the replacment for Crash and it's a awesome game! Crash fans don't even waste your money on this game buy something else!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LOADING ...[POOR] BUT CRASH IS STILL AWESOME","review":"THIS IS THE A GREAT GAME MINUS THE LOADING. THE FIRST GAME IS THE BEST THOUGH. THE GRAPICS LOOK ALMOST SIMILAR TO THE OTHERS. ITS FUNNY THAT KONAMI IS ONE OF THE MAKERS OF THE GAME. CRASH WOULD HAVE GOT 5 STARS FROM ME EXCEPT THE LOADING."},{"rating":"1","title":"SLOW, SLOW, SLOW","review":"We were excited to get a new Crash adventure game. What a disappointment. The game is fun to play, but not worth the SLOW LOADING. Every time you turn around, it seems like it needs to load again, which takes forever. If I had rented this first, I probably wouldn't have bothered buying it just because of the slow and often loading. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Worst Crash Bandicoot Game","review":"This Game was terrible. The only new thing about this game was that Coco was fully playable but you don't get to play as her very often anyway.Here's an overall view of the game:The Positives:-Good Graphics-Good Bosses-New VehiclesThe Negatives:-Sucky Levels!-Sucky Music-It takes about a hour to load-The Game is extremly hardI heard there is a new Crash coming out later this year. All I can say is that I hope it will be good."},{"rating":"2","title":"what has happened to naughty dogs?????????","review":"this isnt the same old crash!!!!!!!!!!!what is konami doing with crash??????????im very sad to rate a crash bandicoot game 4 stars but i would rate it 3. it isnt the same controllers but if you are a big fan of crash like me you would notice the differences!!!!!!!!!!!ONLY BUY IT IF YOU ARE A BIG FAN OF CRASH...im very disapointed with the transfer of crash to konami..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crash Bandicoot the Wrath of Cortex","review":"This game was pretty fun.IT had some tecnical problems though what I first got it I needed to set the disc speed to fast.And its a pain when you need to keep on doing it every time you play! But thats not it!it needs to load 35 seconds IN AND OUT OF LEVELS thats pretty annoying too. There are 30 levels (5 bonus)there is a boss every 5 levels.most of the levels are fun and challenging.You can also get cool powers.It took me about a month to finish all the levels.But I still only have 46% done.Overall this game is really fun but can get annoying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crash is back","review":"I know that alot of people say that the loading times [are unsatifactory], well, ya they do but if you have patience you will have alot of fun with this game. I loved how everything looked(graphicwise) and how fun the levels were. Even without the machines most levels are a blast and the ones with the machines are even better. I just hope if they come out with another crash bandicoot game it wont have as much loading time. If you have some patience and want to add a good game to your library that is good and [inexpensive], i would recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"He's back and in pain","review":"Yes crash is back and is kicking [behind] with new gadgets. thestory dosen't continue from the other crash games it's like none of that stuff has happened and Cortex is just starting to fight crash. the reason for that would probably be because naughty dog didn't work on this one. The graphics aren't as good as they could have been. Besides all that it is still a fun game to play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lame","review":"Can you say LOADING time. There is a \\"menu\\" stage where you select the level you would like to enter, then you stand on a number to select a level. And be prepared to wait. Takes average of a minute plus to load the stage(complete with annoying music). Its especially painfull when you walk over the wrong number while trying to get to the right number. It takes a minute to load then another minute to get back to the menu. Game itself had pretty decent graphics and it wasn't too hard or too easy. But I had to stop playing after the 10th stage because the loading time was just TOOOOOO annoying. You expect that kind of time out of a PS1 game, but not for a second generation system."},{"rating":"1","title":"HURRY UP AND WAIT!","review":"WOW - all I can say is \\"LOADING...LOADING...LOADING\\". This game was such a dissapointment. I loved all of the previous Crash games, but this one is ruined by unbelievable \\"loading\\" times. Stick with a previous version by Naughty Dog - and leave this one alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought Crash games were cool?","review":"Well, I have rented this game. Had my PS2 memory all set to go. Man! You people wouldn't believe how long it takes just to exit, or when you have a game over, or if you want to save. A mintue to load up every time. That is a shame. The graphics were awesome, but graphics I am afraid kids, doensn't make a great game. It is the gameplay that does. Too long of load times. Boys and Girls, this was to me, a very dissappointing game. I LOVED the other Crash games, but unfortunately, Crash loses all his fir on this game. Bottom Line: This game does BITE. B-I-T-E. (...) Try it before you buy it. This game is almost exactly like Crash Bandicoot 3: Wrath of Cortex. They could of added a multiplayer game to it to make it a unique Crash experience for the PlayStation 2."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"The new Crash game was well anticipated, but I can't believe the time wasted \\"Loading\\" between every function.

However, this latest installment created by \\"Traveller's Tales\\" rather than \\"Naughty Dog\\" left a LOT to be desired. Mainly the unacceptable amount of time spent staring at \\"LOADING\\" on your screen. In the first 15 minutes of play, I spent MORE THAN HALF of my time waiting for the game to load. INEXCUSEABLE! I don't know if this is their first game for the PS2 platform and they didn't know what they were doing or what, but I'll not blindly buy another title from them again without renting first. Get \\"Jak and Daxter\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely rent before you buy","review":"Games, like every form of entertainment, are subjective so I would never tell anyone not to at least try something out. I came really close this time. Lets start with the load time--this practically cripples the game and makes the whole experience annoying. The graphics, though not a big deal since really this game is for those into the CB series, did not impress me. Movement of the characters has an annoyingly N64 like feel to it. This was my second attempt at getting into the CB series and I think it will be my last. Those into the series, which I am not, may find something appealing about it although I'm not sure what."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOADING LOADING LOADING","review":"Can't stand that this game takes forever and a day to load. That is all I have to say. The game is a lot like previous games, but it takes FOREVER to LOAD! If you don't mind waiting for the loading then go for it. Otherwise I would go for a different game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crash Bandicoot isn't like it used to be.","review":"The loading times are way to long and it doesn't play like it used to. Where's Naughty Dog? The bosses are way to hard."},{"rating":"1","title":"very very disappointed Crash fan","review":"I have all the other Crash games and while they are sometimes frustrating and difficult, they have a certain charm that makes them very enjoyable. This game is completely lacking the charm. Crash jumps like his feet are leaden, the jumps are very imprecise and difficult to gauge, the levels are very slow paced and quite frankly, boring. The backgrounds are amazing and the ideas behind many of the levels are very good but the execution is awful. The bosses are incredibly difficult and just annoying, as well. I very much like the concept of the elementals but as I've said before, the execution and game playing are just too clunky and random. To be honest, I am so disappointed in this game that I nearly cried. My son, who is 3, is happy with it but he's frustrated because mommy and daddy can't seem to do the 'hard parts'."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product did not work well","review":"I really like this game but it did not work with my playstation. I would really consider looking for something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"A rare gem!","review":"I have only heard a few samples of this so far but I must say i love it already. The problem is, it is so hard to find. I think I have found a good source where i can get my hands on this cd pretty quickly and I am anxiously awaiting it. I love the smooth, and melotic, soulful grooves on this one.When I heard that she was associated with Erykah Badu (as her back up singer) I knew it had to be a rare one. I think a lot of people are going to sleep one this one, just don't let it be you, because I know it won't be me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Y'all gon' love this one!","review":"Love her voice. Love the instrumentation and arrangements. Love the lyrics. Love it, love it, love it!!! Please don't compare or have expectations of her CD sounding like Erykah's. This is a masterpiece that stands on its own. N'Dambi has got some pipes on her. I can't wait for her next CD to be released."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is the bomb!","review":"I just love this CD. N'Dambi came with it. I don't know why we don't hear any of this on the radio or the video. Soulful, spritual and though provoking. She will be heard from in the future I am sure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very soulful","review":"When I first got this album, I admit, it had to grow on me. I thought too many of the songs sounded the same and was not really feeling her style of singing. But, more listening encounters convinced me that this is some of the most soulful music that I have heard since Erykah Badu's album, Baduizm was released. Perhaps, this may be due to the fact that N'Dambi was one of Badu's backup singers. However, on this album, N'Dambi has a vibe of her own. The album has a jazzy/blues type feel to it, and at times, it is even poetic. N'Dambi has a strong, mature sounding voice which works well with the mellow production on here. This is a nice effort and I am curious as to why more people have not picked up on this. Don't sleep like the others, get this while you can because it is becoming hard to find."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my FAVORITE FEMALE ARTIST","review":"I love N'Dambi she's under estimated. They need to play more music like her's more often. This is the first cd I got of her's years ago when it first come out. She autografed it for me. I played it so much that its scratched so now I have it in my Cloud and will have it forever. I like your style Ms. N'Dambi."},{"rating":"2","title":"N'Dambi IS DA BOMB!","review":"This CD is off-da-hook! I had the opportunity to see her in concert in ATL this summer while touring with Grenique (Motown) and we witnessed one of the dopest live shows. N'Dambi has so much good energy and it is shared with us both through listening to Little Lost Girl Blues and seeing her live. I can't wait to see her again! If you like good/soulful music, this is NO DOUBT a CD you want in your possession! - 1luv"},{"rating":"2","title":"You will love it!","review":"I absolutely love this CD. In this crazy crazy world with life's everyday hectic pace - I am always searching for a soothing smooth sound to relax to after a rough day out in the jungle. N'Dambi is a smooth mix between Meshelle, Maxwell, Sade and Badu. Unfortunately, finding this CD is tough - but thanks to the internet it can come right to your front door. Buy it - You wont be sorry!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent vocals and the music is inspiring and uplifting","review":"This cd is fabulous! A wonderful debut from N'dambi. I look forward to hearing more from her in the future. I think that black stations are missing out on a lot of talent and opportunities to enlighten those that are not aware that there's alot of substance out here! I would recommend this to all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality and Customer Service","review":"I purchased this radio on July 2, by August 15 it was shutting off automatically after being on for a few minutes. I had to pay a webservice for troubleshooting and they determined it was shorting out. I return it directly to Sangean, since it was beyond the 30 day Amazon warranty. I sent it back to Sangean on August 23 and still have not received it back, it is currently September 13. Do not buy this radio."},{"rating":"2","title":"This game is awesome!!!","review":"I like this game because it is a good challenge. The enhancement system is very good, I like the buying system because you buy your moves and you obtain new weapons along the way. Plus once you beat a mode you unlock another mode. Dante must die mode is the hardest of all modes but when you beat it you get a big suprise at the end. There are no button codes for this game and thats what makes it very fun. Cheating will get you no where, it will make you bored. The story line on this game is perfect and will interest you. You will want to find out more of the story as you go along the way. The graphics of this game is awesome, it isn't boxy. Its graphic almost reach to perfection! To those who are thinking about getting this game, buy it. Its price is cheaper now and it is extremely fun. I must congratulate Capcom for making a game that is very fun and intertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"dante sparda rulez","review":"i love devil may cry its a whole lot better than devil may cry 2 i hope they make devil may cry 3 better than both but on this game i loved the bosses phantom was my favorite and weapons of course the sword sparda and i cant belive nelo angelo is dantes brother with the name virgil sparda the graphics was sweet weapons was bosses was and i loved the little movie from where dante gets alaster its awsome but i think its a whole lot better than the second"},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"I love this game, the plot is goth and really great, so are the graphics, I would definately recomendthis to anyone icluding YOU! now get out there and buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Devil May Cry, God May Smile!!!","review":"I have never played CastleVania, but if it is like this, I'm going to!!! This is a great action game. The graphic are outstanding, the soundtrack rocks, and the action is insane. Plus, the main character, Dante, is the best... action hero not unlike Solid Snake ( my all-time favorite video game character ). There is only one flaw... The camera is just like Resident Evil, but you won't care when you're hacking and slashing your life away with this killer title! Buy Metal Gear Solid 2 and Devil May Cry! You won't regret it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"super challenging","review":"this thing was sooooo hard i could not even beat the first boss ths i sold it.otherwise its pretty cool"},{"rating":"1","title":"Onimusha fighting with more bosses less little guys","review":"Ok, this game has great graphics and gameplay, but it still doesn't work for me. I mean, I think I'm on the 9th level now, spent a load of time getting there, I've fought the same boss *BOSS* three times, another one twice, and I've had the worst time beating them both. If you're into fighting the same thing over and over again, this is the game for you. I think I'm biased because I bought GTA3 at the same time, and have found myself playing that game more by a factor of 10, but it just doesn't hold my attention. Would rather play every other game on my shelf!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated?","review":"I'm going to get some bad feedback for this review, but here's my alternative opinion.This game is really boring. Looks lovely, moves like a tiger on vaseline and I do dig that Matrix style \\"hang in mid-air doing the John Woo\\" thing, but there's nothing much to do apart from batter the cr*p out the same dull enemies. There are a few combos but a game has to offer more than just fingertip yoga to keep me interested.In a word, vacant - big on style, but no substance, and certainly doesn't sit on the shelf with anything in the Resident Evil series, which actually have a plot and a few good shocks. Maybe if I had no attention span I'd like it better. Great game if you think Blade 2 is a better film than say, Near Dark."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing. But replay value drops it by 1","review":"This is one of the truly best games for the system. It is a lot of fun to slash and hack at monsters in a game and this one is just about the top of the heap when it comes to this. Also appreciated are the amazing visuals, excellent character control and decent storyline. Best of all for me was the fact that the game is not too frustrating. Easy mode is fun to play through and doesnt have too many of the wandering around wondering what to do next moments of Resident Evil. After you finish this mode you can go back and go through in hard mode with ramped up monsters etc. Overall it is a fast paced thrill ride, definitely worth your dollars or at least an extended rental. A word of caution, it is a very violent game so it is not for everyone. Still for those mature enough to not be scarred by a story about a half man/half demon this game will hit the spot. It is a single player adventure."},{"rating":"2","title":"all that and then a lot more","review":"This game is truly the game of games. You play as Dante, the son of a devil, who is on a quest to avenge his mother and brother (wait untill you find out what happened to his brother). The game is pure fun as you blast your way through devil spawn with a variety of rapid fire guns, a sword with the skill that surpasses any you've ever seen before, and as if the guns and the sword wasn't enough, you can always just go with the hands and literally beat your foes to the next dimension. I'm an avid gamer, and if you can name it, I've probably played it, but there isn't a game that I can think of that's more fun to play than this one. The only flaw is that it isn't very long. But after you beat it, more levels of difficulty open up, each with their own rewards making them worth the time and effort. If I could I'd give this game more than 5 stars, I would, but..."},{"rating":"2","title":"unbelieveable","review":"Ever since getting my ps2 at the launch i've tried to keep the good titles playing. Among then is devil may cry. this game is the funnest game i've ever played. Controls are great. Gameplay- holy cow it's great blast away with pistols, shotguns, grenade launchers. You also can turn into 2 different demons . that's pretty cool. sound is great . graphics are excellent hair movement is what got me. 100/100 ausome game buy you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Game","review":"Although short (3-5 hours to finish), this is a great game. Capcom designed both a good story (although get ready for a little weirdness at the end) and a great control system for this game. Take on the role of Dante, a half devil, half human, who is hell-bent on keeping the Devil off the Earth. One of the best features of the game is the ability to turn into a devil for a short time, allowing you to move faster, do more damage, and recover some health. The graphics are great to top it all off, the FMV sequences and gameplay blend together, which makes the game all the more enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Game...but easy","review":"I just finished playing devil may cry, and I have to say that it is a great game with stunning graphics. The only downside to the game is that it is extremely easy."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"One Of The Best Games Of 2001\\"","review":"THE GOOD THINGSTHE STORYWhether you like it or not the story isn't that original, or even compelling. You see I was spoiled by games with great plots or even characters I care about.DANTEI think Dante rocks, and I care more about his journey than Riddick's. Plus he has a big sword, Whats more better than slicing things with a big sword?The GameplayThis game is really easy to get into, and the controls are easy.

The game is just very very cool.Even the music is pretty good and adds to the feel and atmosphere of the game. I highly recommend this game. It is well worth the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Was About To Cry!","review":"I have the demo for \\"Devil May Cry\\" and it is an awesome game. I have never played a demo disc over and over again. That is until this one fell into my hands. There is so much attention to detail, you will be in amazement at beautifully the looks and plays.

Live it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stylish and Freaking Fun!","review":"Devil May Cry is a great game, but I have a few gripes. But first the good things: This game has great controls, a cool character, creepy enemies (those demonic puppets scare the heck out of me), awesome weapons, a wide arrange of attacks, when slashing up evil you can change into demon form, and this game has, which every game needs, a challenge. But now we must see the bad, which shouldn;t stop you from buying this game: The worst camera system I've ever seen in my life, horrible storyline, bosses that NEVER DIE!, and all the cool moves can't be bought (unless you cheat). Conclusion: If you like hacking, slashing, and shooting your way through hoardes of enemies, this game is for you. If not, you are one messed up dude."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game","review":"When I first went over to my friend's house after he got back from his vacation, he was preaching about this game. So I tried it. Let me say, it is awesome. The weapons are great. Ebony and Ivory, Dante's pistols, shoot insanely fast. The Shotgun is powerful but obviously slow loading. Those are the only weapons I know since I'm only on Mission 6(one of my gripes, the Missions instead of being able to roam free). The swords are pretty cool. Once I got my first new sword, I fell in love. But, the bosses are kinda easy. When I fought the giant spider both times, all I had to do was Devil Trigger and hit him a few times with my sword. But, I still recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same bosses used over and over","review":"The major problem with this game is that the enemies Daunte faces are all the same from level to level. You fight the same bosses two or three times in the game! That's not too much value or excitement for me. Since you spend your whole time in the same building, the enemies don't really change, so the new weapons and the \\"devil trigger\\" mode don't offer much in beating these same enemies you fought with the old weapons.Also, most of the game is fetching little rocks and keys to open doors, it gets boring after a while.I beat the game in about 10 hours. I have never beaten any game before, so that tells you how easy this game is.I'm not totally upset I bought it, but I think there are better games for the money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT GAME !!!!!!","review":"I first played the demo when my friend had Resident Evil: Code Veronica X for PS2.

Anyways, the camera angles [are not good], but not enough to keep me from giving a five star rating. The storyline is perfectly fitting for the atmosphere, and the graphics are beautiful. I didn't pay much attention to the music, which probably means it was really good and only outdone by the gameplay.

My first impression is this is what a game should be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad But True :(","review":"As sad as this is, this game's graphics are awesome.....but that's where it ends.

Just not a must-play game."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most overated game of all time","review":"5 stars for this game? Well you judge by yourself.

That's it, 23 missions inside the castle. HA! The game is very repetitive, just slashing and shooting the SAME enemies over and over again. The story, what story? I beat the game and I don't remember if there's any story in this game. The cutscene is only 10 SECONDS top. WARNING: AFTER PLAYING THIS GAME, YOU MAY CRY..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even worth a rent","review":"This game is unpleasant to look at, and awkward to play. The movement of the main character Dante is so clumsy. Every time the camera angle changes, you have to change the direction you are pushing on the controller. Also, the perspective on the character is changing so much, it is impossible to guage where you are, or what your surroundings contain. This game looks like PS1 graphics at best, but it is no fun at all. I knew it was no good within 5 minutes. Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Game Blows","review":"Dont buy this game. It is full of a horrible game play. There is no story. The graphics make me sick becuse they look like a Picasso drawing that has violenty mutated and are currently attacking their loving master.

The worst service I got EVER."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game, with the exception of a couple MAJOR drawbacks","review":"Devil May Cry is getting excellent reviews for a reason. However, it's important to note that there are a couple issues that might drive the easily frustrated game up the wall. One is the camera angles, which generally are only mildly annoying, but occasionally become extremely aggravating and frustrating. Another is the way save games work. You can save mid-mission, but when loading you are taken back to the beginning of the mission. I have no idea why they did it this way - perhaps to artificially inflate the difficulty. Both of these problems are inexcusible in my book. The camera angles in no way add to the game's atmosphere, gameplay, etc. The save game feature is nothing but frustrating. I still very much enjoy this game, but there are times when I get extremely frustrated with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Most Awesome X-perience for PS2","review":"This game is the newest edition of the Gotic Horror genreIf you love Onimusha you will be crazy with DEVIL MAY CRYThe game has high points in every game department*Incredible Graphics( you will feel the horror)*Amazing Sound( you will hear every scream and scary sounds of the souls)*The Gameplay is the best of all!! you can go anywhereJump,Double Jumps,roll,combos with your guns and swordBelieve me I have the Final Japanesse Version of the game and the Demo Disc that comes with Resident Evil CV is a candy comparing with the final game that is more difficultThe game is mission based!!!(23 in total) and the replay value is high because you can access new surprises when you finish the game(HARD MODES, SUPER DANTE and MORE)Buy this game NOW!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fast Paced, No Depth","review":"I found myself tapping the controller like crazy which was fun at first, but I didn't have to think at all to get through the game. For those of us who love to solve puzzles in a game, this game is more fun to tinker with than to actually try to master. I bought it when it was new for $..... then I had beaten it 3 times before the end of the night. It was a real let down at the time, but now I've found that it's a really great way to let off some steam at the end of a day. The graphics are smooth and pretty. The story and acting completely lack originality. The concept of using both a sword and guns was fun.

THis isn't a game for the weak, this is a game for those of talent and perception.The story is simple and the dialogue a bit cheesy, but the real deal is the action. Every boss fight, regular fight or puzzle being solved all equate to massive awesomeness ... you blast, slash, and jump your way through the many levels, sub levels, and collect orbs to upgrade your gear and give you specials.

The Bible also makes it clear that some of the narrative takes place in Egypt as well. It is mainly a tale involving people of color. But the people of color are brown, not black.I do not doubt the universality of the stories. Many similar tales come from Mesopotamian literature as well as the Greek myths.

Earpiece sound is poor, especially at higher volumes it really sounds like an AM radio from the 60's. (my Sanyo SCP-5150 sounded like a landline phone)2. The speakerphone is nice, however it is really just okay to be on hold or for dialing and not to have a conversation. I always hear \\"are you there?\\" and am told that the sound comes in broken words.3.

It's important to me that the author not give me theory rather something that I can really use. John's unique combination of western background coupled with years of experience on the \\"front lines\\" of doing business in China make him an unparalleled authority on how to truly be effective and profitable for anyone that is looking to do business in China. John has taken his personal experiences and to that added stories, both successful and unsuccessful, from other high-level executives to truly give the reader a realistic view of what works and what doesn't work in China and more importantly, why. I really liked the color charts and statistics throughout.

The aftermath of the Civil War is brought to life in the characters of the James brothers, Cole Younger, William Quantrell and various other noteworthy perpetrators of mayhem who closed out the era of continental expansion ...strife that marked the interval between Andrew Jackson and Theodore Roosevelt.The author, George Jansen, has written a work comparable in technique and effect to Gore Vidal's Burr, which also uses a fictional narrator to present history. Aside from its narrative thrust, The Jesse James Scrapbook makes admirable use of the argot of those distant days and is reminiscent of Mark Twain's Huckleberry Finn in that respect.I recommend The Jesse James Scrapbook to readers whose interests lie in a true perspective of the American West of the 19th century."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"The two stars are for the pool itself. It seems to be fairly sturdy for a blow-up pool and my 3-year-old grandchildren have gone in and out hundreds of times and it hasn't sprung a leak yet. But all the gizmos they advertise with it are expensive junk. The slide is so wobbly the younger kids can't really slide down it without falling off sideways. It takes too much time to put together all the gizmos and they don't work well after you go to all that trouble. We ended up just buying a used plastic toddler slide and putting the end of the slide into the pool and it was much safer and much more fun. The ring toss was pathetic and the basketball game wasn't much better. Just buy a good quality toddler pool without the bells and whistles and make your own fun with sturdier equipment."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAY smaller than pictured","review":"This pool is sooo much smaller than it looks in the picture. The slide is a little small for my almost-three-year-old (and she's not big for her age at all) and it is a joke when my 4 1/2-year-old tries to get on it. The slide is about the same length as his legs.Also, the slide is very tough for the kids to get on...it is really wobbly.We got this for $35 at Big Lots and I think it was worth about $10-$15."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware!","review":"I agree with the other review. The children on the box have been digitally shrunk to make the pool look about one and a half times as large as it really is, which is shameful on the part of the company making the pool. The slide is wiggley even when tied down securely. It is not worth the price being asked here. However, if you can find it on super discount, as I did, the pool is worth it for a few fun afternoons of splashing around. Face it, kids just like to get wet! My kids are 3, 6, and 7 and quickly got over the fact that it was way smaller than expected and made the best of it and actually had quite a bit of fun. They even made a game out of the unbalanced slide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy something sturdier","review":"This looks good in the package, but none of the gizmos work. The slide is wobbly so my grandchildren slide off sideways before they hit the water. The ring toss was cheap and useless and so was the basketball game. The pool is also much smaller than in looks. Buy a normal pool and add some other gizmos to the pool or yard. You will spend the same amount of money and have something that works and lasts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great kid's toy for a GREAT PRICE","review":"I bought this for my son's second birthday. He and his 2 toddler cousins played in it for hours, and had a blast. We set it up within 20 minutes, easy as could be. This was the best investment. (Shop around, prices vary).

But if you have a toddler (or two), BUY THIS TOYPARK!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!!","review":"Make sure you understand the dimensions before you open this pool. The front of the box is misleading, the children on the box playing in the pool were probably digitally altered to fit into the picture. My 3 kids are 5, 3 & 1. Normal, average size kids. They barely fit into this pool. The slide is wobbly and the attachments were broken before I opened the box.

This is the first submarine to seek an enemy ship in the world; atleast spell it right and give it the right name!!! This ship is named after it's biggest investor, Horace L. Hunley! The last time I checked Hunley didn't have a \\"t\\" in it and Horace didn't start with \\"R\\"!!! I wish that when people write books about the Civil War they would do their research because it is books like these that misinform people. Luckily, I'm not stupid enough to spell this important piece of naval history INCORRECTLY!!! So hats off to Bern Anderson for screwing up the minds of people who buy this book.

These books are later numbered than \\"Elizabeth In Love\\" and such, but they continue nothing of Sam/Liz which was started at the end of the sophomore year. But this particular book has the usual \\"SVUseless\\" bashing, along with Sam's stoner--LOSER friends making comments here and there. The almost non-existant plot follows Sam as he \\"finds\\" his destiny in the film industry...fighting with Liz, and trying to get a Jewel-lookalike to go out with him. Thrown into the plot is Lila Fowler's boredom-flirting with him, since apparently Bruce is still in Paris. These new books have so much designer clothing & famous personalities name-dropping they are almost unbearable. The ticker, though, was that the author Pascal writes the characters to one bar after another...but the drinking age is not 19 folks! I just thought this book was so unrealistic it was stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"SVU Books Have Sunk Pretty Low...","review":"I loved the SVH books, as well as most of the SVU books. But since the SVU characters have been in sophomore year, the plots have deteriorated and the new characters, with the exception of Neil, are awful & shallow. Sam's Secret Love Diary is the worst yet, not so much the writing as that the main character is a slacker/moron. Right away, it's guaranteed that the book is going to be terrible, even just for the reason that the narrator is a guy who's only interest in life seems to be getting another can of beer... Plus the plot is extremely weak, about Sam's new career as a filmmaker with Lila Fowler in his documentary. All this was inspired by a documentary about his favorite bar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait a minute...Sam's diary?","review":"Sam's character does not strike me as the type of person to write in a diary or 'thought book' as he calls it. I was very dissapointed in this book. The plot was way off with Sam wanting to get together with Lila. I really wish the author would go back to the plot they previously had before the secret diaries came into play. I'm dieing to know what happened. All in all, this book was OK, but deffinatly not a must read."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING!","review":"This book has got to be one of the most boringest books known to man! I mean seriously!

The book also offers suggestions on how to cope with the side effects of treatments and how to deal with such hard to ask questions as: how can I best communicate to my young children that I have breast cancer? Or, why do women in industrialisized nations like the U.S. have a much higher rate and risk of breast cancer than women in developing nations?

I re-read those sections that pertained to me; they were informative and technical, with supporting studies and statistics. Most importantly, there was always a positive, warm tone.

I was initially concerned that it might become excessively hot due to the cooling method, but in reality it only heats up to about the same temperature as a typical laptop power brick. So far it has operated an all-in-one PC for several 8-hour periods and performed flawlessly. I would definitely recommend this product!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and basic features that work","review":"My old inverter died and I needed a new one for a trip. Searched high and low for a reasonably priced sine wave unit that was well reviewed (thought I might move this to my truck after the trip and have it handy for tools). Too expensive for these plus I would have had to plug in to the battery directly to get the published power ratings. Turns out pretty much anything above 150w is more than your cigarette lighter can provide anyway so this unit taps most of what is available inside the car. My two complaints would be the single outlet and a lack of a USB connection for charging phones, iPods, etc. For the money, this works great. I also like the fact that the smaller size and ratings nuked the need for a fan and that makes it considerably quieter than its big brother, the only other inverter I was serious about. Excellent value and does the job nicely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tripp Lite PV375 PV 375W 12V DC to AC Portable Inverter with DC Auto Power Outlet","review":"I purchased this product about a year ago.

The advantage of this smaller unit is no fan - quiet. Some devices will require the power of the larger (noisy fan) model. Low cost inverters such as this produce electric power that is an approximate sine wave as opposed the perfect sine wave that come out of a wall outlet -- as far I know this isn't a problem for typical consumer electronic equipment, laptops etc -- but it's probably worth checking the user manual of the device to be powered just to make sure there are no precautions about using it with an inverter.

The puzzles that I purchased for my daughter 3 or 4 years ago were actually solid wood. I just went to the closet and looked at them and the backs of both the puzzles and the puzzle pieces are wood. I purchased this one and several others for my 1 year old son. Several layers of these puzzles are now mdf - fiberboard including the back layer of both the puzzle and the individual puzzle pieces. Only the core appears to be wood. If a baby puts this in his or her mouth, as most 1 year olds do, the fiber will swell or deteriorate.

It took me less than 15 minutes and the result was great. I didn't have to avoid plastic trim because it wouldn't leave white spots on them like Nufinish. I even used ICE polish on my plastic bumpers.Today I noticed that my faded rear plastic bumper is fading more and more.

And it works very well on trim pieces that usually turn white with other polishes or wax. It even cleans up the old residue that was left in the cracks and scratches from previous waxing. I suggest you give the car a good cleaning first to get the paint smooth. I used Turtle Wax polishing compound with a random orbiter and pad and did the whole car, then applied the Ice. The result was as smooth as, well...ice. I did this back in June and it still looks and feels the same. Wash your hands well after use as it is greasy and gets all over the place.

It says you can apply in the sun, but I had difficulty seeing where I had applied and the dried 'haze' in the garage. I applied in the evening and by morning it still had not dried completely. Maybe the 'wet' look is because it IS still wet. I had to put the car in the sun to be able to see all the streaks in order to remove them. It was impossible to see them inside.This product will NOT remove missed bugs, tar, blemishes, scratches or anything else that you may have missed. It looks great only if the car is already completely cleaned and waxed, then it will bring out a deep shine. So this is only good for a followup. Don't expect any more than that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I have used my share of waxes and polishes on my vehicles and this is by far the best I have seen. It goes on very easily and comes off the same. No white stuff in the seams or on the black trim! Wish I had started using Ice sooner!

If you follow the directions but use a little bit more than the label says you will get a good shine.

The system is very simple (if you can daydream, you can tell fortunes with coffee grounds) and anyone can do it. I and a bunch of coworkers at the office sit around at breaks and do eachother's fortunes- and I take it to coffee shops and am instantly popular! Everyone want's to try it! Why sit and gossip at Starbucks when you can tell fortunes?- Ive met some great people that way!

The performances are technically excellent but some truly lack soul. The album is for the most part consistent until we reach the Harry Partch material which seems out of place (this is when it takes a turn and makes the listener cringe), John Schneider sings on the Harry Partch tracks, the singing is very sub-par. He sings about being a hobo and riding a train but the voice sounds far too crisp and clean. But it's hard to complain because these are their first time on record and our only way to hear them. You need to close your eyes and Imagine a gruff, hairy, hobo singing them. Also, the piece written by John Scheider feels a little too melodic and peaceful for this record. This disk has some great material on it, but purchase with an informed mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Good Rough Draft\\"","review":"The best way to explain this book is, its a \\"good rough draft\\". Now go work on it some more. As is, the book is extremely hard to read. Crucial concepts are stated matter of factly, succinctly, and with little detail as possible, ie, just enough to get the point across (and that might be a stretch). The authors could make this a very good book, but they need to take much more time with every subject, and give more than one example. Furthermore the diagrams are sub-par. These diagrams could be greatly enhanced by professional technical artists. Also, the 2nd half of the book might be better interspersed with the 1st half. A *much* better read, with better diagrams, and a gentler approach on the exact same subject is \\"Distributed Operating Systems\\" by Andrew Tannenbaum."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are typos!!!","review":"We here use it as textbook.

You get battle chips, which are tradeable with friends, and you get $$Money for laying the smackdown on various Virii. Alot of old school bad guys are PETs.

I was more concerned with the failure of the ring. They need to make it much larger. I have continued to use the harness by making a knot of the nylon harness and it really does not do much and is a pain to out on. My dog is very hairy so it is a pain to put on a harness.

In Winter Fairy Home, there are challenging mini-games such as Hummingbird Fort. If you are a beginner, I won't suggest this game because sometimes it can be very challenging, like when you get into the Sparks World.

Absolutly, positively DON'T buy it.","review":"I own the first three Spyro games and when this one came out I coudn't wait to get it. However, I made a serios mistake. Spyro can't move very well, and you die the second you come near water, which I think is terrible seeing as this game is supposed to take place AFTER he learned to swim. This game has bad graphics, annoying speedways and Sparx levels, and can't show elevation. As a general rule, everything looks completly flat so when you go to make a glide, you find out the place you're gliding to is too high. Furthermore, enemies with missles and fireworks take about two seconds aiming at you then they just blow you up. In conclusion NEVER, EVER buy this game!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS GAME!!!","review":"As soon as I took this game out of the box I was frustrated. This game has no options and is impossible to beat. What fun is sitting around watching spyro kill a few enemies? Every other Game Boy Advance Game I own gets a five star rating but this one is crummy. If you think it is going to be like the playstation game guess again. This game is nothing like that and is more dissapointing than fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying!","review":"I have all the Spyro games for PS1 & PS2, and I LOVE them, so when I got my GBA I bought Season Of Ice right away....and was very annoyed. At first I thought it would be cool, because there are fairies and mermaids, but the controls are much more difficult on the GBA than the Playstations. I have trouble getting Spyro to go the direction I want him to, especially on diagonals. I think it's because you're using directional buttons instead of a joystick. I don't think it can be the fault of the button on my individual GBA, because I bought it brand new and this is one of the first games I've played on it. Anyway, I have trouble crossing bridges and just moving around in general; it makes it incredibly obnoxious, because every time you fall in water you die. I say, if you have a Game Cube and a Game Boy Player (so you can use a joystick) this could be a great game, but if you just have a GBA, don't bother, it's more frustrating than it's worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good game for a Gameboy","review":"This is just not the type that makes a good Gameboy game. I found myself getting very frustrated because Spyro was hard to control. He moves in a diagonal path which makes him hard to maneuver. Many times I ended up falling off a cliff just because of his strange movements. I think the makers should have made his path straight so that you can actually see where he's going. Also, I didn't think the graphics were all that great."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible!","review":"When my sister got this game and I played it, i soon found out that this is 100% the WORST Spyro ever. The graphics are reasonable, the ideas, characters and enemies are good, but the overall gameplay is out of the question. You die extremely easily and it's almost impossible to get every gem in a level. For example, if you miss one gem in a level you have to go all through it again, to every part just to find it. Plus, you can hardly see where you're going with the angle. The speedways are too easy and stupid, and you can easily misjudge the height of a platform you are going to jump to, then fall and die. Believe me, to buy this game is to buy a lame, frustration-inducing piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a shame","review":"I am one of the biggest Spyro fans on the planet but this game was really a disappointment!!The graphics were outstanding and the adventure was typical Spyro pleasing bliss. Unfortunately I don't think they ever should have put this game on GBA. The control is out of control and frustrating to say the least. The lack of visibility is a discrace when the scenery is such a huge part of all Spyro games. This should have been made into a Playstation 2 hit and become another all time Spyro great. I hope to never see another Spyro game on a miniature system again. I can't wait until the new Spyro game comes out in November for PS2. As I said it was a pitiful shame they didn't put this game on the PS2. GameBoys will never do justice to great games like these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good until...","review":"This game is great overall until...

Judging by the excellent graphics, I was mislead into believing that Vivendi Universal had actually spent some time on Spyro: Season of Ice, but I was wrong. After just a few days with the game I took it back to the store and bought Advance Wars instead.

I love the Spyro games on the Playstation, but this...this is just horrible. The graphics are very nice and pretty, but controlling Spyro is almost impossible. It may be just me, but Spyro seemed to be committing suicide throughout the game, as I kept accidently making him walk off the edge of a cliff. I'm very bored with it, and it's currently gathering dust in my \\"Rejected Games\\" pile. Hopefully, Crash for GBA will be much better, as the team behind Tony Hawk for GBA is working on it. Better luck next time, Spyro and friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good game","review":"This is a good game, I'll start with that. It's much better than Enter the Dragonfly and Hero's Tail. It isn't as good as the PlayStation 1 Spyro games, though. But still, this is a good game. It's challenging, lengthy, and in my opinion has a good story for Spyro. The only complaint I have is that it's sometimes hard to navigate through levels, I wish there was a map of some sort.

Well it does, but it costs $20 in shipping and processing fees to get a new one. I have heard of paying shipping, but 'warranty processing fees' ? Pretty ridiculous.I was also told by the Warranty Service representative that you shouldn't return the handle the charger base everyday, other wise it will kill the battery.

However, I think that part of that was intentional: it's from the p.o.v. of a kid who is only vaguely aware, himself, of the history and facts of his universe. And, while it would have been nice to be filled in on some of the mysteries by the end of the book, I think the story compensated by moving at a good pace, with strong dialogue and engaging scenes. DH does a good job of creating several distinct settings that Daric passes through. A lot of writing is so good at the technical details of a scene that it fails to conjure up the feeling of a place, but here you get a good sense of each place, whether planet, ship or castle."},{"rating":"1","title":"imaginative but pointless","review":"I gained some small sympathy for young Daric, but was constantly annoyed by unexplained terms (such as Ceres storm). It can be useful to leave some things unexplained, but when nothing is explained or grounded in any kind of reality, the whole thing devolves into fantasy (rather than science fiction). The difference is a sense that what happens MATTERS, because there are limits to what can be fixed. If young Daric's \\"love\\" interest is dead, no problem, she's a \\"soul\\" that can be brought back to life. If Daric himself slips and dies, no problem. No matter WHAT happens, no problem.

Ceres Storm presents a somewhat interesting universe but with too much left undescribed, unexplained. Some might say it's a brilliant story that makes you fill in the gaps with your imagination. I just think it's a cheap way out from actually writing a good story.Herter tries to present a story which takes place amid a sweeping history full of interstellar wars and fallen empires but how can you do that in 180 pages? It comes off flat and shallow.And there is no character development whatsoever. The plot and characters are merely a vehicle to take the reader from one spectacular stage set to another.

Oh well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Read","review":"In this first book of a space opera by David Herter, I was disappointed by the two-dimensionalism of the main character, Daric. One of the reviews mentioned how \\"Herter tells a huge and complex space opera in relatively few words, allowing the reader to fill in the blanks without sacrificing narrative integrity\\". Unfortunately, Herter uses so few words, I found I never identified with, or was engaged by the main character, Daric. The story is slow moving, and quite frankly, boring. I finished the book because I had paid hard cover price for it- had I read a chapter or two first, I wouldn't have ordered it. Other authors, such as EE \\"Doc\\" Smith, and Simon Green have done space operas very well- where you eagerly await the release of the next installment of the story. I found that with this story, the only thing I eagerly awaited was the end of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a great first novel!","review":"Think early Dan Simmons when you get this book..

There were too many instances of \\"name dropping\\" of persons who had either died or had been affected by this fire, and I had a difficult time feeling the drama that these people must have felt because of the lack of any type of background on any of the characters, especially the main characters.This true story left me feeling like I wanted more, but the author didn't deliver and it appeared that the numerous names that were used throughout the story, were simply utilized as \\"fluff\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's an overpriced sponge","review":"I was very excited about getting this product after seeing it demonstrated and raved about on television.

The voices are bad, the characters lips don't move and that really throws me off and the controls are horrible. The best thing about this game is the graphics on the box.

From there, the thrill ride picks up momentum when Jason gets Kurt a position at his company in Security.

Sometimes his dialogue and plot devices make one want to laugh out loud, though the author is dead serious and that is not the reaction he was seeking.The only thing that saves this book from zero stars is its rapid pace and serviceable prose.

I thought the corporate world of electronic sales made a nice backdrop for a thriller and initially I found the story fresh and entertaining.I later found the story to be too unrealistic with too many unlikable characters.Finder does an excellent job illustrating the villain Kurt Semko (Trace Adkins with a haircut?) and moving the story along at a nice clip, but the protagonist kept coming across like a wise-cracking schmuck which supressed the entertainment value for this reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was rooting for the bad guy","review":"I'm sorry, but I just couldn't finish this book. Got all the way through cd 7 and partly into 8 and was so pissed at the main character I had to quit listening. Through the entire book he proves to be a weak willed, lump of a person, making poor decisions. Here he is, supposed to be one of the top salesmen for a large company and he doesn't act anything like top salesmen I've known: Letting everyone run rough shod over him, insulting him and otherwise pushing him around, no stones and not even close to being the \\"meat eater\\" his bully-boy boss wanted."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another winner by one of my new favorite authors","review":"Joseph Finder seems to get better and better as he writes. Killer Instinct is another great book by a brilliant and entertaining author. Killer Instinct gives you a glimpse into the life of a cynical salesman in a worldwide electronics company. His ambition and success skyrocket as Kurt Semko enters, and Jason Steadman, like most of us would, gets sucked in.What follows is a whirlwind tale reminscient of the 1980s hit movie Wall Street. The corporate jargon and sales life are right on, and the book flys by.

Instead of working code samples and native projects to experiment with there are code snippets that are in text files, some of which have bugs that no C/C++ compiler would of let through. Also there is not a mapping in the chapter to tell you which text file goes with which chapter, and you spend a lot of time GREPing through the CD.

There are 16 fighers from the Street Fighter series to choose from (unfortunately, a few noteworthy Japanese version characters were once again left out), each with a slightly different style. The graphics is passable, considering this is on a handheld, marred by the poor display of the GBA itself. Controls are easy, but sound is terrible. The package description boasts \\"lightning fast animation\\"; somebody should sue them for this misleading, erroneous statement. Another thing: many of the moves for the characters are in Japanese in the manual, so not too helpful for those who don't know the language.In the end, this is a good rental title that satisfies your nostalgia about the arcade Street Fighter games.

I had previously heard \\"I Should Have Known\\" on New York FM stations, and loved the inventive sound- no drums! A great melody with great counterpoint from the violin and guitarist. At the concert, Martin was joking with the crowd- it was a 9 PM concert, and many of the kids there didn't really know what the band was about. And of course, there was a wild psychedelic violin solo with lots of echo. It was an excellent concert. I continued being a fan, buying the albums as they were released, and even seeing a pre-MTV video from Tracks which aired on network television one weekend afternoon.This group created great sensitive music on a consistent basis. And now we have the 30 year anniversary album, which I waited so long to hear. How lucky we still had the principal players around to play once again.

All throughout the book author does this. For example, client side cursors can only be static type and in chap 3 the author codes .CusorLocation=adUseClient, .CusorType=adOpenKeyset (p.143). Geez. Other samples have adOpenDynamic. You can set the cursor type property to these enums but if you check the property via debug.print or in the locals window you will see the property = static. Something that simple makes me a bit unsure what is wrong with the more complex material in the latter part of the book. Other things that bothered me were the code on CD needed to be hacked to run. They should run right out of the box. Too much emphasis on the data controls. And what was all that about VCR drivers and video picons? what a waste of time and space. If I was married to this book I'd get a divorce!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything just went over my head","review":"I had high hopes for this book from its title.

My joy evaporated faster than you can spell VB.The book reads like a discussion between the writers and his/her knowledgeable peers with no room for us wannabee developers. I have reasonable proramming background including VB, but this book was all greek to me. Scattered code snippets here and there with no \\"real\\" explanations, buzz words like MTS,CORBA, NED ED or whatever without their functions or scope in reference of this book are just tip of this iceberg of problems.I will keep this book.

Suffice it to say, the CD is an accomplishment. There are few Cd's in my collection reserved for the permanent slot in my player, this is one of them. The quartet, which to my knowledge have only been together for a little over a year, sound like a seasoned family of musicians. Percussion provides a backbone for excellent base lines and steady vocals. The wild card and an excellent one at that, are the keyboards, blending 70's southern rock riffs with a deeper blues feel. The play list is extensive and diverse, and each genre is treated respectfully and performed as such. The only flaw I can find with the CD is that it is an Ep and short on tracks.

What could his take on Egypt mean to the explorer of the mystical side? Lots!To begin, this book is filled with information about most of the gods I could think of and more. Many are all but obscured and forgotten. The very myths behind these wonderful illustations are profound. This complements, but is not required to study and use his great Ancient Egyptian Tarot. I cannot understand why the book is no longer in print. Not all books have to be a best seller. I suppose the publisher had some issues here.As for myself, there are no critical marks regarding this historically accurate and beautifully illustrated text.

THIS IS NOT AT ALL CLEAR IN THE ONLINE PRODUCT DESCRIPTION --- I thought I was buying a stereo-out device. When I received the package, the mono circuitry was clearly diagrammed on the back, along with text that was relatively unambiguous if not explicit. I confirmed all of this by cracking open the case and looking inside (while mumbling several explatives). SO THIS IS NOT A STEREO-OUT mixer.

Fisher combines principles with examples and how-to tips that you can apply in your own organization. He provides good summaries of each chapter's highlights.

I usually accompany them with macaroni and cheese and whatever vegetable I'm in the mood for. However, they are also good in sandwiches or with mashed potatoes or rice. If you are not a vegetarian, you will probably find the flavor closest to Salisbury steak, though the texture is very different. That said, I recommend that those who are not familiar with vegetarian soy-products think of them as something totally other, rather than the meat product they are meant to replace, and enjoy them for their own merits.

Despite this, it did make fairly good espresso, but you have to have tiny espresso cups for it to catch because a regular coffee cup is too big to fit under so I had to use a bowl to catch the espresso.

I've change 3 fresh ground coffee brands including Starbucks but that didn't help. A notice on this issue is that I usually make a cup of espresso coffee while the filter was made for 2 cups. So, there is space in the filter and may reduce stream pressure through ground coffee. Anyhow, it's able to create a good body coffee. (I recommend to use very fine ground coffee and according to my trial, some fresh ground coffee in a grocery store works better than Starbucks.)Before using this machine, I had experiences on 3 or 4 home-espresso machine before (in Thailand).

Speaking of which, I've read reviews where people suggest to heat the espresso in a microwave and heat up the milk first in the microwave. No thanks, this machine should not need that kind of effort. As far as clean up goes, I think it's a mess. This is way too much work for me, AND I have to give up counter space for this thing. I'm going back to my little stove top gadgets.

The machine was plugged in and it was lucky it didn't start a fire. I will never by a Hamilton Beach product again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lousy, Don't Buy","review":"At least 50% of the time the machine leaks water all over the counter. It has a bladder control problem. Often it won't produce enough steam to froth a cup worth of milk. Sometimes the espresso drip is so slow that it's agonizing. We are getting rid of this clunker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make sure to send in your warranty","review":"My machine stopped much stopped working after 6 months. The espresso will not come out when the light says it's ready. Every once in awhile before it stopped working it would decide to make a serving but would'nt make another afterwards. I called to use my warranty and they wanted $20 for shipping. I only paid $60 for the machine. So I didn't think it was worth the trouble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rarely Functional","review":"The machine worked well for a couple of week until it developed problems passing water through the pod, so we called the manufacturer for assistance. The manufacturer asked us to destroy the machine so they could send us a new one. The new machine didn't work at all. By this time I couldn't return the machine to Amazon for a refund and the manufacturer refused to refund my money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lasted 1.5 years","review":"Overall this was a good machine, but the lifespan was way too short. We got it for Christmas in 2006, and it died May 2008. We had to keep cleaning it out with vinegar or it would get clogged and not produce steam. Finally it stopped being able to produce espresso as well and there was nothing we could do to clean it or get it working again. I recommend you keep shopping."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Quality for the Price","review":"After reading the alternately glowing and scathing reviews of this espresso-maker, I bought it with mediocre expectations, but I was surprised. The machine has produced nice, dark, hot espresso (with crema) everytime, and, using a thermometer, I can froth milk better than I could have dreamed.In response to other reviewers' complaints of leaks, my machine leaked once (inside the port that holds the water resevoir), but the leak was my fault. As the video clearly states, you can't refill the water resevoir while the machine is heating, but I did so before viewing the video. While following the directions, I have not had any leaks.While I do need to froth my milk 2 - 3 times to reach the correct temperature (160 F), I'm frothing a fairly large portion of milk (8 - 12 oz), and waiting a few seconds for the machine to heat up is better than spending $5 or more per day at Starbucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Waste Your Money","review":"Makes terrible expresso and if you want to wait to let it preheat 5 times you will get a few tablespoons of milk froth. Ridiculous excuse for a cappuccino machine regardless of price."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a big risk to buy this machine","review":"I will have to say I absolutely loved this machine when I first purchased it; I even purchased one for other family members.

Now I have to deal with the manufacturer, the warranty (1yr), and no machine..."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't get it, it is only good for the price, not the quality for just a water down coffee","review":"returned the machine because:-during milk frothing process the milk comes out from the plastic tube and splashes everywhere.-the milk frothing stick is too short, you have to fill your cup soo much to get the stick half way in your milk, and once it start creating a lil foam your cup is full already.-bubbly water down less than 10 second milk froth foams.-espresso is soo light and water down, couldn't change the setting on how strong you want it.-again the space btw the rod and bottom is too short, you would really need a small cup that is no taller than your cell phone to fit it in and not get stuck.$80 dollar for just making coffee, you can settle for better espresso and cheaper. takes less space machine.this machine is only attractive because of the fucntion and price, but its really not that great trust me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"At least it makes coffee","review":"It is the most affordable 15 bar pressure espresso maker around. It does froth, not the first time and usually on the second run or third. It should have a bigger trip tray for as much as it drips after making a cup. Overall, it's good for a beginner - maybe at some point I might decide to upgrade and buy a real espresso/cappuccino maker..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What You Want","review":"it said that as you use it it the coffee will get hotter so don't be concerned.The first use was great. Heated up real fast & the coffee was piping hot.from there it wen't down hill very fast, by the 10th time the coffee was luke warm, even though the proper lights were either on or off.I returned the item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage...Better Ones Out There","review":"Used this machine 5 times over a 1 year period and cleaned regularly according to instructions. Pump failed after fifth use. Contacted Hamilton Beach and they stated since I was un-able to locate my receipt, they would be willing to send me a new unit at a reduced rate. Something about spending more money for an espresso maker, that is of poor quality in the first place, just does not seem to be a wise consumer choice.Avoid this espresso maker at all costs. With todays economy, spending a little more for a way better quality machine, is worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep looking for a better product","review":"The machine gets the job done... sort of. Mine worked great for about the first 10 uses, and then I started experiencing problems. The espresso drips continuously which doesn't produce very good shots, it gets clogged and because it drips non-stop, when you go to dispose of the coffee grounds it's quite unpleasant because of liquid lingering in the grounds. It also seems to splash causing a huge mess on my counter but I haven't been able to figure out where the splashing is coming from. It's a very messy machine, but like I said, it sort of gets the job done. My advice is to keep looking for a machine that will make the experience a little more enjoyable - even if you have to spend more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst capuccino maker ever","review":"Water stopped dripping through the espresso side of the maker. My husband was able to unscrew the trap and clean it out once but a little while later it did the same thing. This time he was unable to see what was stopping it up. Just a small amount of espresso stops up the trap and water won't come out at all. It is poorly engineered."},{"rating":"2","title":"expresso maker","review":"great for price!! only problem is water leaks out if left in the machine. have to empty water holder after making expresso."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"The first machine was defective. It leaked very badly around the filter unit. The second machine appeared to work correctly. However, I was very disappointed by the quality of espresso brewed by this unit. It was weak and barely hot.The unit itself takes a while to heat and does not stay hot enough long enough to brew a double shot. The same goes for the steaming function. I could barely get my 8 oz pitcher under the nozzle. While steaming the milk, I had to stop every 10 seconds to let the unit reheat. When I released steam through the nozzle to clear it, it spit water instead of steam.Thankfully, the retailer let us return it for a full refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hamilton Beach 40729 Espresso/Cappuccino Maker with Pod Holde","review":"I have a Hamilton Beach model 40175 in Florida that makes an excellent cup and wanted to buy one for when I'm up North. That model is not available so I bought model 40729 figuring it's the new updated version.How wrong! When I unpacked it I noticed the \\"cheaper\\" finish and manufacturing. This thing makes the equivalent of dirty lukewarm dish water. I use the same grounds - \\"Segafredo\\" as on the other machine but the result doesn't even come near. Don't know if it's just a matter of QC but I'm sending it back and going back to the old steamer I have up here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed in 6 months!!","review":"This machine worked okay for 6 months. Then the pump broke down. I went back to my old Mr. Coffee espresso maker. It actually froths better than the Hamilton. I bought the Hamilton because I could make two espressos at the same time. And I could make several batches without refilling the water reservoir."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Espresso maker","review":"I purchased this item two weeks ago and am quite happy with it's performance. It heats up quickly, and makes a nice cup of espresso.A few points to consider before buying.1- The drip clearance is barely 3\\". You will need a cafe style espresso/cappucino cup.2- The drip is somewhat wide. A tiny espresso cup will likely result in spillage. We just pour into a larger cup to enjoy.3- The steamer takes a minute to steam cold milk- try microwaving before frothing- you'll save a lot of time.All in all, I love this espresso maker, and would heartily recommend it to any budget conscious consumer looking for a small espresso maker.Update- At two brews a day, this brewer gave out 18 months into it's life cycle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book and an amazing author!","review":"All of Ken Gire's books are amazing, he has such incite with God's Word!!

This book is probably suited for someone brand new to yoga."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book about Yoga (not asana but the other limbs)","review":"A quiet thoughtful book about \\"the rest of yoga\\" ... the non physical side that is all to often forgotten. There is alot of meat to the book and it's presented in a non-pretentius way. I have read her book a few times and either pick up something new or allow myself to see something new with each chapter. It's not about the physical (asana) branch of yoga but about working to become a better person. I respectfully disagree with the reviewer that felt the book was more suited to people with children ... read it again without judgement and you may have a very different take. A must own in any yoga library and highly recommended for anyone alive, breathing and thinking!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Living your yoga","review":"I was disappointed that the book was more of her personal experiences with her family that were too many."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!","review":"This is a very good opening book. If you enjoy playing English, this book is a must. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"interesting but unuseful","review":"I was very interested with this book because Grandmaster Kosten is a good chess writer and he is a regular user of the English opening, but the book is disappointing. Fisrt of all take note that this is not a reference book nor a book for beginners. Kosten writes 16 chapters dealing with the endless variations of the English, so with 144 pages at his disposal he has to be brief and - alas - superficial. You'll learn nothing studying this book unless you are such a good player - 2300 rated or higher - to understand the ideas Kosten illustrates. Indeed Kosten explains his own way of playing the opening and this is an interesting topic, but absolutely unuseful to the average player."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Good Book by Tony Kosten","review":"I have been playing the English regularly for several years, but never played the 2. g3 lines until I read this book. Now I play 2. g3 regularly and thereby avoid many of the heavily analysed variations. As far as I can see, this is the way I should have been playing the English all along. If you want to know everything about the English, this book isn't for you; but if you want a good, aggressive, relatively simple way to play this opening, this book will point you in the right direction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Guide to the English","review":"Anyone starting on the English Opening, or even considering it, should get this book immediately! Rather than simply list dry lines and variations, Kosten goes into detail about the broad, long-term goals of both Black and White in the major systems of the Carls\` Bremen System that he seems to prefer. He rarely deviates from 1.c4 2.g3 3.Bg2, but as this is a very good set of starting moves for White most of the time (which he has played at Grandmaster level himself for years), there isn\`t really much trouble. He talks about certain desirable formations and plans that are not dependant on memorising move orders or dependant on your opponent playing exactly the moves you have memorised. The book is fast-paced, as it is short, and doesn\`t dally around much. Without a doubt, this is the best book I have ever seen on a chess opening!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dynamic English","review":"Excellent book for anyone rated U2000 and below. Stress is on understanding the resulting middlegame positions that occur after 2.g3 instead of rote learning of lines. There are also some gems that help you understand key issues concerning the f4/f5 squares and d4/d5 squares, knowing when to make exchanges on these squares is fundamental in understanding how to play the English. The investment made in studying this book will reap big rating points."},{"rating":"2","title":"The English is fun!","review":"I play the lines in this book in blitz and correspondence - no OTB tests yet, but they will be coming up next year - and the results are quite encouraging. The only rub I've discovered are in a few of the Symmetrical English lines... he just missed some move orders and gave one line that can only be played OTB, not in correspondence.

As a lifelong New Yorker, I barely recognize the city Burns' describes (even the periods I've lived through).New York is a fast-paced, chaotic and funny place, but none of these qualities comes through in this pious, windy textbook of a film. The wit his brother Ken was able to capture in Baseball and Jazz is nowhere to be found. If locals and visitors were asked to pick New York's most prominent feature, one word you'd hear again and again is \\"energy\\". Paradoxically, Burns' attempt to portray the city has barely any.Watch this, if you must, for a bit of historical background, but there are any number of books, fiction and non-fiction, that will give you a better sense of New York."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great documentary","review":"Taught me things about New York and the rest of the country I never knew.

Spellbinding from first episode to the last...I found myself not wanting it to end. The series presents a broad tapestry of New York's history with an emphasis on the indomitable and resilient human spirit above all else. Ric Burns succeeds with a definitive masterpiece and tribute to New York in a unique style that captures one's imagination while tugging at the heart. If history had been taught with this medium when I was in school, it would have made the difference between passing marginally or with excellence. This DVD set is a treasure and one which I will revisit again and again.

It's not really loose, and I'm not worried that it will fall out or anything, but since part of the purpose of this filter is weather sealing I'm wondering about its integrity and I've removed a star from my initial review.

He could easily have switched the titles for several of the tracks and nobody would have noticed.

You will find songs by guest stars that just don't cut the mustard like \\"Money Makes the World Go 'Round\\" (featuring Daz with a less than memorable performance) and \\"Game Over\\". On the latter song, with guest stars Ice Cube and Too Short, I thought I would get a bangin' song, but Short only talks in the beginning and Cube drops a weak hook. Don't get this weak album.

Women, with a few notable exceptions, either commit suicide or are sacrificed for the greater good of family or nation.In an ancient world where women had little or no control over their destinies, Loraux highlights how Greek tragedy twists the ordinary gender roles and expectations of those times.In her readings of these classical texts, with their powerful women who change their own fates (especially when depicted by the iconoclastic Euripides!), Loraux brings interesting insights to the Athenian cultural attitudes to methods of dying for women (and men), as well as attitudes towards gender and sexuality.This is a scholarly text, which requires concentration and some knowledge of the Greek Classical plays to enhance your reading. But it's also an excellent addition to anyone's reference library."},{"rating":"1","title":"radiator cap","review":"It wasn't what I expected and I wasn't pleased with the quality and the overall appearance of the cap.

The authors are significantly opposed to reality tv as they draw comparisons between the genre and military torture tactics and social psychology experiments from the 1960's and 1970's (in particular, a whole chapter dedicated to the Stanford County Prison Experiment). The book primarily looks at the big two: Survivor and Big Brother. The book mentions an upcoming reality show where contestants can compete to be candidates in the 2004 election. I found this hard to believe, but sure enough, such a show is in the works! (www.americancandidate.com). How far will reality tv go?

The character of Chloe is so obnoxious that I had to force myself to finish it. It starts off with Chloe being obsessed with the college QB, Tom Watts.

Anyway, there's one of those mixer things, where you fill out a form and you get matched up with your perfect date to the dance. So (how original) Chloe fills out all the answers she thinks Tom will put. And she gets Tom. Tom kind of likes Chloe, so he sneaks around with her behind his girlfriend (Georgina)'s back. Tom is portrayed as being just stupid, and a jerk, which does not add up to the character earlier on in the series. Maybe if they had used another jock, instead of Tom, it would have been better, because then the personality wouldn't have done an unnatural 180. Anyway, this book was REALLY bad.

Also what's with the model on the cover? She looks awful. Her makeup is glooped on so thick her eyes look stoned and her face is 3 different colours!

If this happened to someone today, the chances of them living would be better, but still a very good chance they would die.

What a guy. The author gives all the details, and explains away all the myths. It is all here. I guess it really boils down to one thing. If this detailed story, and point by point examination of who Gage was, and who he became is of interest, then this is your cup of tea. You will either love the book or loath it. You decide....

We meet people who interest us, thrust into a situation of conflict and intrigue, and we listen to the ideas of individuals placed in the same room in order to hammer out a philosophical creed for living through a range of disparate convictions. We hardly realize we're getting a lesson in the various tenets of a range of philosophies ourselves.

Lindsay's trademark scratchy detuned guitar perfectly counterpoints Scherer's synth wizardry.

If you dont' talk to all characters you are totally missing out. 3d environment, great controls. Only annoying thing is that the one liners repeat too often on the one liner button. They removed this feature on \\"regeneration\\" I think it was in good taste.Typical macho Campbell at his best. I loved this game. You get a whole lotta' game for your price. Don't miss it.

It combines the violence, gore and dry humour which you find in the films. Not to mention that Bruce Campbell does the voice of Ash (this will please some of you and some of you wont care less depending on what you think of Campbell). Personally I think this game is good, baby. You get to walk through the streets hacking up and shooting zombies with your chainsaw and trusty boomstick. What else could you possibly want? Well the graphics are pretty good too with no real glitches in the game. The use of the camera is also good as it allows you to fire your \\"boomstick\\" from over your shoulder in real Ash style. Although the game is a little linear (you are limited in where you can go) you still have no time limit and the run of pretty much anywhere. My advice, if you like Evil Dead, you'll like the game.

I read the Nancy Drew series as a teen. I am 65 now and am re-reading them, fully appreciating how good these are. They take you back to a much more wholesome time. Highly recommend for all ages. The old originals are best, always at least 200 pages. The ones that were revised later are always 20 pages short, with full page illustrations taking up more space. Supposedly, the revisions occurred to enable political correctness of the earliest published ones. Something is always lost when an author's work is tampered with. These were written at a different time, a product of those times. I never found anything offensive in a Nancy Drew book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Let freedom ring?","review":"The book discusses the Palestitian problem from a Palestinian point of view. Even discounting some of it as too anti-Israeli, there's no doubt that the Zionist movement and later Israel dispossessed the Palestinians of their land.

And a bad one. A bad copy.The soul and intensity of the original is gone. The unpredictability and pacing of the original is gone. Its just a slow weak anticlimatic arrangement of notes similar to Deloused. Which makes me wonder... Why? These are someone else's songs played in a different style, without any hint of soul and feeling. Robots could play this.Creative? No. No WAY!!! A big waste of time I feel.Classical music fans might enjoy it. I probably would if you didnt tell me it was a volta cover album. Its got an attractive sound in general.

It crashes on my PPC PowerBook G3. The second CD (Field Trip Adventure) is Classic only. It won't run on my Intel system, but is OK on my PPC.My reaction to this (without running the programs) is that they are just throwing a bunch of stuff together. Here's a CD we made back in the OS 9 days, here's one we've made recently. Webkinz is really popular so we're tossing in virtual pets as well.

His father did not want personal vignettes put into the book and yet Mr. Bernstein had lots of private comments about his parents that I felt were an invasion of their privacy. He also spent a lot of time on his own life at that time which really was secondary to the tumultous events his parents had been involved in. There should have been more input into the causes and events during those McCarthy years and what he did put in was episodic and not put together clearly.

It is much more autobiographical than anything. I can't say it is uninteresting but my interest is what lies behind his personal history.In this regard the book is chock full of insight and observations that you won't find in more 'historical' articles.

The first few chapters consist of some reasonable, common sense information around conversational skills. Not exactly ground-breaking, but it reinforces information that most of us already know but don't always practice. The rest of the book addresses an assortment of communication skills, which I see as very distinct from conversational skills, like handling criticism and avoiding being manipulated. About two-thirds of the book dealt with such topics, all of which were very cursory and trite treatments of complex human interactions. I had hoped the book would be focused, as advertised, on skills specific to engaging in conversations, to helping me to connect with a wider variety of people, and engaging in more satisfying conversations."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Info!","review":"Althought most of the information seems common sense, if you actively try applying each one of the tenets in the book it works great.

The book is solidly pragmatic and easy to follow. It was fun to ready and very helpful.This book will be welcomed by all introverts and those seeking to meet others.

However, it's not a panacea- to improve your conversational skill you'll have to practice.Each section describes a single \\"issue\\", such as the basics of effective listening, or how to follow up on information you learn during a conversation. None of it will make you gasp and realize that's the hidden key, but it serves as a useful discussion of why each issue is important. Integrated into the discussion are instructions on how to use it in your day-to-day life.Since none of the ideas are much more than fairly well-known components of interpersonal conversation, most of your learning from this book won't come from reading. However, if you follow the author's suggestions and read one section, then practice it for a day, it really is useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"When is the movie coming out?","review":"What can I say besides I didn't think one person could include so many characters in one book and keep it flowing.

Because my husband still was not convinced, this was TTC1 so i don't blame him, i went a bought a Digital First response test and it said 'YES' but it also cost me $20.

Then if you're pregnant you'll see another one appear within 3 minutes I think. Mine appeared almost immediately though, both times. Recently I bought another pack to have on hand. I took one when I had a scare and it was negetive...so basically, 6 out of 6 have been accurate for me. I trust these strips, and love the price.

Needless to say I had to go buy a new pregnancy test to confirm. I went digital so that I wouldn't have to interpret any ambiguous lines. Indeed, I was pregnant.

For how cheap they are, they're fine, but I'd go with wondfo which are very clear and rarely show evaporation lines (also about this cheap).

There is some distortion in the lens but since I am creating panoramas from the pictures, it doesn't really matter. It is only noticeable when there is a horizontal or vertical line near the edge of the picture.

The trial has been reworked in other media to such a fashion that the reality of the actual events are fairly anti-climatic.

In order for it to work, the camera has to be left on. When I had attempted to take stop action pictures of the lunar eclipse the battery was dead before the eclipse was full. If I had this adapter at the time, this would not had been a problem.Using this adapter I have taken over 100 continuous flash exposures. I have taken stop action exposures continuously for over 12 hours with 6 minute gaps.I would have liked Canon to have provided another way of powering the camera with ac, but they didn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sexy and Fun","review":"Diana is truly one of the sexiest women on the planet. An embodiment of true goddess energy, she oozes sensuallity. I was able to meet her several years ago and she shared many of the tales written in this book. She invites everyone to have fun and explore new ways to look at our sacred sensuality in a very unabashed way. We can all learn something from this woman. Her book is a fairly easy read (I finished it in under 3 hrs.) with some interesting recipes such as her Chocolate Cordial (I just finished making it, it's delicious...)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Series","review":"This is a great series by a truly gifted author. She has every element you look for in a good book.

I couldn't have been more let down. It is obvious that the makers of this DVD had no interest in their subject other than to make money off of him. The most annoying and consistent element in this selection of videos is how they formatted the videos to fit the TV screen: In the same way that widescreen converted to full screen cuts off the sides of the film, these films were carelessly squeezed into a format that frequently cut off the top (People's HEADS) or bottom of the screen. Whole segments are run where you don't see above a person's mouth. It is infuriating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very bad movie","review":"This is one of the worst movie I ever watched. Bad acting and bad art direction. Avoid it at all cost. Does Amazon even offer a zero star rating option?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Looking for the basics in CR, this is your book!!!","review":"This is a great intro to the skills of a mediator, or just a human being in this day and age. Daniel Dana is a leading teacher in this area. Anyone who is looking to attain this skill will be greatly served by reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"This is one of the worst books I've been forced to read in a long time. I had to read this for a graduate-level course on Conflict Resolution and thought it was a waste of time. Nobody in my class agreed with most of his statements about conflict(there must be anger, it's all about costs, etc), and his writing style was irritating. It sounded like it was put together at the last minute. His fictional characters could have been left out as well as ending every other paragraph in chapter two with \\"Got your attention now, Roy?\\" Honestly, I learned nothing, and reading this book was an absolute waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Repeat, repeat, and another repeat.","review":"This book does have a few good examples in it, but the author uses those exact same ones again and again just using a few different words throughout the ENTIRE book. I had to read this and use it for my business ethics course, and I wanted to pull my hair out after a while of reading chapter after chapter of the same things."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is lame","review":"I expected more from this book and from this author considering his knowledge and professional background. His examples are lame at best and his writing style is boring. The people he needs to thank are the people who designed the cover and the people writing reviews on amazon because this book is a joke. I've never felt compelled to write a review but this book is 8 chapters of common sense. What I got out of this book is that if you have a conflict you need to sit everyone down and talk. REALLY .... I'm sure there are better \\"Conflict Resolution\\" books out there. I'm going to keep looking and never read a book by this author again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only l6 Reviews?","review":"I should think hundreds of people would have written in praise of this novel. I am 65 years old and was in wonder how an author could so accurately portray both youth and old age.I give it 5 stars because of the joy it brought to me. Am buying paperbacks to give to friends. Sometimes it seemed a bit choppy to me - but this is just my opinion - it still is a wonderful novel and I hope the author thinks about a sequel."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Incredibly disappointing -did I miss something?\\"","review":"I simply do not understand all of the honors this book has received. I found the novel to be achingly dry, superficial, uninteresting, and claustrophobic. I had to force myself to keep reading: I continued to hope that things would pick up, that I would learn some great truth. Nothing ever happened. I cannot even express how short changed I felt when I finally finished this lump of nothingness. I do not recall, in the past 20 years, ever feeling that a book I have read was actually a great waste of time, feeling the sorrow and regret that I will never have those hours back again... this book has captured that honor from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much Ado About Nothing - A Meandering Mess","review":"This book seemed promising at first but quickly self-destructed. The characters are flat, unlikeable and uninteresting if not downright annoying. There is more name dropping in this book than at a pseudo-intellectual convention. The dialogue is stilted and the situations often contrived and ridiculous. I felt like I was reading a final exam in an introduction to creative writing class. Amateurish and directionless. The author obviously wishes us to be impressed with his literary and philosophical references. I found it pretentious, condescending, self-serving, intrusive and distracting. I gave it two stars instead of one because the ideas were interesting though poorly developed, the book held me for the first quarter or so and there were a few precious beautiful turns of phrase."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great talent, a very good book.","review":"Mr. Morton is a great talent, with the potential to write outstanding novels. He writes brilliantly- wonderful prose, with amusing observations. The only weakness of the book is that the plot comes apart in the last fifty pages. The focus of the book until then is the young critic, Heather. At the end, she disappears and the plot switches to focus on Ariel, the novelist's daughter. Heather's story just hangs there without a satisfactory conclusion. Her ambition just dries up in an inconclusive manner. Mr. Morton could have done much more with Heather and her displacement at the end is disappointing. But, Mr. Morton has written a very good novel. And he shows tremendous ability. I look forward to his next novels eagerly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip it","review":"A badly-written book about people that are bad at writing books. The writer's tone is condescending and self-important. Your money would be better spent elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent overview of the EV history","review":"It is an excellent overview of the history of Electric Vehicles (EV) I recommend anyone interested in the subject. The book suggests an idea how EVs could have become a standard transport and why they hadn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthy non-formal release of Damned Material","review":"Like most of us Damned fans know: there non-formal releases are sometimes better than the formal ones. This is probably a better introduction to their material than the two-disc Light At The End of The Tunnel. Good renditions of Feel The Pain(with a great final jolt not on the album version), I Just Can't Be Happy Today(with different lyrics and an extra verse), I'm So Bored, Thanks For The Night, Curtain Call, Is it a Dream, Stab Your Back, Fan Club, I Fall, Smash It Up(With Part 3) and a good cover of The Stones' We Love You. The album even has superior than LP versions of Therapy, New Rose(\\"Are we really 65 on the charts?\\"), Sick of Being Sick, Strecher Case Baby, and Nasty. The rest, however, falter for bad production and quality. If you buy only one damned album this one would be a great one and an even better introduction into their style for the less than casual observer."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST GAME I EVER PLAYED!!!","review":"If i could i would give this game a 4.5 overall rating. i just felt it could have been better. firstly the game doesn't end so gracefully, even like 3 more levels would have been better to end the story also silent threat (which DOES come with this order) has very little variety w/ regard to the missions, mostly just warp in, kill hostiles, warp out.but the main camopaign is much better, spy missions, capture missions, recon etc, but i still think this one of the best games ever made.p.s. anyone know where to get freespace 2 below 70 bucks?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Questionable Material","review":"Although the author is more than qualified the book is awkward to read and at times large sections are so disagreeable. He is very judgmental and acts that his word is gold despite many contradictory scholars against him. I am okay with the mixed information but the lack of acceptance that it may not be perfect for every situation is just annoying. I will never read this again or recommend it to others, it is not a total waste of time but there are better books out there (Senge, Covey)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book that still applies","review":"I am about 25% of the way through the book and it has so much content that is directly applicable to all kinds of operations.

I have seen Douglas Brooks speak on several occasions and I highly recommended any personal fitness trainer to seek him out. This book is comprehensive, easy to read, and written according to the guidelines of the ACSM and NCSA (and ACE and other well known organizations). I really liked that he has \\"copy approved\\" worksheets and forms throughout the book to use with your clients. It is a bit nore expensive than other PT books, but as they always say, you pay for what you get. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"INCREDIBLE book! A must have!","review":"I have been looking for a 'guidebook' with my personal training...I am certified with ACE and ASCM and have the books they require for this kind of work, but I happened to stumble across this book on Amazon, and almost did NOT buy it. What a mistake that would have been. This guy really knows how to reach out and touch you thru this book! He gives you the confidence you need, and tells you the mistakes he made in the beginning and how to avoid them....lots of REALLY good info...I am still reading thru it...and it will be a key manual for me as long as I do personal training...a must have, order it, and be happy :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Personal Training book review","review":"I ordered the Personal Training book for my son for Christmas.

I am very pleased with this company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amplitude","review":"This game is great. I loved Frequency, and Amplitude just adds to everything great about Frequency. The songs are great, offering much more variety in music type, also get much more challenging, something that Frequency kinda of held back on. Again, this game is fantasic, if you liked Frequency, of even Dance Dance Revolution, I highly recommend Amplitude."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy!","review":"I love this game.. It's an older one but it kind of paved the way for other games like Guitar Hero.. I enjoy it hope others do too"},{"rating":"1","title":"This game is horrible!","review":"After getting demos of both Amplitude and Frequency I thought that this game is horrible. It deserves one star because of the great soundtrack. Other than, this game is horrible. I am more of an action, adventure, extreme sport gamer. This game has the WORST PLOT EVER! DDR is way better even though it isn't that great at least you get a workout. If you are going to spend your well-earned $40 dollars on this game it is the same thing as flushing $40 down the toilet. Why not just learn how to play an instrument, it is much funner. (Electric guitar and ALL of percussion is the best.) Any way, this game is the worst ever. Either that or Dark Summit but that's another review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its not awesome, its SUPER SPR~DE!!","review":"Amplitude is the best way to spend your money on a PS2 game right now. Even if you haven't ever played a music game, or haven't played Frequency (the 1st in the series,) you will be hooked instantly. I can't think of one thing wrong with this game. The music is great. The graphics are great. The game is great. If you're still skeptical, rent it. But be warned: its cheaper to buy it than rent it over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredibly fun game","review":"Amplitude is wonderful. Looking at the success of the game's sequel, Guitar Hero, it's obvious that Harmonix knows what they're doing. Amplitude is the same style of game as GH, but with different mechanics. Being able to play every instrument in the song (including vocals) makes the game more exhilarating. I think Amplitude provides a bigger rush than GH ever could. It really rewards good players. Overall, I find the choice of songs better than in GH, as there's more variety. The only down-side is that it's kind of short, but it has excellent replay value. One of my favorite games of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic Musical Fun!","review":"With a wide variety of songs and a fantastic online multiplayer, Amplitude is a music and game fans dream.Buy it now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"High quality headset for internet telephone","review":"I purchased this headset for use with my Mac dG5 and Skype internet telephone. The combination is killer. I cannot compare to other similar equipment as this is my first and only, but for me, the quality is far better than what I have with my phone, and it was really as easy as plug and play. I wish that the headset had thicker and stronger wires; I wish that the headset was more sold. On the otherhand, I have not had any problems with the equipment up to now. And the sound quality during telephone conversations is steller, which is important to me, especially as my hearing starts to deminish. I saw some comments about the headset as an audiophile listening headphone. IMO, this is too complementary. For its price and features, a good buy and good sound quality, but IMO, this is not an audiophile headphone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good, not great. Not worth the price.","review":"I bought this headset in hopes of finding a pair of moderately high-end phones with noise cancelling and a USB connection. Unfortunately, I misread the specs. Although titled \\"Sennheiser PC155 Traditional Binaural PC Headset with USB and Noise canceling\\" [sic], the microphone -- not the headphones -- is noise cancelling. Beyond that, the phones offer a weak (but very low noise) output. The headset is extremely comfortable, even on big ears like mine, and the microphone works great. Still, for the cost of this item, I'm better off with a good set of traditional 3.5mm headphones and a good mic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Headset","review":"Sound quality is excellent as well as the built in microphone. If you skype, then this is the headset you need hands down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beautiful book, but extremely basic","review":"Beautiful book but a curious mix of beginner and from scratch instructions. Unfortunately, there are much better books for the beginner (such as Good Housekeeping's Step by Step), and there is far too little (including recipes) for the experienced home cook."},{"rating":"2","title":"An essential addition to any home cooking library!","review":"Peterson's book is an important contribution to cooking literature because it focuses on techniques. Through detailed pictures and explanation, Peterson does an excellent job of conveying the concept that cooking is a craft. Once you master the basic techniques of this craft, you can buy whatever is fresh in the market and prepare it without a recipe. I have taken years of cooking lessons, and feel this is the finest example I've seen of a book that makes cooking instruction readily accessible to non-professionals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Developing a Cook, not just following recipes","review":"I buy cookbooks for fun. This book will develop cooking skills as opposed to cooking following the many creative recipes from the numerous cookbooks we all own and freqently use. Peterson's goal is to have you cooking without the crutch and the burden of following someone else's game plan. This book will help your confindence in the kitchen without resorting to books. (The pictures are quite helpful.) If you are a really good cook already, this book isn't for you. If you are a reasonably competent cook, but not a chef, you will find this book valuable. Peterson is top flight, and he wrote this one for all of us who have a life outside the kitchen but hold a passion for cooking nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pictures, pictures, pictures, pictures.","review":"It's difficult to fully understand the appeal of this book until you've seen the pictures taken. In the author's own words, \\"I've tried to make the photographs cheery (see how easy this is!) and life-like--they were shot under real-life conditions in my cramped Brooklyn apartment--so that if the going gets rough, things won't seem utterly hopeless.\\"Before reading this book I wouldn't touch anything that didn't go in the microwave. After about a month with this book, I was making great soups and a mean paella. Just looking at the beautiful pictures motivated me to mimic the skills shown in the photographs and to go the extra three miles to get better quality food.For each technique, Mr. Peterson offers the bare-bones, this is how to do it description as well as an explanation of the variables that make one recipe different from another.I love this book. Looking through it makes me hungry. Luckily I have a fast metabolism. ;-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Searching for the Priest for the New Temple","review":"This is the first in her series about locating the Priest before the new temple is to be built.

All the little bags looked to be in great shape and well protected in the sturdy box. I have eaten several packages and they all tasted really good. The Mesquite b-b-q flavor is very flavorful without being overwhelming. The individual packages are a bit hard to open. The inside of the bag has some type of plastic lining. Overall, I think that's probably a good thing and helps to keep the chips as fresh as they are. These chips have a very hearty crunch!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie","review":"It was ok for the moment. After you watch it a couple of times - that's enough.

I had a hard time finding it as it was published in England. While never a huge Manchester United fan, I now follow them purely due to their signing of Owen, who I hope can make a comeback and again score the beautiful goals he is known for."},{"rating":"1","title":"All in all, relatively poor","review":"All in all, I was pretty disappointed by this book. The author's role as a journalist provided some unique insights into Soviet like and culture, but his writing ability appeared to be somewhat limited.As stated in other reviews, the author constantly repeats the same points in every chapter. Also, I think the author is placing too much blame on the actions of Western nation in not doing more to contain the Soviet Union. In hindsight, they should have definitely have done more, but I when you are threatened with nuclear war, it is understandable to \\"walk on eggshells\\" with your foreign policy.This book contains many interesting points and anecdotes, but is a tedious read."},{"rating":"2","title":"good game","review":"it is a very interesting game; you are always interested with the story and are never bored with it. highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best RPG","review":"BOF is one of the best games I have ever played, I have spent countless hours on puzzles and finding valuable items. If you are looking for a fun, long game, I would recommend this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great game, lots of depth","review":"I never played the SNES version of this game, so it isn't just a matter of nostalgia for me - I really loved this game. The world had so many places to explore and the puzzles were really challenging (just see how easy it is to get anywhere when you can't see the walls). I didn't have to spend all my time leveling either. I genuinely liked the characters and there are lots of different items, weapons, and equipment to play with. The only thing that bothered me was that it only had one save slot. It's definitely easy to make a critically bad decision in this game, so I would have preferred to be able to alternate save files in case I regret something I did later. It uses the typical method of saving only in certain places (usually in towns), but it will keep a temporary save if you need to turn it off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Slight higher than average","review":"Breath of fire has relatively good graphics [average].This game has a neat story line and a stunning and tensifying intro movie, a rather long one to be exact, the problem is that you have to wait through the long, starting and stopping music (this can get a lttle tedious).Overall, because of the decent music and story line, I give breath of fire 4 stars [out of 5]"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best","review":"I have never played this for the GBA but i have for the super nintendo.

Most introductory textbooks are pretty much alike: a little history, a little theory, an overview of what theatre professionals do, etc. Cameron and Gillespie give the student a leg up by writing their chapters in a user-friendly format, with chapter objectives, bulleted (main) points, and key terms at the end of the chapter, as well as web sites for further information. They also provide headings and subheadings as chapters progress, helping us digest the material in conceptual chunks rather than one long narrative. As one reviewer pointed out, there are no cuts from plays inserted, but that gives the instructor the freedom to choose his/her own plays to examine in class. Overall, I think it's an excellent introductory text. I especially like the attention to script analysis using Aristotle's Poetics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caution: May cause severe eye-rolling and excessive boredom","review":"This book is meant to be informative. It is. Unfortunately, only about 15% of the book contains useful information.

This book provides an insider's view of the imperialistic fashion in which the missionaries, large ranch/farming interests, military fanatics and their political cronies collaborated against the Hawiian cultural and political system. It also explains the efforts of native Hawaiians to prevent these actions. Essentially, \\"Stolen Kingdom\\" is the non-fiction version of James A. Michener's \\"Hawaii\\". I learned much from this well-documented book; and most notably, of the various factions in the US and Hawaii involved in usurping power from the indigenous locals. I recommend this informative writing to all Americans as a primer for Hawaiian Political History."},{"rating":"2","title":"The US Navy Band","review":"How could it be anything but great?

Why this over the 3170? This is half the price, smaller (about 1/3 in height), and looks great. It fit about 4 4x6 photos on the scanner, use the multi-scan at 600 dpi and works fine. Sometimes though, I think the autocropping could be better. It took all of 5 minutes to set up and use. It does not need a separate power adapter as it uses the USB for power.

It did a decent job scanning color print photos once I got the right settings. Unfortunately, it stopped working exactly one year after I purchased it. This was on a Sunday, no telephone tech support from Canon on Sundays. I called them the next day and spent almost an hour on the phone to confirm the scanner was dead. Then I was told that I was one day out of warranty, tough luck, thank you for purchasing Canon products. They would not budge at all. For this scanner, Canon gets 2 stars: 4 for actual performance, 3 for the driver software, and zero stars for durability and customer service.

This book and audio CD set was useless. The text alone may be fine for those who do not need the audio component, but Chinese pronunciation is notoriously difficult for native speakers of English.

I think he succeeds blending fictional characters with a whole host of historical figures. His melding of fact and fiction is quite seamless.The historical scholarship is remarkable. As a native Northwesterner, I knew about the Pig War bit didn't know about the back-stage pulling & tugging that went on between northerners and southerners on the American side. That set an interesting prelude to the Civil War itself.The fictional characters are nicely developed. You can hear Rory's brogue! The surprising (to me) fact of extensive Irish and African-American naval service in the Civil War is presented subtly but clearly. It is an interesting and vigorous plot with lots of action and a modicum of romance.

The way her lips part halfway, he tastes her moistness. The hairs on his arms stand up, alarmed. He feels altogether changed and different. All the time he has been meditating to dissolve the self, and here, with one kiss on rose-colored lips, he has disappeared competely into her.\\"Or here, \\"The night lifted its curtain to another scorching morning, heavy with the scent of fairy bell lilies below the northern window.

Each chapter ends with a helpful quiz and hands-on exercises, some of which depend upon sample programs that are included with retail versions of VB5.One gets the impression that Mr. Perry has had experience teaching VB5 beginners, since he clarifies many points that confuse beginners, but which VB5 gurus often take for granted.The prospective reader should note that mastery of the VB5 programming language requires significant time and effort. As a beginning VB5 programmer, I have found Mr. Perry's book to be a helpful first step."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another blabbermouth wastes time and print","review":"He talks way too much; he could have covered many of the things he only \\"touched on\\" with less gift of gab and more hands-on procedures. Too much talk is boring; had to drink extra coffee to get through some of the verbal marathons, as with other Sam's books, just too much flapping of the mouth. I actually prefer Microsoft online tutorials, neat and concise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good way to build your VB Foundation.","review":"This is a good book for beginners but don't expect to get through it in 24 hours. You need about 1-3 hours per chapter to get through questions and exercises. Definitely a lot of bang for your buck!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good way to begin programming as well as Visual Basic","review":"Have you wanted to get more power from your computer but was put off by having to learn programming? This book will take you through the basics of what a program is and current programming theory. The author does this in a non dry way, and attempts to present complex concepts in easy to understand steps.As someone who is versed in several programming languages, I was able to get through the book quicker than some, only because I could skip over some the basic programming theory. But for someone who has not had programming experiance, I recomend reading the book fully. There are a few typos, which can cause some confusion, but the information can be gleened from the contex.This book is a good buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Inexpensive Introduction","review":"This book is a good introduction to VB5 and the price is right, but like all things, you get what you pay for. I thought the information was presented in a logical and easy to follow manner, although note that some of the programs/examples referenced in the text were either not present on the CD-ROM, or did not work as described. I don't consider this a show-stopper, as I have always considered the CD-ROMs that come with books to be less than satisfying. This one was no exception. For a beginner programmer with little or no prior progamming experience, this book will suffice to get you started. On those terms I would recommend it. The best choice (if you have the extra $$) is Mike Halvorson's VB5 Step by Step published by Microsoft Press. It's top notch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for a fast start to VB programming","review":"I am very impressed with this book. It is the perfect book for anyone beginner to advance willing to learn VB. Better yet, if you have the standard edition of VB, have no fear, you get VB 5 Control Creation Editor with it and all the ActiveX components that you get with the Professional version. The book says about an hour per chapter but you can get through each in about 1/2 hour -> that is how readable it is! And the end of each chapter the exercises reinforces the concepts learnt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I have used this book for self study as I wasn't a great math student in high school.

I bought it to bore out the undersized holes on two metal-clad french doors. I hoped the flimsy plastic guide that comes with this kit would steady the hole saw. The first time I pulled the trigger on the drill, it was like that scene in the New York episode of the Simpsons where Homer uses a jackhammer to remove the boot on his car with comical results. To finish that door I ended up butting some clamps up against the guide to prevent it from moving. For the next door, I'll simply cut a hole in a piece of plywood and clamp the plywood to the door, which will make a much sturdier guide.For a set of two bi-metal hole saws with an arbor, you can get better quality (DeWalt) for less money. Do yourself a favor and go buy DeWalt hole saws in the same sizes and make a jig similar to the one just described."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good luck using this thing","review":"I bought this kit to install some door locks and they're so cheap that they only give you ONE mandrel for two saw bits. The manual tells you to drill the 2 1/8\\" hole, then \\"disassemble 2 1/8\\" hole saw and assemble 1\\" hole saw\\". Yeah, good luck... once you drill with one of the saws, that mandrel stays in that saw bit and you won't be able to get it out even with your best wrenches.

I thought this book would be a good fit, so I ordered it. What a mistake.What this book actually is, is a collection of the stupidest, most inane bit of \\"advice\\" ever put forth. Some examples:\\"Don't use liquid eyeliner. If you want to use liner, use powder.\\" p55.\\"Don't force your hand too far into the hole (of the toilet bowl).\\" p72.\\"Remember: Customer service means giving the customer good service.\\" p177.Add that to the snippets of garbage from 'real people' -- like this one:\\"Say what you mean, and mean what you say.

Instead it put her in tears. Instead of accepting themselves as who they are and how they look, they bring kids to the conclusion that they cannot be OK if they break out. My daughter was very upset and all I could do was apologize. If you are looking for a book that wants to compress your daughter into the current fashions and mainstream, maybe this is for you, then again, I strongly believe that my daughter is special and that this has not helped her self-confidence or her understanding of all the changes happening. Personally, I do not want my daughter caught up in all of the latest makeup and dress, I want her to be able to wear what she is comfortable in and feel comfortable in her own skin. Next time I will review any books I get for her much closer."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE, IT'S MONO!","review":"I tend to agree with the reviewer who says poor remastering. This has to be the quintessential combination of great artistry and poor sound quality. I am always thrilled by Callas' and Gobbi's voices, regardless of how poor the sound quality, and this one is no exception. But to add to what others have said about the sound quality, I found a lot of transient distortion, and ragged scratchy spots where a singer or the orchestra would come in strong after a quiet passage. Furthermore, unrevealed by the website description, is that it's not in stereo, quite remarkable for this day and age.I guess if there's a better remastering of the same LP, I'd go for it, but I haven't heard the others. Perhaps the master tape was mono and so are they."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant Lucia","review":"This is not your usual Lucia. Callas sings the role of the Bride of Lammermoor with a big voice uncommon with the many Lucia canaries that have made this opera an undramatic playground for coloratura embellishment. Fortunately, Callas' genius is singing allowed her to portray the role with colors of madness and remorse, something that you will never ever find in any other Lucia. Di Stefano and Gobbi were equally great in this recording, with their ability to tap into the roles and to deliver the dramatic lines with ease uncommon with so many of today's uninterpretive singers. This is how Lucia should be sung, and we were blessed to have the chance to hear the role in the way it is supposed to be sung."},{"rating":"1","title":"POOR REMASTERING OF GREAT PERFORMANCE","review":"There is not much more I can say about the value of this famous performance; unfortunately this latest remastering (2004) is overly bright and filled with audio artifacts - listen to Gobbi's very first lines in Act One - every consonant has an artifact. The earler EMI mastering from 1986 and the Naxos version are both far better. EMI is doing a real disservice to perhaps its greatest artist by the poor quality of many of the transfers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prayer Guide for the Brokenhearted: Comfort","review":"Ladies, if you are suffering from a broken heart then READ this book. It is FANTASTIC. Michelle is blessed with an ability to reach out to women and understand their pain. It has been said by others, and I totally agree, reading Michelle's books are like talking to your best friend. Every page that I read helped me in the healing process. Michelle understands, and when you are hurting you need someone who understands how you feel. Let's put it this way, I hate to spend a lot of money. However, I have just ordered all of Michelle's books, and had some of them delivered the next day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough photos","review":"Ok, maybe I am getting spoiled by all the glitzy full color photo filled books on this topic that are out there. There may be many good ideas in this book, but out of 181 pages, there are only four double-sided pages with actual photos of her work. The other illustrations are hand sketches which appear on nearly every page. Pity the inside wasn't as pretty as the cover.

There were some really useful ways to loosen up and talk to your partner about what you need or want, and the stories that went along with those ideas were hot.

I forced myself to read half of this book, hoping that somewhere along the good stuff will begin. Never happened!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This story would make a great B movie","review":"Card starts with a interesting premise as a foundation and on it builds a factory made formula novel. Knowing the caliber of work of which he is capable, this book felt like it was cranked out in one weekend to make an editor's deadline. The story had some surprising twists, an intriguing background, the characters were likeable if not complex, but the details and delivery lacked depth. It reads just like a haunted house movie and demands about as much imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"This novel held my attention","review":"If you're a sucker for a well-written ghost story with a couple of plot surprises thrown in for good measure, then you'll enjoy this novel. It's the story of a lonely guy who has pretty much given up on the world since his daughter's senseless death in an auto accident, and about him reclaiming his humanity thanks in large part to a homeless woman who refuses to leave the big old house he just bought. It's just a well-written story with enough twists and turns to keep you interested. I recommend this book to any and all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly Entertaining","review":"Card has become one of my favorites; I have read almost 30 of his books since September of 1997, and each one leaves me hungering for more. Unfortunately, I've read almost all of his \\"in-print\\" stuff, so now I find myself waiting for his new publications. _Homebody_ is one I've been looking for for almost 6 months. And it's worth the wait. The only thing I don't like about it, is the fact that I finished it too quick. Card has the ability to immediately transport me into his world and wrap me up in his story. He creates characters that are distinct and dialogue that is believable. I care about these people. _Homebody_ doesn't rank with _Ender's Game_ or _Alvin_, but it is a solid novel that is thoroughly enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Supernatural suspense not horror","review":"If you like stories with a scary supernatural element, but are uncomfortable with satanic evil material, this is a book you can enjoy. I liked this book; it is kind of scary without making you feel dirty. Not as much of a thinker as many of his books, but maybe more than most horror stories. Not more or less predictable than most horror. Good book, not his best, but worth a read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Competent, but bland","review":"Normally I like Orson Scott Card. In fact, the Ender series tops my list for best SF series ever. Homebody, however, is a disappointment. The plot is bland, the cliches abound, and it's not very moving or scary. The writing, as in all of Card's work, is clear and well presented. But, alas, here Card is just moving his pen for no reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Look Not Here For the Heart of Orson Scott Card","review":"The author of the Ender Saga and other great novels such as Pastwatch is virtually nowhere to be found in this story. Instead of great storytelling and philisophical food for thought this novel provides nothing but time wasted.The characters are strong and the actual mechanics of writing are pure good ol' Orson Scott Card but after that the reader is left with a humorless, suspense impoverished and bland novel. I spend chapter upon chapter hoping someone would do something half-way interesting.If you are looking for a great novel by this author then check out his others because this is not the one to measure his talent by."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining","review":"If you like Orson Scott Card, Homebody won't disappoint you. If you love Orson Scott Card stories, it may leave you wanting more.Homebody is about a simple man with a bad past who buys a house with an even worse history than he does. The story is simple and straight forward and is relatively predictable.Don Lark, the main character is flushed out well, but somehow everyone else seems a little hollow. The characters seem a little too convenient and there is very little, if no background characters. Unfortunately, Lark's character believes in the story of Sylvie, the old ladies and the house too easily. Not enough struggle in the acceptance of the supernatural.The story is good and you'll enjoy it. However, readers who go out of their way for a Card book for the depth of the characters and the storyline will be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing read","review":"This was a surprise--I was hooked by Ender's Game, so I thought this would have some merit. It is a fast read, but not interesting. Don's response when he realized Sylvie was a ghost was without emotion. I couldn't believe he accepted her presence in the house in the first place. I find it confusing that Card introduced Cindy and removed her just as quickly--certainly a romance with her would have been more believable. I never realized men are attracted to women who wear the same dirty dress day in and day out. I am nearing the end of the book, and I will be glad when it is over. It will be difficult to pick up another Card--unless it is the sequel to Ender. Maybe he should stick with science fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Non-horrifying horror","review":"This novel, by one of the great modern science fiction authors, was not what I was expecting. Homebody isn't science fiction, it's more of a light horror/romance. I almost stopped reading during the first half, because the story seemed like a misplaced romance novel, a genre I have absolutely no interest in. The second half was definitely an improvement over the earlier chapters, but the overall book was a disappointment. The plot and its twists were extremely predictable, and it never really reached what I would consider horror. I was annoyed by the disappearance of the first female lead--she was written as if she would be a main character, then she diappeared halfway through and was never heard from again. Very sloppy.I think I'll stick to Card's sci-fi, if this is what happens when he switches genres..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Obviously a good writer","review":"Though I admit this novel doesn't strike me as the sort to become a classic anytime soon, I also must admit that Orson Scott Card's writing is very good. It shines through a plot that could have been better developed. Not to say that HOMEBODY has a terrible plot. I merely feel that it would have been an even more gripping and involving piece of literature if the house were given more of a thoroughly discussed history just to give the novel even more depth.I recommend this book to readers who appreciate fine writing and not just the cookie-cutter sort so readily available in commercial fiction today."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Mighty Has Fallen","review":"What happened? Did OSC finaly lost his Midas-touch? I just hope that 'Homebody' will never happen again! This book is empty of substance and weak in every way.

So when I saw this book I decided to give it a try. Let me sum it up, this book is stupid. I love mysteries but this one just didn't make sense, and the characters were unlikeable and poorly devloped. My husband wants me to give this guy another shot, I don't think so!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"If this book didn't have Orson Scott Card's name on the cover, I would never have thought it was written by the same author as \\"Speaker for the Dead\\". The dialogue was stilted and simplistic, the characters, who seemed to spend a great deal of time \\"feeling each others pain\\", were uninteresting and one-dimensional, and the plot was... well... boring. Wow! A real stinker. I wish I had spent those hours reading ActionScript 2.0."},{"rating":"1","title":"Card should be embarrassed!","review":"Let me start by saying that I really like Orson Scott Card and think that he has written some really excellent books (Ender's Game, Pastwatch, etc). This book is in not Card's normal sci fi genre but is a supernatural \\"thriller\\". I have to say that this book was absolutely terrible! It started off pretty well but just flopped in the end. Nothing exciting ever really happened, the characters seemed to have emotions with no context, and the ending was so predictable it was painful. If I were Card, I would be embarrassed to put my name on this book. If you love Card's previous books, you will be extremely disappointed by this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different, but not bad","review":"This novel seems to be the first in a different genre for Card. It didn't feel like a horror story like a Stephen King novel for example, but it definately does have its creepy moments. Card, as usual, builds strong characters and conveys to us their inner feelings and motivations. Some of his characters are so strong that we hate to see them leave, just as we hate to see people we love in our own lives leave.In some areas the plot was predictable, but still enjoyable. If you like Card's manner of storytelling, you'll enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A second rate story from a first rate author","review":"I have loved almost everything that OS Card has written. His combining of sympathetic characters with solid speculative fiction sets him apart from the rest of the genre. I don't know what happened with \\"Homebody\\". It is a pedestrian ghost story that could have been penned by any number of grocery store authors. Read \\"Ender's Game\\" again rather than waste your time with this novel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing. Expected a scary tale, but got bad romance.","review":"Card can write horror, but he's out of his depths when he tries to write romance. I neither identified nor sympathized with any character and I found the female character's repetitive \\"A man like him...\\" thoughts lazy stereotypical mimicry. The book comes alive with the appearance of two whacky elderly female neighbors who are simultaneously comforting with their old-fashioned cooking and yet darkly sinister. Unfortunately too much time is wasted reviewing the hero's wounds, and the book reeks of sentamentality."},{"rating":"2","title":"PASSIONATE & EMBRACING MUSIC!","review":"This is an amazing, energetic and passionate style of music unlike any I have heard.

Her compositional style doesn't just give a horn the head and go into solos, but shares the head with instrumental blends (sounding quite new and fresh even for a quartet) and building to send Music straight into solos. They don't build the groove, the compositions allow them to keep it in motion and just color it or dent it. It's so dirty and so clean, like steralzed mud.

He is a world-renowned guitarist and sideman. But his solo albums have often been uneven. His greatest commercial and artistic triumph was undoubtedly the \\"Los Cubanos...\\" album released a couple of years ago. His second outing with the \\"Prosthetic Cuban\\" ensemble is every bit engaging and fun as their debut. While Ribot's guitar playing dominated their first album, this album sees the whole band stretching out, being allowed to shine. Don't get me wrong: Ribot's fiery and unique playing snakes its way through every song, but the band also gets their fair share of the spotlight. Anyone who likes great guitar playing, Latin rhythms, and blistering group interplay will LOVE this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it says on the box (in the twilight)","review":"This is a pretty good tool.

Within 30 minutes which included reading the instructions and safety precautions I had completed the task of fastening all the wood strips to the concreted with excellent results. The tool is easy to use and works as advertised.My one reason for not giving this a 5 is that the tool is, in all effects, a .22 caliber gun.

My previous model was a flimsy thing with an ugly plastic handle, purchased in the produce dept. of a grocery store. This one was handsome - all gleaming stainless steel - and had considerably more heft than I was used to. And the teeth - so sturdy! But therein lay the problem. The teeth were too thick to easily pierce the skin of my lovely heirloom tomatoes (more like thick fork tines than tiny blades). Instead of precisely scooping out the hulls, I ended up mangling the surrounding flesh.Perhaps it would work better on some other tomato varieties? Or something firmer, like a strawberry?P.S. While I may have had problems with the tool, I have nothing but praise for Chef's Tools. I told them about the problem, and they promptly and politely righted the situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be sharper.","review":"I bought this tool to fill one very specific need - to hollow out cherry tomatoes for my famous BLT Bites. But it is not quite sharp enough, and I end up squishing the tomatoes a bit.

The chapters alternate between the trials and tribulations of each new field season and the basics of geology, paleontology, and evolutionary theory. There is the occasional minor error [which I cannot relocate and since I just read a copy of the hardback, I cannot say if those errors have been corrected in the paperback], but these do not distract from the overall excellence of the book. This book predates the confirmation of the discovery of the end of the Cretaceous impact crater in the Yucatan, so the discussion on the mass extinction at the end of the Cretaceous will seem a little out of date to the knowledgable reader. I look forward to reading Time Traveler, Novaceks newest book. I highly recommend Dinosaurs of the Flaming Cliffs to any fan of paleontology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome! Just what we needed!","review":"We have a 60lb Hungarian Vizslas who loves to run! She has run so much that she's killed the grass on her 'paths', turning her favorite areas to mud when it rains. We tried in vein to wipe all of the mud off of her paws, but no matter what we did, we'd still have mud on the carpet. Well, when we saw this product & read reviews we thought is was worth a try. The Paw Plunger was easy to use and very effective! At first, our dog didn't like us using it (but we gave her treats afterwards to reinforce it as a positive experience). It works wonderfully & we tell all our friends with dogs to get one. It has seriously saved the carpet and made us much happier when it rains. WE WISH WE HAD BOUGHT THIS SOONER! Totally recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing & Impractical","review":"I imagined the Paw Plunger as a compact and easy to use item. It's very large and awkward to use.

It's easy to use and way better than just using a dry cloth to wipe my dog's paws down. It has solved a lot of the paw licking problems too. If you purchase the right size for your dog I don't see how it's possible that the paw can get stuck. My only thought is that maybe if your dog's nails are horribly long they can get lodged in one of the holes where the bristles come out off?

It works surprisingly well!","review":"We used to use wet-wipes/baby wipes to clean off our greyhounds muddy feet; we used to go through 3 packs a week! Now we keep a rag by the door (which we have to change every two to three days) and we fill up the paw plunger before going out. It does a great job of getting off caked on mud. It also works wonders on our Afghan hounds feet (bigger feet, lots more hair).It is very easy and takes what used to be a terrible five minutes with the greyhound and made it a quick one-minute breeze. (afghan takes longer, but thats due to all the hair!)If your dog's paws are too big to go through the top, what you can do is unscrew the top, places your dogs paw in the water, the put your dogs paw through the BOTTOM of the scrubbing part, while still holding over the water. This should clean the paws and get rid of any tough dirt."},{"rating":"2","title":"paw Plunger","review":"This is the greatest thing for cleaning your dogs paws. In the winter I have a lot of mud and this has saved my carpet from being ruined. At first my dog was hesitant but with a little time he got use to it.

My dog's paw got caught in the plunger. We were all stressed out specially him, not to mention the pain that he was in. He could not stop wailing so we called the emergency room. Because we were unable to cut the hard plastic, they asked us to bring him into the emergency room. On the way there, his paw released and he was not harmed.

When I saw it my heart sank. I'd like to take my kids on the kind of road trips I enjoyed when I was their age. My parents always found the scenic, as well as the fun places to take us. This book struck out big time. It doesn't give out useful info for planning a fun road trip. I thought one of the previous reviewers was exaggerating when they said each state gets only two pages. How can you learn what a state has to offer in a tiny amount of space? 2 pages it is.On the bright side, I also ordered United States on the Road. WOW. Now that book is definitely a guide to planning a very cool road trip. Beautiful photos and descriptions of plenty of places to visit (scenic as well as fun), history, directions, mileage, email addresses, phone numbers, price guides, etc. I can't wait to start planning our trip!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I wish I had read some of the reviews of this book before making my purchase. I would have passed on it. I was hoping for something a little more detailed, more definitive. Instead I see a smattering of questionable entries on locations that were easily accessed on his itinerary, whether they were the best the state has to offer or not. As many would, I first looked at a state I know well (Kansas), to see Wood's recommendations. Gulp - he was way off! If P.J.

Though the title would have you believe it would be a suitable replacement. I was planning to drive from LA to San Diego and was looking for some cool landmarks. Well each state gets 2 pages, so you can image the ideas I got for stopping points. Zero. I looked up Massachusetts, my home, and all it seemed to talk about was Howard Johnson's.

It is easy for even my 4 month old to get the little tails to make the animal sounds. Haven't tried to hook up an MP3 player yet. The problem I have is that it is way too loud for my baby's ears, especially since he is so close to it because he is looking in the mirror and trying to chew on the tails. I have not been able to find the speaker so I could try to tape over it to make it quieter because it is closed up too well. I will keep trying but I really think they should put a volume switch on it and then it would get 5 stars from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price tag","review":"I bought this for my daughter when she was about 3 months old and thought it would be good for tummy time. I picked this specific mirror over other (cheaper) ones because it said on the box that it can stand on its own, but it constantly toppled over.

I ended up returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all I had hoped for","review":"I bought this product looking for a floor mirror for my 3 mo. old daughter to play tummy time. Unfortunately the mirror is a little high off the floor so she can't actually see herself in it when she's on her tummy holding her head up. Also there is no volume control and the voices are a little loud and startling for her. I gave this 2 stars because it's colorful, and at least my 2 1/2 yr. old son likes to play with it. I think I will just go get a floor length mirror and prop it up horizontally against my entertainment unit like I did when my son was a baby.

Its been great for tummy time, she loves to push the \\"Tails\\" and listen to the animals \\"Talk,\\" and loves to look at herself in the mirror.

He enjoys seeing himself in the mirror, but he is most interested in the songs and the animal voices, which most other mirrors do not have. The nice thing is, this is the first toy he has been able to interact with by himself. The colored tabs are easy for babys newly adjusting fingers to work! It is also very versitile. I put it on his highchair table, his crib and on the floor for tummy time, which by the way, my baby could not stand until this toy!! He finally is spending some time on his tummy and really pushing up to see himself in the mirror as the song sings, and like previous reviews, the song is so sweet!

As rhythmic as Copeland's drummming was, the Police never played funk-rock like this. You hear bands TALK about their R&B; influence, only to find no such thing in their music. Inclined walks the walk and lays down some grooves here for sure. It's clear they were influenced by James Brown as much as Jimi. I should stop comparing them to others though because they're just not like any other. A shame this was their only CD.

It's a miracle. I was so anxious to get the 12 string version. When I did I simply cannot get it to fret all of the strings. I'm using it on a Taylor 855CE, tuned a step low, with medium Elixer strings. The problem is on the higher pitched octave strings. The capo's rubber doesn't seem to yield enough to allow it to reach the narrower width octave strings, the rigidness on the wider strings don't allow it to press the octave strings to the fret without enormous pressure, and even then, sometimes I can't get a clean sound. I've considered trying to modify it by cutting or burning the rubber, but I'm afraid I would ruin it, and it has found a place in another 6 string case where it works perfectly (hence 2 stars instead of 1).If they ever address this problem, I'd buy one in a second, but I feel pretty burned on a very expensive capo."},{"rating":"1","title":"USELESS 12 String Capo","review":"I bought this for my Larrivee 12 string, with high expectations.It does not work!No matter how it is adjusted, the smaller gauge E and A strings are not depressed.I am stuck with it because I didn't keep the packaging - I foolishly thought this 'premier' capo would work.It is pathetic!!

This is like the chairs we use where I work. Any repeated use and they start falling apart. It'll last a year, then I'll have to save for a real chair. By the way the instructions are typical poorly written. Don't buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pet Dectective Game","review":"This was a surprise.

Certaintly, this is the next step for boys 13 years old (at <i>least</i>) who find Louis Sachar's Newberry-winning \\"Holes\\" to be below their level. It embraces male stereotypes at the same time it rejects them, and it has a timeless quality in the details of setting that ensure it a lasting place in the hearts of those who found \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" to be too downbeat and lacking in action.All in all, if any of the above sounded even mildly appealing, you'll enjoy this book a lot more than mildly."},{"rating":"1","title":"hmmmm...","review":"Interesting plot, but not well set up.

Call me sentimental, but it's just the way I am. The Elizabeth series might be exciting, especially with Max, Vanessa, Alice, and Sarah Pennington there to spruce it up, but it's still not Sweet Valley.

It's definitely an adult game, and best played in a spirit of mean fun. Cries of \\"Take one to the peppermint, Bitey!\\" and \\"Oh, no- not my tasty little legs!\\" accompany gameplay. It's a pretty amusing parody of Candyland, a game which (while we may remember it fondly from our youths) sucked. The basic game play is similar to the original, but the addition of \\"treat\\" cards (which give you special powers) and the ability to attack other players change it from a game entirely based on chance to a game with an element of strategy.Gameplay is okay, though not inspired. This is a game you play for the fun of the situation, not for the brilliance of the game play."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This is my first book by Carolyn Graham, but I am familiar with the television series. I found the plot to be somewhat interesting and well laid out, but some characters (with one or two notable exceptions) sorely lacked a third dimension. Other characters were introduced with great promise for a colourful development which never materialized. The foundation for intricate relationships between characters was indeed present, but was left unexploited. What I found most disappointing, however, was the fact that the Inspector and his deputy had apparently nothing to do with the solving of the crime! They were simply two more characters parading alongside all others, creating very little impact on the overall development of the plot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where was Graham's editor?","review":"Enjoyed this as I have earlier Chief Inspector Barnaby's books. However, was it only me who spotted, in Chapter 5, a glaring discrepancy in the description of Ann Lawrence's dress: \\"as she opened the door, Barnaby took in a faded blue dress...\\", followed a few paragraphs on by \\"Ann Lawrence...wore a poorly cut green tweed skirt and hand-knitted jumper.\\" Not the biggest discrepancy I've ever spotted but enough to put me off a bit.Otherwise a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible, find a better book","review":"What I as a student found lacking in this book: 1.) It has many problems, which is a good thing, but this fact is negated by its lack of a publically available solutions manual and numerous and obvious misprints. 2.) Many of the examples gloss over important points to note and I found many vague and cursory. The instructor I had used more detailed material from other textbooks. Many examples also appeared to be used as a substitute for generalized text explainations and diagrams. It also seemed rather vague on the more theroetical aspects of the material. Considering all the other Statics textbooks out there, chances would favor some of them being a lot better than this one. And taking into account the price, I would consider this book a total waste of resources. If you're a mechanical engineering or aerospace student, you'll probably need a better introduction than this if you hope to survive the more advanced courses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for self studying","review":"Although the basics of statics is explained in each chapter, this doesn't help answer the more complicated section and review questions in each chapter. The examples were too simple and very few were given. I found myself refering back to my calculus textbook to get a more in depth explaination of the topics. And even though every other question had an answer in the back of the book (which is typical of most textbooks), that didn't help with the actual step by step solution of the question. You're left on your own to dig through the book to piece together a solution for each problem. A student solutions manual would be helpful. I would not recommend this book if you plan on using it in a self taught enviroment."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy this book it is bad","review":"It would help if a solutions manual were available to the public.

Its my hope all the distributors send this unfinished product back to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sound Issues, Keyboard Issues","review":"I want to love it, but have several issues that are detracting.1) During missions, each time a session is replayed (because the AI is better than I am) the sound gets faster and faster. The episode of the original series with the people accelerated so their speech is like the buzz of an insect is happening on my computer. Normal speed-chipmunk-insect is the sound progression. Restarting the program is the only cure.2) Need joystick and remapable controls. The warp button \\"Q\\" next to the control buttons \\"WASD\\" means you warp out in the middle of a fight due to a slight hand motion error.3) The mouse cursor disappears in the map mode some times. Once you accidentally warp away, you have to fight to get back to the battle.4) Just plain buggy5) Needs access to quick lessons or tutorial or key maps"},{"rating":"1","title":"This game is complete garbage","review":"This game is an utter disapointment. Do not waste your money. The official web page states that it is a strategy game. That it is not. It's a poorly done (and buggy) port of a console implementation. no strategy at all, a few hours of fairly lousy shoot them up at best. Someone on the official forums called it Astroids with a Star Trek skin. Astroids was actually much more fun than this garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Execution","review":"This is the game that my son has wanted for some time (like a previous reviewer), and we were surprised by the delayed release dates. When it finally came out, the screen rate was far too choppy. I have tried to change some of the options, but the response is still fairly sluggish.My son is not the most particular of computer users, but I fear that he has already given up on this game. Seriously, I can't believe that Microsoft Flight Simulator X works so well on my computer but Star Trek Legacy appears to be junk.I am not much of a gamester myself, but I can say that it is very frustrating when the sound, video and controls are sloppy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Double check your equipment requirements","review":"While I'm sure the game will run on the newest PCs capable of supporting the graphics, memory and processing demands of Windows Vista, if you have an older PC, bought sometime around 2002 running XP you may want to pay close attention to the hardware requirements necessary to even launch the game one time after installing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disaster!!!","review":"What a disappointment for a Star Trek Fan.I couldn't even finish the tutorial without restarting it again to get the instructions again. The controls are so bad you have no clue on what to do even with the manual in hand. You can't save in game and controls can't be reconfigured. I had no clue what to do and was ripped to shreds in the tutorial - till I cheated. Then I just couldn't get anything accomplished. Whoever coded this should pay everyone back who bought this game! DON'T BUY IT UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Even worse than Starfleet Command","review":"This game was bad! The controls are hard to use, there is no joystick interface, and no ability to change the controls in the game. The game takes forever to do anything. Destroying one ship is a chore and I have no confidence that further gameplay will allow me to get any better. After all the hype for this game I was extremelly disappointed. For not having a new Star Trek game for a couple years, you would think they would put one out of better quality. If you want a Star Trek game, I would suggest Star Trek Bridge Commander. I still like that one. In STBC you can fly the ship in a similar way to this game if you like, and it is easier to manuver. Otherwise you can have the con officer fly and just command from the captain's chair. So it gives you a few choices. But I would either find another game or save your money. Because Star Trek Legacy is not worth your time or money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Legacy","review":"Can't play yet. When I was buying the requirements to play were DX9c agp 8x video card w/ 128 vram. I have a 256 vram 8x card. The readme lists my card as not good enough so the game is too choppy to play.

From non-functioning multiplayer, music/sound skips, cut story lines, no introductions, all video scenes removed, notes in the gaming code from developers and abysmal keyboard controls that dont work correctly, non-working software with systems that meet the minimum requirements...All of these culminate into a game that was rushed out the door with too little time and too many budget cuts, by a company that borrowed heavily from it's aged Armada II graphics engine to save time, money, and investment...and it shows! In an age where a company's survival is dependant on customer satisfaction, this title indeed puts Bethesda Softworks and Mad Doc Software in the hot seat."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this game!","review":"Look. Don't buy this game. The fanboys will tell you it's ok. That it has good gameplay and the graphics are great. They'll also tell you to 'wait for the patches', and 'wait until the modders get to it'. Frankly, it's garbage, and Bethsoft should be strung up for this gaming abortion they've unleashed upon /unsuspecting/ consumers.Fine, I'll admit the graphics are average. But the gameplay stinks, the multiplayer was broken when it shipped, there are no ways to edit the control layout (which was designed by gorillas), and half the features they were supposed to include are gone. You don't even have true 3D. There are games five years old that have that! And this is supposed to be a space combat game.This game is NOT worth 40 dollars. Not a chance.Run away. Trek gaming is dead. Stick with Starfleet Command or Bridge Commander or Klingon Academy. Whatever, just don't line their pockets for this BS."},{"rating":"1","title":"sigh","review":"I have to agree, what irked me the most about this game are the controls.

Ship movement, very poor, you can't use the mouse or the arrow keys you move the mouse it move the camera but not the ship. Over all very poor.2. Game Play, ZERO depth. Your better off with Armada, Starfleet Command 3, or Bridge Commander3. Graphics, They are nice but to much in some cases, I would rather have seen a better interface and control set up then lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots and lots of nebulas, asteriods and such that have no impact on gameplay. In other words not many bells not enough whistles4. Sound, The sound is really the only possitive thing about this game. Good sound and voice overs.Over all AVOID! Money can be better spent elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Make sure you read and exceed the minimum hardware requirements","review":"My wife bought this game for our son, who loves Trek games.

It's a dumb, boring, old-fashioned arcade-style shooter. The guy who modeled the ships did a great job but everything else is next to worthless. I kept waiting for a patch to fix many of the most annoying problems and when they finally issued a patch, it too was worthless. Oh, the box art is nice so it makes for a nice shelf decoration but if your looking for a fun, engaging, re-playable, intelligent game, forget about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fail starship","review":"I had high hopes for this game. I really did. But like a Klingon BoP, it let me down at the worst possible time - all the time. The controls were terrible and to make it worse there is no way in game to change them, worse yet, it doesn't support joysticks. That's right, no pulling an 'Archer' and flying the NX-01 by the stick, nor any of the others either. The physics were horrible too. After failing a mission, I tried to plow the Enterprise into a planet, only to find that neither you, nor your foes could hit them, or anything else for that matter. There is little to no tactics to be found, it simply comes down to a slugfest and whoever has the largest ship wins.

EVER!All of the below comments regarding defects in the interface are true. The game is unplayable and also quite boring. You'd be better off taking the money and burning it. SHAME on the game producers who issued this undeniable piece of crap. They saw the chance to make a buck with a terrible product and ended up damaging not only my opinion of thier company, but of the Star Trek brand itself. I will never buy another product from Bethesda Softworks and I suggest you do not either. Also, I will think twice about any other Star Trek software product. NBC seems more interested in milking it for every penny possible rather than doing anything to maintain and improve the brand.Again, you'd be better off peeling off your own skin and bathing in alcohol than buying this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"another xbox 360 port.. :(","review":"Well.. just as the topic says.. It's a 360 port. You cannot change the key mappings without editing an XML file in the game directory. There is already a patch out for it because multi player doesn't work out of the box. 4 player (2 ship) limit on multiplayer mode (which has two modes, deathmatch and coop wave) The game runs OK I suppose, but there are little to few options for a PC game. I would have preferred they left this game as a 360 game only so at least that way it would have saved me the disappointment. Personally I wouldn't buy this game if I were you guys.. just look at a friend's copy and you'll see what I'm talking about. This game is a step below Bridge Commander (which wasn't all that great either). Maybe I'm just too much of a hardcore trekkie :("},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst - ever","review":"I can't think of anything positive to say about this piece of junk. I really was looking forward to it, but the controls suck, the mission play is unsavable and confusing, the bugs at frightening numbers ... it just sucks, period. The exact thing that shrinkwrap license laws were designed to foist off on us. If it weren't for them, it would be back at the store for a refund with warp speed.

Even though the box states only a 128 is needed, the game won't run unless you have very specific graphic cards. These requirements are not printed anywhere unless you call BETHESDA directly and go through thier technical help desk. I even bought a top-line AGP graphic card (512) and the game doesn't accept it. There are not many video cards that the game does accept so if you are lucky to already have one (then you are just lucky). If not, then you either have to convince the store you bought it from to refund your money or go pay $100 for a video card that is on thier compatable list. BETHESDA also REFUSES to refund anyone for thier products and as we all know, stores won't take back software that has already been opened."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game is awful","review":"This game wasn't professionally done at all.

I've never seen such poor planning in interface. It is loaded with bugs. I keep trying to play it, hoping I'll get my moneys worth; but you can't stand more than 15 minutes of it at a time.

When, as in music and other arts and Entertainment, games get real again(and MS goes under) I will be somewhat impressed at what is happening to PC games in general, this is a travesty of a once great gaming device. Thier is no graphics card worth this, no PC upgrade worth this, and stinky X-boxy controls limited to up, down and sideways.

On a recommendation, I purchased a 360 controller and soon after install and setup, the games graphics were VERY unstable (choppy video) as well as you cannot configure any of the controls at all. Overall, and of course this is my opinion, this game is a disappointment to the Trek franchise as a whole, were I have seen games like Starfleet Command Vol 1, 2 and even 3 be more enjoyable as a \\"spaceflight sim\\".
