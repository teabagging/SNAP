When something doesn't work, it can be quite hard to solve the problem because the error messages often don't a lot, if you get an error message at all.I must say: I would not want to miss the software, if only because it is the only speech recognition software that can process Dutch as far as I know, so I have to depend on it.

I cannot honestly say that any coffee is as good as home roasted coffee, but Coffee Masters is close. Almost all their flavors are good, this particular one is a favorite of our people especially when blended with a good Bolivian brew.

This unit also will not let you randomly play songs on multiple CD's. It will shuffle the songs on a single CD, but not shuffle between CD's.The video looked great, and the remote was not as bad as others have claimed.

The play/stop/rewind/forward buttons the ones used 90% of the time -- make the bloody things larger than the others and easy to find. The remote isn't backlit either, and to activate the buttons you've got to mash them ALL the way down.Changing discs is a pain, too. Sometimes it just doesn't want to, no matter what you do with the remote. Changing DVDs at the unit is maddening, too. I'd go into it, but I'd be writing all day.

The excellent French group Ensemble Gilles Binchois explore a very important moment in European music history: the emergence of polyphony. The so-called Ars Nova marks a radical departure from the monody of the gregorian chant. Arguably, polyphony is the cornerstone of European music. Even modern composers such as Nono, Berio and Boulez continue to be deeply influenced by the Ars Nova.This record provides early examples of polyphony in France, showing examples of the transition to the monody to one, two and then many simultaneous voices. Dominique Vellard, conductor of the ensemble, is a scholar-performer in medieval music, and works at the Center for Medieval Music in Paris. The performance and recordings are first-rate.

The book is not about religion, but about the criminal justice system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for Brutally Honest Introspection","review":"In this raw novel Tolstoy unleashes his strongest and most poignant social criticisms and displays his deep understanding of human nature. It's an uncomfortable read because of its piercing ability to dig through layers of self-deception and make readers face themselves with total honesty. Anyone who appreciates Arbinger Institute material, such as The Bonds that Make us Free and The Anatomy of Peace, should read this book.This doesn't quite achieve the power of other classics, such as Les Miserables, Uncle Tom's Cabin, War and Peace, and the Brothers Karamazov, but it definitely belongs in the same class.Tolstoy forces you to confront societal flaws, but some of his thinking in this novel smacks as unrealistically utopian. However, this makes for great discussion material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best acapella group I've heard!","review":"This is by far the best acapella group I've heard.

It is not the most entertaining movie in the world but it does seem to hold the students' attention well enough. The film reviews works by Lichtenstein, Warhol, and Thiebaud and provides quizzes throughout where they can guess which artist painted the picture based on style. It is a good way to begin to teach students how to recognize an artist's work by the way they paint. I used this movie for 4th grade. I think it would be good for middle school as well. The other good thing about this DVD is that there are no \\"questionable\\" points in the film (no nude artwork). It is very school appropriate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great expectations....

BUT several of the tracks here are re-edits, NOT exactly the original versions. That doesn't detract from the music as such, but a buyer should be aware of this fact. The re-edits include \\"Sevilla Nights\\" (an instrumental), \\"Gloria\\", and \\"Black Pot\\". They are not better or worse, just different.

The Multmedia Card is fine but the COBY is the biggest piece of garbage I have ever seen. One cannot get to see what you would like to, because of the lousy software in the COBY. It always defaults to their LAME pictures or it shows your pics on the Memory card in some ridiculous format. You cannot do anything with your pictures on the card. The interface is sooo cumbersome as to wonder what wrote it(certainly not a human). I am so frustrated with the COBY that I cannot see straight.

I figured maybe the apple was to big and I had the wrong settings. I adjusted over and over at least 3 different batches. Maybe 1/3 worked. Worse after the red insident it stopped working for any apple!

There's simply no comparison. The stories in this comic are silly, meaningless. The best that can be said is that the opening story has a decent puzzle inside, which ends with a bunch of malarky.One of the last stories in the book features a darkly bearded \\"superman double\\" and you get the impression that the illustrator was just being lazy and only wanted to draw super_men (one in blue, one in grey), and that a whole story was developed so that the illustrator could be lazy.meanwhile, spiderman stories had ironies, ethics, the 5th estate, cleverness, and many, many, many things to recommend them. this book had none of that.this book is totally forgettable.

This book is amazing!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The title is misleading...","review":"The title of this book would lead one to believe that the book focuses on the topic of sex. Unfortunately, there is only one sentence about sexual intercourse in the whole book and it is not very descriptive. There is a decent description of fertilization and a baby growing in the uterus but in terms of the act that got the baby to grow in the first place, there is very little. Also be sure that you are ready to talk about masturbation because there is more informaiton in the book about that than on intercourse. Overall, I was disappointed.

A much better choice for our family was \\"Amazing You\\" and \\"Changing You\\". We had mild differences with these texts, but they proved to be great discussion starters with the children. \\"What's the Big Secret\\" went too far across vital moral lines for us to even consider using as discussion material.

This is an excellent gaming system to start off with as well, since it is so strait forward. The game mechanic is simple, but allows for alot of depth and completeness depending on your tastes.Quite often in other game systems problems arise that are difficult to resolve with the rules, with Alternity Guide not only are the rules well organized and complete, the number of rule problems are minimal because of the efficent game mechanic and well written guide.If you are thinking about purchasing this Guide, it wouldn't be a mistake.

What makes their book insightful is the comparison between electricity and computers. They note that it took decades before the economic impact of electricity took hold and predict that it will take a few more years for computers to increase productivity exponentially. They make a strong case for the efficacy of community colleges. The authors rightly contend that these colleges are more important to our nation than Harvard. Community colleges will raise the skill levels of American workers just as high schools did at the turn of the century.

It's well written. It's easy to read. It's engaging and informative.Perhaps a bit too much focus on Zingerman's. (That may just be my perception, as they are located nearby.)

However, in this book, which he edited way back in 1977, he chose nine stories dealing -- some marginally --with time travel and, to be honest, I only found two or three of the stories that interesting.

Having traveled extensively throughout the world for many years, I have used many, many different travel guides and this is amongst the worst I have purchased."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of a Good Idea","review":"Although James Herbert's imagination is obviously a vivid one, his writing skills are second rate at best. I fail to see how he has gotten this far in his career with his blatant disregard for good storytelling.The basic idea of '48(a plague released by Hitler after WW2 kills off almost everybody except our intrepid hero and a few others) is scary enough to impress, but it loses its impact when coupled with Herbert's stilted prose."},{"rating":"1","title":"EXTREMELY predictable, with a climax that makes NO sense","review":"James Herbert has written some decent stories, but this is not one of them. He combines 2 or 3 subplots that are so random and out of left field that his attempts to tie them together at the end with the old \\"town with a very evil past\\" premise fail. Combine that with characters whose combined IQ can not be more than 50, and you have one disappointing read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ghosts of Sleath","review":"This book was one that I didn't think I would enjoy, Enjoy is perhaps the wrong word. I was held spell bound to the pages. James Herbert creates such an atmosphere that you feel you are actually in the story. I must say it had me looking up at every creak and groan my house made. It is a long time since I have felt quite so scared and I must admit that I did get scared. A book that holds you right to the finish and it is an unexpected ending. This book is an A grade thriller."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Gore of Sleath","review":"Here's the run down: You've got a emotionally compromised psychic investigator who has been sent to an intellectually compromised town.

There was an exceedingly large portion of icky violent scenes. And by ick, I mean things being ripped off, oozing down, cracking apart etc etc... Another con, would be the psychic-link romance quotient... Yeah, who'd a thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast paced sci-fiction Robin Cook with Koontz twist book","review":"I couldn't put this book down. It was good from the beginnig to the end. It had a virus which had attack the human race shortly after WW2 sent by Hitler to destroy the entire world. Only people with AB negative blood survived the rest died either short deaths or where made to roam the world to die a slow agonizing death, since their blood slowly cloted and they started loosing parts of themselves. The characters where A-la Dean Koontz. You felt for them and it had a great ending like. This book is an excellent book for reader of Sci-Fi and WW2 war books since you could feel yourself there if it had happened. Excellent writing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Prurient self indulgence","review":"I agree with the review on 13th February. There is a line between good descriptive horror writing and dwelling on the obscene sick details of a scene. Herbert crosses this line.

I'm often amazed when a movie is better than the books. And in this case the movie was far superior! In writing, in plot, and pacing, the movie outstrips the books in a way that the author probably finds offensive.Do not waste precious time on these novels, rent the movie instead. If you must read a suspense novel, particularly a british one, read a great one! I recommend anything by Phil Rickman who is phenomenal to say the very least."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book was a complete waste of money.","review":"Paper thin characters and mindless action fill this waste of paper and ink.

In general, I have enjoyed his books in the past, but this one was just plain boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Research Isn't Enough","review":"Herbert gets an extra star because he clearly spent a lot of time researching war time London. However, the good research wasn't nearly enough to save this novel. The premise of the book is that at the end of the second world war, the nazis released some kind of virus that wiped out most of the world population rather than admitting defeat. The problems are as follows:1. He used a noir-ish tone for his characters, but it wasn't well done and instead of stylish, it just came across as badly written.2. The constant action scenes were better suited to a bad film than a bad novel.3. The characters were cardboard cut-outs, and their actions in relation to each other made very little sense at all.Total summation: Skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A GREAT idea, but...","review":"Now, to me, there can be nothing cooler than the premise of this book. A few survivors of a world destroying disease fight off all sorts of dangers, including slow dying \\"Brownshirts\\" and the elements of destroyed London. The team mix is dripping with interesting potential in the way of plot twists and turns, however that goes nowhere. In fact, the whole book goes nowhere. The writing is so poor. And the plot is so good, but destroyed. Read the book if you don't believe me. I wish I had come up with the idea myself so I could've done this plot justice. Mr. Herbert had such a great idea and just let it slip away. Tsk, tsk..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Argh","review":"Good Lord, this book was terrible.

A bad book is the worst kind of thief."},{"rating":"1","title":"Idea Great, Execution Not","review":"Herbert really shot himself in the foot with this one. A fantastic premise ruined by boring characters, silly sub-plots, and inane observations.This book feels like something turned in to fulfill a contract. There is a chase scene that goes on....and on.....and on.....for something like 100 pages. And rather than creating supense, or concern for the characters dangerous predicament, you just wish they'd die and leave you alone.I won't ruin the plot for you, but just let me say that it's been a long time since I've read a book with so many inconsistencies and absurd solutions, not to mention the repeated use of 'deus ex machina' to save the day.If you worship at the shrine of premise, this may be worth a read. If you also need characters to care about, or even tolerate, give it a pass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Usual under-average Herbert-stuff","review":"I've nearly read everything by James Herbert, and I have to say he writes a lot of bad books. And a lot of average books. And some rare really good books. This one belongs in the middlefield.The story sounds interesting, but he doesn't make anything of it really. The war scenario is also useless. Even the title sounds sooo interesting, but in the end... well, is has some suspense, but it's pulp suspense with no real content.This is fast-read stuff. Okay, but time can be better spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"A New Herbert","review":"Unfortunately I was disappointed with this offering from the man who gave us classics such as \\"The Rats\\" and \\"The Survivor\\". The idea for the plot is not the most original ever concieved but still reasonably chilling. The descriptions of London were vivid and enjoyable but page after page of Sten clutching action became a little much. I would have also liked to discover a little more about the characters other than Hoke. At times they felt a little like five names running around London.

This book was encouraging in that it helped me see that it is possible for anyone to find their niche. The stories vary from people who fell into finding their niche by discovering a need, to people who had worked at something and decided to go out on their own. In some cases it happened without people realizing it. It also made me realize that I have to know myself, my limitations and understand what I would be up against and be prepared for it.

I've read several books about finding one's passion through work, etc. but this book is so concise -- the author has said in less than 100 pages what takes most authors 300+ pages to convey! The short stories inspired me too -- I could personally relate to parts of each one. The questions and checklists throughout the book are excellent tools and helped me think more clearly about what is good and bad about my current work situation. After reading this book, I have all kinds of ideas about how I can take my skills and some of the aspects of my current work that I really enjoy to identify *MY* niche!

I highly recommend this book for both laypersons and clinical professionals."},{"rating":"2","title":"new outlook","review":"I've found this new work to be invaluable in my medical practice. First, the book has been an informative and mind opening guide to relationships in their many forms and possibilities as I encounter them in an urban practice.

I'm 6' 220 lbs and can wear the hat comfortably, on him its really big. The microphone boom is not necessary and is an annoyance. We cut it out with a seam ripper and it worked well.

The blob on top sits on top of the head and has no functional purpose other than to make it top heavy. It seems durable, but it is not attractive. I don't know anything that could be done to it to modify it and make it better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Book, but with MBCA Focus","review":"I write mainly to note that the book focuses almost exclusively on the Model Business Corporation Act, with only occasional references to Deleware or other state law. If your course has a similar focus, then this is a solid book that progresses well and lets you test you knowledge along the way. But if your class, like mine, focuses mainly on Deleware law, this book will prove significantly less useful. The book will often state something generic like, Some states allow X and others do not. But it rarely specifies which states have adopted which approach."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very mediocre Brazilian music","review":"If you don't know anything about Brazilian music they might fool you. They are trying to do something cool, but they fail in the attempt because of the poor harmonic structure of their songs. The rhythms are OK, in the sense that the percussionists know what they are playing, but overall it is not very good music. At the end the album is not even cool, it's very mediocre. In Brazil they wouldn't get gigs. Maybe because they are from Europe they got this record contract.On the positive side, there are a couple of OK tunes, that have been remixed and sound much better, like Banda do Ile, but in the album they don't shine that much. I am sorry Banda Favela, nice try! Maybe in the next one..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"If you're looking for a real tour of the trail itself, this DVD is not it.

I opened the 2nd tote and noticed that it had WOLF GARTEN tags sewn on the top band...the first bag did not have any tags. One of the labels was sewn upside down. Maybe a petty observation, but to me, it indicated a lack of quality control. Basically, I did not care for the \\"made in China\\" bag, offered by a German company that makes garden tools.

However, the writing is really atrocious. Punctuation errors abound. The first half of the book is mostly interminable, boring, non-sensical conversation, which jumps around from subject to subject or is repetitive.

I have read most of the other books on Amazon regarding this topic and in each of them they provide very little in terms of how to be successful. Additionally once you finish the book, the author is more then willing to answer any questions you might have while providing a medium in which to further your knowledge in international trade (listserv).

The writing was all over the place. There were countless mistakes that the editors did not catch and the over all voice seemed too forced.

I didn't like how it jumped towards the end with the son getting hurt and how all of the sudden he was in the hospital ready to die.

He really help set up the stage for the misunderstanding that ocurred. It was great to see that as the booked moved on Todd was more thoughtfull of Christy's needs.

She should have dumped him! Being a good Christian does not mean being a doormat.I see that everyone else just loved this book. This makes me think that I am really not the target audience.

I was IN LOVE with this series from age 11-16, so when she came out with a new, \\"grown up\\" continuation, I couldn't wait. But by \\"grown up\\" I think this author still means under 18, because this just really isn't realistic to adult life. Christy hasn't changed. She's still a whiny teenager. The spiritual aspect seems way over forced much of the time as well, and makes it seem far from realistic. As a young teen, that's what I loved about it- it was a fairy tale. But now we've grown up, and this just seemed obnoxious and dumbed down. As a wife and mother, this just seemed far too immature. I'm so sorry, I wish I loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Amiga demo","review":"Let's make it short.This DVD is about bunch of amazing Amiga demo.

What I found is now my favorite show of all time. This english commedy has great writing that always has something new going on. The dialog is very intelligent as well as extremely funny. If anyone would rather watch Star Trek over this series I seriously question there ability to understand good entertainment. The four major characters are Lister (A slob of a man who happens to be the last living human male in the galaxy), Rimmer (Listers ex-commander now dead and displayed as a Hologram, best discribed as a smeghead), The Cat (A Humaniod creature that evolved from house cats and is still just as arrogant as any normal house cat), and Kryton (A android interduced in the second season who's logic is as funny as any joke the others could make).

I am a fan and I have her three previous studio albums but \\"Big\\" is better than all three of them combined.Her decision to collaborate with will.i.am was a smart move and I disagree with those reviewers who see this album as overproduced and a deliberate attempt to regain some of her commercial success. Not at all true - I think Macy just wanted to work with composers, musicians and producers who would complement her \\"old skool\\" and 70's funk rhythmic style and with Big, she has succeeded on this front.Macy's formula of combining old skool with neo soul and hip hop beats (a la Justin Timberlake) works very well. Each song is a story and Macy's voice has never been in finer form. Pick up this album and give it a listen from start to finish.

The sound quality is awesome, and the bass response is great (it has a definite thump, but it doesn't rattle everything in the house). The system is also very aesthetically appealing, and the metal trim on the front is sexy. The remote is definitely good, much better than comparable models from other brands (cough...Sony...cough) although the buttons are all the same shape and size.

I also use it as a stereo system for when I watch DVDs and play XBOX games.

There is a continuous fuzzy white noise during radio play and cd play too. It completely ruins what otherwise be a fine system. I have tried several cd's and then played them in another player for comparison and it is definitely the Panasonic's fault.

The sheaths are fantastic, way better than those cheap fake leather ones. It's a great sword for show, but is NOT in any way combat ready. I knew the limitations of this sword when I bought mine, so this is more just a warning for new sword buyers. In order for a sword to be truly combat ready (ie you can hit it against other swords, branches, etc) the sword needs to be full tang (meaning the blade is one solid piece of steel and runs the length of the handle and is secured normally by 1-3 pins. Avoid \\"rat-tail tang\\" because they snap easily.

They are so poor I can't imagine how you would be able to use them for any purpose. I also found that the battery life is too short and the image viewfinder doesn't match the actual image taken requiring you to mentally compensate.

The music retains the same hypnotic, entrancing, and energetic feel that is so characteristic of Delerium's style--But in \\"Chimera\\" it is presented in a much more accessible form. The songs on this album seem more directed and less rambling than those in previous works, and the music will probably appeal to a broader audience.

I find it odd that this album has gotten so many positive reviews here. I consider(ed) Delerium among my favorite artists due to the seemless intergration of electronica, ethereal vocals and hypnotic rhythms--all tied neatly together with a bit of an experimental sounding edge. Chimera has none of these qualities. After playing the CD for the first time, I kept hitting the 'next' button, desperately trying to find a track that didn't sound like a prefab pop tune crafted for airplay. No such luck. The bottom line is all the songs sound the same; all of which would be right at home on the CD of the latest MTV pop drone.

Delerium to me will forever be \\"Symbolism\\" and \\"Twilight Ritual\\". If you are new to Delerium and were expecting dark brilliant ambient, only to hear cheap top 40 dance music, DON'T buy \\"Chimera\\" (Unless if you do like top 40). Get ahold of their classic albums \\"Faces, Forms, and Illusions\\", \\"Morpheus\\", \\"Syrophenikan\\", \\"Stone Tower\\", and \\"Spiritual Archives\\", or get their \\"Best Of\\" sort of speak, \\"Archives 1 + 2\\". I can't totally dismiss \\"Karma\\", because I do like New Age/cross genre music, but I don't see why it's under the Delerium name (Between Fulber and Leeb, they have a million project names, why not one more?).

So i Purchased Chimera expecting to be amazed yet again, but much to my dismay, this cd absolutely had no personality. It was more pop, and more commerical sounding. The vocals did not measure up to previous releases, and i was crushed to say that Chimera is a total disapointment. This record, i am sure is a product of the record company getting their hands in and wanting to make a commerical hit cd, not a cd of quality, personality, or uniqueness..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formulaic","review":"This Delerium album HAS followed what has been a proven formula of using female vocalists to create an ambient dance-pop sound. The result on Chimera however is just that: formula. There is nothing new, nothing exciting left on this album. Several of Madonna's albums from the 90's (Bedtime Stories, for example) have touched many of the tones and movements on this album. As exciting and different as Semantic Spaces was, this album follows into mapped territory, contributing nothing but a watered down version of former Delerium sounds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!","review":"I have been a Delerium fan since Semantic Spaces came out and have been a fan ever since.

However, the more I listened, the more this album worked its way into my subconcious. I would find myself humming the tunes at work or in the car. Yes, it is a departure from some of their earlier efforts, but the point of artistic endeavors, music included , is evolution and change. I like that this album differs so much from previous endeavors. True, there are some misses on the album, the most notable being Forever After, but even then, the weakest song is still miles better than most other pop offered today. Once again, the strongest feature of Delirium, varied instrumentation and changing vocalists lends itself to what is ultimately a great album. The two standouts of this particular work are After All and Fallen."},{"rating":"2","title":"They did it again!","review":"After the masterpiece Poem, Chimera has the same problem Star Wars Phantom Menace had as a movie - with such high expectations how can one be satisfied? While this album is certainly different from other Delerium albums, Chimera has intensely beautiful moments all throughout the album. While their earlier album Karma \\"borrowed\\" from great bands as Dead Can Dance, Enigma, and Deep Forest, Chimera borrows from great (but different) bands such as Zero 7, Cockatu Twins, and Theivery Corporation. It is less earthy and more \\"downbeat\\" - music you listen to after the night at the club.

This CD just sits on a shelf collecting dust now. Balligomingo's CD sounds more like Delerium than this does.

A real shame...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bye Bye New Age -Hello 80's House Music","review":"What happened? Where are the world beats? Wheres the ambiance of their earlier work ?They been replaced by generic disco beats! If you wanna flashback to the 80's house/latin/disco era this is the disc. If you want new delerium try their clone balligomingo instead - at least they sound like delerium."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with Delerium's new direction","review":"This album as has been stated in other reviews lacks any sense of the darkness and mystery that previous albums were so rich in. Delerium is one of my favorite groups and I do not hestitate to purchase any album from groups I enjoy -- but I urge customers to sample some of this album's tracks before wasting money making this purchase. I found it a terrible departure from the relaxing sound I enjoyed most from this band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rhys & Leeb, how could you?","review":"I never thought I'd be so disappointed with a Delerium disc, especially one featuring the return of Rhys. What the hell happened? What happened to the mystique and emotion of Delerium? It's been replaced by bland, emotionless, irrelevant pop with throw-away lyrics and throw-away music. Everything I love about Delerium is gone on this one. Even a return of Kristy Thirsk, whose magical voice gave Flowers Become Screens life, couldn't salvage this wreck. It sounds exactly like one of those countless clones that jumped on the popularity of the Delerium-Enigma-esque music in the recent years. I'm really sad to say this, but since Karma things have been going steadily downhill, and I'm including Rhys's Conjure One CD (which was at least a bit better than this effort, or lack of thereof)."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a really great album save for some duds.","review":"These negative reviews are just a bunch of dirty laundry.Delerium's newest album \\"Chimera\\" is a very good album, in fact a great album.\\"Chimera\\" has a much lighter and more accessible sound in their music than any of their older albums did, even more so than \\"Poem\\" did from three years back.My favorite songs are the opening track \\"Love\\",\\"After All\\", and \\"Serenity\\".There are some duds like the throwaway \\"Touched\\" and \\"Run For It\\" which are worthy of passing by but overall, this album does not dissappoint. I can't say it ranks up there with \\"Karma\\" or \\"Semantic Spaces\\" but this album is nonetheless a very good album and worth buying.Top votes from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this?","review":"I really enjoy Delerium and have thoroughly enjoyed the solo project of Fuller (Conjure One). This cd however sounds like bad pop music. I can't say that the cd is entirely a waste there are a few songs that are very good. Other than that at time I am wondering what happened to this band that I liked. A bunch of different artist singing about love replaces the mystical sounds that kept you engaged to this other world sound on previous records. Some of the songs are so bad that they remind me of bad disco. It's a horrific experience for anyone expecting another good cd from Delerium. There are still three good songs on here though. So if you want to waste your money for very few good songs buy this. I can't say enough bad things about the cd, even if you like Poem this is nothing like it. They could find beter artist on American Idol and have a kid mix in a basement and sound 10x better. It just leaves me thinking what happened???"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wondering if this CD would make a passable Xmas present...","review":"Half-way in during the first track, I began scratching my head and wondering if what I was listening to, was indeed Delerium. I looked at the cover and indeed it was Chimera, Delerium. If I wanted to listen to pop I would have turned on the local radio.Delerium - in its early years, made the best style of beats - dark ambient electronica. What this CD is, is a direct opposite...the music actually gave me a head ache and I had too turn it off. And now I am pressed finding someone to give this CD away too.But as a continuing fan, I will not give up on Delerium."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chimera ~ Delerium","review":"Chimera is a stupendous album and is in my humble opinion on of the best albums ever. Leeb and Fulber have created a modern day master piece with amazing tracks such as truly and after all. For this album they also employed many outside muisicians and the end result is probably their best effort to date. This album is so good in so many ways, awesome vocals, incredible beats, sounds and vocal treatments and I feel that whetever word I use it still does not adequately praise it. Leeb has managed to gather som amazing vocalists and this is probably one of the best assembles of singers gathered on one album. I simply love it and I can not wait for Deleriums next album."},{"rating":"1","title":"skip this... go with the old Delerium","review":"I love Delerium... but I can't stand the new Delerium.

Older Delerium rocked, but this album sounded like so much other crap thats out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bit too mainstream...","review":"Chimera is definately a great album. Out of the 15 songs (13 + 2 songs on the bonus CD), I probably like about 10 of them. What I've always liked about Delerium is that their music has a bit of a dark-edge\\" to it. However this CD contains many mainstream/just-for-the-radio type songs. For any other artist, this CD would get 5 stars. However, Delerium gets rated a bit tougher because expectations are always high."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cold Beer and Crocodiles : A Bicycle Journey into Australia","review":"Having travelled through Australia a number of times by airplane, car, and train, I found the perpspective of a bicylist to be enlightening, funny, and exasperating.

He has lots of interesting adventures and gives detailed descriptions of the scenery.I wished he had given a little more info on what his circumstances were that led him to decide to do this trip (he wasn't an athlete or bicycle racer), and how it changed him after it was over. But overall it was a pretty good story about adventures with the people and places in Australia."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT DOWNLOAD ANYTHING FROM THIS ALBUM","review":"The tracks on this album are completely scrambled.

I expected it to be some kind of trading book that taught me about how one of the most famous traders of the last century developed and applied his technique like the Gann Line in the market, or something close to Reminiscences of a Stock Operator. However, this is a fiction of how somebody picking sentences here and there from the Bible, making propheses and earning bucks of gold in commodities markets.I have been a Baptist for half of my life and I study Bible intensely. I certainly would appreciate other traders to turn to Christ as their personal Savior. I just dont buy into that \\"Bible Code\\" type of stuff and take the Bible as a means of fortune telling for money making.Still I will read other Gann books in the future. However, I just cant recommend this as a trading book to anyone at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tunnel Thru the Air or Looking Back from 1940","review":"The book is very good. One must have an open mind when reading the book. It is sentimental upon the first reading and at the same time one can gather several significant points of market movements. During the second time one can pick up on more significant points that relate to the markets. I am particularly interested in FOREX and have found several applications along with my partner that is keen on the market. I plan to finish my second reading and continue to re-read it again.

The old addage is true--you get what you pay for. The picture was very distorted around the edges--big noticeable wavy lines. My retailer exchanged the set for a different one (same model) and it did exactly the same thing--very dissappointing for my first foray into HD. I went back for the Panasonic widescreen (also 30 inch) and LOVE that set. Do not waste your time with Samsung.

On the plus side, it looks great and has a wonderful remote which is very easy to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"CHEAP CHEAP CHEAP","review":"I have been researching HDTVs and I have to warn people that although Samsung has been very aggressive, their products are still cheap looking and the quality of the picture is inferior to the many established brands -- Sony, Panasonic, Zenith and Sharp. If you're looking at a HDTV purchase, forget Samsung and look hard at any of the brands I just mentioned. Don't be fooled by this company. They copy the better brands and cut corners to give you a cheaper performing product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Value","review":"I'm very pleased with my TXM3096HF. (I notice with some chagrin that the negative reviews listed for this model seem to be ACTUALLY for a different model, the TXM3097HF).My biggest gripe about the TXM3096HF is the annoying remote control requires far too much fiddling, particularly when selecting the source (one must cycle through the choices, there is no direct one-button access to a particular source).Being a movie fan, I really love the 16:9 aspect ratio and the hi-def picture.My previous TV was a top-of-the-line Sony-XBR.

He's only 4 so we didn't expect anything different. We also expected this hat to be big for him (although he does have a big head), but it is REALLY big. And on the hat or packaging itself it doesn't say anything about kids, but it seems to be an adult sized hat? Still fun and he can kind of wear it if he pushes it back a bit. Not sure if it's necessarily worth the money...but still a good purchase since he's definitely having fun with it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does adjust to fit even small children's head and trick is easy to do.","review":"I was happy that he hat did adjust with an elastic band around the head and my 3 year old could wear the hat with a good fit. However an adult could fit the hat to when the elastic is adjusted. When the hat is adjusted for a young child it looks mad hatterish as the top of the hat is still adult size. I did not realize from the photo how oversized the top of the hat would be. Great trick and easy for the kids to do. I would still recommend. Material is a shiny velour (thin velvet) type material."},{"rating":"2","title":"worth the $","review":"I ordered this hat for my 3 1/2 yr old son for their school Halloween party/parade. I was so glad I went with this costume as he were the only one wearing it! It was something convenient for him to put on and take off by himself while in class. The other great thing is that a few days later, I was able to wear it as well for my own Halloween gathering! This hat is well built and I can see it lasting for years and years to come. It's great that there's an elastic inside that makes it adjustable and the bunny is indeed a cute addition and gives it more character! It may be pricier than other magician hats out there but in my opinion, it was worth the extra money given the quality of this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's magic!","review":"I really liked the magic hat ,very good quality and I'm sure my grandson Nathan with have hours of magic fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Cheaply Made","review":"I originally bought this to use the clothing on a different doll.

Even though most learners believe that speaking is more useful - and there is some vanity involved in it - it's actually writing that takes precedence in today's connected world. Most business communications today are done through email, and no one wants the recipient to have a laugh at their expense.Grammar, punctuation and vocabulary are important, for sure, but once you have mastered those, why not spend a few more hours dedicated to polishing a bit your written English? With just 160 pages, you get tips that will make your writing look formal, but not stilted; correct, but not pretentious. You may even have a laugh or two with the entries."},{"rating":"2","title":"A god is born but his memory is gone","review":"This book tells the tale of a god who is born with no memory. He slowly regains it as the book progresses. A evil godess is working against him, trying to become the only diety by manipulating him.This is the first fantasy book I've read by A. E. van Vogt. It has the same fast pacing as his other books and nearly constant revelatios, as well as numerous setbacks for the hero. I rather enjoyed it. Maybe it isn't a classic, but it is worth a read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice working tuners","review":"I bought these for my Epiphone Dot and they were a drop in replacement.

Instead, they've substituted something that is far worse for blood sugar than table sugar."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious for a low carb sweet craving!","review":"This was easy to prepare and tasted great!

I'm even considering getting a tatoo of a quote from one of their songs.

My friends and I ended up hanging out with the band members while the other three opening bands were playing. The guys are really cool, and really fun. And this CD, even though it's short, is a great CD. Temper, Temper and Green Eyes Don't Lie are my favourite tracks. But, they're all awesome.

Unfortunately, it is exactly the opposite. Aside from the funny scene involving the Colonel, I didn't see much humor. Mainly this movie revolves around the serious (not funny) topics of neglect, racism, and self-worth. At first I thought that maybe I just wasn't getting the Czech type of humor, but by the end I was thoroughly depressed.

Really it's not Savoy Brown. This is a project album which was most likely recorded under the SB banner due to record company contracts.

Surprisingly the rest of the album is dominated by Anderson who wrote and sings five of the nine songs and arguably the three best cuts.

Their motivation for doing so was practical rather than ideological. They don't pretend to tell you how to teach your own children - just how they managed to teach theirs.The only drawback is that some of the references are out of date - the Colfaxes taught their children in the 70's and 80's. However good sense (I don't say common, because I don't believe it is) will lead interested readers to updated references: Enyclopedias on CD-Rom rather than in book form, for example.A great book for intelligent parents who suspect that they can teach their child(ren) more effectively than any overworked and underappreciated teacher can."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book convinced me give homeschooling a shot.","review":"This book was highly recommended to me.

The narrative at the beginning of the book (about the authors' experience in homeschooling) is thought-provoking for those who are considering homeschooling their children. The parts of the book that I would have found most useful were the references to materials for teaching reading, writing, arithmatic, and science at home. The book was written in the 80s and a lot of the materials it references are from the 70s or earlier and were mostly out of print."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"I threw away my copy after reading it.

The color and resolution are excellent. I feel the sound is quite good as well. My only complaint is that there is a geomtric defect with the flat screen.

You'll be waiting all day. They claim that it can clean most heavy scratches in 10 minutes or less. But it's more like 45 minutes or more.I'm also very disappointed in the final finish it leaves on the discs. It's terrible. It leaves a swirl pattern of light scratches. I thought it was because of dirty polishing fluid or pads, so I replaced everything, but the scratches still show up.Also, after only 1 week of having it, one of the shafts that holds one of the buffing pads broke. It cost me 35 dollars to replace.I don't recommend this machine. Especially considering its price. For $350 it should do a much better job than it does."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aleratec Disc Repair system","review":"Very disappointed with this unit. It is extremely messy to use, the liquid goes all over the place - not a lot of thought put into conserving consumables. Worst of all is the finish.

Instead it just puts up an error message \\"Bad Disk\\". This is a real store-bought copy of Gladiator, not a copy or home-burnt DVD. There are no visible scratches on the disk and it plays fine in other DVD players (including a Toshiba combo DVD/TV player I have.)Tech support from Toshiba has been less than helpful.

Otherwise, this movie is not worth the money or time it took for me to force myself to finish watching it. Very poorly filmed also.

In this age of fast living and hustle and bustle, this book is a superb gentle reminder of easy living and what life is all about.

Ulmer, coducted by Peter Bogdonavitch. I also found a short history of B films to be of value. What I didn't feel was necessary was a section which was a reprint of 1944 industry statistics (yearly attendance, profits, etc.), something which is interesting, but seemed to be little more than filler.

Her character is the epitome of cool, and worth the price of the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Precious","review":"What a wonderful film--cut and paste formula pabulum built on calcified romantic cliches, listless acting, poor TV sitcom humor and a directorial clumsiness that would make Gary Marshall wince. Drew Barrymore is so cute she makes the Teletubbies seem like festering chancre sores. And she's so clever she chooses a script with the worst aspects of an old Shakespeare plot cross-bred with Cameron Crowe. You might think that the youth of America could find a better person to idolize than a cynical Hollywood insider who obviously has very little respect for the fans who paid for her houses in Malibu and Beverly Hills. Then again, you might not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chick Flick at its Worst","review":"Having just spent one of my valuable evenings suffering this in order to show just how much I love my wife, I cannot think of one good thing to say about this movie. The characters were thin, the acting woody and the humour predictable and childish. As for the plot... what plot? There simply wasn't any storyline worthy of the name. I suffered and cringed throughout and cheered when it finished (because it finished, that is). I hated it.My wife? She sat riveted, cried her eyes out at the sloppy ending and absolutely loved it.If there ever was a movie that explained the phenomenon of the \\"Chick Flick\\", this is it."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most boring and stupid movies","review":"It's just a waist of time.The plot is obvious from the very beginning, the action (what action???) is one of the slowest ever, characters are so exaggerated that they are unrealistic in anything they do, and the movie itself gives a wrong impression that american teenagers are just a bunch of silly girls and stupid guys.DO NOT WATCH THIS. IT'S ONE OF THE WORST MOVIES EVER."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun movie","review":"Drew Barrymore plays Josie Gellar, an undercover reporter for the Sun Times, researching high school students. As she desperately tries to fit in with the impossibly snobby in- crowd at school, she remembers how horrible her own high school experience was. A touching story, a little unbelievable at times, but a fun movie all in all. My heart almost broke when she was remembering her high school prom. Molly Shannon is terrific in this movie. David Arquette, surprisingly, was pretty good in this movie! I recommend this movie if you're looking to watch a light, funny movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Been More Kissable","review":"The Teen Movie is an intricate part of teenage culture. Never Been Kissed definately joins the ranks of \\"The Breakfast Club\\" and \\" Ferris Beuller's Day Off\\". Drew Barrymore plays the part of Josie without pretention. She is wonderfully effervescent and absolutely hilarious.The plot may be slightly cliche, but it is so well done that it is not even a factor.There are numerous parts in the movis that do ring true about the politics of High School,and it looks at the whole experience with much humour.So,if you are looking for a no-brainer that will have you laughing till it hurts, this is the movie.PS. Who is that gorgeous TEACHER (lucky Drew)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"This is a completely ridiculous and unrealistic movie. Josie, at 25, is still not over the fact that she was unpopular in high school, and whines for the entire movie. It's unclear why any one likes her, espesially her teacher. It's also hard to get over the fact that the teacher, beleiving that she is in high school, makes no attempt to hide his feelings. The final scenes tie nothing together and the issue of her betrail is not delt with. Never Been Kissed isn't good as a silly unbeleivable comedy; it's both painful to watch and devoid of any redeaming qualities in its content."},{"rating":"2","title":"Film snobs, stay away","review":"Otherwise, this is a good movie to watch. The storyline is a tad trite and predictable, but it's nevertheless cute and full of heart. The performances are all good -- Drew Barrymore, who would not be the first person in mind to play a former geek, pulls it off with surprising honesty and makes us utterly sympathetic to her character. David Arquette is quite funny as her younger, cooler brother. And Michael Vartan does a great job making us see the teacher's inner conflict about feeling attracted to a student (and, yeah, he's really hot). Basically, if you're looking for a fun way to pass an hour and a half, this is the way to do it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Generation \\"X\\" At It's Best!","review":"Lately, Hollywood has been making some cheesy, shallow teen flicks with no meaning or depth. But, \\"Never Been Kissed\\" is different. Much different. Josie had a really bad high school experience (and when I say bad I mean my heart sinks every time I think about it). But, now she gets a chance to go back and redeem herself...undercover for a big city newspaper. Needless to say, she goes back and the result is an excellent, funny, and heartfelt film that will sure stick with you!

(though, in confidence, i must say that it made me a wee bit uncomfortable that on this fragile earth of ours there might exist a smoldering, older high school teacher with blue eyes cast upon an innocent student.) all in all, it was a pleasurable experience that i would not trade for the world!i wasn't kidding about those slipper socks..."},{"rating":"1","title":"an okay movie at best","review":"sure this movie was cute, but it must have been one of the dumbest films I've ever seen.

Drew Barrymore has once again proven that she can't act. I'm sorry, I don't care if she's adorable, that doesn't mean she can act. The movie, like most teen movies, was filled to the brim with cliches, bad writing, and horrible acting.

Please, keep Drew Barrymore off the big screen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossibly LAME","review":"The movie starts as if there is something going to happen but nothing actually happens for the first hour.

The main character dreams of becoming a journalist and one day she gets the opportunity to go undercover at a local high school and report on what's going on with modern teenagers in America.She is HORRIBLY unprepared for this assignment! Despite the fact that she's undercover, she uses her REAL NAME! She also failed to develop a cover story and was forced to make one up on the spot when one of her teachers told her to tell the class something about herself. She did a HORRIBLE job of improvising a cover story and the whole movie is just one awkward, humiliating situation after another.The only really likeable characters in the whole movie are some teenage math nerds that call themselves the denominators.Seriously, do NOT waste your time with this movie! 99% of it is PAINFUL to watch and the other 1% doesn't make up for the pain."},{"rating":"2","title":"set back eat popcorn and enjoy a great movie","review":"this movie is great! it has a great polt buy it it is worth it"},{"rating":"2","title":"So sweet","review":"This movie is so sweet.

A former nerd is forced to go back to highschool as an undercover reporter and relive the traumas of her youth. Predictably, she discovers more about herself than she does about any story and along the way she finds love in a most unexpected place. This movie isn't too deep or that thought provoking, but it is a modern day 'fairy tale' with a happy ending that will leave you feeling good. Recommended for anyone that enjoys romantic comedies and a positive, feel-good movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Interesting.","review":"This wasn't one of the best films that I've seen.

I actually give this film 2.5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"i had a like-hate relationship with this movie","review":"this movie to me is giving out messages about how society treats misfits. What is wrong with never being kissed? They make it out to be a really bad thing and the high school kids seem really rude, kids at that age aren't always like that though at times they can be cruel.

Otherwise, run screaming from this horrible, horrible movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never Been Kissed","review":"I have never been a huge Drew Barrymore fan, but this movie changed my opinion of her somewhat. She plays Josie Gellar a painfully shy editor for the Chicago Sun Times, and through a comedy of errors, ends up being appointed as an undercover reporter at a local high school. This film switches back and forth between the past and present as we see Josie try to fit in with the students. She was shy and tortured by her peers the first time around which left her with some pretty deep scars. As she comes to terms with her life from the past and present, her biggest story ends up being of that struggle."},{"rating":"2","title":"VERY NICE!","review":"I've never not liked Drew. Cute story that most can relate to with the high school experiences and has a great surprise ending."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much cultural studies","review":"I disagree with the other reviewer who praised this book for, among other things, its historical accuracy. This book has no claims to contribute to historical studies at all. It is a work in cultural studies, and shows all of the characteristics of that genre - obscure language, complex theories, loose historical claims, and a confusion between fictional and non-fictional sources. Obviously the analysis of fiction and non-fiction, together, is essential to the argument of the author, but as no attempt at historical or even literary context is attempted, one is left with a series of under-argued observations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Insubstantial...","review":"This is the worst example of cultural studies. The book is full of vague, insubstantiated claims, tenuous theoretical and historical connections, sweeping generalizations, and marred by a fatal lack of basic organization. Cultural studies doesn't have to be this simplistic and thin. Each chapter reads like a series of promises (\\"I will deal with this issue later in this chapter\\") that remain unfulfilled, as though the writer couldn't actually deliver on the task of real analysis, but can only give vague and hollow summary. Avoid it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very poor quality.","review":"This video is poor quality. No instruction given. Instructor is shaky in balancing postures. Sequence is correct but timing is bad.

I saw the first one and thought it was alright. The second wasn't very good. Bloody Mary for me was very enjoyable. The movie brought something knew to the table. The title \\"Urban Legend: Bloody Mary\\" is a mystery to me of why it was chosen. This movie is very much unlike the others and the creators probaly just put Urban Legend in the title to bring more attention towards it. The deaths in the movie are very cool and the acting is not too bad either. The story was somewhat predictable but kept me watching. Overall a good straight to video movie and for how cheap it is, I'd reccomend you buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Power to the people?","review":"Haha, this movie was a joke right?! OK, if not it's pretty darn foolish. You have the dead looking for revenge thing and it just doesn't work.

I'd recommend Dead Mary instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloody Awful","review":"Terrible, just terrible.

My main problem, and it may be a spoiler, why kill the dog????? I'm all for killing the murderers, and even the descendents of murderers, but why the dog....come on, unless you get killed by a pet, in which case all bets are off. Lay off the innocent pets though, otherwise, you are killing off more innocent people than yourself in \\"revenge\\". I spent the rest of the time saying \\"what a bitch\\" even though she deserved massive sympathy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable, Spooky, and Great Twists","review":"The first two entries in this series are plain slasher fare. This film is a very fun, and well written, supernatural piece, which is where it differs from the first two films.It has some red herrings, that lead you to think one thing, but the ending is quite fun actually.The Audio is very good 5.1 ( as opposed to some trashy 2.0 surround).A Very good watch, with a nice featurette on the DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloody No Good.....","review":"This movie is by far the worse of the Urban Legends movies. This is another movie I purchased without renting it first. Had I rented it first, I would not have bought this movie even though I did save money by buying it previously viewed. A group of high school friends start talking about the legend of Bloody Mary. Chanting her name will make her rise from the dead! Oh Boy. The whole movie boils down to the fact that Mary was murdered many years ago and her body put away where no one would ever find it. When Mary comes back to life, she seeks revenge on fellow classmates and kills them off. Not a good horror movie. No gore, no suspense. I would definetly recommend anyone rent this movie before buying it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dumb movie","review":"This movie has nothing to do with the original Bloody Mary story, it had nothing to do with saying her name in the mirror, and when you say her name three times she doesn't kill you, but kills the children of the people that killed her.Well, the movie starts out 3 girls at a slumber party telling the story of Bloody Marry. Later one girl says Bloody Marry 3 times just joking around and awakens the spirt of Bloody Marry.Soon after she said Bloody Marry 3 times, day after day the childern of the people that killed her start dieing. One girl died by poping a huge zit and hundreds of bugs start pouring out of the zit!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloody Boring","review":"Another movie in a stream of bad horror films that are being recently released (see most any Lion's Gate film).Acting wasn't too bad, but the story has already been done in other movies so many times (revenge for the ghost, find ghost resting place, etc.)And why do nice people become evil when they become ghosts, just wierd. Bloody Mary gives a nice \\"thank you\\" smile to the main character for helping her at the end, but I'm sure the main character hates her guts and would never accept the smile, could have been a good scene (argument with ghost, etc.)oh well, rent if you just want a hokey movie to make fun of with a group of freinds on movie night. Otherwise, run, run, run."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get caught up on laundry or wash your car.

I didn't expect much from this film, but even considering that, I can't express what a complete waste of time watching this was. It kinda reminds you of Prom Night II Hello Mary Lou in a few storyline aspects, along with a couple of other films. Nice job on the camera angles at the girl's slumber party, I'll say that much for it. Do yourself a favor and get caught up on something else, anything other than watching this piece of garbage.

This was a major disapointment for me.Mexico's map is much like Canada's. One tiny page for the whole country.

But the real insult is that Anytime crashes when attempting to import either the exported Organizer Contacts or Events information. It's fairly clear the \\"seamless\\" operation was never tested before releasing the product.Extended e-mail conversations with Anytime support proved less than helpful.

In the meantime, David Halberstam's _October 1964_ is a far more satisfying look at Lou Brock, and you get the remainder of the Yankees and Cardinals as a bonus!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought the book wasn't that interesting","review":"I felt that the writer could have done more with the characters and storyline of the book. I also did not like the way the chapter's were split up into the character's thoughts instead of flowing together. It took me a while to finish the book because no part really gripped me. I just finished it to find out what happened in the end although I should've just read the last chapters. I honestly don't think this book was worth the time I spent to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"????","review":"This was not a thick book but for some reason it took me several weeks to complete. One of the reasons I did complete this book is because I try to finish what I begin... I felt the author was trying to write like the voice of a man.. Many times during the story I found myself wondering do men really talk like that? Perhaps they do? There was not much of a plot and over all it was not a terrible book,just not all that exciting... I love to read but this was not one of the best books that I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"This book made me sick to my stomach. How a woman like Sandy could be so dumb & desperate is beyond me. What sane woman would put up with this type of junk? The characters were not well developed & the ending was dumb. Sandy should have dumped T.J. & kept rolling. But no, her desperate behind just had to anything just to keep a man in her corner."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good Read","review":"This book was pretty good. I just wanted to tell Sandy to stop being so stuffy. I was glad when she finally stuck up for herself. As for T.J., he was just too stuck on himself. I couldn't believe how he tried to rationalize what he did. Now, Speed was a trip and needed to stop trying to be young and stop encouraging his son (TJ) to be a player. He was funny, though. Bebe was a pretty down to earth person. I just wished the author had given her character more structure (for lack of a better word) so that we can see more of her as opposed to seeing her as a support system for Sandy. I do applaude her for going back to school. It is never too late to educate yourself. All in all, I will definitely recommend this book for its spurts of drama and funny scenes."},{"rating":"2","title":"The \\"BOMB\\" Baby","review":"A friend of mine told me this was a must get book.

I will definitley be looking for other books by her."},{"rating":"2","title":"He Say, She Say was an enjoyable reading experience.","review":"The characters are full-bodied and real. This book is a real gem because it mirrors life and relationships. Most people, just as these characters, travel through life hoping and believing --- Sandy looking for love; T.J. looking for success and fearful of real feelings; Bebe looking for a promotion and a good hairdresser; and Speed desperately trying to hold on to his \\"player's card\\", which should have been revoked twenty years earlier. Even with these different goals and fears, the friendship and love between the characters shine through. Now, this is a true \\"African-American\\" experience. Most readers will recognize at least one or two of these characters as friends, foes or associates. You do know them - they are just that comfortable. I could not put the book down---such a delight. I told all my friends to read it and the feedback has been wonderful. Thank you, Ms. Yolanda Joe -- can't wait to read your next book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Say What?","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. The characters were poorly developed and childish.

It's full of intricacies, formulas, and complexities that most people have a hard time getting a full grasp of what they are trying to accomplish with technical analysis.Mr. Kaufman does an excellent job of bringing this subject to the reader in a digestible form. As the author of three financial books I can attest to the difficulty of separating the art from the science of technical analysis. In \\"Futures For Small Speculators\\" I only bring it up briefly. In this respect Mr. Kaufman shines and exceeds my communication abilities.This is a great start into the world of Technical Analysis without having to be overwhelmed by mathematics.I definitely recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Entry Point to Technical Trading","review":"I've read a decent amount of books, and articles describing various technical strategies and how to use them. I am no expert on them and use them as one tool among others as a way to make investment decisions. This book is clearer and easier to understand than most. Technical analysis can seem silly for many people until you truly get it. This book demystifies things a bit. One definite drawback though is the editing is quite poor. There are numerous mistakes referencing wrong prices, and charts which sometimes made me wonder if I was looking at what the author was writing about. If not for that issue I may have given it 5 stars as the book is what is says it is and does it quite well."},{"rating":"1","title":"The complexity of the book hides the simplicity of XPath","review":"O'Reilly books are usually a good choice for a professional to learn a concept in an effective way. However, this book is an exception. If you think XPath looks difficult, it is just because this book makes it _seem_ difficult. Read the official W3C specifikation instead and you will see how simple XPath really is.The book incorporates a lot of discussions about XPath but they really get in the way of XPath, beeing presented the way they are. It would have been more effective if the book explained XPath just by including the 30 pages of XPath specification, and instead focused not on explaing, but on discussing aspects.My main point is that you learn to use, as well as master, XPath an order of magnitude faster by reading the specification than by reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"more than just a survivor","review":"Mira lived to tell the tale of the holocaust. She's carried the message of strength and forgiveness, of working through the horrors she's lived by bringing the message to all who will listen. This is a strange and different book: on the one hand, so repulsive, so unbelievable, yet, on the other hand, compelling. Several questions ran through my mind: how does a person continue to live with any humanity at all after such an experience; why does one person live, while all the rest die; what kind of magnetism did Mira have that encouraged people to help her?I've met Mira; she lives here in my home town of Oak Ridge. She will speak before my class. Perhaps my questons will be answered, and I will know who Mira is after all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Global Media: The Missionaries of Global Capitalism","review":"This is your typical left wing anti-capitalist drivel.

Both books end in eerily the same way. Speaking of eerie, My Fair Lord has something that The Proposition didn't: Ghosts, for all the good it did this story. For most of this book, it seems that the writer can't decide if she wants to write a ghost story or a romance. Since the romance in this story is dull and predictable, the ghosts could have been used more effectively. They weren't.The heroine, Caroline, like Winnie in the Proposition, is just THERE, things happen to her, but she doesn't have much spark. Both heroines were, to be blunt, saps. Where the two books again diverge is in the hero: Nick of The Proposition was a fabulous leading man--fun-loving, charming, and knee-buckling, heart-poundingly masculine. Lucas seemed to be a very pale imitation of Nick.This book could have been so much better; being released so soon after The Proposition only makes its faults more glaring."},{"rating":"2","title":"I may be the only liberal who loves this book","review":"Either you love it or you don't, just wanted to say that the shipping was faster than the speed of light and the book was in fantastic condition."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Gum Works For Me!","review":"I brought this gum at Walmarts and when I chew 2 pieces it has me so hyped and full of energy but 2 teen boys notices the difference right away.

I also believe that this unit and the Emerson unit are actually manufactured by the Funai corporation.The remote control feels very cheap and has to be pointed directly at the unit to function. Also, the remote is overly large and is very uncomfortable to hold and operate as the buttons are small and placed in odd locations.Overall the unit itself seems to operate well and has played both DVD's and VHS tapes without difficulty.

I'm no expert on the technical aspects, but the vhs and dvd players work just fine for me. This is a very inexpensive system to purchase, however, the quality is top notch...and offers all the bells and whistles of a more expensive system. Extremely easy to install. The remote is not complicated...a 10 year old could operate it. And, another reviewer for this model is incorrect, you can adjust the tracking on vhs tapes...simply read the manual...it's very easy.

Those who have seen them live will attest to the truth of this statement. The Replacements' live shows were always raucous affairs, even when their recorded material took a more subdued turn in the twilight of their career.The Replacements were an outstanding band for a number of reasons.

The edition was that published in 1982 by Mc Graw-Hill (1-st edition). At that time this was a hard subject to master but this book helped me a lot in clarifying many abstract quantum mechanical concepts during the preapration of my final examination. After several years I saw in a bookshop the paperback edition published by Dover and I bought it immediately. After re-opening it after so many years, I realized how good and well written this book was, especially its introduction of the Hartree-Fock method and the mathematical derivation of the Roothan-Hall equations. In my opinion, chapter 3 remains the best ever introduction on the HF-MO theory. The remaining chapters are, nowaday, a bit outdated but some useful appendices have been added. Considering both its content and price, I give it five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Forgotten Music","review":"Alan Gowen was a brilliant composer and keyboard player who had a knack for writting music that drew from the tradional Canterbury sounds and jazz and classical tradions.

More government control, check; restrictions on free speech, check; higher taxes and fees, check; a sop to the environmentalists, check. He's writing about turning us into a socialist state, period. We already have a byzantine regulatory structure and it's just getting worse. There is a difference between effective regulation and a plethora of regulations. He's no different than Karl Marx and just as wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read for anyone dealing with large companies","review":"I have provided many friends and business associates with this book. I read it several years ago and it covers the actions of large corporations. Having dealt with large automotive companies for over 45 years I found this book very interesting as it explained why large corporations do what they do. It will not make you happy but it will give you great information and understanding about how corporations think and make decisions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye opening analysis of the things we take for granted","review":"I don't accept greedy, lying, overly self boosting, or violent behaviour from my friends. Well, not from any living person actually. So why should I accept that very same behaviour from an institutional person, a corporation?Bakan's analysis of the corporation as an societal institution is clever, clear and very revealing. It is not be confused with much easier to dissmiss nay sayers and anti globalisation writers. This is a sober analysis of an institution we don't normally question on this level."},{"rating":"2","title":"spanked","review":"Although their masterpiece is \\"Fontanelle\\", this certainly contains enough vicious attacks on the eardrums, estrogen, and twisted melodies (?) to satisfy one's appetite. Highly recommended. Get it now before it goes out of stock (again!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"raw and unnerving","review":"This is the Babes' debut album,and the name right away gets you interested.\\"Spanking Machine\\" has some great songs on there,such as \\"Swamp Pussy\\",\\"You're Right\\",\\"Dust Cake Boy\\",and my absolute favorite,\\"Lashes\\". the lyrics (when you can understand them,or,like I do,look them up online),are so deep and poetic and personal.Kat's angry,hurt yowl and soft,babydoll whisper are a fantastic mixture of what makes Kat Kat.This CD is hard to listen to at first,since I was used to the more melodic \\"Fontanelle,\\" but it has grown on me. it is so complex yet primitive,groundbreaking yet stereotypically punk.I also recommend \\"Fair is Foul and Foul is Fair,\\" the latest compilation of Babes material.It has several demos of many songs on \\"Spanking Machine\\". I highly recommend this album!!\\"I see you grew into that stiff grey suit they've sewn for you/scrubbed you clean now you forgot what you mean\\"-Kat Bjelland on \\"Lashes\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A Misnomer","review":"This is not a book on Multicultural Psychology but a book about prejudice and discrimination. The title is a misnomer in that interpersonal relations among different ethnic groups are not addressed. What is addressed is prejudice in a far ranging scope that leaves little to the imagination as to its source. It neglects important topics, such as, how do relations among the ethnic diversities in America affect acculturation processes and strategies or even prejudice. The book presents prejudice as a one way street and makes several general statements, which appear to be the author's opinion, with no empirical support. The author indicates that the world judges people based on European American values as if ethnocentricism wasn't part of every culture. If you want some resources on prejudice and discrimination, you will find many in this book. However, it will require a careful critical reading to determine which of the author's interpretations are consistent with the data."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good content, terrible editing","review":"I am currently reading this book for a Masters class in Psychology and although I am enjoying the content of the book and find it to be quite interesting, I am completely put off by how many errors there are throughout the text! It is kind of unforgivable to publish a book, especially one that is used as a scholarly source, to be filled with so many errors. I will not share detailed examples due to copyright laws but if you take a look at page 47 at the end of the first paragraph the author mistakenly writes \\"that\\" when the correct word should have been \\"than\\". This was probably the 10th error that I had come across in only 47 pages! I do not understand HOW these errors were not corrected. All in all, I am disappointed in how the book has been put together and feel that it loses credibility when words are incorrect throughout the text."},{"rating":"1","title":"I bought it for class","review":"I don't really like this textbook, the first chapter is all opinion and has a bias that I find offensive that feels closed minded."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot of common sense","review":"This book is ok, but a lot of the points made are obvious to anyone who has given serious thought to moving, working, and living overseas in today's world. The more critical issues that one faces are given only superficial attention, and a constant pitch for the \\"companion book\\" (not included) for elaboration. Why not include it all in one book?On the plus side, chapter 7 gives some decent detail into the mechanisms behind culture shock that may keep you sane if you are having a tough time overseas.

But there's a pretty ugly error on page 35, under DTD's, in which a chart displays ?, *, and + and states that they all mean the same thing - 'Permits zero or one of the element'. WOOPS. I own several other 'In a Nutshell' books (and love them all), but this is the first one in which I've found such a glaring error! Ack! Unfortunately, you gotta lose a star for blowing such a basic chart..."},{"rating":"2","title":"XML in a Nutshell","review":"This is a well-written reference on XML 1.1. Slightly over half the book is tutorial in nature, while the remainder of the book is reference material (on XML, Schemas, XPath, XSLT, DOM, SAX, and character sets). The explanations were clear and the reference portion quite complete. I recommend this book as a good reference on XML."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth every penny...","review":"An excellent book worth every penny I paid for it. However, I do find it strange the authors covered a topic such as XSL-FO, for which support is almost non-existent, while ignoring schemas, for which there is wide support. Other than the schema issue, this is a very fine book with clear and concise writing with an excellent recipe for Southern Corn Bread."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, compact book","review":"My compliment for the excellent XIAN 2nd edition. I really like the short format of this book. A lot of information and clearexamples without much clutter in a few pages. Well done!Personally, I wouldn't mind if the reference section (part IV) would be taken out. These are easilly available from the WEB, and I prefer references in electronic format anyway, because I will always have them at hand (everything that I need is on my laptop), and they can easilly be searched. It would make the book a somewhat lighter in appearance."},{"rating":"1","title":"The type of book you shouldn't buy.","review":"The text of this book is decent, but this is simply reprinting standards with some examples thrown in as frosting. This is the type of stuff you can download from the W3 web site. Added to which, the XML standards are still a work in progress, so linking to the W3 site is a better way to stay current with these technologies than a printed book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but many Mistakes","review":"Good explanations and examples but download all of the verified and unverified errata off of [the web] to save yourself some pain.

However if you buy any nutshell book and more specifically the \\"XML in a nutshell\\" book with the intention of learning XML from scratch, then you will be disappointed. This book is meant to be a pocket reference for those who know XML and don't want a huge book on their desk.This book scratches the surface of several XML topics like DTDs,XLink,XPointer,DOM,SAX,CSS etc, but doesn't explore any subject in detail. However one glaring omission is XML schema.If you are a techie trying to learn XML or an experienced professional looking to enhance your understanding of XML and the related technologies, then Professional XML from Wrox press is a much better bet of your money.Overall the most useful section of this book is the reference section at the end and is well worth the money if what you want is a good reference book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful reference","review":"The Nutshell series of books from O'Reilly have a special section of my desk established for them; no other set of books condenses so much information for reference. This book is no exception to this fact.Before I continue, please avoid buying an O'Reilly Nutshell book expecting it to teach you about the topic it is intended for. As far as I've worked with them, these books are not intended as a do-all be-all that other references want to be. The information introducing you to XML is sparse, so if you don't know anything about XML, get another book. I recommend XML: A Primer by Simon St. Laurent; it is an excellent learning tool, and though it doesn't go into all the detail the XML standard can go into (no book I've found can do such), it provides the user with understanding of XML.XML in a Nutshell is what I use when I've forgotten how to use a certain aspect of XML detail. As a reference and a second book on XML, nothing comes close."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so great","review":"With this CD Con recorded the music but someone else mixed it and it shows.

Fun game to pick up and play. It even includes the gameplays from the arcade versions of Outrun. Alot of unlockables forces you to keep going further into the game.

It is somewhat difficult to clean but I find that true of most tea strainers/infusers. Loose leaf isn't the easiest process in the world, but most good things require a little effort. :) The holes are rather large so fine tea can leak through, which is why I prefer fine mesh for infusing tea.I actually purchased this about 7 years ago and I still have it around, though admittedly I don't use it that often."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"Must Have\\" For A Family Library","review":"When I was in the eighth grade, my counselor suggested \\"The Creation\\" as a selection for me to read in the UIL Oral Reading competition. I didn't win the competition, but I fell in love with the poetry of James Weldon Johnson. I was delighted to see a quality picture-book version of this colorful, winning account of the creation story. Perhaps the most wonderful thing about Johnson's approach is that he makes God appear \\"personal\\" rather than \\"human\\". His poetry seems to share God's heart, and captivates the reader and listener alike. The story-telling nature of his poems remind me of Rudyard Kipling's \\"Just So Stories\\", which I also treasure. I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A JOYFUL RENDITION OF JOHNSON'S POEM","review":"As many know, James Weldon Johnson's splendid word poem based on the creation became the throbbing, joyful musical \\"God's Trombones.\\"As illustrated by James E. Ransome, this book is a grateful rendering of that verse brilliantly brought to life by oil paintings that reflect the spirit of the text.Capturing the imagery and rhythm of southern black sermons in the mid 1800's the words ring with the regional cadences of folk stories. Seldom have words and illustrations complemented each other more."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best of all time","review":"This album gets better with age. It is a visonary product whose influences are heard today. Put this one and you cannot tell that it is 20 years old. The melodies are sweet, lyrics are rough as well as humorous, sensitive and poignant. The album is produced just right, not too heavy, not too rough.....and the songs themselves range from the metal sound of the seventies, to the what rock ballads really should be. All in all it should be listened and celebrated. THIS IS THE ALBUM THAT GOT THEM THIER MAJOR LABEL DEAL, but even the greatest hits of the Mats post Let IT Be cannot be more listenable than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Agree with Jeff - another Rhino/Warner gouge","review":"Sorry, but I have to agree with Jeff - this is yet another example of why so many people won't buy music these days. Let's see, the album is how many years old, has been remastered once before, and now they are charging full list price and want folks to buy it AGAIN! Maybe one or two bonus tracks is good on each of these reissues, but it's largely marginal to bad demos and outtakes. And the ~15 minute \\"Stink\\" should have been added to the ~36 minute \\"Sorry Ma...\\" If Rhino wants my money, they should look at what Virgin has been doing with remasters like the early OMD albums. All great quality, some excellent extra tracks, and several bucks cheaper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greatest album ever but don't spend your money if you already own it","review":"Let It Be is the greatest album ever recorded. Period. It was great when I bought it on vinyl, great when I bought it on CD and great again when I bought it again today on this expanded version.However, the running time - for a medium that can hold 80 minutes - is a mere 54 minutes! I shelled out money for an extra 21 minutes! That's actually only 17 if you take out the one extra cut I already had.I am sure all music fans feel sorry to some degree for everyone in the music industry that is facing tough times. Yet, the fact that even in their darkest hour they keep (trying to) ripping us off means that we need not feel sorry anymore.All at Warner, I won't be buying the other reissues.

Seems like every darn album on Amazon is rated 5 stars by its customers. But this album is one of the few rock albums that I would rate 6 stars if I could (along with some others, \\"London Calling\\" \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\" come to mind). I herald this album as one of the signposts that defines the genre of rock and roll. There is no innovation at work here; instead, we have a culmination of the previous 30 years of music, all stuffed into one set of glorious, heart-stopping performances. I can't explain it any better in 1000 words or less. A must in any serious collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Here it is!!","review":"The Mats explain growing up in 30 minutes.

While not as technically proficient on this album as on the Nightwatch, the band exudes pure energy, making this one of their most loud and raucous performances.

Augmented by additional bonus tracks, this edition of USA sounds better and has more to offer Crim fans.

It's incredible!After seeing each other only once in a while, Todd and Christy are now together on a daily basis. Todd has comfirmed his love for Christy, but she's still trying to sort out the pieces in their relationship. Then, when tragedy strikes, Christy realizes that she could loose Todd at any second. Is she willing to trust God with her future - with or without Todd? Will Todd ever propose?This book was incredibly romantic, wonderfully written and funny.

I love this series and will read it over and over again. I can't wait to read the next book and see what comes next in the life of Christy and Todd. I won't go into detail because I don't want to ruin the book for anyone. This is a must read. I wish they would make a movie about this great couple. I LOVE THESE BOOKS! Read every book Robin Jones Gunn has writen. She is soooo talented and I admire her. Go Girl!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Robin's books are always as I wish!","review":"I loved it! It was such a great book I even had all my friends read it and \\"Until Tomorrow\\"! I think Robin Jones Gunn is a great author and I love her books because they are romantic but Christian so I don't have to worry about bad language and bad ... situations. They are okay for even 10 year-olds to read! I always look forward to when her next books will come out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This is my favorite book out of all of her work easy. I've been reading about Christy and Todd for years and this is the best. Just so much happens to them in this book. They are going to the same college,Todd is running a youth group, and Aunt Martie...... Well that is all I have to say about her.Well I just say buy it and enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"As you wish","review":"In this second exciting book, Christy Miller is finally back in the country after studying in Switzerland. She's back with her friends and Todd at Rancho Corona for an exciting year. She decides she wants to be clear on what God wants her to do before she makes a commitment to Todd although everyone has an advice for, including her lil bro.

It was pricey for a few short pages. Extremely fast read with nothing of interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks pretty, but is empty of content","review":"I bought all 3 books in the Pink Books series and I am disappointed with each and every one of them, they're each small, cute and portable (think about keeping it in your mini purse to read while waiting in line), but the content is more than just lacking, it's like reading the headlines of the news without actually reading the story.

The formula appears to be different. The label reads ECO-Harvest tea tree oil, but I've been purchasing this same deodorant for years and it always had \\"organic tea tree\\" oil on the front label. Regardless of the formula, I used one of these to give it a chance, but it has a nasty odor/stinks when you sweat and it is irritating me and causing a rash under my arms.

They have CHANGED the formula of this product!","review":"They have CHANGED the formula of this product. It no longer contains propylene glycol, which may please some people, but it absolutely stopped working for me. The old product worked great for years and then suddenly stopped working. I thought that I had bought the wrong deodorant, but when I checked I saw the completely new ingredients. Sadly, they didn't even change the item number or UPC code of this totally different product, so you don't even know what you're buying when you order it online. The one pictured here is no longer available. You may get someone who has old stock, but they have stopped manufacturing it. I won't be buying it anymore. Propylene Glycol is perfectly safe unless you have a sensitivity to it, so I will be seeking out another aluminum-free product.

I found the book very interesting, however there were more typos in this book, than in any book I have ever read. I would buy a different edition of this book.

Other copies of \\"Plunkett...\\" which I've owned have included such contemporary references as photographs, Thomas Nast cartoons, reprinted newspaper articles and a glossary of terms. This version is nothing but very slim volume William Riordon's record of Plunkett's observations on government printed on cheap paper within a nondescript cover.My recommendation is for you purchase one of the more complete versions of this political classic which can be found on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did these reviewers actually OPEN the book? It's a MISPRINT!!","review":"Garbage in, Garbage out. I ordered this for my cousin, who's going into politics, and was astounded, when I looked past the first page, to find that, rather than reading Plunkitt talking about a little \\"honest graft,\\" I was instead reading GOBSECK, by de Balzac!Oh, the cover says Plunkitt... but it's completely misprinted on the inside. How Amazon and the other reviewers missed this is beyond me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent solo recording from ex-Tangerine Dream member","review":"Wuivend Riet marks Johannes Schmoelling's first solo recording since his departure from Tangerine Dream. Wuivend Riet (\\"wind-blown reeds\\" in Dutch) was first composed by Johannes for the play Opus ESP (by Hans Bosch). The music is nostalgic, moving, and best shows Johannes Schmoelling's talents as a solo artist. A definite must for any Tangerine Dream fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for every electronic music fan!","review":"It is not easy to come out of the shadow of a great band.

I would have given it 5 stars if it were felt lined for a more snug fit and to prevent marring the cabinetry. I think once I line mine, it will work perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious story telling","review":"It's a rare thing of beauty to come upon a book that holds you and transports you on a delightful and emotional roller-coaster of a journey.This book does all of that - and more. I'm an avid sailor, so that enhances the yarn for me. But it's much more than the story of building a wooden sailboat downeast in Blue Hill, Maine. It is the story of three generations who have made it through World War I and II. It's rich in detail and humanity. This stands close to being a truly outstanding achievement."},{"rating":"2","title":"A step above the rest","review":"I have an older edition of this book and must say that it's the best field guide available. It's a true classic and is always the one that goes with me out in the field. There's nothing missing. The bird drawings are truly the best I've seen in a bird identification book. It's also the easiest to carry along when I go birding. A step above all of the others. Roger Tory Peterson truly produced an indispensable field guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"not the best guide, but not bad","review":"Peterson's guide was my first as a child, so I don't want to bad mouth it, but it is not the best. Since then I have used just about every other guide available. Peterson's seems to have fallen behind in several areas. The illustrations are not as good as those in the National Geographic guide. The accidental and exoctic species are listed seperatly at the end of the book, and not all of the birds listed are shown!!! Im not sure if this is a mistake or not. Accidentals are also shown seperately, not alongside similar species or birds with similar appearance. This makes it somewhat confusing to identify some birds. Very little information is given about them, and usually there is nothing more than a head shot. I wouldn't use it as a primary reference, but it does make a good companion to other guides, especially ones with photographs rather than watercolors."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Field Guide to the Birds: A Completely New Guide to All the Birds of Eastern and Central North America","review":"This is a tried and true reference book author for a newby or pro enthusiast.I have worn out two copies of the Tory Peterson books over my lifetime.

The identifications made me identicate birds real easily without any difficulties! I think that illustrations are more easier to help identify then photos.

So get it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"top notch","review":"This is the best general-knowledge gardening book in my collection, and definitely the best organic book I've found. The thing I like the most about this volume is that it's *practical.* The author doesn't act like weeds will magically leave you alone or that gardening is a carefree and perfect existance. He offers real world advice that deals with the real, mundane problems of the chemical-free gardener, or any gardener for that matter.It also contains lots of pictures and is easy to browse for whatever information you're after."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic book","review":"Knew this book from living in the UK. Fantastic to see a US edition, just what I needed as I start gardening again over here. Geoff Hamilton has done so much to influence UK gardening, I'd forgotten how much. Couldn't recommend this book more. He was so very practical, creative and scientific at the same time, and a genius for finding simple, common sense solutions to complex problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good reference","review":"First I was disappointed due to the lack of detail in this book, however later I found that I kept opening it up to get some advice before I planted something new in my garden. It is tough to cover everything about gardening in a single book, so if you look at it that way he does a great job. You can get the basics with this book, and if you still need further detail get a specific book for that question or look it up online. The pictures are beautiful, so I can see this book as a winter chaser, getting your mind prepared for the spring."},{"rating":"2","title":"great gift","review":"this made a very nice gift for our very inquisitive nephew. my wife and i especially liked the fact that his mom can read it to him now, but it's so full of information that he'll go back to read it as he grows up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incorrect information inside book","review":"I have read the book and I noticed that pages about electrical inventions have no data about Nikola Tesla, one of the most important in this area.

Hey, they did a remix of one song and the beat certainly qualified for the dance floors. But, as this collection reveals, the Suburbs could also blast you with a punk-ish guitar assault, or woe you with something more in a traditional rock (although with a twist) vein. Some cool stuff on here, but honestly, nothing grabbed me as much as the two songs I was already familiar with. Fans of the band \\"back in the day\\" will surely love this collection, and other fans of 80s American alternative acts might dig most of it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a time saver.","review":"Love this product. It helps a great deal. Good purchase for abled and dis-abled bodies."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing","review":"After reading so many good reviews of this product, I was very disappointed. There is no accompanying booklet, so one cannot actually see the words spoken, in case he did not get it right. The disks are repetitive. The first one concentrated on several words and repeated them for the whole twenty five minutes. In each consecutive disk, only few new words are added. After going through the whole set, I may find it useful to listen only to the last disk, since it contains all the words introduced in this course. After listening to 8 disks of 25 min., I have learned very little, and payed very much. I have a Berlitz course of 3 hours which is much more fun to listen to - it deals with daily life - and contains a booklet with explanations, so this course was a big disappointment.If you are an intelligent student, save you money for better products."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this","review":"I bought the cd version after hearing great reviews about Pimsleur. I don't understand how learning the words broken down backwards helps anyone.

I'm just glad I didn't purchase the really exspensive version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Audio and Visual learners.","review":"I think the course is great for audio learners. I realized about halfway through the course when I was becoming frustrated with the speed of the conversations, it is because as an artist, I'm a very visual learner. After I do some visual homework, this course will be more useful to me. Ask yourself before buying it, am I an audio or visual learner."},{"rating":"1","title":"PIMSLEUR method is overrated","review":"PIMSLEUR products seem very highly regarded and it's sales pitch is that you will remember everything that you learn. Well... that's not saying much given the amount of material. There are 8 lessons of 30 minutes each, and the first lesson teaches you how to say \\"I understand Italian\\", \\"I understand English\\", \\"Do you understand English?\\", \\"Are you American?\\". The material you learn in each lesson is nowhere near enough you need to know for even basic \\"tourist\\" conversation.The method of repetition and building sentences word by word is a good way to learn pronounciation and learn basic phrases. But these tapes are only good for someone with money to burn. You will need other material (Living Language series is excellent) to really learn the language."},{"rating":"1","title":"False Packaging and Inflated price","review":"These are the exact same CD's found in \\"Pimsleur Quick & Simple Italian\\" IBSN#0743517679 but with a different box and almost double the price.

I was particularly tickled by the flashing cameras as I passed the spectators.The gameplay is almost laughable. On the mud/snow based courses, you more or less keep the trigger fully depressed and slide sideways 95% of the track. I was curious as to how I could slide at a 45 degree angle the entire length of a straight-away at 120mph.I am an avid fan of racing games. The Dreamcast will be a fine racing console, I'm sure.

It starts out fairly simple and easy going, you might not place first, but you can advance fairly easily. But watch out after the 7th..... it goes down hill from there. It took me about 8 tries to beat the 7th round, then the 8th! FORGET ABOUT IT! The game suddenly becomes impossible! The last track of the 8th round is absolutely impossible to complete! It gives you like 28 seconds to get to the check point! I have yet to see it, and I've played the 8th round about 100 times! It made me so mad I haven't played it in a month!

On the positive side there were many cars to choose from, about 4 tracks, and various modes to play in. But the overall driving model was boring.

If you are considering buying this, I beg of you, rent it first. I sure wish I had. The only reason i give it two stars instead of one is because the graphics are nice.

Line spacing is the narrowest. There are also some hand drawings among sentences like brackets or arrows or underlined sentences which gives you an impression that as if that book was photocopied from a used one in the smallest font.

Being a football fan starting in the early 1960's I saw some of these guys play on TV. I gave it only four stares because I think that there was maybe a bit too much talking. Most of the modern players seemed to have a difficult time relating to the football world of the past (There's a big shock). \\"You mean you had to ger a job on the off season!?\\" \\"You made how much!?\\" \\"How could you play with no grass on the field?\\" Nobody actually said these thing, but you know that's exactlly what they were thinking. It was a pretty sloppily played game, but it brought Pro football to everyone's attention like never before. A real kick start you might say. So, in that respect, the title is more than appropriate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Baltimore Colts are not the Indy Colts","review":"It's interesting. But I have problems with having players from the Indianapolis team interviewing the greats of this game is if they have ties to the Baltimore team. They have the same nickname. That's it.

Their customer service people have no authority to help you, and neither does their management.

If you forget that the remote was previously used to view a VHS, you can push all the buttons you want, but nothing will happen UNTIL you push \\"DVD\\". None of the button combinations make sense. You'll be lost if you misplace the instructions or have a bad memory.It isn't possible to record a DVD onto a blank VHS either.

Additionally, I do not remember seeing any of the \\"hot\\" GRE words that Barron has in their book on the actual GRE test.I found that my best preparation was to use the POWERPREP software that ETS sends upon registration.

If you need to brush up on math, or even if you need a lot of help in it, then the guide is preety good, providing you with a thorough math review and complete answer explanations. For verbal, however, there is no real guidene. The 3,500 word vocabulary list is daunting and the actual GRE has few, if any, of those words on the exam. It provides NO explanations for verbal questions on the CD-ROM or in the practice exercises, which is troubling cause I needed the boost in Verbal (incidently, I got a 500V and 800M after using the book for six months). As for analytical writing, you're better off getting GRE for Dummies, they have a good review of writing tactics.

I have never seen any other book or information about them. However, this book is more about Mengele's life, from birth to death, with brief quotations from the Twins thrown in. Only about 40 pages of the book actually took place in Auschwitz-Birkenau. If you are looking about information on Mengele, you may find this to be an interesting read. If you are interested in the Twins of Auschwitz or information about the concentration camp, this book offers little information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book.","review":"The open end of the books makes me want to go searching in South America for Josef Mengele.

The voices of the twins and other Holocaust victims--who faced Mengele daily--are brutally matter of fact, despite the inexpressably horrific conditions they convey. This is a detailed, historical account of Mengele's \\"science\\" experiments including the emotional impact on the victims. Admittedly I had terrifying nightmares and a fear of the dentist for months afterward, nothing compared to actually living it with no end in sight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stemware that *endures.*","review":"The only stemware that has survived my abusive, bustling house.

Upon first glance, the book appears to be every inch what his previous volumes have been, with the exception of the mediocre \\"Explorations\\".After reading this though, I can't call it more than a short compilation of his previous works on Midway and Gudalcanal, with short side trips to Pearl Harbor, Truk, and Bikini.There are very few photogrpahs of wrecks, certainly not anywhere near the amount in previous volumes...AND WHERE ARE KEN MARSCHALL's PAINTINGS? Overall, I felt rather underwhelmed. Bikini has been done better in \\"Ghost Fleet\\", and the Submeged Cultural Resource unit did a bettr job at Pearl Harbor.On the up side, there is one haunting internal photograph from the Arizona...hardly enough to recommend full retail for this book.Wait for it to be $4.99 in a few weeks if you simply must have it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This is the first book which I have purchased concerning shipwrecks. I expected many photographs with information concerning the wrecks. What the book actually contained are sappy attempts to tell stories of the battles and Ballard retelling how he has found previous wrecks. This book was more about Ballard blowing his own horn, and less about the ships which went down during WWII. Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the pictures?","review":"Plane and simple this book should be holding the coffee table up not on it as a book for people to thumb through.

Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rehashed photos, well known stories and almost NO wreck photos","review":"I expected a lot more.The pictures were stock photos of Pearl harbor, and several other warships. The stories are generally well known and about paper thin in depth.As for pictures of the 'famous wrecks' Ballard has found...

I have discovered that my generation has a sense of entitlement problem, we believe that opportunities will be handed to us with minimal effort. In these uncertain economic times creating a strong foundation for your future is beyond imperative.

No... Refreshing? Maybe... Good? Absolutely!!!","review":"Maybe I shouldn't admit this, but I first heard the Subways on the O.C. on Fox. I wasn't quite sure what to make of them and since I can't stand the radio, the only way I could really find out if I liked the album was to buy it (I don't P2P and samples don't always give me enough information). What I discovered was that the Subways are not original, but they are very entertaining. They fit very well into a playlist with bands like the Vines (who are one of my favorite bands) and The Von Bonies (certain songs on Pawn Shoppe Heart). Good pop mentality from the band without the trappings of a specific style like garage, punk, or alternative. They skirt the line well and I enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Subways invade the states!","review":"This album is an up beat rocker. It took awhile for their music to cross the pond from the UK but its here now and everyone should give them a chance. I would classify them as Indie Rock along the lines of Franz Ferdinand but they raise the bar with this great effort. Songs like Holiday, Rock and Roll Queen, Young for Eternity, and Somewhere all stand out as amazing tracks. They may not be the most original band but they certainly know how the take the best of what other bands have to offer and apply it to themselves. Pick it up and you wont be dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thought it was better...","review":"Before buying the album I only heard 1 song. When I heard the hole track list I was disappointed.

In need of good literature, thats where! So let me say that any of Fante's work is worth a read. Yet this book is certainly not his best. Of course any fan of Fante can see that he has two main kinds of stories: childhood stories and struggling writer stories. His childhood stories are usually about his Catholic, Italian-American upbringing, and they are good if that is what you like. That is what this book is. I don't prefer this stuff. I vastly prefer, no, worship, his writer stories which are about a bright young artist living in a thoughtless and bizarre world. This stuff is straight from Knut Hamsen's work (especially Hunger, which inspired Fante and Buk to no end) and includes Dreams of Bunker Hill, Ask the Dust, and to a lesser degree The Road to Los Angeles. While 1933 shines, these other works are the sun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy","review":"I own several Gerber products and have always been very pleased.

But, I had to put a hold on studies for a while.I started my CCIE studies again in 2002 and passed the lab in 2003. During that time I glanced at this book for a total of 20 minutes. There are simply so many other books by CiscoPress that are better than this one, although, again, the Frame Relay section very well done. But certain sections, such as switching, token ring, and quite a few others simply don't apply anymore. Also, the Lab exam is so different now, with 3550's, QoS, Multicast galore, that this book falls of the required reading list.I do think the author did a great job on this book initially, but it needs a facelift of major proportions."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Cisco CD gives you more useful information.","review":"I bought this book and returned it.

The FR, ISDN, ATM chapters are solid to start with. This book clears many common misconceptions. It is well-structured like from Layer 2 to Layer 3. and it also talks good detailed stuff on Cat 5000 series switches. I especially liked the boot-up details with time in seconds given.

Scott writes another excellent book probably relating much of his own personal experience in Viet Nam.

Mr. Scott, though he was an officer, describes Army life among the enlisted troops with great clarity and understanding. He may be a Mustang (enlisted later becoming anofficer) whatever, I have enjoyed reading all of his Viet Nam Era Army books and would rate this one just as good as The Expendables. The vocabulary he uses is of that era and adds in his effort to recreate life back in the late 1960's. A Must Read if you like Scott's writings."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can I say, but what a great book.","review":"The way that Scott writes the story to the hill is extravagant.

Then I tilted the caliper in the process of putting it down on the table and the needle fell off the post inside the dial! Those are the facts, you make the call.

I've known for a while that Romans 6 was the key & that writers like Thomas, Hudson Taylor, Watchman Nee, Miles Stanford, F. J. Huegel & many others had it right but I could never make it consistently real in my practice beyond the initial 'push.' Thomas has given me a practical methodology (attitude?) where I am now genuinely & actually learning to yield to the Lord potentially in each & every situation so that His life is manifested.

It made larpers and D&D; players out to be losers with sad , failed lives that were rejecting reality for a fantasy world. While most of us may indulge in different hobbies for the escapism from day to day stress we do manage to have fulfilling relationships, work a day job and are generally happy. But the people that were portrayed in this film were just so depressing.There was no 'fun' aspect of role playing that was really shown beside the dressing up, but even then not much focus was given to that aspect. I would also like to add that I do not participate in any of these types of games but seeing how DM masters are portrayed , it makes it not even fun to see people so power hungry that they have to ruin a game experience for others. ( I am talking about the overweight guy who is in the army reserve that walked out on his first family .

The songs are supposedly pulled from real-life head lines, but they are hard to follow lyrically and the melodies are just kind of dull. There are two CDs, but the second is almost all skits with only two or three songs on it.

So, when I popped in this album I was caught by surprise, a very pleasant one. I sighed from relief, and began to sink into the rich and colorful sound of Oh Perilous World.The musical diversity on this album is incredible, and all these strange instruments and lyrics are mixed so well together. Cellos, guitars, pianos, sweeping vocals, it all adds up to an incredible album.I would definitely recommend this album to anyone who likes offbeat music, and who is tired of the same song structures from the radio. Very refreshing..."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm listening to it right now. . ..","review":". . .. and it is absolutely worth the buy, whether or not you are a fan of Pig.

This is a cd for Ween fanatics only. If you don't like or care about Ween, you won't like this cd. It is mainly an hour of screaming, yelling, and disjointed singing over fast guitar riffs and jangly pop sounds. While some of the songs are really creative and good, most is just white noise. I really love Ween's later, poppier albums like \\"Chocolate & Cheese\\" and \\"White Pepper\\", so I thought I'd like the earlier stuff as well.

Yes, a reader can be expected to work harder with some novels than with others, but an author who expects work out of reader while giving him only broken metphors, nonsensical analogies, and sentence structure inspired by train wrecks is an unreasonable author, and to blame the reader is the refuge of the scoundrel.

Originally released in 1989 by the Minneapolis label Twin/Tone, Blue Earth showcases a young band with great promise. Sure the songs are not as polished and well crafted as those on Hollywood Town Hall and later records. But there is a certain rustic charm to the cuts on this album. The listener can hear Olson and Louris search to find their voices in these simple country-styled compositions. Songs like Five Cups of Coffee and Will I Marry show the beginnings of fine craftsmanship. Enjoy this record for what it is: a small gift. There are no professional session players, no big name producer. This is a few guys from the upper midwest saving up some cash for studio time, playing together while drinking a few too many Grain Belt beers. Sounds like Blue Earth to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Jayhawks are stand-alone artists of high quality","review":"This album is quite countrified and stays pretty left brained.

This book is about how, while Duncan and Methos are in New York, they come across a truly ancient and hopelessly insane immortal whose sole purpose is to free his Hyksos \\"brother\\" from an ancient sword that the Egyptians trapped him in when they liberated their land. You find out much about Methos' past wanderings in that land when it was under Hyksos rule and what he had to do in order to survive. It's a GOOD book and Methos (my love) is PROMINENTLY displayed. It's worth the money and has a wonderful plot as well as intense action."},{"rating":"1","title":"not very interesting","review":"I bought the book in the hopes of getting a good story about Methos in Ancient Egypt, but instead all I found was a typical story suited to a romance novel and not to an adventure in the Highlander universe. The ending and the discovery of Methos' immortality and the reaction of the Egyptian was trite, simplistic and shows a horrible lack of orginality. The book also managed to work in the typical 'kill the woman he loves so there'll be no hindrance and he can have more adventures' (This was used in countless James Bond movies). The Macleod/Methos relationship was also one dimensional. Macleod does the boyscout routine and Methos does his 'Do nothing and leave' routine. There is no true interaction between the two and they are left as cardboard cutouts. Ms Sherman could have done so much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"does not capture the characters","review":"I vastly preferred the Methos/MacLeod sections (a regrettably small portion of the novel), despite the lack of rapport between the characters and the strange stiltedness of MacLeod, because at least it had a plot with good pacing and intrigue.

Ms. Sherman has managed to make him a cardboard figure buried in Egypt thru the majority of this wearying hack piece and even managed to make the MacLeod-Methos relationship gray and lifeless. Worst of all, the author makes a novice's basic error in having \\"ancient Methos\\" speaking and thinking in late 20th Century idiom. I devour good books in hours. It took me 4 nights to valiantly persevere through this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Methos is the coolest immortal","review":"I really hate to be critical of a book that is centered around my favorite Highlander character, but this book is not that good. Very little time is spent in the present which causes the relationship between Methos and Duncan to seem flat and one dimensional. The flashbacks to ancient Egypt are somewhat interesting but I felt that the characterization of Methos in the past was, for the most part, inaccurate. But if you're a diehard Methos fan, go ahead and read the book anyway. Just don't expect anything spectacular."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Wanted to Love This Book","review":"I really, really did. But I just couldn't, despite the fact that Methos is my favorite character from the Highlander series.In this book, a madman is killing people in New York City by beheading and disemboweling them. As it turns out, Methos knew this immortal, a Hyksos Prince, in 1500 BC. In flashbacks, we see Methos in Egypt and the Hyksos territory thousands of years ago and how he came to meet and do battle with this insane immortal. Eventually, McLeod and Methos set up a trap to catch this evil immortal on top of a Manhattan museum in the middle of a rainstorm.I was hoping for more insight into what makes Methos tick, but this book did not deliver. The other characters were flat stereotypes, and the plot predictable.

You can play single player games vs. the computer or do premade missions as well as play multiplayer games on one computer or via network. Weapons include your classic bazooka, shotgun, punches and air strikes but you can also take out your enemy with zany things like banana bombs, sheep, carpet bombs or by pushing them off of the edge.

We wore out the CD and followed him to \\"Slippery Noodle Inn\\" where he showed off by walking up on the table, playing lead with his teeth, behind his neck, and slide with a bottle he picked up off the table.

Lonnie needs to find another recording studio, maybe one not in a basement or a garage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ronnie Baker Brooks - Great Debut Album","review":"Ronnie is the son of Chicago blues legend Lonnie Brooks and \\"Golddigger\\" was his debut album. If you like fiery blues guitar with more than a hint of Hendrix this album should appeal to you. Brooks' father and Chicago mainstay Jellybean Johnson both make guest appearances here as well. Brooks mixes traditional blues with a little funk, some soul and a good dose of rock to make a modern blues album in the Chicago tradition. Brooks is a fantastic guitarist and a solid vocalist and with songs like \\"She's A Golddigger\\" and \\"Stuck On Stupid\\" it is clear that his songwriting chops are top notch as well. For a debut disc, this one is very good and should appeal to anyone who enjoys modern guitar based blues."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Weekend in Venice","review":"I recently spent a weekend in Venice and found this book to be an extremely helpful architectural guide. Whether you have a list of buildings you are set to see, or you want to ramble through the island's sestieri, this book will clearly inform you of what special gems are on your route. Each strucutre's description (usually a pithy one page description)is matched with a sophisticated and compelling photograph (some black and white; some in color). What this book provides is an architectural overview, a brief historical context, and a bit of suggestion for both the iconic Venetian structures, as well as the lesser knowns. This very combination makes the book unique. I found myself as interested in visiting the Palazzo Ducale, as I was the modern car-park. This fantastic little gem is durable and washable (having perused it after eating a panino, I know): it can be thrown into a backpack just as easily as it can be displayed on your coffee table."},{"rating":"1","title":"Readable but hard to follow and scarcely worth the effort","review":"I picked this book up when I ran out of reading material over the holidays.

Worst of all, when the \\"weird part\\" takes over -- it is very hard to follow. Impossible to understand what actually befell the primary male character. I can't recommend it unless you get it for free and have lots of time on your hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Longest Journey","review":"I read this book in four hours.

I asked if they could please test this one to see what is going on, but they said no, they just throw them in a big bucket when they come back. The 3rd one only worked for about a day.

I was completely blown away by their live show. At the time I had only known them by one song \\"Giving in to the Change\\" from their \\"Redemption\\" cd. Their performance definitely made me an IE fan. \\"Redemption\\" was good but the cd had a couple of filler tracks. I finally got around to buying the latest Imperative Reaction cd \\"As We Fall\\". I definitely found \\"As We Fall\\" much more compelling. The dance beats are much more aggressive. The beats are more in your face than on \\"Redemption\\". The songs are definitely more melodic than on the previous album. I can't help but notice how similiar the song \\"Judas\\" is to the title track to \\"Redemption\\" both melody wise and Ted Phelps' vocals. That is where the band's weakness rears its ugly head. Their songs tend to sound the same but oeverall I enjoyed \\"As We Fall\\" immensely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good in small doses","review":"I enjoy most of these songs. I don't enjoy listening to the CD straight through. The songs sound so similar. I listen to a lot of music that is repetitive in nature: ambient, techno, house, etc. I'm okay with repetition in the same song as that can lead to interesting progressions. However, this CD has repetitive elements across songs to the point where I don't like to listen to the whole thing at once. There are great songs on here especially the last one. This is not a CD I could throw into my CD player and forget about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Write Well and Sell: Greeting Cards","review":"A wonderful book to get you started in the greeting card business.

The author, being a relationship therapist took advantage of her position and made money off of it. She took what people were saying they wanted changed in their relationship and made a book out of it. On a better note, it was entertaining.

He would have us believe that bands like Nirvana communicate through their music some type of hippster leftist ideal (for kids). This coming from a music exec, an individual who on a daily basis worked in a business segment which regularly abuses the naivete of its consumers (teenagers), all in the name of making a buck (or rather, millions of them). It's disgusting. I'm not going to waste more time on this trash, I already feel violated after reading 2/3 of the book (at which point I admittedly gave up and moved on -- there's no way the last 1/3 was going to save it, I guarantee it)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Name-dropping 101","review":"This book is hyped as a history lesson/collection of social observations from the prespective of a record label exec.

It is a blazing disappointment that social thought icons lend their recommendation to this book.

Eddie Valiant does the narration throughout the story, and while it's enjoyable, it's sometimes a little overt. From the flirtatious innuendos to the cliched metaphors, it screams detective novel at you through and through.It's an interesting read, if nothing else, to better understand the origins of the hit Disney film's characters. By the end of the book, however, I had my own image of who Roger Rabbit and Eddie Valiant were and they were not the spoon-fed Disney characters. I'd definitely recommend it if you like the cheesy noir style writing or are a fan of the movie inspired by the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay, if you like silly trick questions.....","review":"I purchased this for my children (ages 10 & 12) and my husband and I.

When I received this product, even with low expectations due to the cheap price, it was very disappointing. The enamel was inconsistently applied in parts with bubbles and streaks on several of the place setting items. In addition, the place settings had metal showing due to transport wear or poor manufacture on 7 of the 12 items. The silverware was very cheaply made and I wouldn't expect it to last more than a meal or two. My product had also been clearly repackaged by one of Amazon's partners (probably because it was someone else's reject) and was not how it was originally shipped from the manufacturer. I strongly recommend that you consider spending a little more money and buying something that is worth keeping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible junk","review":"As shown in the pictures I have attached to this product, out of the box the product had huge production issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chips Included","review":"Let me say that the only reason that I gave this product 2 stars was because the cups and bowls are Ok. Everything seemed to be well made. The plates looked really good until I looked a little closer. Three of them have chips around the edges. I really expected better quality from Coleman. I would return them but I am so tired of businesses selling junk. I mean who inspects these things before they are sold to a customer.Update: I now understand why the quality of this product is so poor. I was under the impression that all Coleman products were American Made. When I went to wash this set to put it with the other camping equipment, I found on the bottom of each piece a sticker that said Made in China. Don,t get me wrong I am not prejudice in any way.

With no thought for the consequences to herself, she rescues him. But oops -- in the eyes of the world, this is called kidnapping. Now what? Louise Hawes tells us what, in a story that is subtle, nuanced and achingly plausible. Before it is over, Feena confronts: 1) the day-to-day worries every mom knows, 2) some frightening insights about herself, 3) an adult world with a skewed idea of right and wrong, and 4) her own powerlessness in the big, bad world. The story ends ambiguously, but as it must. This will give teen readers plenty of material for probing thought and discussion."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's like a \\"MISS READ\\" mystery!!!","review":"In 1905, in this absorbing story of village life, England's Lake District villagers are (with a fair amount of tizzy gossip) eagerly anticipating the arrival of the new owner of Hill Top Farm. Charms and irritations of life, in this small country village, are cleverly written and Albert gives the reader glimpses of Beatrix Potter's biography with a mixture of truth and whimsical fiction. Ms. Potter did purchase Hill Top Farm, bringing with her two bunnies, a hedgehog and mouse. They, along with the motley village cats and one rascally dog, delightfully talk to each other!The cast of endearing and eccentric characters are brought together in this (the first of a series of eight) gentle mystery. Fans of Dora Saint (\\"Miss Read\\") and Rita Mae Brown will find the anticipated series thoroughly enjoyable. I don't compare authors...

He argues that politics is essentially useless for Christians and is contrary to the New Testament. The only flaws to this book were1)John MacArthur says there are rare occasions for Christians to get politically involved, yet doesn't really give any examples. Plus this contradicts the sermon at the end of the book by the famous Charles Spurgeon which says we should never be involved.2)His part of the book of what a government following Christian values seems to go against the principle of the rest of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Title","review":"A more appropriate title to this book would be \\"Why to obey government at all costs\\". The author makes the shockingly misinformed argument that governments through history are generally good and just. Truly, this has not been the case. Curious as to why so many Christians in Nazi Germany went along with Hitler's evil plans? It was arguments like this.If you are interested in this topic, I would suggest reading Dr. Cobin's \\"Bible and Government\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"pietism can not save","review":"While I generally appreciate John MacArthur's writing on a host of issues, he has fallen well short of his own standard in this work. Rather than present a biblically based agenda for the Christian's role in the world, the author only succeeds to respond to the excesses of some Christians in the sphere of politics. In some ways, this book surpasses Cal Thomas and Ed Dobson in their controversial work, Blinded by Might. MacArthur's ability to take Scripture out of context and to use both Scripture and history as he sees fit is alarming considering his track record of fine teaching. Clearly, history does record many abuses that Christian's have fallen prey to in their zeal for cultural transformation. But MacArthur throws the baby out with the bathwater. The author could have brought careful scriptural analysis and thoughtful historical reflection to his subject, but failed to administer both."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Book is Anti-American","review":"My church did a bible study using this book. I find it very interesting that \\"armchair christians\\" like John Macarthur can thrive in this country by tearing down its very fabric and foundation. I have read christian and secular views on the American Revolution and believe that it is nothing short of miraculous that a group of unskilled soldiers defeated the greatest armed force of the time, the British Military. I further find it interesting that after 9/11/01 John MacArthur jumped on the patriotic bandwagon with a video production that refutes the ideas in his own book and talks about how God was involved in the forging of this nation.I served 24 years in the United Stated Navy and I, as well as many others, was a patriot long before 9/11. The evidence in this book shows that John MacArthur will never be able to say that."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must for Musicians!","review":"I would highly recommend this book for any serious musician who wishes to delve into the relatively unknown realm of twentieth-century piano music. David Burge provides a thorough and interesting read full of fascinating bits of information and historical context. The accompanying cd is a special bonus. Occasionally the writing turns very opinionated or biased, however this is a small distraction in an otherwise excellent resource."},{"rating":"1","title":"Her Worst!","review":"I'm a huge fan of LLM.

(The last is inherent in the subject, admittedly)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy Daily Reading","review":"I've had this in printed form for many years and recently bought a Kindle copy for travel.

I would recommend Driver for any one who likes driving games and getting chased by cops!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For The Wheelman In Everyone","review":"Driver is sure to go down as a classic in the Playstation library. It puts Grand Theft Auto to shame. Anyone who's ever watched car chases in movies such as French Connection, Bullit, and the Driver should buy this now. Okay, so the plot and video sequences are underpar. Big deal, what makes this game great is the control and the fun factor. When you are speeding up a San Francisco hill and fly right over top of another car, you will thank me for recommending this game. The director mode is my favorite. You can save your replays and direct your own high octane car chase. The classic 70's cars range from a Buick, a Nova, a Cadillac, and many others. Trust me, go out and buy this game now. It took me over 20 trys to beat the last level."},{"rating":"2","title":"#1 driving game","review":"I should rephrase that, number 1 driving adventure! That's what it is. No more driving around a track, but actually proving your driving skills on the streets. If you liked gta, but didn't like the view, this is the game for you. The game has very realistic damage and driving handling, and the missions are fun. If you get tired of the undercover part of the game you can always \\"take a ride\\", or play some of the driving games such as; survival, dirt track, pursuit, checkpoint, and several others. What makes it even better are the cheats that you can put in to make the game a real challenge, from mini cars, to stilts, to invincibility. Overall this game is very realistic and has now become number 1 on my list of driving games (yes in front of Gran Turismo)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a driving game I enjoy!","review":"After buying every racing/driving game on the market since the introduction of the Playstation (and taking them all back after being disappointed in some fashion or another), I finally have found a driving game that I enjoy! This game plays with the same feel as Grand Theft Auto, except with the graphics of Destruction Derby. A lethal combination of fun and a never ending shelf-life. Unlike many of the \\"popular\\" driving games, this one actually gives your car damamge when you hit something. Finally, a driving game that has more than just \\"true driving physics\\"; it is actually realistic. It's about time someone figured it out..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Driving Game!","review":"Definitely a great driving game! Passing the initial garage test is very difficult, but once you make it through, you'll have fun. You receive different assignments, and can choose between two or three options after you complete each one. If you like driving games, this one offers more excitement than \\"the same old tracks\\" and is a game you can go back to and enjoy after you've beaten it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite video game","review":"My first video game I ever played, and my favorite! It's very fun to play. Whenever I set up my Plastation, This is always the first game I play. Nothing else I can say. It's just truly AMAZING!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Driver is Tops for Driving Games in 1999","review":"The game has all the realism of actually driving on crowded city streets. The crashed are almost too realistic. Your car will crash into another car and the accident will cause that car to smoke, the lights to break and it will even come to a slow rolling stop. Your car has active suspension, it bounces off jumps and needs to be driven around corners at high speeds being mindful of oversteer so as to enter and exit the apex of turns to maximize your get-a-way potential. The cops are as aggressive as possible and make the game a true challenge. I would get the codes after you complete the game, and re-try. The game is fun to just drive around. The driving test needs a bit of work in that the directions don't clearly spell out the purpose and the way to complete certain tasks are not well defined. Other than that, this game and Gran Turismo 2 are phenominal! 4 1/2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ultimate Game Man!!!","review":"If you are just reciveing just Playstation or Playstation2 buy this game. It is the best car game you'll ever be able to buy. With an undercover mission you can get many cities throughout the USA. You start out with Miami and San Fransisco. Then as you beat more Undercover missions you'll soon get Los Angles and New York. The Missions get harder. But the hardest are at the end. You have a possible option to cheat and on the last phases you can't pass them without cheats.So buy this game for your own good."},{"rating":"2","title":"another awsome game!","review":"This game will keep you busy for many long hours its the best racing game i ever laid my two eyes on you can drive through many different U.S including Miami and sanfransisco and the big apple newyork city and it has some other citys and lots of different missions to play in trust me you wont be dissapointed if you bought this game."},{"rating":"2","title":"driver review","review":"Thought I'd just respond to the person who said he couldn't pass the initial test that allows you to start missions. It took me about 45 minutes, it was frustrating, but now I can do it about 1 out of 3 times. It really isn't that difficult. The gameplay itself is very fun, with the 70's feel and music, and fairly accurate depictions of the cities. The map is easy to read after about 10 minutes, which is good, cause normally one thing that annoys me about car games is that I'm running around in circles, with a useless map. The graphics are good, like the above review said, too pixated and blocky, but besides that very good."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Game Rocks","review":"I've Played many different car games before, and none of them even come close to DRIVER. the visual effects are amazing and it's a great challenge."},{"rating":"1","title":"DONT BUY THIS GAME!!!!!!!!","review":"I read the back of this game thinking that it wold be a good game well guess what IT'S NOT!!!! it has poor gameplay and is really hard to get past the first part and i am a very experienced gamer.Do not buy this game unless you like very boring games."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game sucks","review":"I really hated this game, it is so complicated and no fun at all. I looked at the back and thought it could be fun. Every step you have to do just right and then when you do it right, you still don't pass the level and what not. If you like complicated, challenging, and non-fun games you'd like this one. Comming from a 16 year old this is what i think."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"Definitely a waste of time and money. The driving is realistic and the story line works up to the point called \\"president's run\\". This level is close to impossible and leaves you ready to toss the whole game out the window. Without failure you are hurt from all sides by both the police and the bad guys turning your car a wreck in a short time where you eject the disk and send it flying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Racism is NOT fun!","review":"Ok, this is good game in the gameplay part, driving around trying to accomplish your goals (though I don't condone the Fox TV-like glorification of escaping from law enforcement officers), but I returned this game after one to many of the inbetween scenes. How much making fun of minorities can you stand? I thought this kind of humor was better left to Borchtbelt comedians from the '50's. Hopefully the sequels will rectify this mistake. An apology would be nice too."},{"rating":"1","title":"HEY DRIVER LET ME OFF!","review":"I try to do a trick on the undercover section,but is hard to do that,I try and try but I can't even pass the test.This game is not good,the graphic look horrible.yack!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Get Driver if you are a real experenced gamer","review":"Driver is a real fun game but very hard.When you go to undrecoverand and you have to do all all those tricks in a minute it seems impossible.I have hade driver for a year and I still can't beat the first level of undercover.That is why I am giving this game a 4 star.If you wan't a really fun game get Need For Speed:High Stakes"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Fun Game However.........","review":"Great game however after a while did get a little boring, driving the same car on the same street almost.

I mean how can you not like a game that has 70's muscle cars in it!! Granted there are better games out their(such as GTA 3, and Driver 2) but this game really gives you a run for your money! BUY this if you like car games, look at the price how can you miss out on a deal like this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Driving Insane","review":"When I first played Driver, the game gave me exactly what I expected: running over signs and mailboxes, incredible chases, and if you hit a ramp the right way, getting air-time. The only thing Driver lacked was a good multi-player option, if they had that, I wouldn't have found anything wrong with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"average","review":"Driver is a good game that follows the typical undercover cop in the midst of a crimeworld scheme. Driver is more about accomplishing missions for the sake of seeing the next film clip, rather than for the fun of playing the game. It gets to the point after 10 or 12 missions where the game gets tedious and possibly even boring, same missions (different setting), and the same car (different color) over and over. I believe that the makers of the game must have given up at some point and said \\"That's good enough\\", personally not the attitude I would like to have going into a game I was considering purchasing. Overall plot could use a little work too.Decision: If you already have every other game, you might as well complete your collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unclear product description","review":"When the word \\"Kit\\" or \\"Ends\\" (plural) are used one would expect more than ONE!

The acting starts out mediocre and digresses for some reason as does the film. TV soap actress Robyn Griggs, whose name is plastered across the top of the DVD as the star of this film appeared to have lost her acting ability with this role as things progressed to their lowest level.No blood.

This is a really bad comparison. Duke Nukem GB is actually an advanced version of \\"Duke Nukem II\\" which was released for the PC a few years back. Further more the first level is a clone of \\"Duke Nukem II's\\" first level, classic.The game its-self is nicely spread accross 14 or so levels, which are imagenativly constructed and really streach the 8bit architecture of the Game-Boy.The sounds are great, and the imagenative start up sequence animation really shows us a side of Duke not seen before, stardom.Buy this game and you won't be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great game!","review":"I love Duke Nukem from PC and Playstation.

There are 3 crowfoot \\"sockets\\" included though (and one was 14MM), so that would have been an option. It's not cheap for a one use tool, but the cost of the tool and the belt was still probably less than half of what a dealer would charge to replace the belt.

Big mistake, i got the old belt off and never could get it back on because the crows foot was wide open. I had to get a ride to the store to purchase a $25 set of crowsfeet to complete the job.

The most annoying thing is that I have to count the slides before I put them in so that the feeder knows how many slides to scan. Counting is a little beneath me, I guess, but it's a compromise I can handle. I have had to reboot twice on an XP machine with multiple apps and 4 UBS ports running simultaneously, but compared with one slide at a time (a la the scsi slide scanner I had 5 years ago) this is pure luxury.

Happily though, I've been through more than 1200 slides of the family archive so far (about 3600 to go) while it is true that the slide feeder does occasionally jam, I have found that it is very much a function of the age of the slides. Slides less than 20-25 years old scan without a problem. I'm often able do 50 or so (about the max which fits in the feeder tray) without a single jam. On older slides (dating to the 50s and 60s), I do have some jamming problems but they are still the exception rather than the rule. Bottom line---if you are tackling the job of archiving all the old family photos, this is a must have and it works much better than many of the reviews would lead you to believe."},{"rating":"1","title":"necessary junk","review":"this slide feeder is a disgrace to nikon's name. it should cost about $50 given the quality engineering and flimsy plastic found in it. it has trouble with most slides, although heavy plastic mounts seem to do fairly well. cardboard mounts jam frequently. since on their return path slides bend the spring plate, you will find yourself monkeying with it repeatedly until you finally break it.i have 15,000 slides. after some 2,500, it looks like i'll need another one. this is junk, but there isn't anything else out on the market that can offer the same functionality (when it works)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on Me","review":"Why did I buy this thing? With all of the negative reviews, I can't believe I went ahead with it. The physcial design problems have been pretty well thrashed out. It jams - - a lot! And the cover will break off eventually.But there are other problems with the unit. Why should we have to go through a stack of slides and re-orient them all in the landscape position. I don't take pictures that way, so that means wading through the stack and getting them in the right order. Then, to add insult to injury, the feeder returns them to you in reverse order!I don't know, it seems to me that for $450, you ought to be able to stick a peanut butter and jelly sandwich in the thing without a jam (pun definitely intended).The software that comes with the Coolscan 5000 ED is another piece of work, but I'll save that for another diatribe.Shame on me for buying this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works great until the metal spring loses it's shape!","review":"The SF-210 auto slide feeder works great until you do 3 or 4 hundred slides then the little metal spring device loses it's shape and the feeder jams. You then need to reconfigure the little metal spring that handles the slide and get the four prongs back into the right shape where it can push the slides the right way again. Very frustrating because unless you manage to get the little piece of metal back into it's original shape it keeps jaming slides and shutting down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Went back to my Minolta AF-2840","review":"The problems with jamming are insurmountable. I went back to the Minolta DiMage Scan Dual III, AF-2840 (bought on eBay for about 150, years ago), which can scan 4 slides at a time and never jams.

They puff up in the oven and deflate like a souffle after coming out of the oven. I also have several Chicago Metallic Mini Cheesecake pans that I prefer; the aluminum finish bakes the cheesecake more evenly. I have compared cheesecakes baked in dark nonstick and aluminum pans side by side (both mini and full size) and found that cheesecakes baked more evenly in aluminum pans, looked better, and had a better texture. I won't use this pan again; I like my Chicago Metallic Mini Cheesecake pans much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Finish is pealing","review":"I bought 3 of these to make cheesecakes for a wedding.

I lost a couple of the bottoms, so I just shaped some Reynolds Release foil, since it's non-stick, into rounds to replace them. I smear a little butter in the well before I put the foil in so it sticks in there a little better, then pack in the crust. No leaks at all - hey, whatever works! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Contruction, Poor Coating","review":"I was super impressed with this pan for the first 3 uses, after that the teflon coating started peeling off. I never put these in the dishwasher or anything. While taking cheesecakes out I noticed the teflon sticking to the cakes. While rinsing them out, even more teflon came off!No more non-stick for this baker. I've only had this pan for one month. Hopefully I can return this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pan is well-made. Perfect for a party !","review":"I ordered this pan to make mini Cheesecakes for a party and they turned out amazing ! Since they are so small, I was able to bake, cool, and serve them within two hours! The pan seems very well-made and it was easy to clean. If you order this pan, I highly recommended you order the Norpro dough tamper. Made making the crust a cinch! I plan on getting another set. I do wish they came with an extra bottom circle as they seem easy to misplace."},{"rating":"2","title":"neat, sweet, petite","review":"I love cheesecakes but they can be sort of heavy and intimidating, especially these days when everyone seems to be dieting. And when you slice them, they can get very messy looking.I bought two of these cheesecake pans and they solve the above problems! You end up with a perfect neat serving amount and the petite rounds make the cheesecake very appealing and not heavy-seeming at all. They only take 15 minutes to bake (l turned off the oven and left them in for an extra five) and release easily. Now I'm casting about for what else I can bake in these pans because people do like the individual serving size and the cute shape. Good product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had To Return It","review":"I ordered 2 of these. 1 of them was scratched and dinged up and the other was warped and missing the nonstick coating.

I purchased this product to make small cheesecakes that wouldn't ruin my calorie count for the day, but would satisfy my sweet tooth. I also figured, that for Thanksgiving, an assortment of mini desserts would be nice. Everyone would get to try all of the desserts without overdoing it. I wouldn't hesitate to recommend purchasing this pan. I would recommend sitting the pan on a cookie sheet when baking since some of the butter in the crust can leak through -- that's not a problem, it does the same thing if you are making a big cheesecake in a spring form pan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy","review":"From the start this pan started to peel its coating.

Pan cups were rust, but Amazon exchanged. 3rd one came yesterday from the same seller (A & L Inter). The surface of the pans including the cups were very very rough with many small air bubbles.

Because of all the glowing reviews and the cute cheesecakes photos that bakers are posted that I decided to went ahead to purchased this pan. I was very excited that it came 2 days before thanksgiving and so I thought I am now ready to make my mini cheesecakes. I opened the box and checked the pan and it's round pieces that goes at the bottom, oh my gosh! the coating of the round pieces is flaking off and I notice that each cavity of the pan don't have a smooth finish. It's bubbled up and the pan is made of thin metal. I mean it is not heavy at all. The workmanship and quality of this pan is poor and cheaply made. I was totally disappointed and with it's price you expect a high quality well made pan but no, you will be getting a piece of crap that is made in CHINA. Well, sorry AMAZON but this pan has to go."},{"rating":"1","title":"I must be alone but did not like this item","review":"but I am returning this. If your crust misture has too much butter it drips thru, the cavity is just a bit too small for my liking and they do bake a bit too dark & then deflate into flat disks.

She loves to jump and dance and sing with the wiggles, but this DVD held her attention for exactly 30 seconds. It is way too old for their normal target audience. I didn't really like the backgrounds too much either, digital everything just looks corny to me. This is a great addition for the older child who needs to learn these things before pre-school, but for iddy biddy's it's best to pop in the big red car again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"The Wiggles new format (whether intended for TV or DVD)lacks the wonderful songs, dances, energy, and sweet goofiness that so endear them to children and adults alike. The \\"learning\\" skits are weak and repetitive, almost condescending even for an audience of two-year-olds. And Anthony, increasingly hyperactive, fairly leaps off the screen.Wiggles--please, go back to what you do best! The two stars are for Sam Moran, who has a beautiful voice and charming manner and is a worthy successor to Greg Page."},{"rating":"1","title":"The new songs are awful...","review":"I was sorely disappointed with this dvd. While I thought Sam Moran did an excellent job replacing Greg Page, the new songs and skits on this dvd are really bad. The songs are not catchy. It was almost as if they made them up on the fly. The backgrounds are really tacky looking throughout the movie. While I'm glad they didn't get lazy on this one by doing rehashes or by including a lot of Spanish Wiggles tunes, the new songs just did not entertain my child at all. I hope they go back to the old formula next time, or that'll probably be it for us with the Wiggles."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete DUD","review":"This is by far the worst Wiggles DVD. The songs are not interesting, not catchy and the entire DVD is by far the most boring Wiggles DVD in our collection. The songs also sound poorly recorded, the vocals are way in the background, arrangements are bad, not many wiggly dancers, this DVD completely is a waste of money. Pick up Top of the Tots (2004) and you'll see a big difference in the production/recording, and well thought out music.

This episode doesn't help matters much, placing Apollo (conveniently out of fuel, with no wingmates, tracking, or support vessels) on a planet run by a third-rate slimebag and a malfunctioning Cylon. Naturally, a somewhat useless female and her son need Apollo to defend them. This entire episode is basically a vehicle to show what a nice guy Apollo is, a point that needs no further pounding into BG fans' skulls. \\"Inept\\" is the operative word here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overcomplicated recipes","review":"I never use this book because it contains unnecessarily complicated recipes. I am not looking for recipes adapted to mainstream American tastes and am happy to seek out and use exotic ingredients, but these recipes are just not remotely practical and I wind up searching for tagine recipes elsewhere. Maybe an update would be in order, especially as the author seems to have the resources for a broad scope of Moroccan recipes. However, there do seem to be multiple other cookbooks on the subject that are simpler to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a cookbook........","review":"This is a lot of things, but it is not a cookbook. The recipes are listed by local names and have little or any organization. I felt like I spent more time looking up what the words meant so often that I felt the book was written in Moroccan. There were a very few line drawings and no pictures of finished dishes. This book is not about couscous, it is about just about every other dish served in Morocco.My daughter loves couscous and I bought this book hoping to find some good dishes that she would enjoy. Nothing could be further from the truth.If you are looking of a compendium of Moroccan food and have time to sit and read this book from cover to cover, then this is your book. If you want something helpful in the kitchen, save you money.This book was a total disappointment to me and I am amazed that it is even given cookbook status."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big fiasco","review":"I bought this book with great expectations based on previous reviews available at amazon.com. The book seemed to ambition a blend of North african anthropology, personal memories and actual recipes. But the final product is a complete fiasco from each of the three points of view. Author seems to be more interested to impress readers with her hypothetical knowledge of international and Moroccan cousine than to actually encourage the practice of the various recipes. Some descriptions (for example preparation of the \\"warka\\") are pompous if not ludicrous and I doubt that anyone will use them. Neverending discussions on the many types of olives and their similarities with non-Moroccan counterparts are again a complete waste of time to read. In summary: a bad cookbook."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful reciepes for delicious authentic food","review":"Amazing couscous with a heavenly light grain, succulent lamb tagine moist and sweet with apples and prunes, and hearty Harira soup are just tid bits of delights one can find in Paula Wolfert's book.

He took a pencil and circled all of the recipes that he loved, or sounded good to him. He circled a large portion of the book!! I have grown to love Moroccan food since I got married, and more so since our trip to Morocco! The only down side is that there isn't that large of variety of recipes. I am searching for more variety, since my husband only wants a certain few moroccan meals. I will never get rid of this book! I love it, and it makes a great foundation for your Moroccan cooking library!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Moroccan Wife...","review":"I have enjoyed this cookbook very much. My Moroccan husband has liked everything I have cooked using the receipes from this book. I only rated it a 4 because some of the instructions are not clear. I would love it if the author would update it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and thorough study of Moroccan food from a true gourmet","review":"Every review I'd read about Ms. Wolfert's book described it as a masterpiece of Moroccan food and culture and I've found that it certainly is. I bought the book after returning from Morocco along with another Moroccan cookbook. While Ms. Wolfert's book does not have the beautiful glossy color photos like the other book, she includes a wealth of information about the culture, history and people of Morocco as well as very detailed, delicious recipies. Each one I have tried has come out better than the vast majority of the food I actually ate in Morocco! A warning to those looking for fast, easy recipies, however. Ms. Wolfert is clearly a perfectionist and a purist and does not include many short cuts or substitutions, and Moroccan food is the original \\"slow food\\". If you crave authenticity, are willing to follow her recipies closely, and willing spend many hours preparing the dishes, you'll be handsomely rewarded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dog collar","review":"The dog collar is great for helping my black lab stand out at night.

Try The Traveller's Tales of Japan for a fabulous sampler of all the wonderful things that have been written. This book is about Rhiannon Paine and her inability to connect with Japan. She uses nicknames for her co-workers which are derogatory and may or may not mean something to her, but they mean nothing to the reader. The people don't come alive because she never got to know them.

It's worthless and devoid of any artistic merit.The plays are filled with monosyllabic replies, the dialogue is often 1-2 lines or less per character and the stories are devoid of conflict and characterization.What's worse is that the plays aren't 10 minutes. They're all over the place on page count.This does not sound anything like teens either. Maybe teens in Idaho or somewhere out in the Bible belt, but nowhere near any inhabited urban areas.If you can get away with it and want to do \\"edgy theater\\", just give the kids a Danny Hoch book.

I have waited eagerly for each album to be released and I have never had enough of their music.Unfortunally, this 'comeback' of theirs is below any criticism I could muster. It is boring and kitschy. I still listen to their old music, but this album is something to be avoided in the name of love for the old Mark Almond.2 stars - only for the sake of memories, but actually, this album does not deserve more than 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD made me want to vomit...I threw it in the trash.","review":"I'm a huge jazz fan, and I was expecting something of the sort when I purchased \\"NightMusic\\". The cover to this album is misleading. What you get is some pretty nauseating elevator music that is bland and corny. Please spare yourself the misery and skip this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRENDOUS","review":"Listening to this album was a painful experience. How to describe it? Let's see: CORNY, CHEESY, DULL. You want smooth jazz? Pick up a Todd Cochran or Antonio Carlos Jobim album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Buy- This Perfume is Old and Does Not Smell Right","review":"I have worn this perfume for 10 years and learned it has been discontinued and I wanted to stock up. The bottles I purchased smell horrible and one of my employees said it smelled like cleaning solution. Amazon says it cannot return the item because it is hazardous. I requested a full refund and Amazon quickly granted my request. Although I did not have a good experience with this product, Amazon responded with great customer service. Hopefully Amazon will pull this from its shelves- it is just awful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nautica for Women","review":"I have had so many compliments on this perfume. It's light and airy. The guys notice right away. I'm surprised by the low cost, but I love the quality. Thanks Nautica"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pleased!","review":"This was a great deal! Can't find this perfume anywhere anymore. It's my fav! Was a good price, cheaper then I expected and I recieved it in no time! Will purchase again when I run out:-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the real thing.","review":"I used to love the original Nautica for women. It had a fresh, aquatic smell, with a splash of florals intermixed. It was a very sexy fragrance, appropriate for the young and young at heart. Then, unfortunately, they quit making the fragrance for sale in stores.When I found this product, I was excited and ordered a bottle as soon as I could, thinking that it was the same fragrance that I had once loved. Unfortunately, it is not. This is a knock-off on the real fragrance, plain and simple. This perfume smells heavily of powder and some florals, but the powder smell is very strong. There are no aquatic notes as there were with the original, and the resulting fragrance is really not something I would expect a younger person to enjoy. I am returning my bottle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfume","review":"Purchase arrived way ahead of predicted date. Perfume was fresh and also offered at a great price. Thank You. Would highly recommend this product to be purchased through Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Monster C++","review":"A very poorly writen C++ text book, intended for junior college 200 level class. This book was never proof read, it contains numerous typo and syntax errors through out the entire text. Some errors are so bad that they will cause a new student to waist hours on example code that can't possible work. Incredably, one section of the text was copied word for word from Stephen Parta's book C++ Primer Plus, yet no credit is given for Mr. Parta or his book. Save your 60 bucks and put it toward more memory for your PC. I keep this book in my library just an a novelty to remind me how bad a text book can be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Pleased !!","review":"Order was delivered very quickly, nothing broken or chipped, and it was the correct size for my Dodge Dakota !!

A great instructional video for adults and kids alike. It gives you tons of detail to help improve all your shots."},{"rating":"1","title":"good for children.","review":"I strongly recommend you get Sean Skinner's dvd series Stickhandling Beyond Belief. While it is not dealing with scoring, Skinner's dvd will do a lot more for a player of any skill level than this short dvd.

Amazon saved my day!","review":"I searched for this CD+G for weeks without success. The original I had somehow got broken in half during a karaoke show. I was frantic at the loss because this CD contains some of the best of the best of classic rock and roll. I couldn't believe my eyes when a search came up with the disk listed in Amazon.

Used to be a great product.","review":"Used this product many times before with great results, however I bought two of these as haven't been able to find it lately but it seemed to be very old stock, didn't even smell the same and had the consistency of PVA glue - ended up throwing both tubes out. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drudgery","review":"I wouldn't give the book even one star, if there were a \\"no stars\\" category. Reading it is sheer drudgery. I'm a quick reader and very fond of true crime, so plowing through it for two weeks was quite unusual and quite unsatisfying. There are few facts - instead, lots of \\"if\\", \\"maybe\\", \\"perhaps\\", and \\"might\\" - the author has built an air castle on his own conjecture. Finally I just checked the back of the book for the verdict (normally verboten) and threw it away. What a total waste of money and time! I'm going to be allergic to the name Carlton Smith from now on. Too bad he shares the first name of a good true-crime writer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Do not waste your money on this one. Very poor research and slow moving. This si not the first time I have been disappointed with this author, but it will be the last time and of this I am sure. I think this book was probably written in about 2 days. This is one of the worst books I have read in along time. I can not understand how this Turkey ever got published. AWFUL!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much legal stuff","review":"True crime is tough to write about, but filling page after page after page ... with complicated legal wranglings and accounting practices that no one but an accountant could understand or even care about takes this book from about 10 pages of interesting information about the lives of these people to however many it ended up being. Sorry, I ramble."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!!!","review":"I have never been thrilled with Carlton Smith's work but after trying the sample on the Kindle I decided to give him another try. I bought the book based on the first chapter which was the only part of the book actually written like a story. I agree with the other reviews that none of the karma stuff or history on culture was necessary. My biggest problem with the book is that most of it was word for word from trial transcript. If that's what I wanted to read I would buy a copy of the transcript. Carlton Smith needs to read authors like Ann Rule to see how to write a book that tells a good story and skips all the repeating trial testimony. I will never purchase another one of his books again. I didn't want to give it any stars but had to give one to continue with this review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painstakingly laborious .....","review":"This book reads like a court transcript with each and every detail explained and re-explained ad-infinitum. It could have in fact been 60 pages long and all the facts would have been covered. Not often do I wish for a book to end, but this book was sheer drudgery at its best .... I constantly had my eye on the percentage marker. In the author's defence, he had obviously done extensive research but this made for heavy reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"only a ballast was shipped to me","review":"i was under the understanding I would get the full lighting system but I only got a ballast in the mail and had to spend another 40 dollars for the rest of the set up.

No need to buy different ones just to get the one song on each one that you want. This is a great find if you are a Lionel Richie fan!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Valuable material, fills an enormous vacuum in the US.","review":"This DVD does contain material available elsewhere to anyone willing to invest the time and the money, but here for the first time is an enormous amount of material, from family, other musicians, critics, and friends of Kathleen Ferrier.I learned for the first time what a comic she was; there is a film clip of her performing a naughty song at the piano, with all the funny faces she makes as she improvises for a laugh. One learns how anxious John Barbirolli was to try and prevent Kathleen Ferrier from becoming what was called -with obviously derogatory intent- an Oratorio vocalist.The Ferrier legend continues to live; there is general agreement about her character and her sweet nature, and a picture that already exists of a woman not spoiled by her evident physical beauty is confirmed.Highly recommended, until something better comes along.Archimedes"},{"rating":"2","title":"A novice's review","review":"I am not an expert in Yoga or aromatherpay but I am a firm believer in the fact that we (humans) can benefit by better aligning ourselves with nature and by better balancing our inner self with natural elements around us.This book - provides a very simple but very very effective perspective on something beyond the flesh and delivers stunning cause and effect connection to enable us to know ourselves better and also balance our innerself.It provides very good linkage of key \\"chakras\\" in our body with natural elements (e.g. fire/water or even colors of the rainbow) and then goes on to explain how each Chakra affects ourselves drive our behavior and what we can do to balance the energy flow in each \\"chakra\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Iguana Loves This Stuff!","review":"Great product!

This Tao Of Peace disc is really good for deep meditation. Personally, I don't even know many folks into that anymore. 'Tai Chi' is where the Eastern culture successfully meets with the West. Couple of these tunes I found myself playing over were \\"Full Apple Tree\\", the nine-minute \\"Stillness At Midnight\\" and the spell-binding \\"Grass Reflecting On Pond\\".

It doesn't show you (in great detail) what to do with enochian magick. Although, it shows the purpose of each angel with gematria. But the original magick system had no relation whatsoever with gematria (the golden dawn included that part). This book has made me more confuse about this magickal system and it is a useless reference! This reference may be an asset to the golden dawn practitioners but as for me....I'm trying to look for references to the the genuine, authentic, orignial enochian magick system....and this book doesn't seem to help at all......"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"This is a good book to learn the basics of enochian magick.

The girl in video even spends a few minutes panting like a dog. I wish I could say I was joking but I am not. I gave this to 2 different friends who also felt it was very strange. I read the positive reviews on this and good rating and it was my 1st experience with any yoga. After watching this I assumed yoga was not my thing and didn't try it again for 2+ more years. Boy was I wrong, this DVD almost ruined yoga for me forever. I tried a regular mainstream yoga class recently and I LOVE it!

Nor an exercise!","review":"I started watching the video hoping to exercise with it. Guess what? It was not even close to what I expected. From the beginning the girl started to disgust me!!! Weird and boring positions. Not many creative moves and she repeats everything for a long period of time. What a waste of money. To be honest, since I couldn't return it, I threw it out in the garbage. I just can't believe that people found this beneficial. It was awful!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitious and Boring","review":"It's not yoga - it's hyperventilation combined with a repetitious single movement. For example, sit with your arms straight out, looking over the left hand, inhale. Now curl the hands in to touch your shoulders, exhale and whip your head to the right. Now left and inhale, right and exhale....and repeat for 5 minutes. There, I've saved you the price of the DVD. It's by far the worst yoga DVD I've ever purchased."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO Flow YOGA","review":"This yoga dvd was the worst, I hated it! I didn't feel like I was getting a full workout as the poses were to abrupt and the lady on the daisy mat and the narrator would stop after every pose to do breathing exercises.

However, I do highly recommend this DVD. I like it for the following reasons:-I can switch up my workout each time with the matrix, make it longer or shorter- whatever! The sections vary in length, but are just right.-It's the perfect mix of challenging and yet not too strenuous (it gets easier over time, too!)There's a nice mix of cardio and toning stuff.-I got results. I started eating better, running 3x a week, and doing this DVD and I felt better and lost about 25 lbs. I wasn't overweight, either- just on the high side of normal. Now I'm quite trim and fit and I have so much more energy!Some of the techniques seem a little goofy at first, but just give it a try... you won't regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Intro. to Yoga...","review":"This is my first experience with yoga (although I have been doing pilates for about 2 years). At first, this DVD was a little, strange. I don't know, that's the only way to put it... It was more philosophical than I usually expect my workouts to be. But since I got over the quirks I have grown to like this DVD a lot and I will probably buy more of Ana Brett and Ravi Singh's products. If you are new to yoga I would recommend it because I was able to do all of the moves. My only complaint is that it is kind of long... you can program it to just put the parts you like but some people just find that too confusing."},{"rating":"2","title":"This DVD is amazing.","review":"This DVD is fantastic! I had never attempted yoga before, and the numerous positive reviews made me decide to give this one a try. It's great for many levels. I struggled with it in the beginning, but was able to notice improvements quickly and that encouraged me. The movements are simple yet very effective. There is also a variety between stretching and more aerobic-type movements. I haven't felt this good in years. It's a true workout for the mind and body. A few of my friends tried it and have already ordered their own copies."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Most Favorite!","review":"This is an excellent yoga DVD. After checking it out from the library and trying it, I was hooked! I immediately bought my own copy here and LOVE the workout's effectiveness.For those that are not familiar with the breath of fire it may seem a little weird, but if you are willing to give it a try, you will love the amazing feeling of wellness and lightness you will feel after each workout.I have tried many different yoga DVDs and in studio classes (hatha, kripalu, ashtanga, bikram etc.) and none has left me feeling as good as this workout has. I highly recommend it.Buy it, you won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps burning calories even after workout's done","review":"After trying treadmills and weights for years, I decided a more yogic approach was best. This yoga DVD (along with all the dvds in the ana/ravi series) have made me a convert.The poses are challenging and fun and provide an aerobic challenge. I feel a heat in my core after this for hours that lets me know my metablosim furnace is stoked. It makes me feel like eating less, and that what I do eat gets burned effectively. If you do this everyday, you will see you body transform and your stress level diminish.The DVD is well produced and since I have used the DVD for over a year now without getting bored, it has more than shown itself to be good value for money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout","review":"This is a very well instructive DVD.

I'm enjoying it everyday in the morning before work. The meditation part is wonderful. The \\"breath of fire\\" section helps me relax and feel alive when I drive to work. My head clears up and my negative thoughts go away. I recommend this Yoga DVD to any beginner.

Enjoy and be healthy."},{"rating":"2","title":"ABSOLUTELY INCREDIBLE!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I have just about all of ana and Ravi Dvd's. I enjoy all of the workouts. Fat Free Yoga is my favorite. I am constantly doing fire breaths throughout the whole workout. I have never been so calm. I use to have constipation problems, not anymore. I feel totally one with the universe. If you are having stress in your life, I recommendmend doing any of the ana and Ravi workouts. I don't do my aerobis anymore, because it wear and tears down my body. But ana and Ravi Dvd's gently get the body in shape without the wear and tear to the body.

From the movements, to the breath of fire and meditation, I feel and notice my body changing. I recommend it for newbies who are interested in starting the KY practice. Actually, I recommend all their DVD's. Their passionate about their practice, their knowledgeable and they will not disappoint. This DVD includes four 20 minutes segments, along with a meditation. I love this DVD, and I know you'll love it too."},{"rating":"2","title":"The claims for this are true!!!","review":"A lot of people swear by this but I remained dubious for a long time, that is until I actually tried it. So, I am here to say that FAT FREE YOGA really works for weight loss. It's because of how it combines work on the glands, emotions, metabolism, in addition to providing a really great workout. It's also broken up into segments so that you can just do 20 min. and feel like you've done something. The problem with most weight loss workouts is the resistance factor, and by that I don't mean as in weight training, but by the fact that a workout won't do you any good if you keep putting off doing it. What I love about Fat Free Yoga is that it keeps drawing me back. I have lost 11 lbs. in two months. Maybe not quite as dramatic as the stuff they advertise on TV, but this was real weight loss, not just water weight or wishful thinking. I'm very grateful for this DVD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my style","review":"I'm fairly new to the Yoga scene and I was looking for a more fast paced yoga that still stretched me a lot. It was fast paced enough, but I found it odd. I didn't like the rapid movements and felt very awkward in several positions. It could just be I don't like this style of yoga since this my only experience with kundalini. Over all though, I did get a good workout.Along with not liking the workout style, the graphics are very poor. It looks like the background is a green screen and I do not like the choice of music at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tough but enjoyable","review":"It's a tough workout, especially when you first begin.

Especially love that you can design a matrix so that you have a different work out each time. Occasionally the sound does not work well when I use the matrix, I may try it on a different DVD player to see how it works. Highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and Relaxing While Being Provoking","review":"Something interesting and indescribable about this video! It's pretty fun. I just did it in its 90 minute entirety because I just felt I couldn't mix and match til I did everything.Better than eating for 90 minutes, that's for sure! I like the way it causes you to focus on certain things. I lit a candle and that's all I needed. I had a yoga mat but in the video, she just uses what looks like a bath mat."},{"rating":"1","title":"you can really hurt yourself","review":"I read many reviews of this dvd before I bought it and I have been doing yoga in one form or another for over 30 years. This was the first time that I truly hurt myself doing yoga - I didn't even think it was possible. In yoga, if you are feeling pain, you back off and only go to the point of sweet discomfort and your body learns from there. When I did this dvd, the first time was okay but after that, I found I was in pain. There are too many repetitive and sharp movements - particularly with the neck and you might not feel that immediately, but you will later. I do not use this dvd any longer."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS DVD MAKES ME SO HAPPY!","review":"I don't know if it's the work on the glands, or the low impact cardio...but every time I do this I feel so completely positive and energized. I'm giving this as a gift to everyone I care about. I'm also giving a gift to myself and getting their other beginner tapes: Kundalini Yoga for Beginners & Beyond, Yoga for Beginners & Beyond, and Yoga Beauty Body. I'm sure by this time next year I'll have collected the whole Ana/Ravi series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy and Flexible","review":"This video is very easy and flexible to use. You can start or stop it at various points so that you can arrange the workout suited for you. The picture and sound is excellent. The explanatory process is easy to understand. It is for beginners to get started with Yoga or for those who want to maintain a moderate Yoga program."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't like it","review":"was a little bit strange was looking for a meditative yoga and this was just bizarre. I tried it once and purchased something else instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird","review":"I am sure it may be a good work out, but I couldn't get past how weird the instructors were. I bought the video because of all the fantastic reviews, but the instructor is just a tad too odd for me and it is weird that while she is doing the exercises a loud deep mans voice is narrating. It was a bit odd for me and I guess I will just stick with the 10 minute solution videos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do you like kooky stuff?","review":"Well good to see Amazon is finally publishing negative reviews on this DVD. This is my third time posting - the other two times my 1 star review did not show - my message is to be suspicious of complete 5 star ratings as its very unlikely 100% of people will like a product.Like others giving it a one star I found it kooky and weird - it did absolutely nothing for me. If you like power yoga and are looking for a change as I was, be careful! I ended up giving mine to a thrift store."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of time","review":"This yoga DVD is a waste of time. There were so many good reviews I thought it would be great. I was sadly disappointed. I did not feel like I worked out afterwards. Usually I feel stretched and strong after yoga but not this time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time","review":"I don't know what everyone else was talking about when they wrote their reviews because this video was terrible. Sooooo boring. It's just breathing exercises...half the time you're just watching the girl pant like a dog. I would not recommend it at all"},{"rating":"2","title":"Helped me shed the baby weight ...","review":"I LOVE this DVD. It is easy enough for a beginner, and you really feel good afterward. Ana is a joy to watch, and Ravi's voice is very soothing - really gets your blood flowing (this coming from someone who HATES to work out).Very enjoyable - highly recommend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Perfect DVD","review":"This DVD is perfect for when you only have 25 minutes to exercise. It will get you energized fast and get your metabolism revved up. This is great for the days when you can't make it to the gym. In fact, I've been going to the gym less than before because I actually prefer this workout. It's something I look forward to doing everyday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Four 19 minute yoga workouts really do boost metabolism!","review":"This really worked for me after trying various methods to lose weight. I even tried other weightloss yoga workouts but they mostly just add weights and don't do much else and I can do that at the gym! This type of yoga has an aerobic aspect and it works on a very deep level like your glands and emotions. I suddenly have less appetite and am now losing weight in the most natural way which makes me feel very healthy and very very happy! The workouts are moderately challenging but completely doable which means any level can do any exercise and will feel the benefits!I love Fat Free Yoga because I can do yoga and not feel guilty about not working out because I know I am getting a workout as well!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very enjoyable yoga workout.","review":"I really love this yoga DVD. I do not mind the chatting in the beginning or keeping my eyes closed for the workouts. I feel so great after doing it. I love the explanations for each workout and what part of your body (both inside and out) that you are working on. I have completed the first 2 workout sessions and am ready to move onto the next. Oh...it helps me sleep..I do it mostly at night when the kids are in bed and it helps me relax."},{"rating":"2","title":"seems fantastic","review":"i haven't completed this entire dvd (my first copy was defective but amazon were great in replacing it)but from what i've seen and done with it so far i can tell that its going to be one of my faves..the exercises are very different from traditional basic yoga (this is kundalini yoga) which from what i understand is very beneficial to thyroid and liver...all in all seems like a great dvd and i cant wait for the replacement to arrive"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Yoga I can do!","review":"This is a great yoga workout! I have muscle problems and by learning to breathe and do these exercises I have improved my flexiblility and pain level tremendouly! I have been doing this tape twice a week for 2-3 years and have recommended it to my friends and family! I love this workout!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This one hooked me!","review":"I ordered this DVD a month ago, really just because it was a novelty (I am always looking for something different) and had so many good reviews. Now I see why. As a result I quickly ordered 2 more of Ravi & Ana's workouts -- Dance the Chakras and Kundalini Yoga for Beginners and Beyond. They each have their strengths so I don't really have a favorite. They're all 5-star workouts, and I rotate/combine them (or parts of them) with a couple of hip-hop cardio DVDs. The first day I did Fat Free Yoga I felt like I was smiling all day. It really put me in a great state of mind, which had seemed difficult to accomplish because I have been going through a difficult time in my personal life. I feel that these workouts are somehow helping me to make better decisions -- if that makes any sense. They also really work the body in ways I have never known possible. I am noticing a difference in my waist and hips. I find myself not wanting to go more than a day without one of these workouts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this.","review":"It very different from the yoga I am use to. At first I didn't want to do it because I thought it was weird, but once I tried it I felt great. The fire breathing and the gentle aerobics are awesome. I dont see myself getting bored of this anytime soon."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT, EXCELLENT!!!","review":"Finally the long awaited updated Fat Free Yoga! And it was worth the wait. It will take me awhile before I can do the entire DVD. Right now I just do one of the four 20 minute sets and it is enough. I am hoping it will help me drop the 15 pounds that my doctor has recomended that I loose.I have just been diagnosed with pre-diabetes and needed to start an exercise program. This DVD seems to be the right one.I am so happy I found Ravi & Ana and am on Amazon right now to buy their Beginners and Beyond DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Very Best Friend","review":"This DVD has come through for me in ways I never would've imagined. I was not feeling good about myself before I got this and now that I'm seeing results I'm on top of the world. I guess one likes to feel that one has some control over things. Regular exercise just didn't cut it for me. Fat Free Yoga delves beneath the surface to work on the important stuff for weight loss: hormonal balance, energy flow, and self-image. It also happens to be a great workout. You will recognize this as yoga but a more dynamic type of yoga. It's still very doable. There wasn't one exercise I couldn't do. Every exercise has a breathing pattern associated with it. That makes it very aerobic. The two meditations at the end are very moving. I've lost 7 lbs. in a month and when I look in the mirror I see things I never saw before. I know this sounds like some sort of infomercial, but it all happens to be true! I'm not one to keep a secret. I'm sharing this with all my friends!"},{"rating":"2","title":"really delivers","review":"I am a former dancer and gymnast who has experienced a wide variety of movement practices--Pilates, Feldenkrais, Alexander, martial arts and yoga. I am not one to give enthusiastic reviewsbut Ana and Ravi are really outstanding and deserve all the praise they get. Excellent instruction,wonderful production with great music, and well-paced exercises that make you feel energized,peaceful and centered all at once. I felt the difference in my mood almost from the first breathingexercise. By the time I finished the dvd I was blissful. Plus, and it is a great PLUS, I've lost myappetite and droppedalmost 3lbs the first week of doing the workout. I have recommended this videoto all my friends. It's great for beginner through advanced. And, like so many others have said,it's FUN!!! Thanks to Ana and Ravi for a wonderful gift to us all."},{"rating":"2","title":"breath review","review":"i found the inhaling easy to understand. however since there are several types of breathing, they weren't clear enough. also the exhaling, are you supposed to exhale through the diaphragm with your nose closed or through puckered lips?another issue i had was that i read Q & A addressed to Ana & Ravi addressed by a catholic who didn't feel comfortable with the chanting. she wanted to know if it was religious based. Ana and Ravi tried to avoid the issue and just answered that the writer should just be religious about doing the exercise, and the names chanted is actually an Indian deity - which means yes the chanting originates from Indian religion. there is no need to beat around the bush. they should provide the true facts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fat Free Yoga is neither fat free, nor Yoga","review":"This was a COMPLETE WASTE OF OUR MONEY! It was not very physical at all, most of it cyberyoga. My wife does the real yoga with the INHALE TV show on Oxygen, and this didn't satisfy her requirements for a weekend DVD workout when INHALE isn't broadcast."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste you money on this one","review":"I am so bummed I thought I would write a review of this dvd- something I would not take the time to do unless I really hate it, and I do. It has hardly any stretching and is not at all challenging. If you're a dude and like to stare at a really fit lady doing stupid-looking moves (like sitting and flapping her elbows \\"like a bird\\" while breathing like she's doing something difficult like running) you might find this mildly entertaining. If you're seriously looking for a yoga workout, this is not the dvd to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Odd and Different","review":"I don't get all of the positive feedback. I found this DVD to be strange and not a good workout at all. Ana lays on what looks like a bathmat with her eyes closed and lips pursed doing odd poses and speed breathing. Obviously a lot of people love this workout, but it just wasn't my cup of tea.[...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT a workout!","review":"I thought I was getting a yoga DVD that would get my heart rate up, make me sweat and burn some calories. If that is what you are looking for, this DVD is NOT for you. Most of the DVD is spent in a sitting or lying position. I kept thinking it was going to pick up but I never broke a sweat at all. This was a total waste of money for me. I doubt I will ever watch it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my style","review":"I'm used to doing Hot Vinyasa yoga and I really couldn't stand this DVD. If it hadn't come in shrink wrap I would have returned it. The breathe of fire made me laugh and I was no where near motivated enough to finish; she sits on a large shag daisy rug (c'mon!). I really couldn't stand it."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT THE...?? This isn't yoga!!","review":"This is NOT NOT NOT NOT yoga...very boring, very silly, very lacking, and could quite possibly give you whip lash.Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Benefits!!!","review":"This DVD has done amazing things for me. Maybe it was the right thing at the right time or maybe I just got incredibly lucky and picked this from all of the other DVD's I could've chosen. Either way, I needed to lose weight and my doctor told me that if I didn't get my blood pressure down it was going to start getting dangerous. Also, my hormone levels were way out of whack. I started doing this DVD (based on the authors' recommendation) 3 times per week, rotating it with their other titles. Almost immediately I started to see excellent improvements on all fronts. The way this workout makes me feel inside also led to lifestyle breakthroughs. I love Ana & Ravi's caring attitude and the way they design their workouts for all fitness levels. I also love how they present the best of both worlds: the inner beauty of yoga with the outer elements of the best fitness. I've got just about all of their DVD's, and it's like Christmas everyday when I practice them!"},{"rating":"2","title":"losing weight...a plus!!","review":"I had never intended to lose weight. I started doing yoga to strengthen my core. I picked this DVD up to try out something new, and I didn't even concentrate on losing weight. This experience has been amazing.I have been able to not only strengthen as I intended, but now I have shed a few pounds in the process and I have truly never felt better. This is the most useful kind of yoga there is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yoga DVD","review":"This moves a little faster than some other DVD's I bought, which is a good thing.They cover more exercises."},{"rating":"2","title":"Energising","review":"I am a beginner, and I found this DVD to be a great intro into Kundalini. I felt really energised afterwards. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Caused an injury","review":"This tape was not what I expected. Its a lot of awkward poses and fast breathing, but I didn't even break a sweat. Includes weird chanting too, my husband asked if I had joined a cult. I would not have minded all that if the results had been good. But the result was that I threw my lower back out and was in terrible pain for weeks. It nearly 6 months to heal completely. I'm a pretty fit 40 year old who has done Yoga for a years so I was surprised. My chiropractor said it could have been cause by the quick unguarded motions. I don't think I like Kundalini Yoga. I'm going to stick with regular Yoga. Watch out if you have back issues!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange to say the least.","review":"I read the reviews of this dvd and i thought it could be the perfect dvd for me, I've been practicing yoga for the past 8 months and I'm always looking for something new and challenging now. I happened to read the one star reviews and I searched on youtube for videos before i buy it, I found a couple of videos. After 10 min i quit, I felt silly doing many posses,. Definitely not my type of yoga."},{"rating":"1","title":"A HUGE disappointment","review":"I bought this video to add some variety to my workout routine, which usually includes ashtanga yoga (Brian Kest's power yoga is great) and pilates. After reading the other reviews on this site, I thought this DVD would be a good workout but found it sorely lacking. It's really a complete yoga practice, with lots of meditation and breathing exercises, and not a workout video at all. So fine if that's what you're looking for, but if you want a vigourous workout this is not the video for you. I didn't find I exerted any energy, nor did I feel loose or strong at the end of it, which I always do after ashtanga yoga and pilates. \\"Fat free yoga\\" is a misnomer, as there's no way I burned any fat doing it, and though this may seem superficial, the pigtails Ana Brett was wearing (she must be at least 40) were more than a little ridiculous and as such were rather distracting."},{"rating":"1","title":"strange","review":"I bought this DVD intending to take my yoga practice to a new level and as something I could take with me when I travel for work. This is an odd workout. I found it paced oddly and kind of annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fascinating in its creepiness, dizzying in its method","review":"You may find that watching this you feel the urge to laugh even as your skin starts to crawl. That's not just the probability that you are probably hyperventilating due to the breathing and movement combination but the fact that, well, these teachers are a tad creepy.Every time I try this DVD I start to feel sick even though I am in good shape, have been doing yoga for several years and have a pretty good breath support system from being a trained singer. I was quite surprised by the physical reaction I had to this program, actually. It doesn't feel like a workout either (other than that you are breathing hard in a hysteria sort of way) although Ana doesn't seem to have any fat on her at all. So she must be doing something.Perhaps her waifish figure and LSD-esque persona is due to the distinct possibility that she was once abducted by aliens."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I was able to return it","review":"I don't know how this is fat free yoga. Read all the reviews from other customers and bought it. Highly disappointed and wish I was able to return it, but since I opened it, I have to keep it. I don't know how this is fat free yoga, everything was fast, didn't make sense of it and did not enjoy it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not At All Yoga","review":"I wasted my money on this DVD. There is absolutely nothing relaxing or invigorating about this series of exercises. The woman exercising is so strange to watch. She is mainly engaged in a series of breathing exercises that are so extreme that the normal person could not possibly enjoy or be beckoned back to the dvd routine on a daily basis. I love yoga - but this is not yoga - this is a rip off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolutely boring,","review":"How to say, very boring. Not sure if it even deserves a star. There seemed only a few work-outs on the DVD and it consisted mainly of repeating them ad nauseam. Perhaps being a college athlete this is not for me? When I found this DVD I was excited thinking it was a yoga work-out, instead I wouldn't even use it to warm-up. Seriously, I didn't even break a sweat. All-in-all, I would recommend this to the elderly and go back to my Pilates for Indie Rockers. A work-out that makes the sweat rain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved the meditation at the end","review":"I did this DVD this morning and I really wanted to like it. Maybe it will grow on me. I don't see how you can lose weight on this, as I barely broke a sweat. The only exercise that was hard were the yoga push-ups. If done correctly, you really feel it. Otherwise, I loved the meditation at the end. Ravi asks you to feel sadness, fear and anger and then sing Sa Ta Na Ma after each emotion is concentrated on. This one made me cry, which never happened before while doing a kundalini meditation. I really like that Ravi and Ana have taken the time to teach these meditations on their new DVD's. This alone will keep them in my daily yoga rotation. I gave it a four because weight loss--I don't think so.

I chose this product because I needed something that would work for lots of different sizes of people. The vests held up well against repeated taking on and off and worked for our needs.

The adjustable velcro band is great, as I was tired of adjusting bands with every new purchase. Very easy to set up and use, and comfortable. Button placement is typical, but you must be careful not to be pressing on an opposing button if you use thumb and forefinger while operating because the buttons are contoured and unobtrusive. Being a school bus driver, timing is important to me, and nobody can argue that my time was wrong as I drove away without a rider.

I have absolutely no complaints at all. I bought this watch several years ago and it still keeps perfect time and with the adjustable velcro band is very comfortable to wear and fits just right. The size of the watch itself is perfect for me. The face is easy to read as the numbers are large but not too large. I highly recommend this watch if you are wanting quality at a great price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Timex Marathon Radio Controlled Atomic Watch","review":"I must have gotten a dud as this watch does not change time automatically. Went to Guatemala in July and traveled from NC to Houston to Guatemala and never once did the watch change time zones. Had to do it manually. Huge disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Timex Women's T5G341 Marathon Radio Control Watch","review":"Pros: Good watch, has no problem syncing with time radio every day at 2:00 AM (except during solar flare, which is expected)Cons: Too big, doesn't display the date on the main screen"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Concept-Poor Execution","review":"Great concept for a watch but poorly executed in production. After a little more than a year, the indiglo no longer works, one end of the band is ripped off (the band started deteriorating within a few months), and one of the plastic ends where the band loops through broke off. No, I was not abusing the watch - but plastic and poorly sewn cheap products have a tendency to deteriorate fast. That said, the main part of the watch works well (except for the indiglo which I really wanted!), I like the different functions, and believe the concept of a velcro wristband is a great idea (I have small wrists). I would like to give this a higher rating but because of the poor materials and construction, it will have to be 2 stars, and I would NOT recommend this to anyone who would like a watch to last at least two years!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect time!","review":"I had been looking for an atomic watch for quite a while. Finally, Timex has produced an affordable one. It was easy to set-up and received a strong signal at the first attempt. It is very light and the fabric strap is comfortable with the Velcro closure making it easy to adjust to one's wrist size. Be prepared to wear a large watch, though. Petite and feminine it isn't, but it does give you the correct time! Overall, I would say that I am very pleased with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Atomic watch for European travel too","review":"I wanted this watch because it also works in Europe. However, the first watch I had had great difficulties updating in Germany. It rarely was able to receive the signal no matter where I was. That was quite annoying ... I lost my first watch (be careful, the velcro watch band can come loose - it did so while at the zoo in Tampa going through the plastic chain \\"doors\\"! - and I ordered a new one. I will be taking it to Europe soon and hope that it works better. The first also had trouble receiving the signal in Tampa Bay area, but not here in Ontario. The new one receives the signal in Florida now much better so I am hopeful it is also stronger for Germany.By the way, it is labled as for Ladies...but a man can wear it...no problem!Back from Europe: yes, it worked just fine in Germany and is still working now. Only in Florida do I seem to have problems with the automatic setting. In Canada I have no problems."},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch Band....","review":"Watch works great, however watch band broke after 3 months and you cannot replace band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice - but NARROW","review":"As others have said, this may be a nice cot, but I don't see how they can call it \\"oversized\\" because it is very, let me emphasize, VERY, narrow.

It is well made, however, I'll give it that! :0P"},{"rating":"1","title":"Need something more","review":"Too slow paced.

It was good to have a familiar face to this new stage of workout that I needed. I always feel that she keeps an upbeat mood (not annoying like some) and a pace easy to follow. Her videos offer different workouts so you can do the whole thing or just different sections depending on your mood. No matter if I choose to do the whole workout or just a little bit, I always feel great after."},{"rating":"2","title":"very relaxing","review":"I bought this tape with the idea that I could use it through out all my pregnancy and after. All the exercises are put together with modifications for all trimesters. It is easy to follow, and she is fun to watch. The partner exercises at the end make it fun to do with your partner to get them involved. I would recommend this to anyone who is looking to get a good workout and a good strech at any stage of pregnancy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellant Feel Good Workout","review":"I do yoga on a regular basis so I was very interested to see how it would change when I got pregant. This video was great. It shows all the moves with one VERY pregant Tracey and one not so pregant co-star. He voice is soothing and she really describes the movements to you and tells you what they are doing for you. I loved it as a yoga junkie and I had a \\"beginner\\" friend that had no probelms as well. You wont work up a sweat, but you will definatelly feel more relaxed and have a sense of accomplishment when you finish the video. This is a great video for before, during and after pregancy."},{"rating":"1","title":"WAY too easy","review":"This isn't really a workout. It's like a series of very easy warm-up exercises. Very slow. The reason I gave it two stars rather than one is that my 5 year old likes doing the partner exercise routine with me, and it's the only pregnancy dvd she'll consent to do with me; and it's arguably better than nothing. But it really doesn't get you worked out. (Also, I personally hate the partner routine; the husband is so smarmy! But that's a side issue). This will work for you if you hardly move at all, and need some stretches. Not for actual working out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good workout","review":"This is a pretty good yoga DVD. It's nice that they give you options depending on which trimester you're in."},{"rating":"2","title":"great stretching, not much sweating.","review":"This is a great prenatal video, especially when you don't have the energy to do the hard cardio stuff. It doesn't work up a sweat, but it has some nice toning exercises and some great stretching and relaxing. Easy enough for anyone, and even has some stretches you can do with your partner. It may not be as good as going to the gym everyday, but it's better for my body than sitting on the couch!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite good","review":"Before my pregnancy I was a frequent pilates practitioner and believe strongly in the benefits of core strength. I wanted to know how to modify pilates once pregnant to continue to reap the benefits, and this DVD is pretty good for that. The instructor is thorough in explaining the moves. I have been surprised by how gentle all pregnancy workouts seem to be, and compared to regular pilates routines, this one is also pretty gentle but more strenuous than another pregnancy pilates DVD I bought. This instructor keeps safety and space for the belly in mind quite nicely. I do not regularly follow along with this DVD as a workout, but it was good education for someone like me who already had a repertoire of pilates and wants to learn to modify it. However, this one is pretty good for following along. The segment with partner-assisted stretching is fine but I haven't found it that useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feeling Good Pregnant","review":"I am nearly 7-months pregnant and have been using this video about twice a week to keep fit, toned and flexible during what is a more difficult pregnancy. I especially enjoyed the arm toning exercises, the stretches, and the lower body exercises. It's great that Tracey shows you how to use the video for not only later in pregnancy, but also in your first trimester as well as post-natal. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't even get through it","review":"I attempted this video once.

It helped me stay strong and feel pretty good. And must say even though it is slow paced exercise and I thought it does not help much I found out to be wrong.

There are two discs, one where you play as Leon, and one where you play as Claire, the sister of the original RE's hero, Chris Redfield.

I played it for ten minutes and just had to own it. So I bought it and played it over and over until the release date of RESIDENT EVIL 2. This story of this game was hands down the best in the series. I lost my copy I bought in 98' and have been fiend out to get my Zombie fix again in the freaky depths of RESIDENT EVIL 2. If you thought the first one scared you wait til you enter RE2. This is the story, suspense, and dont want to go through that next door moments we've been begging Capcom to get back to minus the old school controls.

But the dialog... sheesh! Hollywood types have never been able to nail the \\"mountain-folk\\" dialect, even if they had a decent script. And Henry Fonda (even a very young one) playing second to Fred MacMurray is a deal breaker. The premise is sound: industrial progress competing with family blood feud to disturb the otherwise tranquil beauty of the Appalachian mountains. Would have been better as a romance, rather than a cheap fist fight. I guess I was expecting something closer to the quality of Spencer's Mountain. If you liked The Waltons, maybe this one's for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor portayal of Appalachian people.","review":"I have read the book by John Fox, Jr. and viewed this movie.

Be sure to get the edition published by Wipf and Stock NOT the one published by General Books, LLC. The latter edition is not as advertised. It is a strange copy/paste job with strange section breaks (e.g., \\"sections\\" will cut paragraphs in half, headings and paragraphs run together, etc.). What it looks like is a bad scan job.

Also an extended live version of Gold Dust Woman would be totally awsome. I'm sure there's plenty of songs hanging 'round Stevies piano bench in Phoenix waiting to be recorded.

We had an old, grainy VHS tape of the film which was hard to watch. I am surprised that ONE OF OUR AIRCRAFT IS MISSING is not more well known because it really is a good story. Five British soldiers escape from their aircraft before it crashes. They land in Holland and are rescued by Dutch citizens working with the resistance against the Nazis. The story is about how the soldiers are transferred to a few towns before reaching the sea and a rescue ship. At times they are just one jump ahead of the Nazis. Very good characterizations all along the way -- British movies are good at this. The quality of the film is still not great, but that is a small criticism. You will enjoy an interesting story and a part of history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Sound","review":"I had not heard much of Mr. Sullivan's playing before this recording, and upon listening to it, I was rather disappointed. Technically he is excellent, his execution throughout the range and style of all these works is incredible. The varied genre that he covers is also commendable, there is some good recital repetoire that can be found on this disk. However, Mr. Sullivan's sound was what really disappointed me. It just seems so shallow, not very full at all. The end of the beautiful Nessun Dorma was especially disappointing. Listen to this CD for ideas of recital repetoire, but certainly not as an example of trumpet tone. Recordings of Maurice Andre and others are much better and more desirable examples."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved It!","review":"I found this CD to sound a lot like Rammstein which certainly isn't a problem as far as I'm concerned.

A love story intertwined with what I consider, a real look at life in this much maligned part of San Francisco. We don't see many brutal drug dealers, but we see a brutal strip club manager and a ruthless hotel owner (?) who both take advantage of the main character in the film; a loving divorced father who's son visits him in his new digs, a lowly T.L. hotel. I felt for these poor people in the film who often skip from one seedy hotel to another, often straddled with alcoholism. Having seen this part of town first hand, I can attest to its realism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"After reading the other reviews, all raving about how great this film is, I decided to purchase and see for myself. I rarely take the time to write reviews, but I am just so irritated with the fact that I was duped into watching this ridiculous film. I kept watching the movie thinking to myself that at some point something would happen that would make sense of it all. If I had to describe it, I would sum it up as \\"a recently separated father moves into a slum apartment building as the property manager and then we get to see why his life sucks as he hooks up with crack heads and hangs out with drug addicts.\\" The movie ending was what really sent me over the edge.

I use only the basic functions on a phone and I was still disappointed with this one. Maybe all the higher end functions make this phone worthwhile, but I doubt that I will use them. I like to use the camera on my phone for taking pictures of memorable moments when I don't have my camera with me. I didn't realize how far inferior the camera is on the RAZR compared to the phone I used to have, the Samsung A670 which I considered a pretty basic phone. The pictures are dark and the quality is aweful, with lines running through everywhere. I tried changing the picture quality and the brightness but it didn't make them any better. Too bad I'm stuck with this one for the duration of my two year contract. Not impressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"ONE ONE HOLE FOR CHARGER & EAR PIECE?","review":"I got this pink razr phone a while back and I was NOT informed that the charger plug is the same as the ear piece plug which means that you can not charge and talk while using an ear piece. This annoys me sooo much because I use my ear piece exclusively to talk and now when I get into the car or am at home, I can not charge and talk with an ear piece at the same time.The speaker phone is not clear. When I drive and forget my earpiece at home, I have to use speaker phone and it doesn't work that well. I have to put it next to my ear. What's the point of that when it's suppose to be used \\"hands free\\". When the police pull me over, what am I going to say to him, \\"Sir, I'm on speaker phone.\\"That's about as much as I want to say about this phone. It's not that spectacular."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst phone I have ever had.","review":"I know everyone is buying the RAZR phones because they are 'cool' compared to your average cell phone. But I cannot stress enough that this phone is a bad buy.My experience has been that:- It loses its charge very quickly, that is my main complaint. Especially if you leave it on in an area that it doesn't get reception in (ex: the subway) it seems to drain itself. If I unplug it from the charger in the morning and it goes through normal (if not minimal) usuage, it will be dead by the end of the day.- The keypad is a pain.- The camera isn't very good.- When setting the phone to 'alarm only' it still lets calls that have been set to their own ringtone through.- Some of the settings are difficult to figure out.So, that's what I have to say about the phone. I would have rather just kept my not-as-stylish phone than have this one. So what if it wasn't hip and with it? It was much more reliable. But, the hype got to me, I wish I wasn't such a sucker for the colour pink."},{"rating":"1","title":"Verizon (VERI Zucky versiON) black model purchased","review":"The RAZR WAS a cool phone. Verizon's firmware really sucks. It is not user friendly at all. It takes additional keystrokes to simply get to your address book to scroll for a number or to send a text message. The phone and Verizon do have great reception but that's about all I can say good about this.

So all foreigners look like Brad Pitt and Leo Dicaprio, no matter how big your beer belly is.And this book really depicts the life of these sorry people, who make Japan their homes. So it is insightful reading for any poeple wishing to go to japan to find your first girlfriend. Or for you poeple who have neighbors who have Asian wives.

Glad I did. Best bit about the whole bit? The black strap you see in the picture is contiguous fabric; it creates the combined adjustable neck and waist band. So if your kiddy's head is larger than average, the apron will still fit perfectly. And the band's width means no red marks on your little cook's neck...even if the apron's on snuggly. The apron fabric is malleable, not stiff like other aprons we've used once and never again. Seams are even, tight and build to last. The fabric wipes down easy peasy for little messes. But if your little chef's used the apron as a mixing bowl, you can swish the apron in the sink with water [or add soap for a greasy mess] and you're good to go. Mimi the Sardine [girl, are you really fish?], I say make us big kids these aprons.

He's just to the point of sounding out these simple words, so What's Gnu is proving to be a valuable and fun learning tool for him.The only downside is, of course, that the tiles are easy to lose if you're not pretty disciplined about putting them back in the dispenser and back in the box.

I'm pleased. It is nice to hear while driving, or in the background of a Scrabble game. I think most of it is too lively to play while a person is trying to meditate (a practice I gave up in the late '70's) but as a modern version of the lounge music popularized by Martin Denny and Arthur Lyman back in the late '50's, this is a successful release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Urban Grimshaw and the Shed Crew","review":"A fantastic book, funny and moving, It is almost easy to forget that this is a true story from the 21 century, and not from Victorian England.

About 10 pumps is all that is required to produce a nice, thick, froth that makes me look like I could be on the \\"got milk\\" commercial after taking a sip of my latte. I like to take the \\"chill\\" off the milk by microwaving it for10-30 seconds (depending on the quantity) in a microwave safe mug and then pouring the soymilk into the frother. Don't microwave the milk in the frother glass base, as it will break (I know from experience!). My sister has an espresso machine and goes to so much effort to froth her milk. I feel that the Bodum is so much more simpler and to be honest, I like the results better than her machine (she owns a *bucks brand). **FYI, regular soymilk makes a great froth as opposed to NF milk or even LF milk. You would have to use whole milk to get the same results as regular soymilk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really?","review":"This thing sucks.

There is no seal between the glass and the screen, and the lid does not sit down into the pitcher, creating a wobbly hold. Who thought this up? I don't get it. How can they sell something so poorly thought out? Please, correct me if I'm using it wrong. We thought, why not just try our french press to froth milk? It worked great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work like it used to","review":"My parents have one of these milk frothers, and it always worked great. When I received one as a gift, I noticed that the new ones (like mine and my sister's) no longer come with the rubber gasket that fits around the plunger. Without the gasket, there isn't a good seal around the glass, so the milk splashes up around the metal rod and leaks out of the top, and the milk hardly froths. I figured they just accidently forgot to put one on, but when I wrote to the company, they informed me that they're not putting the gaskets on anymore. It's not just mine either, because my sister's frother didn't come with the gasket and hers does the same crappy job. I would not buy this frother again."},{"rating":"1","title":"It does NOT froth!","review":"The \\"plunger\\" is flimsy and does not fit tightly enough against the glass.

This left it loose and wobbly as you raised and lowered the mechanism. The previous one was all metal and well fitted, and included a rubber base to prevent it from slipping around during use. This one was poorly constructed by comparison, and was sent back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"I would have given the Bodum frother two stars until this morning when, two weeks after being purchased, it stopped working entirely. The fact that it used to actually froth milk merited the two stars, although the use of 4 batteries to do so and the need to stand there for two minutes and manually hold down the button seems clumsy as a design at best and pathetic and impractical at worst. The button is difficult to depress and you will experience thumb fatigue. But this morning when I went to use the machine the element that is supposed to move up and down to actually froth the milk was stuck in an elevated position, no longer gliding up and down along the spindle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality and awful customer service","review":"The mesh screen got folded up and bent after a few months.

I bought this one to make single cups, but realize if you have a larger metal one and want to make a small amount, you just slant the metal one to the side and it works fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"This doesnt make very much or very good froth. This I could live with, since its still quite a practical size, you can put it in the microwave, and it looks nice.But, as many others have pointed out the milk spills over from the top through the hole in the lid. This also leads to milk leaking into the lid, between the plastic and metallic parts. Since there is no way to get the milk out the product becomes unusable in a few days - the milk goes bad and starts to smell.. The whole product becomes a health hazard!"},{"rating":"1","title":"new product very inferior to original","review":"I recently purchased a replacement chambord milk frother. My old one had a metal and plastic wheel on the bottom of the frother. It worked fabulously. I ordered a new[[ASIN:B000QEEI5I Bodum Chambord 5-Ounce Milk Frother]and got a very different product. The bottom of the frother is plastic and mesh. It does not fit tightly in the beaker. It does not froth. I called Bodum to complain, and they seem to know it does not work very well. After my complaining loudly, they said they would send me a gasket to use which would make a tighter fit. I no longer advise buying this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"glass breaks extremely easily and no warranty","review":"This is a great device for steaming milk in the microwave and frothing it for a latte except for the fact you will need to replace the glass chamber about every two months at 15 to 20 dollars a pop.

Duh, you have to click on DVD_Video and then on top, \\"Open Disc\\". This will read the disc in the camera via the USB cable. Oh, and you should finalize the disc before doing this as it might not work otherwise. It is probably faster to put the mini-disc in your computer's DVD drive if it has one.

Finally, you can supposedly \\"finalize\\" the DVD to watch it directly on a DVD player or computer, but \\"finalizing\\" only ruins the DVD, so your memories are kaput.My in-laws got us a Canon because optics were supposed to be the most important thing about a camera.

Most of those buck-toothed, barefoot hillbillies wouldn't even notice.But I digress, The Lord goes undercover as, get this, a freaking carpenter to smoke out these so-called evildoers. Seagal fixes at least fifty hillbilly's porches throughout the movie. He hooks up with some long-in-the-tooth broad who killed her brother but he doesn't care because Steven likes killing people too, so its a match made in heaven.

Not half an hour after getting the ship notice, the first fan got very, very jerky when oscillating. By the end of the day it cut out entirely; wouldn't turn on, nothing. I unplugged it and let it sit. A day later I tried it again; it turned on, but shut off within two minutes and hasn't worked since. I hoped it was just a dud and set up the second one about two hours ago. It runs, but the oscillation is already completely nonfunctional.I really can't tell if the ionizer works or not; I don't notice any particular freshening of the air or reduction in allergens, just the little green LED on the unit being on.This fan is a total waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Fan for a small room","review":"The fan has been running smoothly and making almost no noise but it DOES wobble a lot.

I have a similar type fan (Lasko) which I like very much, but this one does not seem to be as sturdy. I really don't like the remote.

The oscillate mechanism is a bit clunky, and I'd bet on that being the weak component, but since I don't use it, it isn't an issue for me. The \\"breeze\\" mode and timer are very useful, and the remote, while awkward to hold in one hand, is very handy for operating the fan from bed. It even has a built-in (weak) flashlight. The ionizer isn't very strong, but it does seem to freshen the air at least slightly.

In fact, the only drawback is that the score is not complete. Some of the missing tracks are simply bridge music, but the Act I mazurka is a real loss. So, much as I like Ermler as a conductor, I'd recommend the wonderfully inexpensive Mogrelia version from Naxos (ASIN: B00000147M). It's a two-CD set, with bonus tracks from La Source. Another, more expensive alternative is Bonynge's three-CD set (ASIN: B000026CFV), with all three Delibes' ballets: Coppelia, Sylvia, and La Source. Bonynge keeps a faster tempo than Mogrelia, but both versions are definitely conducted for the ballet, not the concert hall.Of course, if you love Delibes as much as I do, you might like the Ermler just for contrast.

It makes my entire tent warm very quickly and about 20~25 degrees warmer than outside. (it was about 40 outside)But be ware, you need to set up a safe perimeter so nothing touches this thing. It will either get burned up or catch on fire.The support (two black legs) are very firm. The other reviews who said it is not safe either was too dumb to know how this works or just too lazy and didn't read the instruction.It rotates about 280 degrees to form a very sturdy support.The size is good for storage as well as camping.highly recommend this item if you are going camping.

And it did! I have never been to Manila, but now I feel like I have. You can feel the heat radiating from every page of this intense book, which manages to combine setting, plot, and character into a heady witches' brew. I thought the Sam Haines character was extremely well done - interesting, and just perverse enough to be realistic. I do have to warn any potential reader that this is a tough book, so if you have a weak stomach or like your mysteries very cozy, this isn't going to be the right book for you. But if you like a well plotted story, exceedingly well told, and you can handle a lot of gritty details about cockfighting, the sex trade, and assault weapons - then you won't be able to put it down (just as I couldn't)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Block cobra 2?","review":"This book seems like a rip off of the movie Black Cobra part 2.

It is written in easy to understand language and provides simple, straightforward examples of how, where and why to use the various TOC thinking tools. The big insight from this book is that it presents the tools out of the normal sequence and demonstrates how they are independently useful. This will help those new and familiar with TOC to better understand the specific roles of the various tools and how they fit together.Ms. Scheinkopf also provides very nice step-by-step guidelines for using each of the tools.

It is well designed. The game folds up into itself , keeping the pieces in a center console where the spinner is (this has replaced the cards). Two big bonuses: (1) that you can play this game on the beach in a windy location as game pieces that are movable fit into pre-drilled holes plus there are no cards to blow away, just an attached spinner that moves the game along and (2) each person only has two \\"mover\\" pieces, not four, to get around the board making this a shortened version of the at-home game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"This is the most well written software learning guide I have ever seen.

I love this game!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"I would consider myself a casual video game player and I finished this game in no time flat even with the overly long scenes that play between the levels of the game that you cannot skip through. I was highly disappointed that it was so short. It also seemed to have a lot of bugs where you get trapped by the terrain- I had to restart a checkpoint once because I could not get the soldier out. The AI was not very good either as the other allied soldiers would get in your way all the time or be nowhere in sight. To be fair though, the graphics and sound effects were amazing defintely on par with the best of the genre. It would be worth renting, but is a lousy buy. I recommend Gears of War or Rainbow Six Vegas for superior all around games."},{"rating":"1","title":"big letdown","review":"I love Call of Duty 2 and was excited to get this one. But it is not even comparable to 2. The scenes are dark, it's difficult to aim, and it's hard to find other players in deathmatch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really disappointing","review":"My friends and I had high hopes for this game. We played COD2 multiplayer every week and were excited about a new shooter. After playing COD3 for a few rounds we decided to put 2 back in. The graphics are great, but we found a lot of bugs. There were some shading problems with the helmets that made them turn white at a certain distance. That's fine if you want to be a UN soldier, but not if you're trying to sneak up on somebody. Muzzle flashes were almost none existent. No blood splash like in COD2. The single player game isn't too bad so far, but if you plan on multiplayer I would recommend renting it first. We were of the opinion that the game was rushed, maybe they'll patch it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Locked Up at the Crane","review":"I received CALL OF DUTY THREE for Christmas. It was easy but the graphics were great. The Problem: It locks up at the crane. I have tried everything to move forward, however, it locks up no matter what I do; then I must go back to the checkpoint and try it again. After about 10 times, I am ready to send it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the hell?","review":"Seriously....I was waiting quite awhile for this game to come out because its predecessor is freakin sweet. It was all I use to play online. After purchasing this game and playing it for all of 10 minutes I quietly put it back in the box and have not taken it out since. Online play was non existent. Everytime i clicked on a game it said it didnt exist. It was ridiculus. Letting someone else create this game instead of Infinity Ward was a giant mistake. This latest edition adds nothing to the series. Do not purchase this game....there are many better games out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get Call of Duty 2 Instead","review":"This mainly deals with online but is also applicable to single player.In COD 2 you could tell when you're shooting someone cause you'd see blood and then they'd fall over and clutch at their neck while they're dieing. In 3 you have no way of knowing you're hitting them. And when they die they just lay down and then start blinking and disappear. You can't even pick up their weapons immediately. In 2 I hated how the flag would stick out through walls. In 3 players weapons and limbs can stick out through walls. That is rediculously lazy on the game designers part.That's just a sample of the sloppiness with which this game was put togther. COD 2 was moving towards realism. 3 reverted to old cheap arcade tricks. The only good thing about it is it's bigger. But it's also cheap and sloppy. The gameplay is nowhere near COD 2. Not well thought out at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Similar to COD 2","review":"This is a solid game. It has good graphics, smooth framerates, and is fun to play. However, I don't see much if any improvement over COD 2 in single player mode. If you have not yet played COD 2 and are only interested in single player mode, I recommend getting it since it is cheaper and just as much fun. If you have already played COD 2 you may want to skip this one and instead get Gears of War, Ghost Recon Advanced Warfighter, or Rainbow Six Vegas for something new."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Game, online play dwindelling","review":"I really love the single player.

The campain is the same as all the WWII games that came before it, storm the town, kill the Nazis. I'm kind of getting tired of WWII games too. They're all the same. Rent it, if you really love it, buy it.Get Gears of War instead.

The single player game is fine with some dumb things with the enemy AI. The muliplayer is a joke! Well first you have to get online which is basically impossiable. The Multiplayer which was the best part of 2 is totally stupid and WORTHLESS in 3. One you can play by yourself. Sounds like fun right? two you have to drive the tank unless you are the second person to the tank but you cant just use the machine gun which u can in the other vehciles stupid. Three there are some stupid errors in a bunch of levels where you can get stuck and have to respawn yourself. i say rent it before you buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why did they take away the Russians?","review":"The newest COD is great, but my only regret is that they replaced the russians w/ canadians and polish people. What kind of idiot would think anyone would rather be a canadian then a russian. The russians were my fav because of their accent and the commisars threatening to shoot you if you ran away, plus the russian levels were cool, fighting in bombed out urban areas like moscow or stalingrad, hunting down tanks and sniping clueles nazis. It would be so much cooler if they left the Russians"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed...","review":"I have played every Call of Duty game out there.

Then, came the cod 3. This game was a flop in my opinion. The campaign was boring and medicore. The split screen multiplayer was stupid. The only reason I would buy this game is for the graphics, and Xbox Live. Activision failed to keep the hot streak going with this franchise. I just can't wait for COD4, modern warfare!

Dr. Wimberly states the importance of understanding the liberation thought of the early African American Educators and it's importance to the art of vocation. The book is laid out for the reader to engage in study of the African American prespective of educating the Christian Faith. Using four primary pahses, the reader can examine the everyday story, the Christian Faith story in the Bible, the Christian Faith story in African American heritage and in Christian Ethical decision making.

Ben takes the apartment next door and soon has more than his eyes on her. As he accompanies her on her excursions, and happen upon a bit of mystery, the two grow closer together. Grace is just happy that she has found a regular guy to love her for who she is, not because of her family's wealth. But when Grace finds out the truth about Ben, will she walk away?The last in the \\"Simply\\" series proves that sometimes authors should quit while they are ahead.

The plot was dull, the characters were flat and there was nothing gripping to keep the reader pushing through the novel. The only reason I finished it is because I had read the other two books in the series and I felt I should see it through to the end.For anyone out there looking for a good read... DON'T LOOK HERE!

I honestly cannot believe anyone would publish this book, although the pictures are nice. The author actually states that humans and dinosaurs co-existed (dinosaurs were created on the 6th day incase you didn't know)! It is sad that people would teach their children incorrectly about our world's history. I did have a good lauch, but trust me when he can read and comprehend, it will not be this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs updating urgently!","review":"I found the book informative, but it lacks the current information--like the fact that publishers of fiction now want at least 70,000 word manuscripts before they will even look at it.

He used rap and rhymes to put together CLASSIC interviews with various people, most notably, Howard Cossell. He had so much fun giving interviews and showing off in front of the camera, only to back up EXACTLY what he said, in the ring. I think that this video is one of the funniest things I've ever seen.

It has a good selection of stories about Thomas and his many friends: James, Gordon, Henry, Toby, et al. The stories are short enough to hold a toddler's attention. 1 or 2 stories a night is/are perfect. The binding is sturdy, so this book will outlast many a flimsy paperback. It's also quite economical as there are 26 stories in all. When I first saw the book, I was afraid that the small size of the illustrations would be a drawback, but my son enjoys them just the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"a special time with daddy","review":"Both of my sons, 5 and 3 love this book.

While the variety of the stories is refreshing, and you learn some history of the engines, the stories are about misbehaving and mischief....almost a little dark at times. You have to consider when they were written though, not easy times in America. Terminology is different then the contemporary counterparts, but you know, it just gives a parent another chance for teaching their kids words and concepts. My 2 1/2yr son fully understands \\"naughty\\" by the descriptions in these stories of the trucks (freight cars) The term naughty was used in a contemporary Thomas book."},{"rating":"1","title":"not really meant for small children","review":"I bought this for a 4 year old.

We have tried to avoid the videos and books as much as possible, however, since the stories are so negative. The trains are SO NASTY to one another that there are NO positive role models. Preachy, over-simplistic moralism combined with characters who model negative behavior.Fortunately, our son does NOT have the trains imitate the ones in the videos when he plays with his Thomas trains.

A far cry from the stories on TV, this shows Thomas and his friends before they even hit the small screen(Soon to be SILVER!).

From Edward's Day Out to Toby's Tightrope, I think you'll really enjoy this splendid collection of Classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for any Thomas fan","review":"My boys (aged 4 & 2) are both Thomas fanatics and they love this book. There are many different engines in the different stories, many more than the paperback stories we had purchased in the past. My boys also enjoy the illustrations with each story.The stories are short enough that my toddler remains still for 2 stories. We've used this as our bedtime book, and there are enough stories in the book that I don't feel like I'm reading the same ones over and over again. The stories are grouped nicely into sections focusing on various railways and engines.I highly recommend this book for anyone who is a fan of Thomas and his friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ths is the best book of Thomas the Tank engine stories!","review":"I have three huge Thomas fans in my house, four if you count my husband. My boys get endless enjoyment from hearing the stories in this book. Each boy has his own favorite that he begs Dad to read each night.

My son (then 3) loved the book. Well, he's almost 5 and he still loves it. It has almost fallen apart a bunch of times, but his grandfather keeps repairing it for him. My son doesn't want a replacement, he loves his old battered and beloved copy. We read it to him on an almost daily basis. I'm very happy that he loves the Thomas stories. I gave a friend's daughter a copy of this book and she insists on at least 2 of the stories being read to her before nap and before bedtime. If any child likes Thomas, this is a very worthwhile gift that will be appreciated for a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"love it!","review":"This book is great, not only to read to my children, but for myself as well. I really enjoy reading the original stories and seeing the similarities and differences to the tv program. I also appreciate the original illustrations and reading the stories from a non commercialized perspective. I know some have said that the stories may be a bit much for little ones with the verbage used, but I think any parent knows how to self edit if they feel the need to. A great treasure to add to your library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad,","review":"Imagine William Hung fronting a bad Velvet Underground cover band. The music is crap. The lyrics are pablum. The album is tedious and aimless. Each song is torturously long and remains uninteresting nonetheless. This is self-indulgent tripe and anything but poetry.

Listen to some clips immediately and torture yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived and disjointed","review":"Chai attempts to write many different stories and have them converge. The result is a hodge-podge of poorly developed characters whose relationships feel contrived.Chai builds suspense by foreshadowing events, but she abuses this ploy too often! It became an annoyance.The scope of this book is ambitious, and Chai cannot live up to the challenge. Characters, emotions, and plots are lost in the hands of an amateur storyteller.\\"The Last Time I Saw My Mother\\" was a touching book, but this second novel is very poorly written."},{"rating":"1","title":"where's the button?","review":"it's supposed to have a button to press on so your jewels can be fitted onto your materials, but it doesn't have a button.when i press on the jewels manually, the pokie things stick out and it's unsafe."},{"rating":"1","title":"No power, viberates itself to death","review":"Just used on a weekend camping trip and we are frequent campers. You have to be within 2 ft of the thing to feel any breeze at all and thats on the high setting. And when its on the high setting the thing can't sit still it viberates so bad that it bounces off the table or whatever you set it on. We ended up hanging it up so it didnt fall over in our tent. It ran all night on high so i guess the battery life is good but you may be better off checking out other fans if you plan on using this while camping."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak and noisy","review":"This fan produces a gentle breeze that can cool off a small tent on a hot night.

When the fan is jiggled a bit, it runs for a second and shuts down. Looks like the wires are bad. I would never buy it again or recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I really wanted to like this fan. The rubber blades are perfect for preventing injury in a cramped tent. But there are many problems with this fan.1) The circular part has arms that simply plug into the base; so the fan can flop backwards and end up facing the ceiling instead of facing you. There's no way to lock it in place or tighten the grip of these arms.2) When packing the fan in a bag, the circular section will definitely come off (i.e. the arms will detach), and when this happens, the only thing holding the fan part to the base is a thin electrical cord, which will obviously break if any strain is put it on it. So this is NOT designed to be thrown in a bag, which makes no sense for a camping fan!3) I swear this thing eats batteries like they were candy. There has to be another battery powered fan that doesn't kill 4 Ds immediately."},{"rating":"1","title":"You Get What You Pay For","review":"Very cheaply made product. Took it on a recent very hot 7-day camping trip. The first night-and-a-half, it was a blessing as it was the difference between sleeping and not sleeping in a hot tent. But then it just quit working in the middle of the night. Replaced batteries, but no luck, and very little sleep for the rest of the week. I normally only buy premium products so that I don't have these type of headaches, but just couldn't find a higher quality unit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected,","review":"I bought 2 of these fans, since my daughter and I were going camping with a group in July. While the fans worked well when they worked, they did not last more than one night. Both fan's started slowing down and speeding up, then stopped completely. We changed out the batteries (I had purchased Duracell and new ones) without any luck, even though the fans were suppose to last longer than 7 hours on one set of batteries. The other 3 nights were very uncomfortable as it was very humid and muggy. I have return them to Amazon and plan on getting a different brand. Very disappointed with Coleman, this is the second item I have purchase of their's that did not hold up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for half of one night","review":"I bought this fan to take on a recent camping trip where we slept in a tent for two nights. I brought this fan(new in the box) with 4 brand new D batteries. The box advertises that the fan will run for 21 hours of continuous use on one set of batteries. The fan was not running when we woke up on the first morning and did not work for the rest of our trip. With 85% humidity, I was not too pleased. We did check the batteries in our air mattress pump, and they were still charged. I will be returning this fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't last long","review":"The fan worked great, for an hour or two. Then it used up all the batteries and died.

We took it on a camping trip and it did ok the first time. We just took it on a 2nd camping trip and it was pitiful. It was very loud and put out very little air. I thought maybe it just needed new batteries, nope. We put fresh batteries in it and it didn't change at all. As a one time use item it isn't bad, but to pay $20 for a one time use is not very frugal. I'm just grateful I only spent $5 on ours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great item for 1.5 weeks","review":"I like a fan when I sleep or to cool me off when it is 95+ and humid and Coleman makes good products so it was a complete surprise when this fan stopped working 1.5 weeks after I bought it. I'd laid in a supply of fresh batteries and even spent several hours taking it apart to check solders and wiring and even bypassed the switch, nothing helped. After using it for 1.5 weeks, the motor apparently died.Yes it could have been an aberration but I do not care, I'll look for a more reliable brand in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"too weak","review":"very portable but I can't really feel any air coming out of it unless I hold it right to my face and even than it is weak, it is not practical."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good circulation, too noisy","review":"The fan provided great circulation in my tent, but is VERY loud.

It put out such a good flow of air on low, I never needed high speed. It is light enough to carry around and will fit almost any where. I recommended it to many of my friends and they all are planning to get one. I wish I had it after Hurrican Rita when it was unbearably hot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drained the batteries within 6 hours!","review":"I do not recommend this fan. At least not for long-term long-hour use.I initially bought this to help me sleep, I'm currently living off-grid, and since my main source of power is a generator, I obviously can't leave it going all night to power a regular fan. So I figured, hey, why not buy a battery-powered fan? Now I wasn't expecting this fans batteries to really last more than 2-3 days, but I was very surprised when this fan drained the four D batteries before my alarm even went off the next morning!Perhaps this fan is good for only occasional use, but it really didn't push much air around and it also made a strange grinding noise after only about 2 hours.All and all, not a good fan. I found a much better (and only 2 dollars more expensive) fan at walmart in the camping section which only takes two D batteries, and the battery life lasts much longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless","review":"I used this for a 3 day - 2 night camping trip. It worked for the first two days, I would turn it off when I wasn't in the tent, and first night. On the second night it stopped running, I replaced the batteries and it still didn't work. I fussed with it for about an hour, trying to spin the blades to encourage it. It would spin a couple times and then stop again. I finally gave up and dealt with the uncomfortable heat the best I could. When I got home I just tossed it in the trash. It wasn't even worth bothering sending back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked for less than ten hours","review":"This fan is a waste of money. When we set it up, it worked perfectly.

Komen 60 mile 3 day walk. We would be tent camping the beginning of August in Chicago and I knew the tents would be hot. I searched quite a bit for small battery operated fans and thought I had found a winner. We had to pack light so needless to say, the boxes got tossed. One fan did not even work the first night. The other two worked during the walk - thank goodness. Without the box, I was afraid I would not be able to return the non-working fan. Since the other two were working I figured I had received one lemon. However, fan #2 quit working after the 4th use, about a month later. The 3rd quit working after the 6 use, about 2 months later. I am totally disappointed that Coleman would manufacture such a cheap, worthless product. The price was very reasonable, but I guess it is true what they say - you get what you pay for. And these fans definitely are not worth even 1 cent!"},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISAPPOINTED!!!

Bummed about the waste of money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No need to overheat while summer camping","review":"My spouse used this while camping in 100 degree heat wave. Since the blades are foam, your little ones fingers or toes won't be in danger if they get to close. It is quiet and collapses on itself when you want it out of the way. The speed setting isn't too fast but I think it would be noisier if it was faster. Glad I bought it since my kids won't sleep if they are too warm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for a while","review":"I was very impressed with this fan right up to when it stopped working. I put maybe 4 hours on in before it started to make a little clicking noise. After about 8 hours it just stopped.I don't think this fan was really engineered with any durability in mind.

I have tried to get a second one from 3 different retail outlets (including Amazon) recently to have for power failures and camping (batteries last an entire 3 day weekend). The fan motor is now mounted very loosely in the housing which causes the fan to wobble which makes it extremely noisey.

I spent $14 on 8 D batteries for the 2 units.) We went camping and turned the fans on when we went to bed in our tent. Woke up in the middle of the night and they weren't running. They ran out of juice sometime in the middle of the night. Wouldn't even make it one night. And this happened with both fans - both ran out about the same time. I estimate they made it about 6 hours. It was about 80 degree weather."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak and cheap, but is what it is","review":"We bought two of these after Gustav hit this summer and we realized we'd be without power for weeks.They run fairly efficiently, when you can get the switch to stay in position. They'd run for several days on 4-D batteries when set to the low position. They also ran quite nicely on rechargeable alkaline batteries.They are too big to take camping, but we'll hang on to them for the next hurricane.Overall, I was disappointed with the build quality. They won't put up with any abuse, and I feel certain I'll be replacing the switch at some point. The exposed blade is soft foam and doesn't hurt, but is probably still not safe around little kids or cats."},{"rating":"1","title":"To noisy to sleep","review":"Too noisy to sleep.

It was so loud in my house I can't imagine in a quiet tent. Stay away from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money! Shame on Coleman!","review":"Bought this fan for a camping trip, loaded the batteries in it when it arrived, and it worked fine. Took it on the camping trip, and it turned off after an hour.

I used it about 5 times for about 30-45 minutes each time. Then today, the fan would operate very slowly. Thought batteries were dead, but like other bad reviews about this fan, seems there is an electrical problem because changing batteries did not help. But, I will say that I left the fan in my car and that could have affected it, but looking at other reviews, it just seems that this fan is poorly build. Do not recommend. Do not buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bought 3 - All 3 Terrible","review":"I bought three of these to go camping with, and here's how they fared:(1) Wouldn't even turnover. Nothing. Not even with help.(2) Would struggle to turnover. With help it would spin for about 10 seconds then die.(3) Worked but rattled a lot. It would blow wind and we used it, but it was extremely annoying and prevented sleep so we had to turn it off.The 3rd one would blow air quite well and it was a very nice breeze. These products have potential, but simply don't work as they should.Yes, the batteries were new and we tried changing around the batteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken from the start","review":"Unfortunately we waited to use the fan at the camp site.

We were disappointed and I have to send it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage.","review":"I purchased this fan last year from amazon for a summer camping trip. It functioned for fewer than five total hours before failing completely on the first day of use. Even a full change of batteries couldn't get it to work again.

They are compact, and light (until you put in 4 D batteries). We used them twice, and one of them just quit. I grew up using high quality Coleman gear, and these simply don't live up to the Coleman reputation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect lightweight individual fan","review":"I had read slightly negative reviews from other sources that this fan didn't do much at all. For me, it fit what I wanted exactly. 1-2 person tent, move air, done. It's not a \\"powerful yet small fan for the home\\" so don't expect that. It does move air, dry out a tent, create a hum for sleeping, cool you off, blow bugs away from the entrance, fold flat, and have foam blades which I think is a good safety feature. I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Packs a punch.","review":"Nice little fan. Powerful for it's size. Use it at work to cool down and circulate air on those hot days.

Anyone who likes mariachi music will not be disappointed with this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Complete with book and translations!","review":"A great enhancement to this vivid mariachi CD is that an attractive booklet comes with it. Included is a short history on the mariachi, the evolution of the instruments and info on Mariachi Cobre. According to the booklet, this world class group has performed for former President Ronald Regan's inauguration in 1984. This material is in Spanish and English.Song TranslationsWhat a treat to have the English translations along with the Spanish lyrics! And the font is big enough to read well.This group is vivid! The many sounds of the mariachi instruments are present. The voices are varying, pure, rich and loud. Often times, the voices sound of a chorus, while the music is orchestral.\\"Guadalajara\\" which often is strong on the trumpet, features the strumming of strings. It's unique. There is a lot of music I had not heard before. This is entertaining!....Rizzo"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best of the best","review":"If you know good music, then this CD is a must for your collection.

Great vocals, great music, great listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful, traditional mariachi music","review":"I've been looking for some traditional mariachi music, but since my Spanish speaking and reading skills are limited, trying to find what I wanted in Walmart or other stores was frustrating.

This one definitely takes the cake as the darkest of his novels! It is certainly more gory and sadistic than anything else that I have read by him, but as usual, Laymon's writing kept me in suspense. He has a knack for creating tension and suspense, even when the premise of his story is a bit unbelievable. That is what keeps me coming back for more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"enjoyable possibly?","review":"I would give this five stars if there wasn't so many confusing and /or annoying typos.

I don't know if I want to continue dishing out almost $7.00 to be confused."},{"rating":"1","title":"I usually love Richard Laymon books.....","review":"....but this is the most disturbing, disgusting, pathetic piece of trash that he's ever written. I have read a lot of Laymon's books and I always enjoy them. I am only halfway through this book, and I'm debating whether or not I want to finish it. After reading this far, though, I think that either Laymon was a disturbed individual, or this book is just a lame attempt at writing something \\"shocking.\\" It is page after page of gruesome and horrible violence that turns my stomach. Just the plot of the book...in which a group of guys go and slaugther entire families for the hell of it...is just sick. If you enjoy reading about guys torturing, raping, mutilating, and killing adults, kids, and animals and then wearing their skin as clothes...then this is the book for you. If not...then avoid this garbage and read one of Laymon's other books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Will NOT fit Sportster model SP-R2","review":"Product description is not adequate.

I own the Sportster 5 and it fits snugly into the single-pouch case. The seems are stitched well and seem sturdy. The inside lining is soft enough so that it doesn't scratch the screen of your receiver. The case is also stiff enough to help protect your receiver in case you place it inside luggage or a larger carrying case.THERE IS NO SEPARATE COMPARTMENT FOR THE REMOTE. In fact, I cannot see the remote fitting in with a Sportster 4 or 5, only with a slimmer model like the Starmate.Overall, great product for the price.

Beautifully acted by a stellar cast. Ioan Gruffudd shines as Pip. Pip undergoes profound change throughout the story, and there's not a false moment in Gruffudd's performance. Ian McDiarmid as Pip's creepy guardian Mr. Jaggers and Charlotte Rampling as the creepy Miss Havisham also excel. Another superb BBC production."},{"rating":"1","title":"crappy preview","review":"I was hoping for a preview that would give me a taste of what the movie entails...this preview does nothing. Unless the entire movie is of a field. A waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"a good film but not a good adaptation","review":"I'll have to disagree with most of the reviewers of this latest effort of translation Dickens' classic story. First of all, there are too many important scenes ommited. Also, some important charcters of the original stories have become so one dimentional that their presences seem not revalent at all. Pitt's sister Geogiana, who is supposed to be so vivid in the book, has been reduced to a totally dull character without any emotion. Anyway, I would suggest everyone to go back to the 1946 David Dean's version, which is far superior than this 1999 one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good translation of a classic!","review":"Great Expectations is easily my favorite of the Dickens classics. With that being said, normally when you translate a book into a movie, something is lost in the shuffle. Mobile Masterpiece Theater has done a marvelous job, though capturing the heart of the tale.Iaon Gruffuddd, of A&E's spectacular Horatio Hornblower series, does a good job as an adult Pip, however in his days working as Joe's apprentice I did not really feel that he adequately conveyed Pip's disatisfaction at being there very well or appearing embarrassed once he does come into his fortune and Joe visits.Joe, on the other hand, is portrayed perfectly, as is Pip's aunt Miss Havisham and Estella. The plot is followed accurately, though at a breakneck speed, which causes the story to feel a bit rushed. All in all, though, it is a fairly good interpretation that anyone who enjoys the story would do well to pick up."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Production is Great......But dont Buy this DVD","review":"Even though I have never read the book I found this Production very good.I would recommend this to any one who is a Dickens Fan but do youself a favour and dont buy this DVD release.As a British review on Amazon uk site indicated this DVD looks as if it was copied straight off the TV and also the commentary in the beginning and end of the movie telling us about the Great Expectations novel made the DVD worse.Masterpiece Theatre has spoiled this Great BBC Production of Dickens Great Expectations with it's Commentary (even though they think they are being helpful- but are not) and poor DVD.Four Stars for the Production itself but giving this Two stars because of the DVD quaility.Wait until BBC Release a DVD of the Production and the DVD quaility will be much, much better.I will be selling this DVD and wait until BBC release the DVD in Australia."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Rendition","review":"I guess I'm the only one disappointed in the Masterpiece Theater adaptation of Great Expectations, but I was. Ioan Gruffudd is a fine actor, but he is no Pip. The only aspect of his portrayal I liked was his devotion to Estella. Even his horror at discovering the identity of his real benefactor was too \\"subtle\\" and too short-lived.I was even more disappointed in Charlotte Rampling's Miss Havisham. She was too young, too soft-spoken, and too kindly -- not at all cold and distant -- and not at all manipulative. And the scene of her incineration is terribly overdone.From the beginning ... in which we are told of Pip's visit to the graveyard ... to the end ... which is not at all in keeping with the spirit of Dickens' ambiguous ending ... this was a true disappointment.The Anthony Calf, Anthony Hopkins production for the Disney Channel is far superior. I wish that one were offered for sale."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Expectations Box Set","review":"This movie follows the book pretty well. My 8th grade students enjoyed it. We watched the movie before we read the book since sometimes the book can be hard to follow with the English flavoring in the language and the many characters. I would reccommend this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad DVD production","review":"The video quality of this fine adaptation is terrible. I've been waiting years for a DVD release only to be dissapointed by the poor video transfer to DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Expecting Something Great","review":"Taking Charles Dickens' 521 page novel and turning it into a film is no easy matter, but this version seems to do a good job, following the life of Pip, the poor-turned-rich-turned-poor again young man who wants to become a gentleman. Although this version doesn't offer many radical elements from the director, it does show chaos and darkness in the seeking of fortunes and offers a look into the neurotic behaviors lurking in our lives. These expectations may not be great, but they certainly are worth watching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Lasts Forever","review":"What amazes me about \\"Nothing Lasts Forever\\" is the incredible number of hackneyed and overdone literary conventions that Sheldon manages to cram into one book.

It just seems as if it does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Page turner, excellent","review":"it is a great book. I read it on my vacation and finished it in one day.

From an author who has given us such masterful novels as \\"Rage of Angels\\", \\"Master of the Game\\" and \\"If Tomorrow Comes\\", \\"Nothing Lasts Forever\\" would have to rate as the worst. The characters are one-dimensional, the plot is paper-thin, and at times I found myself laughing aloud at some of the situations. Page Taylor's only childhood friends were the animals she grew up with. Give me a break!! \\"The Stars Shine Down\\" was passable, \\"Morning Noon and Night\\" was a mess. I just hope that the \\"Best Laid Plans\\" is much improved, but then, as the title goes, \\"Nothing Lasts Forever\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing Lasts Forever- Including This Book","review":"Good grief. If Sheldon weren't dead I'd sue him for the time I wasted reading this. Episodic, contrived, 0 character development. I cared nothing for any of these characters, and raced through the second half of the book using the old trick of reading just the first sentence of each paragraph, and missed nothing.This is just the type of thing you'd see on TV- hey, wait a minute, maybe that's why he wrote this in the first place. You gotta respect the man's productivity- he's had his fingers in more entertainment industry pies than any 10 other successful creative artists.

Put 'em together and we've got Nothing Lasts Forever.Nothing about 'Nothing...' stood out to me as notable or special. Distinguishing marks there ain't. The characters were two-dimensional and the storylines felt like bare bones structures that needed more fleshing out in order to call them Sheldon's own. It would have been better if the book wasn't written almost entirely in snippet-style; maybe then there would have been more of a complex plot and developed characters.Even though it was (obviously) a novel, it read like the screenplay of a movie or soap opera. I could imagine the music that would be played during the scenes, and what it would look like picture-wise. Not because of amazing descriptive powers, but because it felt like worn-out standards I've seen hundreds of times. We even get the whole sentence or two summary of what all happened to everyone at the end.

I feel that God has raised them up for todays generation of listeners...without a doubt !Some favorite tracks of mine,include; \\"Hey Y'all\\", \\"Lord you are\\", \\"Jerseys and Fitteds\\", \\"Check for us\\", and \\"BIG WORDS\\" :)I don't care what race, creed, culture, or class you are....there is something in a Cross movement CD that you all need and will spiritually benefit from.

Since it was very old, most of the standard cradle mattresses would not fit. I finally found this one and it was perfect. It was shipped very quickly and I had no issues at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Folded in half to ship!","review":"I ordered this mattress because we got a bassinet second-hand that was supposedly larger than most other bassinets. The fit was perfect HOWEVER, the mattress had been folded in half for shipment. It had a huge fold in the middle of it and wouldn't lay flat. After leaving it out of the box for 2 days, the mattress was mostly flat but there are still creases at the edges and I can only place it into the bassinet one way or else it pops up in the middle. I contacted the company and they simply instructed me to leave it flat and it would resolve itself. If I had more time before the baby comes, I would definitely return it. Which is a shame because it's really a nice mattress other than the giant crease in it from shipping... It would be so easy for the company to ship it a different way to avoid this problem but they don't seem like they plan to do this anytime soon so please beware!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Basic, but what else do you need?","review":"Compared to pricier brands we saw in brick-and-mortar stores, my wife and I took a chance on this mattress. It fit inside the bassinet perfectly, provided enough cushion for our baby, but was not too cushiony to present a danger to her. It had spill/urine-resistant covering which always kept the wetness on the outside (to be easily wiped away).What more do you need?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Size does not match specs","review":"This is suppose to be a 16 X 32 mattress. It is not. It's actual measurements are 15.75 X 31. Needless to say it does not fit properly, which is a safety issue. I'm very disappointed.I attempted to return this item but ran into issues huge isses with the seller. The seller was extremely slow at responding to emails and never refuned my money (dispite having mailed the mattress back to them). My money was finally refunded when I had involved Amazon.com. I wish I didn't purchase this.NOTE, in my original feed back I left the seller a 2 star rating. However, I have since changed that rating to a 1 star. The reason for the one star is due to (1) the continued difficulty in getting my refund; and (2) because the seller contacted me after leaving 2 stars and offered me free sheets and a 10% off coupon if I changed my rating. I find conducting poor business and then later bribing customers to give you a high rating to be extremely unethical."},{"rating":"2","title":"PetSafe Deluxe Spray Bark Collar","review":"I could not use this PetSafe Spray Bark Collarbut I am very very disappointed in Amazon's AntOnlinethey did not accept my return for my money back...sayingI used product too much and I did not!

We did trim it following the directions and used it. When it worked it did make him stop barking but it had to be fussed with often. Refilling, retightening etc. It made him very wary and nervous when it worked. He learned quickly when it was on or off. Once he barked when my grandaughter was sitting by him and they both got sprayed no ill effects for either but a lot of complaining. It worked approximately 3 days. The 4 flashes light came on and won't go off. This indicates no fill. But even though I fill it ???? It won't work anymore. So I don't recommend this particular collar. It's way too much $$$ for 3 days of silence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not help with barking but seems well made.","review":"I purchased this for my 20 lb. mix-breed and it has not helped at all. The first time that he barked with it on it made him jump, but he kept right on barking. I thought maybe I didn't have it adjusted correctly, so I refitted the collar to his neck. Didn't help a bit. He is a rather neurotic dog, so that might have something to do with it. I will say that the collar seems well made and sturdy. The instructions are very clear and easy to follow. I just wish the collar would have helped!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It Broke","review":"I'm not sure what happened, but this thing stopped working after a couple of weeks.

The term implies something special or extended in nature, and it is just not the case. What was delivered was 3 separate DVDs, shrink-wrapped and banded together with a flimsy paper wrapper. Each identical title can be purchased separately for a fraction of the ~$50 cost of this so-called \\"collection\\".

Shame on you, Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"great films, poor packaging","review":"The DVDs are great. They have lots of great extras, including commentary on additional scenes, insightful commentary in general, cast bios, etc. I was disappointed in the packaging -- flimsy cardboard and are smaller than more traditional packages.I received these as a gift, and I think that as a gift, they are great.I have watched these films over and over again and enjoy them each time. The acting is incredible and it amazes me that it's improvised -- the actors make it look so easy, which means it must be difficult! In A Mighty Wind, all the actors sing and play their own instruments, with some learning just for this film. Great dedication to their artform."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anita lacks ethical integrity","review":"Anita doesn't believe a woman making a false charge of rape should be charged for destroying young boys' lives.

Sorry Edward, but you are far from a \\"travel guru\\" as you are so apt to call yourself. Your book is weak -- too full of your opinions and repetitive information -- I wouldn't recommend this one, folks. Try \\"World Stompers\\" instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just didn't live up to its legend","review":"As I began planning my RTW travels two years ago I kept hearing the refrain from family and friends, \\"buy the nomad book!\\" So, being an open minded sort of gal, I decided to try it on for size. Much to my disappointment this book was less about helpful travel tips and tales and more of Mr. Hasbrouck's long-winded but short-sited opinions. Like a previous reader said, I'd buy this book maybe for the airfare info--which is a bit outdated--and that's all. On second thought, you can get most of the airfare info from the Lonely Planet or Rough Guide books. I bought the nomad book... and was glad I left home without it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good how-to guide, but incomplete, does not list benefits and reasons","review":"This book though, only gets into a few reasons for exploring the world, describing only a few benefits that are at the tip of the iceberg. The rest if mostly a how-to guide that covers some practical aspects of it. So far, there hasn't been a book that addresses all the deep real life reasons for living overseas. In short, it talks only about the HOW of expatriation, not the WHY. And shouldn't the WHY be dealt with first? That's what all these authors seem to be missing, except for me. Perhaps the \\"WHY\\" reasons are taboo?[...]Thanks for reading this review.Sincerely,Winston"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the RTW travel guides. Period.","review":"We're 7 months from an 11 month trip around the world and this book is IT for authoritative information. If you are flying to a vacation spot you need this book. Although the book is long and detailed we found it's completeness a real help. Hasbrouck is a detail oriented guy that you would want for a travel agent. His section on air travel is unbeatable. I have read nearly all of the round the world guides and this is the best bar none."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have accomplished as much with half as many pages","review":"Overall this book was helpful in understanding a lot of the aspects of world travel, but it could have been half as long. The detailed info about air travel (over 100 pages!) was repetitive and not too useful. The authors anti-American, anti-US government, anti-big business bias got to be a bore after awhile. This book covered a lot of ground but World Stompers was a more useful book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Likes to hear himself talk","review":"While this book had a few good travel suggestions, I found it annoying that the author kept interjecting his personal opinions about every and all subjects. His accusations and conclusions were never supported with actual facts. He seems to view himself as a concerned citizen of the world with a strong social conscience, but he comes off as didactic and offensive. Very distasteful. There are many better books out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hasbrouck helped me have a life again","review":"We not only used the book as a guide for our 15 month trip to four continents, we also booked many of our tickets through Hasbrouck. Of course, the book had great value without the author's direct involvement. It isn't the type of book that you need to bring on an extended trip--it is more like the Bible for the 3 months that you spend preparing for that trip. It helps focus your thoughts on what kind of trip you'd like and how to go about achieving it. It is probably most useful for those who feel that experiencing other cultures, as opposed to serial sightseeing, is the most important element of an extended journey. Also, Hasbrouck' extensive experience as a travel agent shines through the extraordinarily useful section on how airfares work and how to find the best one (not necessarily the lowest one) for your needs. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Info I couldn't find elsewhere","review":"This book is intimidating when you first pick it up and start paging through it, but I quickly found answers to some questions that I was having difficulty getting answers to such as 1) How do I carry all that currency that I'm going to need for 6 months? and 2) How practical is it to send pictures over the internet? and 3)Help - I'm not on an open-jaw or round-the-world ticket what are my options?Some of the stuff I don't agree with, like the recommendation against carrying a camera, but there are a lot of Practical tips in here.This book is much easier to deal with than the net groups I've been reading. Those are FULL of egos and biases and this book is no worse (if not better) in terms of bias It also has the added bonus of not having to wade through the flame wars about how stupid someone is."},{"rating":"1","title":"too wordy","review":"Good information, but way too wordy. I mean, how many times can you say the same thing in so many words without being redundant? I prefer the other similar travel book \\"World Stompers\\". Fun, like travel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent resource","review":"THE PRACTICAL NOMAD has a wealth of information pertinent to anyone leaving the country, especially if they are independent travelers. It was the main resource used when planning a trip around the world with my daughters who were ages 11 and 13 at the time. It's not the kind of book to take with you on a trip, it's the kind of book to read before and during the planning phase of your trip. THE PRACTICAL NOMAD covers topics from helping travelers understand the travel industry to health and safety issues to keep in mind. I can't say enough good things about this book and how important it has been to me as a resounce."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your money!!! spend it traveling instead!","review":"I bought this book hoping to pick up some good tips. Honestly, I'm not a world traveller (yet) and I'm not that good at finding things on line. Imagine my disapointment, when this book offered nothing that the average person doesn't already know. The Practical Nomad takes way too many pages to tell you practically nothing. Yet, Hasbrouck is quick to congratulate himself on how smart he is. He seems more smug than informed. I can only recommend this book if you just crawled out from under a rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading Title","review":"This book is an encyclopedia of travel including a lengthy discussion of how the travel industry operates. However, the specifics on how to travel around the world are only covered superficially. After reading this book and the Rough Guide equivalent, one may conclude that the definitive book on around-the-world travel has yet to be researched and written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spiral bound version not the same as hard-copy version","review":"I'm not going to try to add anything to the already wonderful comments on this cookbook. However, I would like to point out that the spiral version is nothing like the hard-copy version. The format is completely different, with the recipies being printed on 5x5\\" cards that are spiral bound and are designed to flip over a built-in easel to aid in cooking while cooking.There are no pictures of any of the end results. I must admit that I get inspired by looking at pictures, so the lack of them really reduces the usability/desirability of this book.I had seen the hard-copy,which I loved, before purchasing the spiral bound version which got exchanged for the hard-copy version."},{"rating":"2","title":"You are not a serious griller if you don't have this book","review":"This was the first 'serious' bbq book I bought and it has been through so much abuse since I got it that it's a credit to the bookbinding art in this country that it is still whole. I would have given it 5 stars were it not for some annoying formatting in the book that puts some recipes on too many pages; it would have been possible to reformat it to make the recipes easier to flip through. But that is a very minor complaint in comparison with the outrageously good information that this book provides."},{"rating":"1","title":"This aint no BBQ book!","review":"After having read a couple supposed \\"impartial\\" reviews of this book on the net and in other print mediums, where it was hailed as the Bible of BBQ, I ordered this book and its sequel \\"License to Grill\\". My opinion? I WASTED MY MONEY. This book has very very little to do with BBQ. If my memory is correct, it has about 5 recipies or so dealing with real BBQ. Im not talking grilling, im talking barbequeing... and those shopping for a BBQ probably know the difference. As grilling books go, its alright. (thus why i didnt give it only 1 star), but the book would have been better titled as \\"The carribean grill\\". The whole book is about grilling carribean style. This applies little to someone seaking a true BBQ book. This book is WAY overhyped in the BBQ/grilling community. (this review based upon my reading of about 8 BBQ cookbooks, a dozen webpages, several FAQs)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cookbook not just BBQ","review":"I have seen many references to this book from various online recipe sites. Occasionally a recipe has been copied verbatim from the book and posted online. It is nice to see that the publishers had the good sense not to make a fuss over such a thing because testing some of those recipe samples led me to buy this fantastic book. I don't like to be critical of anyone else's review but, frankly I would never want to eat anything made or preferred by someone who would give this book a bad reference. This is a great culinary guide. I strongly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Flavors, Great Recipes and Fantastic Writing","review":"This book is a great adventure in grilling!

This book was so hyped in many reviews, that I put it at the top of a new pile of 5 books on the subject to read, only to wonder what I missed! I agree with the review above that says it should be titled 'Carribean Grill'. Nothing wrong with that sort of flavor, just don't tout the book to be all grilling/BBQ inclusive. It's not! I only garnered a handful of recipes from the entire book. Borrow it before you buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"intricate source","review":"while this is a most useful and effective BBQ book it is not for novices.

Robertson continually dishes out his poison all the while blinking with his eyes half closed, his mouth twitching, and this idiotic **** eating grin.If he didn't influence so many, he would just be another sad joke. But unfortunately people listen to this man talk of praying away hurricanes, how Hurricane Katrina and 9/11 occured because of God's wrath, how the citizens of Dover, Pa. can't expect God's help because they turned their backs on God and on and on and on.

Anyway, the storylines now click, the banter and comedy flow naturally (none of the \\"trying too hard\\" syndrome I noticed first time out), and the actors are delivering the goods. Much has been made of Jeremy Piven nailing his role of Ari, but the supporting cast (especially the guy who plays Lloyd, Ari's secretary) are really hitting their marks too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too expensive","review":"NOTE: This review only pertains to the price of this box set, not the show.

There's so much that's good here it's hard to know where to begin. The film's heart belongs to Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara (and if you admire these two actors that makes this film a must see--for their vocal performances alone). But after repeated viewings I think the best--and strangest--performances were given by Jane Lynch and John Michael Higgins (who both outdo their excellent work in \\"Best in Show\\", I can only hope there's a film in the future which better shows their awesome talents). Lastly, BUY THE SOUNDTRACK! For reasons I don't understand this film didn't showcase the songs the way Spinal Tap did. If you see this film, listen to the soundtrack, and see it again, you'll understand how great is the whole package."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Spinal Tap, for the folk set","review":"Loving send up of the often pretentious and all-too-serious world of folk music - that four-letter word.Terrific songs (We Never Did no Wanderin'), great performances...with Fred Willard a particular stand-out.

Since then I can't get enough of this comic genius and his band of merry maniacs.As for \\"A Mighty Wind\\" Eugene Levy steals the show in this one, there is no doubt. Fred Willard is his usual annoying self once again, and of course we get the musical musings of McKean, Guest, and Shearer once again.I am eagerly waiting for my orders that include \\"Best in Show\\", The Return of Spinal Tap\\" and \\"For Your Consideration\\" to arrive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland","review":"These people are funny... on their other movies. I think the target, folk music, is just inherently bland as a topic for a satire. Whatever the reason, this is nowhere near as funny as anything else done by these people.

In short, the humor isn't nearly brutal enough. Having been around the folk music scene, I could put together a funnier and much more surreal film from documentary footage."},{"rating":"1","title":"A pathetic breeze","review":"'This is Spinal Tap' is one of my favourite comedies, so when I heard that the same team had created in 'A Mighty Wind' a comic exposee of the folk music scene, I rushed to hire the DVD.'A Mighty Wind', is disappointingly unfunny, unrealistic, saccharine and boring. All of the characters are unbearably squeaky clean. There are no drug scenes, tantrums, overblown egos or any of the comedic effects that are part of the music scene in general, in all its aspects, from heavy metal to Christian rock."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Mighty Miss","review":"Too much missing here, too much of the folk scene ignored, too many opportunities for conflict passed over. All in all it's a rather boring movie, but not quite as boring as its website.For us, Guest and Levy missed the essentials of the folk scene with it's ego-driven characters, its groupies, it's drugs, and it's battles between the traditionalists and the new folkies who were writing their own songs. As far as this movie is concerned, those things never happened, and the characters here had no visible lives between their folk days and their reunion days. Pretty bland.Can't recommend this one to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"horrible,horrible,horrible movie","review":"This movie and the three others by this same writer/director are just horrible.

None of the characters was engaging or even resonated.I'd skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Mighty Bore","review":"OK, how many times can this cast milk it? I love every one in this movie, but I couln't get past the fact that this cast has made three really similar movies in a row.

The material wasn't that strong, I couldn't watch the whole thing, maybe 40 minutes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ashcan it now","review":"This was on the local PBS affiliate tonight. They normally have better taste. I loved \\"Spinal Tap\\". \\"The Last Waltz\\", etc. Even Eugene Levy bombed in this one, though. To Harry Shearer and all the rest of you who think you are great \\"satirists.\\" You're boring. You're not funny. You couldn't kiss the tuchus of the great satirists (Smothers Brothers, Newhart, Berman, Nichols & May, etc., etc.). You really lucked out having careers in showbiz rather than asking me if I want fries with that. No wonder you're so insecure. You know you're worthless. Watch the great ones like Caesar, Steve Allen, Steve Martin, etc. They were giants. You're just ants. And very annoying ones.Comedy is supposed to be FUNNY. Yeah."},{"rating":"1","title":"SIMPLY BORING FOLKS","review":"Sorry folks, I did not laugh at all. It was depressing even. I am 46 years old and wished it was to recall the folk era but it did I did not see it as a comedy. But then I like Airplane and Austin Powers movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible movie, I'm so embarassed","review":"I bought this movie as a gift for my brother because it was cheap, he likes folk music, and because 'Spinal Tap' and 'Best in Show' are hilarious. I'd never seen it, but since it came from the people who put out those movies, it had to be at least decent, right? WRONG!!This is the worst comedy I've ever seen in my life. There I was, after Christmas with my family, and we decide to pop it in. 'It should be great', I tell them. Then silence. Then my mom fell asleep. Then people decided to get up and get something to drink. Then my sister-in-law decides to 'turn in early'. Not one laugh from anyone the entire time.The only redeeming part about it was whether they were going to kiss at the end. Excuse me, if that's the only redeeming quality about a COMEDY, then that blows.God, I'm never buying a movie sight unseen again. Thankfully it wasn't my brother's only present."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very entertaining","review":"This movie is very entertaining. Despite the fact that I don't normally enjoy folk music, the songs are very enjoyable, too, if you listen to the ridiculous lyrics. And I really appreciate that they hired actors who actually play instruments, or who at least do an excellent job of pretending.There are a lot of fun special features on the DVD. The colorful music video and guest appearance on a fake TV show are my favorites. There are also quite a few deleted scenes, most of which are as good as anything left in the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mighty Disappointed","review":"While I've greatly enjoyed the work of Guest, Levy, O'Hara, etc. in the past, I found this work sub-par. It looks like they put a lot of work into this mockumentary, effectively simulating realistic folk songs and singers, but the whole thing seemed like a very long set-up for a punch line that never came. I think they probably had a good concept, definitely good comic actors and good production techniques, but they forgot to bring the funny. Good for a couple of chuckles at best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these actors","review":"Although not as laugh out loud as Best In Show, it's still quirky. Intelligent humor for adults who remember tho old time folk singers. No ones spoofs better than this group of actors. And the best part is that they rotate the types of characters they play. No type casting, just actors who are supurb at their craft."},{"rating":"2","title":"Drop-dead hilarious","review":"This is the third of the movies Waiting for Guffman and Best in Show.I do not know how they seem to get funnier as it goes,but it is true.Although the first one is classic they each have some unique to provide.I love how they go to all extremes in each of these making it quirky and corny for fun.Definently something you should see and also check out the first two."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mighty Wind","review":"This was a wonderful spoof on a special time in music. There is some good music on the video and fun to watch with a glass of wine and friends!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Mighty Wind--funniest mocumentary since Spinal Tap","review":"I read a lot of reviews that say \\"A Mighty Wind\\" was funnier than or wasn't as funny as \\"Waiting for Guffman\\" or \\"Best in Show,\\" etc. I have a theory about that: these Christopher Guest & co. mocumentaries succeed or fail in a person's eyes to the degree that they have a connection with or knowledge of that which is being parodied. For example, I'm a musician, and I love Spinal Tap and Mighty Wind. Think they're hilarious. I don't know or care much about dog shows, and I thought Best of Show was the weakest. That being said, if you like music, or have any knowledge of folk music, you'll find this movie hilarious but at the same time a bit more poignant than usually expected from these parodies. Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara's characters provide the emotion; everyone else backs up the comedy, my personal favorite being Mr. Guest and the Folksmen, with Mr. Guest's sheep bleating baritone. See this movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A decent follow up that makes me miss the dogs!","review":"\`A Mighty Wind' is funny, it's actually really funny...it's just such a disappointment when you come off the brilliance that was \`Best in Show'. So, \`A Mighty Wind' follows the same mockumentary premise (I just love these type comedies) and it stars the same cast except instead of eccentric dog owners we have ex folk singers. So this famous record producer dies and to commemorate his life they decide to get his three biggest acts to reunite and perform a concert in his honor. \`Best in Show' MVP Parker Posey is not the highlight this time around, instead it's Eugene Levy who plays Mitch like a constipated manic depressant. Jennifer Coolidge, while only in like 2 minutes of the movie, had me rolling on the floor especially when they are all humming. Great comedy that, while not up to par with it's predecessor, still makes quite the impression."},{"rating":"2","title":"Story ok, Music great","review":"I missed \\"A Mighty Wind\\" in the theater so I purchased the DVD. Am I glad I did! The story was ok, but I really enjoyed the music. I find myself watching the PBN concert feature often because of the music. The New Main Street Singers remind me so much of the Serendipity Singers from the Folk music era. Both groups featured an ensemble of 7 men and 2 ladies. Diane and Lynne always wore matching outfits as Jane Lynch and Parker Posey did in the movie. The Serendipity Singers were known for novelty tunes like \\"Don't Let The Rain Come Down\\" and \\"Beans In My Ears\\". \\"Potato's In The Paddywagon\\" reminds me of those songs. The Folksmen successfully combined elements of the Kingston Trio and the Limelighters. Christopher Guest did a good imitation of Glenn Yarbrough. Eugene Levy and Catherine O'Hara captured the Ian and Sylvia sound.I always enjoy movies where the actors perform their own music. The actors in \\"A Mighty Wind\\" did it well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Mighty Wind -- blows","review":"I would give it less than 2, but I did enjoy some of the music, and we laughed a few times. My family didn't enjoy this \\"Mockumentary\\" very much, and the kids were pretty bored. I really blew it for picking this one out, and I'll probably never hear the end of it from my family. It was just --- weird. And that's probably why we kept watching instead of turning it off. We kept waiting for it to make a little sense, but it never really delivered. When it was over, we just kind of looked at each other in wonder and shrugged. I'm not really sure why it received so many rave reviews. But if you really want to see something \\"different\\", this is it, because I've certainly never seen anything like it before. Or as my son Jason said, \\"Wha' Happened?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"The music is great, but ...","review":"The movie drags on and on for too long. The pace is slow and the laughs are few and far in between. I have the soundtrack to this film and I love it. But when I finally got to rent the movie, I was extremely disappointed at how boring it was. Two stars for the last 20 minutes that made the movie worth watching. I recommend buying the soundtrack instead of renting this movie. You will get out of the soundtrack all that you would out of the movie and much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as their past movies","review":"I eagerly awaited this film to come out on DVD since I am a huge Christopher Guest/Eugene Levy fan. Although this movie is still much better than a lot of the stuff out there, I have to give it only 2 stars because it doesn't compare to their past films like \\"Waiting for Guffman\\" and \\"Best in Show\\". I thought some of the funniest scenes were in the bonus deleted scene footage so I highly recommend you watch this if you buy or rent the DVD.

However, I'm still disappointed since I'll have to return this, too. I buy blocks of cheddar from Costco that are like 2x2 inches and need something to slice them easily. The blade on this is too flimsy to stay straight when going through something like that. It bends sideways in the middle and won't make it to the bottom of the block without sliding way off track, making a mess of your block. You'll never get a usable cut from a somewhat hard cheese from this (and from what others say, it's useless for soft cheeses as well). It's probably useful if you are cutting blocks that are small in one dimension, like 1/2 inch by 3 inches."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't slice smoothly.","review":"I bought this slicer a couple of years ago and was very happy.

I was expecting a piece of work of the same quality as the Ships of the Line calendar. Instead the renderings were muddy, poorly anti-aliased and lacking in any kind of dynamics. The renderings were further marred by being double-page spreads. To actually see the rendering properly you would have to break the spine of the book. Included with each entry is a pointlessly geeky wireframe model of the ship. The text is the one bright spot in this otherwise poor product. These guys are capable of much better work.

Now, six years later, my skin is still glowing. It may not be for everyone, however. Another admiring friend I gave it to as a gift had to stop because it caused her to produce long, dark hairs (Maharishi Ayurveda, from whom I bought it on their site, allowed me to return it for a refund).

I am a huge fan of the 19th Century sea novels of the English Navy and their wars against France and Spain. The author, Alex Kent, is a master of bringing this era to life. His knowledge of the ships and men of that era is astonishing. The battles are so vividly written that you can almost smell the gunpowder. Along with the battle narratives, the historical political history is quite interesting and ties the story lines together in a most compelling manner."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good value but don't expect too much","review":"You're not going to find a better preamp in this price range. That said, don't expect this to have the same effect on your recordings as a thousand dollar piece from UA or Grace. The difference between its all tube and solid state settings is subtle, but it's nice to be able to blend your choice between the two. I recorded the same vocal line through the same mic with the VTB set to the tube side of the knob, and then again without the VTB and spent the better part of an hour a/b'ing the two tracks to see the difference. There is a LITTLE more warmth in the VTB, and it shows a little bit clearer, but it's not going to blow you away. A job where the VTB really shines though, I have a Duncan performer soundhole pickup for my acoustic that has always had problems direct to PA that sounds great with this added to the signal chain"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Value","review":"Very clean.

However, I liked the 11-minute \\"Tattooed Bride\\" piece even better than the long treatments of Duke's '30's classic songs, \\"Mood Indigo\\", \\"Sophisticated Lady\\" and \\"Solitude.\\" The three short bonus tracks, laid down in the same era, are also lively. Sound quality is excellent throughout. While the players varied slightly for the three minor tracks, Johnny Hodges is here on sax, Russell Procope on sax and clarinet, Paul Gonsalves on sax, and Billy Strayhorn as well as Duke on piano. Sonny Greer is the drummer for the original LP selections, and Louis Bellson for the bonus selections. Great songs, great players, great composer, great conductor, great remastering combine to make this one a winner."},{"rating":"2","title":"bosch O2 sensor","review":"Hella cheaper than a dealer, same product.

Not on mine!I wouldn't even have considered purchasing this blu-ray otherwise since I knew the watermark would take away for the beauty of the scenes. Sorry, but I'm really annoyed by those things. They're distracting.And I'd like to listen to just the natural sounds and not the piano music.It's a shame because without these annoying features, it would probably be an awesome disc.

I went on-line to investigate the issue and found that there was no support for that DVD-Player in HD. So, this five year old HD movie should not even be on the shelf for retail sale.

Checking the ad now I now see there is a disclaimer that it will only work on HD DVD devices. I am positive when I first purchased it did not say that and in fact it came up when I was looking up BLU-RAY discs for under $10. Shame on me for now just opening it up but shame on them for having it being deceivingly described originally.

While I do enjoy other nature videos from time to time, I spend time with The World's Most Beautiful Places every day. Between the absolutely amazing photography and the beautiful background music, I find it to be the most wonderfully relaxing and calming disk I have ever owned.

I always felt like he became famous more by the people he knew than anything, but he shows a true talent here and the show was surprisingly enjoyable. If you are buying it for Rosemary Clooney's part in it be aware that this show was done in her later years and she is only on here for 2 or 3 songs.

Other records by her have lost considerable quality of tone and this one is good.For anyone who wishes to hear what most Cubans in the 1950's considered the ultimate female vocalist, this is the recording to buy.

All of the songs are good, and the band plays them really well. Also, considering they're a newer band, the production is pretty much flawless (at times maybe a little over-produced). So why four stars instead of five? Because just because the songs are good doesn't mean that they're original. While the lyrics are well written so that they are good to listen to, the subject matter is the same old thing. The use of some piano and some actual guitar playing (can actually hear 2 distinct guitar parts)helps keep things interesting. So should you buy this CD? If you like The All-American Rejects, Motion City Soundtrack, and The Starting Line then you really should.

Richardson playfully compares two Churches \\"Valley view\\" and \\"Third Church\\" to juxtapose healthy Churches and dysfunctional Churches. The main ideas in the book: How well do the people in a system handle two types of anxiety (Acute/Chronic), the problems of triangulation, and for the minister to be able to mess with the congregation yet have a sense of individuality or healthy separation from the group. As a Minster of just over 13 years, I recommend the book highly. It has been labeled as an introductory level book by several others, but I think even veterans will gain immense value from reading it. The book will provoke thought and introspection while providing applicable methods to better minister to the complex groups we work with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Help for merging churches","review":"We have bought many copies of this title for our church library and the minister has asked us all to read and study it to help us get through a very difficult church merger.

The Joey Ramone penned title track is a pop masterpiece, and no one could sing it better than Ronnie Spector.

Hopefully we'll be hearing more from one of the first bad girls in rock."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ronnie sounds better than ever. Her voice is still a gem.","review":"It's always that \\"Voice\\" of hers. Her rendition of Don't Worry Baby\\" is a 5. Seems there could have been a little more Spectoresque production (more voices and even strings wouldn't have hurt. Why do critics hate strings?). The other songs were ok, but she still needs a producer who can really capture the essence of that \\"Voice\\". I'm just happy she's still around singing and hopefully this will lead to a full album that will be released domestically."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry to be a buzz kill, but...","review":"Yes, the production is fine, but frankly I find little here that interests me. In this recording, she is 56 years old and, if anything, sounds older. If you are already a fan of Ronnie Spector, I'm sure you will enjoy hearing this album. But if you are expecting to hear more of what the Ronettes used to do (and 40-plus years on, that would be an unreasonable expectation), this isn't it. Listen to the samples and make up your mind.

Ronnie can still sing, and this is a fun, albeit short, CD.

I can't pick a favorite off this EP. Opening track \\" She Talks To Rainbows\\" is an excellant piece. Ronnie's vocals prove to be strong and unique. On \\" I wish I Never Saw the Sunshine\\" a live track performed in Tokyo, Ronnie lets loose. And on \\" Bye Bye Baby\\" Ronnie and Joey Ramone duet. This is a landmark recording in the career of Ronnie Spector. She is back and better than ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neat little train","review":"My sister passed this down to me when her kids outgrew it, and it's a pretty cool ride on. My 1 year old loves to push it around, although when we first tried it, he kept tipping it over (sideways, backwards...). We solved this problem by putting my ankle weights in the handy storage space under the seat. What's nice is that the added weight stabilizes it a bit (I think it's close to 10 pounds of added weight), but doesn't make it harder to push around. I'm sure he'll love it even more when he gets the hang of sitting on it and pushing it with his feet. It went through my nephew's care looking brand new, so it has to be sturdy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"THE BEST GIFT!!","review":"My son got this for Christmas 2 years ago (he was 21mo.) and has not stopped riding it. I thought he would outgrow it within a few months, but boy was I wrong. This has been his favorite toy since the day he got it. He still rides it all the time through the house to get where he wants to go faster. This is the one toy that he can't bring himself to share with others:) It has been through a lot and is still in great shape. THE BEST GIFT EVER!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A quiet toy","review":"Fun, sturdy. Kids can learn to steer with this, but otherwise there is little learning challenge other than a few levers & a top to spin. Our 1 year old enjoys scooting around & pushing it. She uses both hands now to put things into & out of the 'trunk'. WOuld have been more fun w/ a train whistle or some other noise....if you like noise. She does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Enjoying It","review":"We bought this for our son who was 2 at the time. He is almost 4 and still enjoys riding around the house and hiding things in the seat compartment. The main complaint I have is that the seat back with the handle comes off very easily, and he gets frustrated when he picks it up to move it and that happens. Other than that, it's been a great toy that he's used much longer than I thought he would!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the money!","review":"We bought this as a Christmas present for our 18 month old twin boys two years ago. I realized they were on the older end of the age range, but we planned on another child so I knew it would go farther. The boys have loved this ride-on train since they got it! They use it almost daily. And now their 15 month old sister enjoys it, too. They all take turns chasing each other around the house. This is one toy that has never been \\"put away\\" or rotated as we do with other toys. Definitely a great toy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun ride on","review":"We got this for my son's first birthday, and he still loves this thing at the age of 2! I love that it's not an electronic toy. No assembly required or batteries needed. The only thing I will say about it is that 12 months was too young for him. He loves pulling the levers on the sides and pushing the button on top, but he wasn't interested in it as a ride on until more like 16-18 months. So if you buy it for a 12 month old don't be surprised if this happens. But you will get lots of use out of it! Very pleased!Oh, and the seat lifts up so they can store things in it! You wouldn't believe the things we have found in there! So fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My 18 month old enjoys it!","review":"This is a toy that my son will go up to on his own, and independently play with. He will get on and off it, ride it around, push it around, open and close the seat compartment to keep toys in it, press the buttons, spin the wheels. There are not that many toys that he voluntarily utilizes to their full capacity without coaxing, but this one he does. I think it is great because it is not electronic, but still stimulates him in many ways, both mentally and physically. Also, I must say, I was very happy to get the blue train that is pictured, but I would prefer if you could pick the color to ensure you are getting the oee you want."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toy!","review":"This toy comes basically assembled, all you have to do is slide the back handle into the holes and you are done. The train is very sturdy and I am not concerned about any pieces breaking or falling off. The wheels roll very easily (we have carpet) and yet at the same time my son was able to pull up on it without it falling over. My son loves it, he started using it when he began cruising around the room and in a matter of weeks was walking on his own but he still loves to walk with his train too. He is too short (10 months) to ride on the train himself but he does love to get pushed around on it. I researched a lot of walkers before picking this one and I am very happy with our purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teach 'em to walk","review":"I'd like to start my review by spreading the word I read here - If you tape some small weights inside the seat of this toy it will make it much sturdier. I put 20lbs of dumbbells in there when my daughter was first learning how to pull up so it wouldn't fall over on her.This toy was the catalyst that propelled my 11-month old baby to be an 11-month old toddler. She learned to walk by pushing on this toy. The first time she pulled herself up with this toy and walked unassisted my knees were like jello, as if it was me learning to walk for the first time!My daughters older cousins come over and play with this toy too. It's a very good value."},{"rating":"2","title":"A first birthday present","review":"I purchased this toy for my son's first birthday. He is a bit too young to ride on it yet, but he enjoys playing with all of the other bells and whistles. He also enjoys putting things in the seat compartment and then finding them again! As a walking toy, it seems very fast, although he is not walking yet and we have mostly hardwood floors. I would recommend this toy; Chicco seems to make a very solid product. An added bonus, his nearly 5 year old brother LOVES it too, so they play with it together."},{"rating":"2","title":"FUN, FUN, FUN!! Well worth the money...","review":"We got this train for my son when he was 10 mos. old (not even walking yet) and he is now almost 2 1/2 and still plays with it every day! This is some of the best money we've ever spent, especially on a toy. It is one of the first toys visiting kids play with and I am amazed at it's longevity. It still looks virtually brand new, too. Chicco makes very high quality products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Durable and entertaining toy!!","review":"My little girl received this train when she was 2 years (she is now 5 1/2), she really never engaged with it and used it once in a while mostly for storing things under the seat, but arround that time her little brother arrived and as soon as he turned 2 this became one of his favorite toys, now he is 3 1/2 and LOVES to move arround the house on it... it's an excellent excercise toy for little kids and i guess it prepares them for when they move to the bike. Despite the constant abuse by him the train still looks great and everything works like it is supposed to. It's sturdy, entertaining and easy to drive. I recommend this toy all the way. Enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good toy overall","review":"My son is 18 months and is the size of a three year old. So finding a age and size appropriate Play-n-Ride required a little more research than normal, but it was worth every minute. He enjoys the play-n-ride and plays with it often. It suits his size and age,my only problem is the handle\\\\back pulls off too easily. Overall I would recommend this toy to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun toy!","review":"My niece age 18 months loved this train. It is fun to ride and has things to push and make noises too. How much fun is that for a toddler?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an interesting toy","review":"I did extensive review before buying this product. Sadly, my baby never liked it. From the day he was crawling to the time he is a toddler running stable. He used to fall down while pushing it because of the direction control in this car. Then when he is older, it is just not interesting. The kids who come to our house for visit did not like it either. I bought him another item from target a little Disney Micky Mouse cart in the shape of a airplane. It is cheaper than this train and my son likes it a lot. He plays with it all the time. I am surprised at how many people actually like this train. This is the first time the reviews does not match up my experience on amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy for beginning walkers","review":"We got this for my 10 month old son who was starting to walk (yes, early). He LOVES it and its interactive so even when he's not pushing it, there are levers and such that he can play with. I read the reviews that it wasn't sturdy and went a little too fast for some. We found it to be durable (and our son weights about 24 lbs) and he uses it on wood floors with no problems - fast or slow, however he wants to walk. I'm also very happy that he'll be able to ride on this later because he's already starting to walk very independently."},{"rating":"2","title":"NO BATTERIES NEEDED...yeah!!!","review":"This train was the best present Santa brought to our house last year! I bought it for my one year old, but my 4 & 6 year olds can't get enough of it, too. I can definitely say that this train is durable, as I've watched the big kids push each other around the house on it every day since Christmas. My 1 year old loves all the extra gadgets as well as the compartment in the seat. The height is perfect for her to pull herself up on. Two of the best things about this train are that it does not require any batteries for any loud, obnoxious noises that I don't need around my house with three small children AND it's ready to ride straight out of the box!"},{"rating":"2","title":"He loves it!","review":"We got this for our grandson for his first birthday! It is absolutely adorable (we got the blue train engine!) and our grandson loves it! He loves pushing it around the house (and of course bumping it into things!) and even better he loves it when his pop-pop pushes him around on it! It has just enough \\"bells and whistles\\" to keep him entertained... appropriate for a baby his age! Very good purchase; I would recommend it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interminible","review":"After falling asleep 3 nights in a row trying to read this book, I finally finished it.

The plot was a clumsy mess. Kate was irritating, unlikeable and too stupid too live. Cam wasn't much better. In fact, I really didn't like much of anyone in this book & there were plot holes big enough to drive a truck through. I want to say that the motives of the killer were illogical except that really...who **wouldn't** want to kill Kate after spending just a little time with her?? Thank you, Amazon, for giving me the chance to read this for free so I now know to never pay for a book in this series. Now can I get a refund on the hours of my life I wasted reading this drivel? Sigh...."},{"rating":"1","title":"glad this was free on kindle!","review":"this was ok, but there was a lot of heavy-handed writing re trying to get us to suspect one particular character.*****SPOILER ALERT*****So--I am expected to forgive the love interest who hit his ex-wife, just the one time, because she had an abortion.

While some of the characters were interesting, I would not recommend this book to anyone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the greatest...","review":"Based on the average ratings, I expected this book to be better. James Patterson and Patricia Cornwell have nothing to fear from this author. I wish I had my time back. :-("},{"rating":"1","title":"Total suspension of common sense","review":"Although it is very obvious this author has excellent writing talent, this book needs research on police procedure. For example, the tormentor kept coming to Katie's office where the corridor was videotaped. Yet no one ever asked about or thought to ask about viewing them. No finger prints were ever taken from victim's skin. There were so many loop holes in police procedures; it was ridiculous.I also did not like the heroine. She was very immature, lazy, and silly. At any point in time, she had no clue what she was doing and readers could even guess why.Could have been a wonderful novel with a lot more research."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT recommend","review":"I really didn't care for this book. First of all, it was way too long. There was so much pointless chit-chat between the characters that I kept forgetting who the suspects were. Also, the relationship between Kate and Cam was very frustrating. *SPOILER* There is NO excuse for a man to hit is wife at all, let alone to do it so hard that he breaks her jaw!! I don't care how the author tried to explain it...this guy is a total loser! Given this, I could not buy into their romance. *END SPOILER* Kate herself was an annoying character. She carelessly puts herself into one dangerous situation after the next and then is shocked when bad things happen to her. The investigator on the case could not have been more ineffectual, basically allowing Kate to interfere in everyway including antagonizing the suspects and causing her coworker to end up in the hospital. I definitely cannot recommend this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your time!","review":"This book started with promise but swiftly deteriorated to the point where you were almost begging for the heroine to die already! The characters are unbelievable...unbelievably goody-goody, unbelievably stupid and unbelievably dull. Painful waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes and no...mostly YES","review":"The book was not a bad read, just not very realistic as far as the police work & letting others do the snooping. You think you know who did it, and then you're not so sure. I was a very anti-climatic end, but for free, not too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another idiot woman","review":"Don't get me wrong, I like fiction where the woman is a strong protagonist - but I don't suffer fools or idiots. When it is obvious someone is trying to kill her does she stay where she is supposed to in her apartment? No - she has to go on a long walk by herself. When she is warned that this one individual doesn't like her and has it out for her does she internalize the warning? No--- she writes him off as a harmless drunk. It's very obvious at the end of this book there is another one coming - I will not be buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ending so disappointing","review":"I was going to give the book a 3 or 4 until the end. The entire time the author tried to make us think that one person was the murderer. So much so that it became kind of comical. Then I realized that what would make the book great is if that person WAS the killer because then it would almost be a surprise. When it turned out to be someone unimportant for a ridiculous reason I was very disappointed. Spoiler ahead: A great ending would have been Cam as the killer and her winding up with Scott."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Too complicated, hard to read and use.

It even \\"translates\\" names of steps from one method to the others!The one drawback I can see is that this will probably not be as good a resource for someone who is not already familiar with the basic steps of ballet. The illustrations are helpful, but it would be impossible to illustrate all the steps and still have the book be easily portable; as a result, the reader must rely on his/her own ability to envision the steps described."},{"rating":"2","title":"Demistifying Life Insurance","review":"Sooner or later, most of us buy life insurance.

We sent for a replacement leg and got one that seems to have come from a different chair, because it didn't match the others and didn't fit snugly. Then a leg on the other chair snapped right off when a 40-pound kid stood on the chair. I\\"m very surprised.

It's the only one I consistently remember to put back in the greenhouse so I'll know where it is.I've broken trowels before on hard ground; they bend where it narrows into the handle, and then it's all over. Never been an issue with this one. I can jam it into tough soil, lean on it, and it handles the job. Speaking of handle, I see one review saying the handle is hard to deal with because of the half-moon shape, and that the handle makes it non-functional. I have the complete opposite experience. It's an ergonomic design, which is why the arc (it's not for looks.) It fits my hand (smallish) perfectly, and my wrist and tendonitis never bother me when I'm using it. It allows me a lot more leverage, too. Love it.

I bought it after reading all the great customer reviews and was greatly disappointed. The toaster does have the capacity to toast quite thick items such as bagels, but for a regular slice of toast, it does not do a good job. Because of the wide openings for bagels, when it pulls down a regular size piece of bread, it pulls the bread closer to one side rather than right in the middle.

I'm not sure why I've put up with it this long. It is completely inconsistent. We keep the knob between 2 and 3 and do not move it. At this setting, sometimes the toast gets completely burnt (like this morning), sometimes we get warm un-toasted bread, and sometimes it comes out perfectly (why I give it two stars instead of one star). There is also no consistency between the two sides of the toaster. Both sides will be set between 2 and 3 and will be pushed down at the same time. One side will come out burnt to a crisp while the other will be done nicely.

At \\"3,\\" I would get a warm piece of bread. At \\"4,\\" one burned side and one warm side.

It was next to impossible to adjust the lamp to get rid of the glare while maintaining sufficient lighting.All that adjusting led straight to my second problem, durability. After several adjustments, the wiring at the base of the connector became undone, causing the light to get no power and to be limp when attached to the Gameboy.The WormLight did not last even an hour. This item may be a bit too fragile for some. If you must buy this, do be careful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Light causes problems","review":"My children have both had problems with their games boys after using this light.

I also like that you can select a worm light to match the color of your game boy, but color coordination isn't everything.If you're stuck in the dark somewhere, then this worm light may work for you.

We bought this toy a few days ago for my 9 month old. It looks great, but I really think it's poorly designed for actual use. We had my son in the car with the safety bar on and the handle attached for me and my husband to push him around. ... the handles are too pliable and bend and this makes it very difficult to turn the car. I also agree that the toy is too low to function as a walker, and sitting in the car my son's feet drag too low. BUT THE WORST PART was that when we stopped pushing my son around and let him play in it with the musical box in front (which is very nice) he turned sideways or twisted around to look at us (we were a couple of feet away) and he and the car fell over sideways and my son came crashing down and landed on his HEAD on our tile floor. We are very careful and this is the first time my son has ever had a fall of this kind. I am returning this toy today."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too expensive & Too flimsy","review":"This toy seems to have many features but the features are poorly incorporated and make it difficult for a child to use. I have purchased and have been pleased by other Chicco products but this toy is anything but pleasing. The car is very cute but on closer inspection you can see that it is very flimsy. The car is made for children six months to three years but my average size fourteen month old is almost too big for the car. My son was able to detach the safety bar while he was sitting in the car. The tall handles that and adult uses to push the car bend easily. When the base was attached the car barely rocked. When I tried to push my son in the car we couldn't get very far because the footrests are at an awkward angle, so he would end up trying to stretch his legs and his feet would stop the car. It is also too low and light to use as a walker (when my son tried it tipped over.) Overall, I found that this car tries to do too much. Unfortunately, it does nothing well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Designed and Too Expensive","review":"I wanted to bring my 8-month-old son out to \\"ride bikes\\" with the other neighborhood kids. Chicco stated this rider was made for children 6 months to 3 years of age; apparently, the designers never actually put a small child in it. My son's feet slide off the front and back of the footrests and either drag on the ground or get pulled under the footrests. I find myself constantly looking to see if his feet are clear of the ground. Other than that, he loves riding in it; although, sometimes if he leans too much to one side or the other, I am afraid the car will tip over. Maybe it will work better once he's older...I would NOT recommend this rider, and if I could, I would return it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Dangerous! Don't Buy","review":"My 10 month old got this toy for Christmas. It looked like a great toy that would last a long time. When we put the baby in it he seemed to love it. Beware! I was standing right next to the baby when he tried to look at something on the floor and it fell over. He landed on his head! I will never buy this brand of toy again. It was obvious that no one had tested this toy on young babies and it was very cheaply made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly designed","review":"My son got this as a gift. When I first saw this I thought it was a great toy. The first time we tried to use it as a push toy we had problems with the wheels. They do not turn unless the steering wheel is turned which can't be done with the tray on it. The tray keeps the steering wheel locked. So we let him use it as a riding toy and every three feet when he shifted his weight he tipped over. We also tried to use it with the base as a keep the baby stationary toy. Every time he leaned to either side and touched the tray it popped off. The only thing we have been able to use on this toy is the keyboard from the tray. It's a great car seat and stroller toy that can be purchased separately for fewer than twenty dollars. I am sorry that my friends have spent so much money on a toy that is basically a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"DANGEROUS!!!!!!!","review":"Don't buy this. Please read the reviews for this toy. My son received this toy as a gift. I assembled it according to the (quite brief and poorly written) instuctions. On his first try, my son leaned a bit to one side, the saftey barrier came loose and he crashed on the ground. So much for 'saftey.' I then looked up the toy on Amazon to check out the reviews. Sure enough, this has happened to many, many others. This is a very poorly designed toy. Too low to the ground to be a real ride-on toy, and too flimsy to be a rocker. My daughter has a different Chicco ride-on toy that has been great. I don't know how this one got onto the market!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it!","review":"Where do I start? We got this for our 12 month old twin boys and were excited about all that it was \\"purported\\" to be. Upon assembly, it was painfully obvious that this was not a high quality item. It is extremely flimsy - the boys are able to actually lift up the safety bar section because it does not adhere adequately. They do enjoy sitting in it and playing with the activity center - for about 5 minutes. One of the boys pulled up on it and promptly fell because the activity center is not attached / locked in to the car. The \\"rocking\\" is a joke, the instructions even worse then that. We haven't even attempted to take this off the carpet so I can't review the other features. We are very disappointed with this product and are extremely grateful we didn't buy two of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"a dangerous toy","review":"This push/ride on toy....has too many bells and whistles for its own good. Any toy that has a four in one item is usually made poorly. This can be unsafe to the baby. We got this as a gift, it is the only toy I have ever returned. The store said they have had many many complaints on this car. It is unstable. The electronic keyboard that goes on the tray...pops off and can land on your baby's feet. It is extremely wobbly.

I was so disappointed. You can't really turn it, and it is not durable enough to take outside the house. Every time my daughter tried to move, she would get stuck and hurt her legs. it sits very low to the ground, making it difficult for her to pedal along the ground. Tips over easily.Buyers beware! Really, really study this product before purchasing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Topples Over","review":"I would not recommend this car as my young son has toppled out of it on more than one occassion.

The yellow part that holds the musical part comes off pretty easily, and the handle to push him with is not sturdy enough...hard to go around corners...also when he pushes it, the dang thing falls over causing him to fall. The only reason I kept this piece of crap is because it was given to us as a gift by my sis n law and they are always looking for it when they come over and want to watch him play with it. I would not recommend this toy to anyone!!! It's bad, bad, bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"I bought this toy for my son when he was 8 months old. I thought it looked like great fun for him and was a nice change from a stroller when we walked the mall. I found out quickly that this toy was nothing more than an overpriced piece of junk. It flips over at the smallest movement of your child. It tips over when you try to turn left or right when pushing it. Pushing it on cement is a joke all together. This toy ended up in the garbage, what a waste. I would have donated it or given it to a friend but would not do so due to the safety issues with this item."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Supervision Toy","review":"As long as you always supervise your child, the Chicco car is great. My son absolutely loves riding in his. He loves playing with the keyboard on the front, which is removable if he wants to play with just that on the floor. Yes, this car can tip over easily, but, as long as you are always supervising, there should never be a problem. I don't know how great it is outside because we always use it to zoom around the inside of the house, which my son laughs his little head off."},{"rating":"2","title":"great dvd","review":"This is a great series and the dvd was fantastic.

Great show all around."},{"rating":"1","title":"Prodigious Piven / Boring Boys","review":"I found that your enjoyment of Entourage.2 is proportional to how much you A) savor a good tabloid read, B) trust in cool product placements, C) love celebrity cameos and D) yearn for more insider trivia on IMDB. After enjoying the first season, I wanted more from this group. But season 2 gave me the sensation of eating too much cookie dough. Everyone is so beautiful and the music is so good, and gosh, the celebrity cameos are really just the best! Dreams of Laker games, beach parties at Jamie Pressly's house, and Sundance sustain me in times of grief and pain. Thank god I waited for this on video. I found myself fast-forwarding through the same endless weed drenched I-can't-get-la*d rich white boy whining just to get to Piven - who blows everyone away.

It contains accounts of ancient history that will open your eyes! It is not for the rigid or closed minded. Reading this book shows us just how programmed we are in terms of what is \\"accepted\\" history. This is an extremely rare book. It is special, because it gives voice to ancient peoples whose voices have been purposely overlooked by the various powers that be. In this book, you will find Ptolemaic era Egyptians, expounding upon the origin of the Hebrews! What a switch!

Now imagine it as five vans drive through it shooting it to pieces in a total violent bloodfest. This is how the terror on Poplar Street begins for the many residents of this unfortunate street. The story is told in a real time situation with the events of the residents of Poplar street and past events through diary/letter entries which lead up to the reason behind the terror. The only trouble I had with this book was remembering the number of characters that live on the street. But Bachman provides a quick remedy for this by killing a lot of them off through the most violent of means. Not one for the queasy as there is a lot of blood, gore and brain-matter in the majority of death scenes. RECOMMENDED TO ALL!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Goodish....by far not his best","review":"It had some good scenes in it, but one should really think whether King and Bachman are the same person. While King writes superb stories, like Pet Sematary and The Shining, Richard Bachman gives us this..and what IS this? It is basically showing that the King of horror may be abdicating his throne to the likes of another author. Another thing I want to know is: What comes first? Desperation or The Regulators? \\"Desperation\\" is a good, old-style King story, and Bachman's Regulators is a bit disappointing. Not even the excess gore in some scenes saves it from its, let's face it, dumn plot. Let's just hope that the King isn\`t really abdicating...."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring for the first 1/2","review":"This book was very boring for the 1st 1/2(almost 300 pages) because they gave you information without any backround info. until the last 1/2.

Remember, this isn't the \\"real\\" Stephen King writing. The Regulators and Desperation have no true plot connection - the characters' names are reused in each book, yet flipped around to those of a different age and personality. It is in this way that The Regulators (if read before or after Desperation) is a melodramatic and freaky story. Don't expect the usual King. Instead, expect a horror story in the setting of an over-perfect (almost already completely surreal), town that gets even more surreal. If you read the back of the book before you start the full text (if you know what's about to happen right from the start), the novel is terrifying. Get it with Desperation and enjoy both of them as separate parts of a truly nasty whole."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don;t miss it.","review":"The Regulators is full of horror, action and well-thought-out characters. As to be expected of King. But ... it was miles different to any other novel of his I have read so far. The letters, statements and diary entries was a nice touch, heling you get more in touch with the leading female character.As well as horror and action, parts of this book are very emotional. And then again, other parts made me laugh out loud.Often people say you HAVE to read this with Desperation. That is not true. It uses most of Desperation's characters, but they're mixed around and portrayed differently than in Desperation. Although, if you were planning on reading both, i would reccommend Desperation first. Mainly because it is a bigger novel, and you really feel the atmosphere of the town of Desperation itself in it. This may make it easier to envision the fake mirage of Desperation in The Regulator.A stunning must-read that you will put down with a warm fuzzy feeling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Regulate.","review":"This is a big, messy, gory novel. If you slam it closed really hard. blood literally sprays all over the place.In \\"The Regulators\\", King quickly introduces scores of characters, them promptly lines them up like bowling pins and tosses a ball down the center isle.To be sure, it's one of his more merciless works, with the first victim going down within the first few pages and scores more following his fate at regular intervals.As usual, King's outlandish tale of a suburban neighbourhood being overrun by the fleshed out imaginings of an autistic child offers far more social insight than it may appear at first, but the B-movie style hack'n'slash antics will keep the the most wandering attention at bay.Altough lengthy, readers will most likely blow right through this page turner.

However it is the 'underlying' story of a force that has become part of and taken over a young autistic child that kept me going - even this was boring at times.If you want horror read Salems Lot or The Shining, if you want a brilliant story read It or The Stand or The Green Mile.I just hope Desperation is better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not even on a par with \\"Christine\\" or \\"Needful Things\\" .","review":"I thought that the beginning was interesting enough, the so-called \\"vintage\\" King, but the book started dragging along soon after the first shot was fired.. the realism was there until the plot interceded.. almost didn't finish the book out of sheer boredom.. hopefully King will get out of the rut he seems to be in and return to his old ways.. two stars on name recognition alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not King's Best","review":"If you like to read about meaningless characters who get killed off quickly and with plenty of gore, this book is for you.

Hard to get into with characters not credible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where did this story come from?","review":"The Regulators was okay. I think that even King's worst is better than many author's best works. There is depth to the novel, and the beginning is grabbing, but after all the cartoon/action figures come in, I am turned off. Around the end I had to skip around just to make it to the last chapter. I was very disappointing. Desperation, on the other hand, was one of the best Stephen King books ever! It had everything and the end made me want to sing!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"completely unreadable","review":"This is the very worst King's book I've seen. Nothing more than a primitive morality tale in an obscure superficial setting. I could not make myself read it to the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Choose this over Desperation","review":"This book is much better, and has a lot more thought in it. Desperation just goes into the boring god/satan line and dies. This book avoids that, and is a lot more enjoyable for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fun time","review":"PLEASE remember that this is written in the \\"voice\\" of R.Bachman, not S.King, so it's going to be different from King's other novels.I enjoyed this story very much, couldn't put it down, as a matter of fact. It was scary to me, I think, because I kept picturing it happening in MY suburban neighborhood. Look out the window, it's another senseless, nameless evil you can't begin to wrap your mind around...ooooo... Spooky as...heck, but interesting and surprising, too.I also liked the intertwining of the two novels. It seemed more adventurous than gimmicky to me. All in all, an enjoyable ride. Okay, a bit gory, but necessary gore, IMHO.OH, and Look for Desperation, too. (actually by S.King) I liked that one even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good book - I read this one first.","review":"I really liked this book. It is a little more gorey than my taste but it was very original and i loved all the letters, scripts, pictures and other notes added in. It's true the charaters were not as defined as the story but i really liked how the town was changing around them. I'd have to say the part when they try to get out off the block is my favorite. I think my opinion might have been a little different if i would have read Desperation first. That book had a better plot. I enjoyed how the books were intertwined, it made it very enjoyable and a fast read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of King's best","review":"We have all been there before. The characters are not defined enough which causes some confusion as to who's who. It is definitely not scary, but I don't mind as long as it is fun. This book is not fun. I hope Desperation is better. I was disappointed since I enjoyed THE GREEN MILE immensely"},{"rating":"1","title":"what's with all the hoopla?","review":"The plot of this book reminded me of an episode of \\"Tales from the Crypt\\" or something. I was so bored I couldn't wait to finish it just to get it over with. I think King is highly overrated and people just like him because its him (even if it is Bachman). Desperation had a few good points but it was also very very preachy and therefore irritating. Some of the characters are well done but there still seems to be a major lack of excitement, twists, and there is no point to this book. Alot of people seem to have liked it, but I found it a big waste of time. I kept waiting to here the Cryptkeeper at the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had high hopes that this would be better than its sister novel desperation","review":"I had high hopes that this would be better than its sister novel Desperation...but it fell flat, just like its sister. It started out all right but then it just petered out slowly from there. King had a great premise here and he didn't come through on it. Disappointed.I usually rate books on their re-readability. Desperation and Regulators are not worthy of re-reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"A well written, suspenseful book, although not for everyone","review":"The Regulators seems like a normal level Stephen King book (although written under his other name, Richard Bachman). It is well written, very suspenseful, and very surprising. The only problem that I see is that the book is not for everyone. It is violent and contains large amounts of vulgar language. There are a lot of adult items, so it shouldn't be read by the numerous child fans of King. But other than that there are no real flaws, and is a thrill to read"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good. Confusing, but good.","review":"I began reading The Regulators the day after I finished Desperation, the book's \\"brother\\" so to speak. The story is great, the characters have their moments, and, although it comes no where close to Desperation, it is utterly enjoyable. However, it does have it's confusing moments if you have read Desperation before beginning The Regulators. Some of the character names are different, as the Carvers, and every character's background has been at least marginally changed. In other words, The Regulators is a great read. However, if anyone out there has found out how the two books are supposed to be related, PLEASE let me know"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible.","review":"I absolutely despised this book. I remember seeing this and King's Desperation together in the book store, and that they were being marketed in tandem, able to be read in either order. For those of you who don't know, The Regulators uses the same characters from Desperation (although they all have vastly different personalities and relationships with one another). Well, I read Desperation first...thank goodness. THAT was a fantastic book. Then I tried to read this one. It was like King didn't even try to write a decent book here. I can barely even begin to describe how much I hated this book. Imagine taking a story that you love and mixing up who all of the characters are, then killing them all off for no other reason than just to do it. That's all this book is. It has no redeeming qualities whatsoever. No plot, no mystery, nothing compelling at all. It really does read like a child wrote it, or at best, a complete novice. Please...avoid this horrid travesty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Richard Bachman, Not Stephen King","review":"When you see the name Richard Bachman on the cover, you can be sure you're not getting Stephen King. The Regulators falls into that side of Stephen King that involves mass destruction by some sort of unknown force. People die. There is blood. Chaos ensues. And most importantly, the book didn't make me peek behind closed doors before I went to bed. Here's to hope that Desperation fills in the gaps of horror left out in this part of the collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Regulates This? Don't Read This! Don't! Don't! Don't!","review":"The narrator of this story detailed the destruction of a neighborhood and its occupants quite graphically, entertainingly even. Yet, in nailing the plot down in... just... the... right... way, the psychology of the characters is given only surface attention. Yes, a demon wants to corrupt and kill. But why? Yes, several neighbors get corralled toward an absurd doom. But are the individaul responses of the protagonists against this threat quantifiable in the text or simply the conclusion of an arbitrary train of thought on the storyteller's part? This lack of humanism was off-putting, but in combination with the narrator's juvenile vocabulary and syntax, worked to entertain with minimal exertion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute garbage","review":"If you like a book with no surprises, about 27 characters to keep track of, and lots of repetitive mass-murder scenes, then this book is for you. Otherwise, choose something else. Terrible job by the author on this one. There's so little content here that he could have written this story in ten pages.Note that Desperation, by contrast, is actually a very good story. Do not confuse the two."},{"rating":"1","title":"WTF!","review":"One of the villains fires two shots from a double barreled shotgun, pumps it and fires a third shot, if you see nothing wrong with that, read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could not read","review":"I nearly always love his books.Not this one.I was incapable of reading it.It was that bad.Just awful.Maybe it was the use of altered characters from the (great)book \\"Desperation\\".Anyway,bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"A monster takes over a helpless young boy and uses his mind to bring to life all sorts of nasty characters to commence a slaughter of a small town.The young boy is an orphan, taken in by his grandparents, and they do their best with him, and the horrors that start to happen in this situation."},{"rating":"1","title":"OH NO! Desperation is not his worse book!","review":"I have read most of King's books. It is hard to believe the same person who wrote The Stand and The Shining wrote these two books. What is it with him hurting kids in several of his latest books? It's getting real old! If you loved this book, it is obviously the only book you have ever read of Kings. I can understand why you can get the hard-back copys of these books so cheap now. They are terrible!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A nasty and brutal gripper!","review":"I loved this novel. Despite what people may say, i think this is a better book then desperation. At first i wasn't sure if i was going to like it or not.....Then the van pulls up......They have shotguns.......Then people start dieing. The town never knew what hit them and nothing they could have done would have ever prepared them for Tak and THE REGULATORS. Awesome book, awesome imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Desperation, Characters are Great","review":"I really liked The Regulators a lot better than desperation. The whole interplay between the possessed Seth, and Audrey was great. I also enjoyed that the book, in the style the great novel Dracula was written (I can't remember the name for this type of literature where different things are interposed ie journals, letters, etc) We have Audrey's diary, screenplays (phony) and letters to tell the story along with traditonal writing. I loved this book because of the interplay between Seth and Audrey. The ending, corny though it may be left me in tears! The use of such commonplace items as Spaghettios and Hershey's syrup, and kids toys helped make this book great. My only question is, in Desperation God is such a big part of the story yet not mentioned in Regulators at all. Why is this?"},{"rating":"1","title":"One star is too much","review":"Let me begin by saying I love Stephen King. I have read just about everything he has written and immensely enjoy his creative plot twists and interesting characters. However, after doggedly struggling through the first third of the Regulators, I was bored. Keeping track of the flat and uninteresting characters made this book nearly impossible to read. I was able to accurately predict the ending. Even the first fifty pages of the Talisman weren't this bad. This book is a step backward for King."},{"rating":"2","title":"surreal","review":"I liked this one better than \\"Desperation\\" because it was so surreal. Surrealism really appeals to me. Unfortunately, a lot of people aren't appealed by it, and that is why there are so many poor reviews for it on this page. I found it exciting and visceral. I like Bachman's \\"who gives a @!#$\\" attitude. It IS Stephen King without a consciense, and I like it. Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"jolly rotten","review":"This is disjointed hodgepodge of ridiculous events, pipping 'Insomnia' for the mantle of King's worst work. Supposedly a companion volume for the much better (but still not great) 'Desperation', it reads more like an entry to the write a novel in an afternoon competition. Save your seven bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"King Must Laugh All The Way To The Bank","review":"Having just finished reading The Regulators I must saythat I find all of the enthusiastic praise for this bookperplexing. The premise is ridiculous, even for King. Mixin gore, sex and profanity for mass appeal and you havethe literary equivelant of toilet paper. Useful at the momentand then quite disposable. I also found the use ofdifferent typeface as well as pseudo handwritten portionsnothing more than gimmickry. If anyone would like toexperience a real chill then read Dracula, which is 100years old. Does anyone really believe The Regulatorswill have any literary value (other than to King) in 100years? It doesn't now"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as I thought it would be......","review":"I read Desperation first, about 3 months before reading this book. I could hardly put Desperation down, thats how good it was to me. I was curious to read The Regulators because I had heard about the similarities to Desperation. It started off pretty good, and I kept reading to see what would happen. Then it just got too drawn out and uneventful, and some parts didn't make any sense to me. I finished the book, but it was definitely not as good as Desperation. I would only recommend it if you just need another King read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad but not good either","review":"I found it to be suspenseful and frightening enough in places but I had a lot of complaints, including the repetitive nature of the massacre scenes (oh, the vans are back AGAIN), the fact that the scenes from the Garron house were completely stomach-wrenching and painful to read (like the rape scene), and the unsatisfying ending. This is pure pulp fiction, fun in places (in its 'end of the world' chaos in suburbia) but flawed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far from Steven King's best","review":"Perhaps I'm becoming a little jaded, having read most of Kings works, but this is far from his best. The Regulators is basically alot of \\"same old..been there, done that\\" the telepathically manipulative Evil presence (Tak) that wreaks havoc in ways that are way out, too incredible to be believed. It's never made clear what Taks motives are , if it is an alien, or what. The characters or more aptly \\"caricatures\\" are wooden and engender no sympathy, the way you cared for the children in \\"IT\\", or the little Torrence boy in \\"The SHINING\\". The only thing the book inspired in me was a desire to go out & rent a video of the 50's movie western that gives the book its title. I think this is a case of mailing it in; he's done it all before and done it better. I will admit, that it's still a page turner once the action starts."},{"rating":"1","title":"HATED IT (Desperation is much better!!!)","review":"Hopefully this will be the only time Stephen King tries the gimmick of companion novels. Found this one to be boring and predictable and the juxtaposition of characters from \\"Desperation\\" confusing.I literally ran out and bought this book after finishing \\"Desperation\\" but was highly disapointed. Glad I only lost the money on a paper back.Final Note: \\"Desperation\\" (the compainion novel) is CLASSIC, FANTASTIC King!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If I was King, I'd have used a phony name too.","review":"Slightly more imagination involved here than in Desperation. However, that's not saying much. The (ahem) plot simply repeats itself after the first couple of chapters, and you really won't care whether the characters live or die. Two things drove me to finish it: first was the novelty of finding where it crosses with Desperation, but that wore thin pretty quick; second was the futile hope that the ending would redeem Desperation's hurried, hokey conclusion - it didn't. About the only good thing I can say about it is that its theme of religious salvation/redemption isn't as blatant or as annoying as it was in Desperation."},{"rating":"1","title":"If it wasn't Bachman/King, would it sell?","review":"No way. Without King's name connected to this book, it wouldn't have been printed. Desperation is marginal at best. The Regulators should have died (and been buried) with Bachman."},{"rating":"2","title":"good companion to Desperation","review":"This book had the same elements of Desperation. Same characters, and same series of eerie events.

I read the first 110 pages and gave up. Too many characters and too many time shifts. I kept getting confused trying to keep track of the who's and when's. I read these books to relax, and I could not do that with this book. Sorry, Mr. King. I will not invest more time and effort in this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total time-waster","review":"Stephen King has written some killer novels (\\"The Shining\\" is a masterpiece) but this is one long horrible piece of... well, he'll be more than happy to share this vulgarity and many others once you crack the cover. I have seldom felt a writer forcing a non-idea to onto the page as much as in this book. It reads like the worst piece of \\"fan\\" writing one has ever seen on the net. You can tell from reading the \\"positive\\" reviews here that something's not right -- they're trying to \\"get\\" it. King should take some time off and stoke his jets.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Miss","review":"Stephen King has his share of hits and misses and THE REGULATORS is a definite miss. I have to give King credit for attempting to create a layered novel--a technique that Avi did with far better results in NOTHING BUT THE TRUTH. However, the story was flat and the characters weren't clearly drawn enough for me to keep straight. The plotting was slow and the story should have been cut by about half.King is prolific, but not every idea should see the light of day. This had the feel of a rush to publish companion to another title. THE REGULATORS could have been a better book--the ideas themselves are interesting enough--had King spent more time thinking about it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Bachman/King classics....horrible and wonderful!","review":"I decided to revisit this book some fifteen years or so after I originally read it. I'd remembered that it was one I had particularly liked from the earlier King/Bachman days. It was even better than I recalled and I thoroughly enjoyed this second experience.A fantasy world has come to visit Poplar Street bringing death, destruction, and horror. How the residents deal with their new reality and the story of how it originated make for a tale that's both frightening and exciting.

He is not among the politically correct -- brace yourself for snide remarks about local customs. But at his best, he's amusing and informative. At his worst, he's just obnoxious.This volume has an ex-Soviet theme to it, covering St. Petersburg, Kaliningrad, Yerevan, Tbilisi, and Chisinau. He also visits the three Guyanese capitals (Paramaribo, Cayenne, Georgetown), Luanda (one of his better, serious essays on Africa's challenges), Maputo, Victoria Falls, Gaberone (Botswanna being one of Africa's success stories), Tehran, Damascus, Phnom Penh, Luang Prabang (Laos), Caracas, St. John's (Antigua), and Ponce (Puerto Rico).

One, the main character, a Latina detective, has enough of a chip on her shoulder -- several, in fact -- that reading about them grows tiresome and overshadows all else.

They're actually stoneware, and the reddish coloration is achieved via glaze, but the effect is overall nice.These clean up just fine in the dish washer.

And why not? didnt Eichmann and Mengele, and Barbie. What his intentions where really ?.. We will never know if they had a Fourth Reich on their minds. But one thing is for certain. Many people forsaw the coming NEW WAR with Russia ( like Gen G.S.Patton) we would be ignorant to think that these individuals didnt forsee the coming storm.Did they set a timeline for there re-introduction of there ideological beliefs ?.

Much of the cast is from the FX comedy show \\"It's Always Sunny In Philadelphia\\", but the description made it clear that this was a drama. I took a chance and I'm glad I did. The story was a well told look into a married couples struggle with one another around having a baby. I'm not going to say more, because it is nice not to know all of the surprises in the film beforehand. The acting was realistic and very strong. Both of the leads pull off some difficult scenes. The film is a drama, but there are some funny moments as well. A couple of scenes with Sunny star Charlie Day made me laugh hard. The film is clearly an indie, but makes the most of its (I'm assuming) small budget with competent cinematography and a nice score. The end was really sweet, I didn't see it coming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good old fashion reading fun","review":"After reading this excellent, hillarious book I couldn't resist but telling all my friends to read it.

I greatly enjoyed the story line, the characters, and the complexity of the situations Alex found himself in - not unlike problems most of us find ourselves in (at least to some degree, if not in Hollywood or on a national level).

The object of his affection and lust is Nick, a law student who is gorgeous, sexy and sweet but seriously attached . A brief torrid affair and a broken-hearted Alex went on to a successful career as a daytime soap opera actor and a closeted gorgeous TV actor boyfriend. However disaster struck when Alex is outed publicly and he refused to deny his sexuality. The incident resulted in some positive happenings in his life though - like Nick!

There are too just too many diarists mentioned and the discussion of them goes from one to the other too rapidly. Mallon breaks his diarists into seven categories, chroniclers, travelers, pilgrims, creators, apologists, confessors, prisoners.The old rule seemed to apply here, and the less I knew about the diarist the more Mallon 's work seemed significant. But for those whose work I do somehow know , and I think here of the example of Kafka , Mallon's treatment seemed to me hasty, and slight. This suggests that another problem of doing the work the way Mallon did is distinguishing well enough between diarists of greater and lesser significance.This book is highly recommended for all those who take interest in the Diary form, for I know of nothing else like it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great reference","review":"Great reference for getting the most from your animal.

We already owned \\"Rush hour\\" so we thought this game was very similar. Younger kids might need adult assistance to get started. It teaches spatial relationships and process thinking because you have to get the guy (who looks like the guy in the old Mousetrap game) from here to there by a series of of connected movements. Players have to decide which towers to knock over to build a path to help the guy reach the red cube. When the 14 year old played \\"advanced level,\\" she had some challenge with this. It's not electronic, which is a plus, and requires some concentration, another plus, and materials are colorful and durable. One or more child can play, so this could be a good \\"waiting room\\" diversion. It might be more fun if it had a timer so you could play in teams.

By the 9th challenge (easy level), he became challenged. It makes him think and continue trying different ways to solve the puzzle. He likes doing it with other kids because they collaborate on different strategies to solve it. The game is deceptively easy.

So much of today's strife can be traced back to this little conflict, but if you ask the majority of people out there, they couldn't even tell you who the participants were. This book tells everything, and leaves no stone unturned. Taking up where the author's previous book Spitfires over Israel left off, this book covers the lead up to the conflict, with viewpoints taken from all the main participants. The British, French, Israeli and Egyptian points of view are all shown, and the power struggle for control of the whole Middle East is brought out in this riveting book. If you are fascinated by any one of these countries, or the Middle East in general, you should add this title to your library immediately.Chris Banyai-RieplAviation What-Not"},{"rating":"2","title":"It seems to work, my chain saw never started this easily","review":"Certainly a new spark plug would improve the startability of my Craftsman chainsaw. When I removed the old one, it seemed to be in fairly good shape, though. I also cleaned the air filter and the saw generally, and I'm sure that contributed to the improved starting performance, but it seems to me that it now starts better than it did when it was new.

Starts are always on the sixth or seventh pull, compared to the usual 10-20 pulls. (Lowes has these for $8 instead of the listed $35 here, of which, I think is a pricing error here.)My thoughts are, these plugs are lacking a resistor making for hotter sparks, hence better burns and lower monoxide. Since we don't have AM/FM radios on our lawn equipment, we probably won't have any radio interference issues. I would also only install these plugs in lawn equipment or older engines, and exclude my newer 2005 Ford which is much more expensive to replace in case the plugs fail."},{"rating":"2","title":"More power on less gas","review":"On a new stock spark plug, my lawn mower would run out of gas with about 10% of the lawn left.

Instead, we're treated to mostly cover versions that Chuck used to fill out his original LP releases in the 1950s. All of the material is worth hearing because Chuck Berry plays them like Chuck Berry Songs. If you love Berry's riffing and chugging rhythm, you're going to love this CD. It provides a welcome compliment to the more widely available Greatest Hits packages readily available elsewhere. Given that none of these tracks are going to get played on oldies radio any time soon, they possess a freshness that many of Chuck's better-known songs have sadly lost. As a bonus, there's a booklet with liner notes that (for a change) seem to be accurate.For what it's worth, my favorite track on this CD is \\"Worried Life Blues.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"The Check Berry nobody knows","review":"We all know the hits; this one shows another side of Chuck.

This wookie is big and beefy, so it's lower arms don't fall off when you try to pose it. It is definitly hunkier than Chewbacca, although all the wookies seem to be better made than everyone else. Of all the wookies I've seen from episode3, he can hold his gun much better. the snap-on body armour is'nt that great, but considering this wookies gun won't fall out of his hands while fighting a battle droid, this is one of the best ROTS toys yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"A bar of French-milled bliss.","review":"Fresh makes some fantastic soap. Without going into detail of the French mill process, the result is a long-lasting bar of soap (with no air pockets). This particular scent is a new favorite of mine (great for guys & gals, IMO), and though I have yet to try all of the Fresh luxury soaps, I have no hesitation in recommending this or any other variety they produce.Oh, and the packaging phenomenal. Cooly wrapped in, as they state, Japanese and European papers and then wrapped with a nice gold colored wire. Some things in life are rare and exquisite in their simplicity - you might be tempted to leave the bar as is. I still recommend you open it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Free Will","review":"I think Mr. Lee's objecton to Kenny's statement about free will is quite reasonable. Kenny's statement is offensive and out of place in a work of this nature - even more so without supporting arguments. It cannot be excused by saying that we should learn to distinguish facts from value judgments, or that a certain amount of subjectivity is inevitable. Subjective statements, if not extreme or too many, are excusable to the extent that they do not deal with serious matters. But the question of free will is a very serious matter indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre","review":"Kenny begins the book by criticizing Russell. Yet all the supposed faults of Russell - bias, \\"notorious\\" unfair treatment of some philosophers, etc. - can be applied to Kenny himself in this book. His own Roman Catholic orthodoxy permeates throughout his comments. He idolizes Wittgenstein, even though Wittgenstein impresses nobody but the most gullible of academic philosophers. He trashes Hume - for obvious reasons. He defends free will, but provides no explanations. He considers that best history of philosophy by a single author is the one by Frederick Copleston, who happened to be a Jesuit priest. I found myself shaking my head no matter what I chanced to read in this book. There are many good histories of philosophy, but this book is not one of them. I advise readers to go back to Russell's masterpiece instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"So this is what Angolans fought so hard for?","review":"This film is about a war veteran's struggle to find work, dignity, and a new life in post-war Angola. As a former military hero, Vitorio's former dreams of a fair and just country prove elusive in present day Luanda. Fellow citizens show little veneration for this once-great commander now without a leg and homeless. However, throughout his hardships circumstances begin to change and he slowly finds hope and comfort through some individuals.If interested in Lusophone African countries this film is a must see. The war in Angola, pre and post independence, was one of the bloodiest in Africa. This film gives great insight of the lives of most Angolans- a life void of the luxury and decadence of the ruling class.Related films- Cuban African Odyssey (a documentary must see to understanding the modern Angola and the Cold War in Africa)Cuba: An African Odyssey"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buckethead is god","review":"Best Buckethead release ever....totally rocking...GET THIS NOW! Lots of mind blowing solos...Even a Buckethead Blues song (the really short Silent Scream), and Inferno plays like a really rockin' Colma refugee! BUY! NOW! DO IT! NOW! WELL? HURRY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great in some parts","review":"I feel this album is really good, there are a few songs that can be considered throwaway songs, cause i dont think they're that good. Mainly i like this album for its fat beats from brain and pinchface, not sure who does what songs. And i also love it for the song Inferno, a beautiful melody and really cool hip-hop type beat behind it;and the title track 13th scroll for its really cool beat and melody as well. Overall, I'd give it 4 stars mainly cause some songs are repititious, but I recommend for Buck fans who have most of his main albums who like, his collaborations with Bill Laswell and Brain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Silly But Satisfying Parrot toy","review":"My large Harlequin macaw loves this toy and likes to chew on the leather parts and dig out the nuts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great TV","review":"I love Law & Order. I purchased all of them from season 3 thru season 10. I wanted all the seasons that included Sam Waterson, Jerry Orbach, and especially Benjamin Bratt.

With all the bad tv shows that are on now, going back to these shows is worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fans didn't need to wait...","review":"I just had to comment on the fact that theprevious review stated the 'finally the 10th Season is here'. If all of the true \\"L&O\\" fans would just buy the Complete Series (see my review on that product's page), there'd be no more waiting. I owned the Seasons that were already out (1-8 & 14) when, on November 6th, The Complete Series came out for a steal @ $450.00! To have all 457 Episodes at my viewing disposal was too much to pass up on such an inexpensive price tag! To all \\"L&O' fans...JUST BUY THE COMPLETE SERIES!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great season","review":"Great dvd set, the only problem concerned the lack of a episode guide on the dvd case. Otherwise it was an awesome packet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Law & Order The tenth Year","review":"All crime series eventually decay into soap operas & this process was well under way by L&O; 10. Several of the episodes were harbingers of L&O; SVU which I personally loathe. Several other episodes had almost incomprehensible or utterly unconvincing plots. Slim pickings for L&O; fans, but (just about) better than nothing.The physical product was fine, the acting & direction were OK, the plots were not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Richly Entertaining","review":"Knowing the author was also an essayist and critic, I was prepared for a scholarly and rather literary work. Wrong! Though the central character, Belle Prokoff, is a subtle, fully-dimensional portrait of the long-suffering widow of an alcoholic genius (based on the Jackson Pollock/Lee Krasner saga), the world she inhabits is fraught with pretentious, loopy and/or greedy art-world denizens that Toynton dispatches with flair and obvious relish. The author has an gift for economical, vivid writing that wastes no time and is full of invention. This is a book about the art world that--rarely enough--needn't make insiders wince, but you don't have to care about art to enjoy reading it. An appreciation for colorful dialogue, for well-drawn, ultimately moving characters--in short, for excellent writing--is enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work well with Mac, poorly supported","review":"Five different phone calls, being switched around the globe to the wrong technicians, and two and a half hours after beginning my \\"Quick\\" Setup...I'm told I can only install using a Windows PC running XP, or to simulate XP vers 3 in my compatibility mode on my mounted version of Windows 7 (tried that, still doesn't work).

However....","review":"I knew from reading the reviews that an XP machine would be needed to configure. I thought a virtual XP machine in Win 7 would get the job done. Wrong. Had to boot into XP native.One other foible. It connects to my Upstairs SSID without issue (WPA2), SO LONG AS MAC FILTERING IS TURNED OFF. Call me paranoid. But I like adding MAC filter on top if WPA / WEP. This bridge cannot cope (it seems). In any case I got mainly to connect my Ethernet enabled electric smoker to my LAN (this will enable test messages regarding meat temperature) so I guess I can disable MAC filtering on those summer weekends when I fire it up.I tested this evening on an old XP machine in the kitchen. Connected fine - and did not interrupt the kids Wii streaming via Netflix. Although when the unit was in my office in close proximity to the SSID I told it to connect to, it did manage to lock up the router - and knock Netflix off the air. Should not be an issue in it's final placement."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great.","review":"This item works great.

That is a serious problem as YOU MUST use the install utility to be able to configure the product. I still can't quite get it to work with their Linksys SPA 3102 which is the type of product it was designed for.Be careful of their customer support - it is non-existant. Try calling them for help on the Linksys SPA3102 for example, and they refuse to allow their online chat to help you - telling you to call a number. The call is put in India where they can barely read from their script and can not take a detour on - or they get confused, and then must go back to the script. Finally they refer you to the people that you purchased the product from. Hmmm Amazon tech support for a Linksys SPA 3102?

And this book is AWESOME!! It starts out with the biological history of the morays, and goes into their earliest interactions with humans (this section would be interesting even if you don't keep morays!)But the best part about the book is the practical information it has: water chemistry, acquisition, diseases, how-to-treat disorders, etc. I think a rank novice could pick up this book and really get a good idea of what to do and what NOT to do in successfully housing and keeping a moray eel. I've been keeping morays for nearly 13 years now, and I am so glad to finally have a good reference book on the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"well made","review":"Product is fine however it was marketed as a replacement for a chair and desk combo, the chair does NOT fit the desk for which it was marketed, chair is too small."},{"rating":"1","title":"This must be a toy!","review":"I purchased this chair with the understanding that it was for ages 6-8...NOT TRUE.

Plus, they neglected to send one of the chairs!!I sent an email to the company to explain the problem. They finally sent the chair 2 weeks later, but I still have not gotten a response on the broken table after nearly one month! To make matters worse, the chair they sent had a rotten leg. So it broke the very first time my fifty pound daughter sat on it!!I have once again emailed the company. I hope I get a response this time!!
