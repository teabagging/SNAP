Great book if you are interested in the medical field."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Just for Med Students","review":"I'm a regular visitor to the medical reference sections of bookstores, not because I work in the field, but just out of curiousity.

Good stuff here."},{"rating":"2","title":"An honest and real novel which I thoroughly enjoyed","review":"I am sixteen years old and I want to become a doctor and this book has been perfect for me to read. What a wonderful idea for a book that Dr. Marion thought of-- by taking a diary of 3 different interns and showing how their internship truly is. It's just an excellent book, one that took me just a week to read. As I read this book, I felt like I was beginning to personally know these three interns through their good times and struggles. I look forward to reading the sequel. I would really like to know what Amy, Mark, and Andy are doing now and how they feel about this book. Excellent job, Dr. Marion!"},{"rating":"2","title":"read inside the life","review":"you can easily put it down 1/3 the way through and still be gladyou read it!!

I bought this book after being sucked into the genre by Atul Gawande's \\"Complications,\\" and bought both \\"Intern Blues\\" and Michael Ruhl's \\"Walk on Water\\". I highly recommend both of the other books - they have exactly what I read non-fiction for - thoughtful, insightful analysis of a subject I'd like to know more about. \\"Intern Blues\\"...

I bought the book to help me in my mid-career crisis. I am currently and Emergency Department nurse and I was feeling bored in my job. After reading this book I had to laugh and appreciate the views of the interns. Interns in the ER are funny and procedure crazy. The \\"pain and Agony\\" each of them experiences is very descriptive. If you are looking into a career in medicine it is definitely a must read. I realized that I can't see myself taking a step back and doing \\"scut\\" and re-learning a new frame of mind. The plus side though, when a new intern is the area I make sure I help them out. I recommend this book for anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, practical workout","review":"Easy to do anywhere.

It's difficult to believe the such injustices happen. Basically, this book is about a troubled 'youth' who just happened to be in the wrong place at the wrong time and was sentenced to jail along with other members of his family. When the book is over, you feel a sense of relief, yet you can't help but feel anger towards the criminal justice system."},{"rating":"2","title":"An unjustly neglected, brilliant book","review":"One of my most treasured possessions is Gerry Conlon's In the Name of the Father, a vivid, brutal, passionate, honest, and outstanding account of Irishman Conlon's unjust trial and subsequent conviction of terrorism. Most of these political sob stories feature mundane description and unabashed sentimentality. Conlon never falls into these traps. The writing always rings true, and he presents his real-life characters so vividly that you feel as if you've just tallked with them. The neglect of this book is as unjust a crime as Conlon's incarceration. Conlon writes with the compassion for human suffering of Dostoevsky, the fiery wit and consciousness of Orwell, and the humanity and emotion of Harper Lee. This is one of the great books; if I were trapped on a desert island with no company, this is the book I'd take along."},{"rating":"2","title":"Functional truck ramp","review":"The ramps are light to carry, but strong enough to use.

Excellent for loading the four wheeler into the truck for some fun weekend riding, the length is perfect and the straps make it safe to ride onto without worrying about tipping or sliding off of the tailgate. They fold up and can be stored as you travel and are ready when you need them again. Excellent product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Exactly as advertised , seems very well built and is very much suitable for the applications that I needed it for( loading and unloading golf cart in back of truck ).

They are really quality made and very rugged, the welds are very strong and neat looking and the hinge points are well made and rugged and have large and strong hinge bolts. Being made of aluminum they are also easy to handle. The safety straps are well made and convenient to use.

This is it folks, this is 20th century music at it's birth, all bawling squally and new to the world, yet old, at the same time.Spend a few days listening to these disks, and you'll start to see where everyone (and I do mean everyone)in the music business for the last 60 years or so began. And this set, with the quality of the sound, and the price it sells for, is the place for you to start the journey yourself (or continue it, as you will quickly see once you begin to recognize all the different songs they recorded).Caveats are few, mainly be aware these are recordings made in the 1930s and 1940s, and they sound like it. The liner notes, while good, are minimal as well (though you do get recording dates, as well as where they were recorded)In conclusion, all I can add is \\"jump in, the water's fine...\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the Pure Stuff","review":"Country Music appears to be more popular today than at any time in its past. This fact leaves me in a state of confusion, as I feel the modern Country Music field does not stack up with some of the classic periods in its history. One thing I find lacking in many of today's Country Music artists is the purity of the music - what Bluegrass artist Bill Monroe referred to as, \\"that high, lonesome sound.\\" Pop music hooks have now been added to bring mass appeal to the genre. Unfortunately, this added 'flavoring' has tainted the music. If one is seeking purity in their Country music, these classic recordings by The Carter Family are the place to start.

I have to say I am very impressed with the increased power from the engine this simple kit provided. For the most part installation was simple, only issue I had was some of the instructions seem to skip a step here or there but if you're semi intelligent you can figure it out. Only one step really had a problem and that was because they tell you to loosen two bolts and one nut but they didn't say which nut, a bit of trial and error helped me find the correct nut and that was my only install issue.After having it on for two weeks I can report the added intake noise is minimal till 3000 rpm which makes it perfectly fine for most driving conditions, but when you want to push it the added sound is great and very sporty.Really thinking hard on getting another one for my wife's vehicle now."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit of a snooze","review":"I know many people have great reverence for Freeman Tilden.

I've already returned one (Toys-R-Us was great about the return!), after the shutter button broke after 3 days of normal usage/play. The camera is very cheaply made and not durable. It's almost impossible to get the wrist strap attached. Most importantly, the quality of the photos is terrible (fuzzy, grainy to the point of being unrecognizable!) - even on the best resolution where you can only take 19 pictures before needing to download.

The webcam mode is simple to use, however it's hard to take pictures while using that mode. Now for the negative, the viewfinder doesn't line up even close to the photo, when you look through the view finder; the bottom of the photo is cut off quite a bit compared to what was seen. The photo quality is shoddy at best. Things that are smooth look grainy; the slightest movement causes the entire photo to blur to unrecognizable.

The quality was shockingly poor even for a child's product. On the bright side, it's a great opportunity to teach your children about advertising, disappointment, etc. For example, the packaging is fairly engaging--makes it look fun and interesting--but it's SO not. Price is not always a dead giveaway, but in this case, it was the first clue. You can also talk to your children about the importance of doing research before you buy a product, buying only from a source where you can get your money back if not satisfied and saving the receipt. It can also transition into a savings lesson as well, because a good camera will cost around three times as much.VTech Kidizoom Digital Camera"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is BAAAAD news","review":"A digital camera for kids for ten bucks?

The media spin was convincing, the Ramseys certainly appeared guilty, so Thomas's accusations blaming the Ramseys' about information leaks to the press runs well...flat. The Ramsey's themselves knew they were on the outs with public opinion, the vicious and cruel remarks and overted glances from strangers. After reading this book I found myself searching the internet and finding further evidence that would clear the Ramseys and wondered why this wasnt publicized as much. We already made up our minds, the THEORY about Jonbenet was devastating. What mother would parade her daughter like a living breathing doll? What unfulfilled dreams did Patsy have? What jealousy did Patsy feel for her gorgeous daughter?

Steve thomas is a man with a passion; to not only find Jonbenet's killer, but to prove that it was her mother Patsy Ramsey. Although his theory is biased and a major finger point, it is the most consistant theory I have read and the one I feel is most likely.

I have more faith in the testimony of Lou Smit, a respected homicide detective, who has given us compelling evidence that an intruder killed JonBenet. Certainly the Boulder police screwed up the case from the beginning, and are in denial and pointing fingers of blame everywhere but themselves.

Thomas, however, uses the book about a botched murder case to promote his own views supporting the death penality - and his shoot first - ask questions later mentality.

The people there would just rather keep from having a scandal than solving the murder of an innocent child. While many bleeding hearts whine that the Ramseys have been treated incredibly unfairly, Thomas opens our eyes to just who was being treated unfairly through this entire legal circus. JonBenet Ramsey was denied justice because the DA's office was too busy jumping through hoops for the Ramseys and their lawyers, and systematically leaking information against anyone who disagreed with the prized intruder theory. This book made me sick, but not because of the author. Because the murder of a young girl will probably never be officially solved, even when the chief investigators know exactly who killed her. I commend Steve Thomas for having the courage to put down his badge and let America know the REAL story."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Ramseys are the.......","review":"Good book, very well written and hard to put down. Its filled with enough evidence to point the finger at the Ramseys and a detailed inside view of the Boulder DA's office and their bungling and incompetance. I am still wondering why the Ramseys felt it necessary to hire big gun attorneys before any investigation had even begun and why they still have not given an honest interview with the police. In the case of Polly Klaus, her parents were down at the police station cooperating, answering questions and giving samples until they were eliminated as suspects because they didnt want the police to waste time in the wrong direction. The Ramseys keep saying that the police are wasting time investigating them but the truth is all the evidence points to them and by not cooperating with the police, they have done nothing to clear themselves except hire attorneys who have been stalling, stalling, stalling."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Seven years later and the murder of the beautiful JonBenet goes unsolved.

It was breathtaking and I felt so frustrated that Boulder police's efforts were blocked by the higher ups.

The storage seat is useful but, should be on the side of the handle since the kid will most often be sitting in the back to face forward. The kid will or won't like it regardless of the wheels but, the parent having to pull the thing will want better wheels.

I am currently looking to replace these the wheels."},{"rating":"2","title":"Useful, sturdy, well-designed","review":"We've used and abused our Step 2 wagon for three years. My son loves riding in it, pulling it, putting his toys in it, etc. I love how well-designed it is with cup-holders, a water drainage hole, easy to open walk-through door for when they're small, secret compartment under one of the seats. It fits great in the back of my Honda CR-V, holds picnic supplies no problem, and is not too heavy to lift. I don't recommend very many products. I'm pretty picky. But I do recommend this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product for the Price!","review":"I bought this wagon for my two grandchildren ages 1 and 2. They absolutely LOVE it! It is great because it has seat belts that keep them securely fastened. It has a flip up seat with small amount of storage to carry cups, hats, camera, cell phone, etc. It has a drain plug for easy wash out clean up! It has a locking door which the kids love to get in and out of. Very easy to pull on many different kinds of terrain. Gravel, grass and concrete. Very good product for the price! I highly recommend this wagon!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My son loves his wagon","review":"We bought this for my son for his first birthday. He is now about to turn two. I have a few things that I don't like about the wagon (mainly the loud tires) but the bottomline is whether my son likes the wagon which he does . . . a lot. He loves to sit in the wagon and play with the door and be pulled around (the steering is awesome so don't be afraid to use it indoors). Flat bed wagons just don't compare (even if they have nicer tires sometimes), and Radio Flyer quality is a notch below Step 2 in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"useful toy","review":"my kids love this wagon because they can ride it together. we even use it as a 'stroller for two' at the shopping malls, parks, etc. it is a fun and useful toy at a reasonable price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Wagon","review":"I bought this wagon for my twins 3rd birthday, it is great for walking around town easy to pull!

Great service.The skirt is really a lot more poufy than I was hoping for. It nips in at the waist, but then extends out so much that I ended up looking like Lili Taylor at the end of \\"Dog Fight\\". Not exactly the look I was going for.The skirt is also not hemmed at the bottom, which means it is strictly functional as a costume. It is not built or designed to be worn for normal activities.I sent an email to Hey Viv! this afternoon, looking for a return.

It's the real thing before the MTV got their hands on it and turned it into 'product'. You only think you know what Punk is if you were not around in 1977, especially after the Boys kick into Sonic Reducer after their intro and Stiv Bators attacks the microphone stand.The footage here looks and sound great considering what we're used to from this era. The set is 29 minutes long and the bonus features are...1977 interviews with the band1977 promo (commercial)New interviews with Cheetah Crome & Billy Kristal1977 clip of show openers Steel TipsAltenate angle for one song from behind the drumsGreat stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dead Boys Look Alive","review":"This was filmed by CBS for 60 minuetes in 1977.

My dad is a helicopter pilot and he taped this movie on new year's eve, so he could see in the other day. Awesome, because I don't see any DVDs available so far. With it's storyline shifting between the US and Mexico, Sam Hooten (Larry Hagman) pilots a Hughes 500 series helicopter. He an ex-army pilot who now flies on his own. The story is pretty simple: Sam must protect an old girlfriend (Chris Butler, played by Susan Anspach) - who married a rich gangster - from other gangsters, flying her from USA to Mexico City. The great thing about this movie is the helicopter scenes; with amazing maneuvers and a lot of dogfighting. The movie gets to it's climax when Sam and Chris find themselves trapped by the gangsters and call Sam's old army buddies for help. This movie is worth watching because of the helicopters and planes. A real good classic."},{"rating":"1","title":"low vacuum","review":"I have tried using the Vacupack for two months this summer in Alaska on halibut and salmon and I'm very unhappy with the vacuum strength of this machine.

There were one or characters I enjoyed, but the plot was weak for the most part and the story development was non-existent.

I recommend this book to those who wish to open up their imaginations as well as their hearts. One question......does James appear in any other Night World book?

It seems to be written on about a 5th grade reading level, and it seems to be meant for those not much older than that (11-12). I honestly felt like this was a 12 yr old telling a story to a girlfriend. Simplistic, mushy, tragic (from the heroines pov), and boring. Even the parts that were meant to be exciting were told so matter of fact (like one would say the Pledge of Allegiance), that they were not exciting at all.Granted, I am not a Young Adult. I am an adult. I do however read my share of YA books from this Genre. I loved The Twilight Saga, The Wicked Series, The Summoning (the first book from The Darkest Power series By: Kelly Armstrong), and I just started reading The House of Night series By: PC Cast.

There's comedy, romance(mostly romance) and excellent cult characters, like Ash, who only appears for a little while but you're glad when he does. It's one of the best Nightworld books.

Oates book, I used the Amazon reviews to select this book. I loved the premise of the book and found the writing and the character development to be excellent. Oates paints a gloomy and believable picture of life in a small, depressed town in the 1950's.While the book lived up to its promise in the first half of the novel, it degenerated badly once Iris leaves Hammond. Oates wants to maintain a connection between Iris and Jinx, but she has to stretch very hard to keep it alive. (I felt that it didn't work at all.)The compelling story lost its punch. I kept expecting a powerful denouement, but instead found myself scoffing at the circumstances surrounding the assault scene on the night of Kennedy's assassination.I'm sure I'll try another Oates novel in the future. I only hope it hangs together better than this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Because it is Bitter and Because it is My Heart","review":"\\"Because it is Bitter and Because it is My Heart\\" is a portrayal of life in the fifties for both blacks and whites. Written by Joyce Carol Oats, the book is a slow paced easy-read that coincides with \\"Native Son\\" by Richard Wright. Joyce Carol Oates uses a unique style that can be nis-interpreted to come off as racist or prejudice. During the read, many graphic, almost horrific events are imposed upon the reader. \\"Because it is Bitter and Because it is My Heart\\" is not a book for the weak stomach nor is it a good bedtime read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bitter and Boring","review":"I started reading this book hoping for the best. In turn, I found that my hopes weren't fulfilled. The beginning half was intriguing and kept me wanting more. After the tone changed, the book became bitter and boring. The characters lost their flare, and the whole book lost personality. The book became dull and lost appeal to me. The book's writing style, in the beginning, was original and fun. Following the death of Little Red the book slowly fell apart, leaving me tempted to stop reading the book. If someone asked me to recommend a good book, this would not be the one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This book gets one star for the development of certain characters in the story (Iris's mother, Jinx Fairchild). However, this was one of the most boring books I have ever read. Iris Courtney a dry stick of a girl drifting through life in a cold industrial town...blah....blash....blah. I could not get the point of this novel. If you are a JCO fan and must read this book, save some money and check it out at the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bitter Hearted Book","review":"As a former subject of racism and violence in my life I can relate to all of the characters in this book. All of these experiences are unpleasant; as I read the book I thought I would give the book a chance. As I read I thought the book would redeem itself, but I was constantly let down. I found Joyce Carol Oates to write in an awkward and uncomfortable fashion.When I was reading the book I thought with all the negative views the book presented of African Americans in the 1950's, the writer would be African American. When I found out Joyce Carol Oates was a white woman I found explanations of why J.C. Oates had a narrow point of view.If I were a minority in the 50's and looking to come to America, and if I had read Because It Is Bitter And Because It Is My Heart, I wouldn't want to come to America."},{"rating":"2","title":"Like All of Oates' Books, This One is Incredibly Haunting","review":"This is an incredibly haunting book. It examines the complexinteractions and experiences that go into creating our coreselves.Iris Courtney grows up in an emotionally impoverished and al-coholic home where chaos looms in the wake of her mother'sdrinking. Iris yearns for love and touch but her mother'sdistance causes irrevocable pain, dissociation, and fuge-likestates that become Iris's primary coping skills.Eary in the book, Iris becomes fatefully tied to a young blackman who innocently kills a boy who has been tormenting Iris.Their lives become forever connected as they maintain the se-cret of the killing forever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gone with the 57 Chevy","review":"While I ADORE Joyce Carol Oates and read her works faithfully and recommend them to my gifted English students routinely, this book felt like a modern rewrite of another. The female leading character was not as strong as she should have been even though she is a reflection of another time and attitude. She feigns strength but never pursues what is right for her inner core of self and honesty. She seemed to be transported from Gone With the Wind as part of a sci-fi quirk. The characters are, nonetheless, compelling and interesting. Oates characterizations alone will make the reader persist through the pages to follow the main character's decisions, satisfying or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Racist Misery-Fest Is Demoralizing In The Extreme","review":"Oates doesn't so much explore the issues of race and sex in the 50s as exploit them. In this book black males are scary ignorant animals and white women are prisoners of fear, forced to seek out Prince Charming to save them from the big, scary world. And society made them that way, so there is no other choice for them. How wretched."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Idea, not so good a book","review":"Because It Is Bitter and Because it is My Heart was a book with a good idea and theme, but I found it not well written or thought out. Oates defines all characters as either good or bad, and most are bad. In the first section of the book, Oates jumps around too much and there are few clues as to when the events were happening. The book portrayed the fifties as an awful time in America and that people were almost all bad and that there was no justice. If Oates would have stuck to the theme instead of going off on other little side themes, it had the potential to be a good book. I would not recommend it, unless you are an advanced reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"cummings en process","review":"Tulips and Chimneys are poems which begin early in cummings carreer but are stunning in their simplicity, clarity and maturity. His erotocism, imagery and sensitivity to the beauty of nature manifest themselves in the juxtaposition of thought and its connection to his relationship to the physical environment as he has experienced it.I love his flow of sense as it metamorphosizes through his words. It is never without deliberate meaning.Tulips and Chimneys is a book to carry with you in bookbag or backpack or car or leave at work or in the bathroom or wherever you have a minute to restore your sense of wonder; of the wonder of what one person's mind can do to delight."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cummings' best !","review":"This book stands as Cummings' most playful spontaneous ecstatic intimate beautiful poems ever written.Many of his later collections are too directly philosophical (all the abstractions can really make the poems more of a complex thinking exercise rather than a felt experience) & too syntactically disjointed (disjointed to the point in which frustration replaces giddy enjoyment) in my opinion. however This collection is honestly COMPELLING & practical while maintaining the experimental edge--beautiful & true & honest & surreal & magical & beyond Anything .The last 30 pages of this book (the '&' manuscript) contain some of the best poems ever written in the English language I'm serious"},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak","review":"This rack fell apart less than 24 hours after hanging my clothes on it.

California Cooper (read them all and waiting for the next one), but found myself equally engaged in this one.

In all of my loves I managed to either loan them out with out getting them back or they were otherwise lost. Until you read his series on praising God you can not adequately release God's power into your life. Not that you are to praise God because things go wrong in your life. You Praise HIM because even though things go wrong you know that God is still in charge and that nothing takes HIM by surprise. God's power seems to ride on the waves of our Praise. This book is full of examples of how our praise of God releases HIS power into our world."},{"rating":"1","title":"WRONG REFERENCIAL PHOTO","review":"I bought this item and didn't take care of what it really was, just the \\"TOP\\" of the air filter, the referencial photo shows a whole air filter with the element.please mention this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Little Content, Little Value","review":"The value that this book has is probably due to the fact that you can carry around some of the most important documents in human history.

The rain kept too many people away (although it did clear up for the entire performace). I bought his newest CD and it's a perfect listen. Thoughtful, funny,and beautiful.

I hope to share this CD with my friends who haven't rediscovered you ... yet!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Believe Me When I Say: Worth It","review":"How someone this talented goes virtually unnoticed as a solo artist for 20 years is beyond me, especially when he had the springboard of being in one of the most popular bands of the early 80's, but I've long since given up on trying to figure out why what's good is so rarely the same as what's popular. All I know is: Colin Hay hasn't put out an album that wasn't worth owning since he went on his own, and \\"Are You Lookin' At Me?\\" isn't any different. Buy it. Hear it. Enjoy it. Love it. Just like me. And if you get a chance to see him live, with or without an accompanying band, do it. Unlike many big headline artists these days, it's easily worth the price. Just like all of his albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Colin Hay does it again !!!","review":"As a devoted follower of Colin's Work, it sounded a little more reserved than a typical Colin Hay album. He doesn't go for it as much with his voice, it tends to have more of a relaxed feel to it. That isn't a bad thing at all. The album version of the title track \\"Are You Looking At Me?\\" is very good. I heard him sing it live at a show in Belfast and I was blown away.Since my trip to see him live in Belfast earlier this year I've been looking forward to the arrival of this album. It didn't disappoint either. A nice mix of tunes and another fine album to add to my personal Colin Hay Discography at home. I'd highly recommend you purchase this album. Also, If you want to hear Colin at what I would class as his most powerful, Then buy his album \\"Wayfaring Sons\\" or why not buy them all :-)"},{"rating":"2","title":"More than a yoga book ....... a life lesson.","review":"Molly Fox is the quintessential educator.

I have seen every show I can and learned a lot about the science of food and cooking. I have his book on how to arrange a kitchen and he gives very good advice. This book was an incredible disappointment. One of my problems is that it does not have much useful information in it. For best thing about this book is how to brine shrimp. We tried the chicken brine with freshly juiced oranges and we gave it -1 star out of 5. This is not a cookbook. I will never take this book off my cookbook shelf; it was a wedding gift from my wife.This book is waist of bookshelf space. Watch the shows you will get higher density of information. And yes his shows are 17 minuets of fun and 5 minuets of information."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have in the kitchen","review":"Alton Brown has spent the last several years correcting everything that is wrong with cooking shows...mainly, they seem made for people who already know everything about cooking and food.In this book he brings all his knowledge to your fingertips for fast and easy reference. I use this book almost everytime I cook, not for the recipes but for the information behind a recipe. His show, and now his book, have helped my cooking tremendously.As in his show, this book covers every aspect of cooking (in this case meat). His explanations are thorough and scientifically sound. In fact, his book will most likely someday make it into our homeschool science curriculum. hehe"},{"rating":"2","title":"A treat for the fans","review":"Whoever feels cheated by the short, 30-minute exposure to Alton Brown on the Food Network's \\"Good Eats\\" show, pick up his expansive cookbook/treatise. Always entertaining and informative... the recipes may seem a little bit of a letdown compared to the cooking science and history. Also kind of bulky for a New York teeny kitchen counter -- copy the pages you need and toss them in a slender three-ring recipe binder!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it, love it, love it....BUT...","review":"Alton Brown is my television hero. Ever since I saw the first episode of Good Eats, I have been addicted tto his style and his blending of culinary science and up-to-date wit.When he finally put out a book, I went straight for it. I bought it immediately, and read it cover to cover. Readers will learn a LOT about why and how their cooking happens, and will have a few recipes to try their new knowledge out on. But, the reason I can only give it four stars is the seemingly minimal amount of recipes per cooking technique. It just seemed a bit odd. Also, there was a very abrupt ending of the book before the appendix starts. Jumping between those two pages was like ending a relationship without having closure.It almost broke my heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great kitchen resource","review":"Whether you're a fan of Alton Brown's sometimes odd sense of humor or not, it's hard to deny his vast knowledge of food and technique. I'm Just Here For The Food is a great companion for your kitchen. I have always been drawn to Alton's knowledge because in most things I always find myself wanting to know the \\"why's\\" and \\"how's\\" of how things work, and my experiences in the kitchen are no different. Alton Brown's I'm Just Here series of books have been the perfect compliment for someone who desires to know how and why certain techniques work the way they do, and have given me a much greater understanding of the science behind food, which have made me a much better cook as a result!My only real complaint of the book is that I think it could use a fresher graphic layout with more illustrations and pictures. As in his show, there is a lot of fluff that is not necessary in my opinion, but I know this is also a big draw to others."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Insightful Book","review":"If you've ever seen Good Eats and enjoyed the show then its likely you will enjoy this book.

I can't imagine any fan of Good Eats actually needing to read a review before buying this book but i you need one....Do not buy this book if you expect copious amounts of recipes. The ones listed in this book are more token examples on the cooking principles explained earlier in the chapters. Yes they are viable recipes but I wouldn't consider it even close to a complete cookbook. These aren't the ones on his show either so don't buy this book expecting that either. If you want those go to foodtv.com.Buy this book is you like the principles of cooking that Alton is so famous for, his blending of cooking and science.

Probably the most helpful section after the theoretical stuff up front is found in the source Appendices . Providing the URLs along with the usual phone numbers, etc. is a god-send. My only rap (and it has been quite softened by the afore-mentioned appendices) is that sometimes a recipe asks for an unusual or rare (or fresher than I can get) ingredient. I love his show Good Eats and the book was nothing less than his show in print, even with the humor! Keep it up AB and just might buy that $200 casserole."},{"rating":"2","title":"The science of cooking","review":"Alton Brown explains the science of cooking but don't be afraid because he manages to explain things clearly and in a way that will not put you to sleep. This book is about learning how things cook and how to apply each cooking method to your morsel of food. It also explains what kind of tools (not gadgets!) you should have in your kitchen -- I just bought my cast iron frying pan! Just like his show, Brown provides a wealth of anecdotes to drive home the point. A must for every kitchen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I finally GET IT!","review":"I've never seen Alton Brown on TV, but I have been cooking for a large family for 20 years and enjoy my time in the kitchen.

GREAT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was very disappointed in this book...I am a big fan of Alton Browns TV show...I learn a lot from it. In this volume, Alton spends too much time on jokes, and not enough time on useful information. He has so much to teach, I think he is very knowledgable, at least that is how he comes across on TV...but I found myself skimming through the retoric, looking for cooking information."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple book for beginning cooks","review":"I am surprised by the effusive comments about this book. Now, I Tivo Good Eats and enjoy it as much as anyone ... but unlike Alton's shows which go into reasonable depth on narrow (and often unconventional) topics, this book is too basic to be helpful to an experienced cook, and too shallow to be interesting to the cooking wonk. Now, if you do not know the difference between braising and boiling or the difference between conduction and convection, then you might find the book marginally useful, however there are other books -- some of which Alton himself cites -- which provide more meaningful discussions of the technique or science of cooking. As far as included recipes go, they are few and uninspired, apparently intended primarily to illustrate techniques."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great detail","review":"The detail Alton Brown goes into in this book can sometimes seem like too much if you have any idea how to cook.

Check it out if you like Alton Brown."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alton+Food=Good Eats","review":"In this long-awaited volume, the guru of \\"Good Eats,\\" Alton Brown, trots out his unique, highly illuminating philosophy on various methods of cooking.From roasting to frying to everything-but-baking, if it involves applying heat to food, it's in here.Do NOT think this is a mere cookbook. Rather, this is a textual toolkit which will leave the reader well-equipped to enter the kitchen and create from scratch, which as any cook will tell you is the greatest culinary joy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mini cooking school","review":"This is good instruction for understanding the whys of cooking. I really like the footnotes and the historical bits. It's also refreshing to read something so opinionated. For example, AB states that hamburger cooked beyond medium is not worth cooking at all.I would recommend this for someone who already knows their way around a kitchen. Otherwise, all the equipment required might be too overwhelming. Also, it takes a good bit of experience to use his guidelines and adapt them to the amount of food and servings one might need. Some of his recipes produce one serving, some 8 and so on. And it's all well and good to experiment with techniques and flavors but not everyone can afford a whole strip roast to cut into steaks for testing. Which is why he did it already.I f you are someone who likes the obsessive explanations of Cook's Illustrated, you will dig this book. Ir's not a cook book, it is a text book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intersting, if impractical","review":"Definately intersting, and definately just for fun.

It completely shook my sense of social and political reality. It is a completely fact-based, objective, and unbelievably insightful explanation for the economic, and therefore social, realities of this country. It was a true epiphany. Everything finally made sense as the layers of years of schooling and media indoctrination melted away, and the truth about what's really going on in this country became amazingly clear.If you read this book, you should be ready to give up any common preconceptions on the topic of poverty and the social \\"welfare\\" systems.

For instance, there's some slow songs but when i hear Laswell on that bass, its so perfect with Buck. i love Inferno/heatseeker... it changes like 5 times in one song, its great. and other songs like Armed just make me crack up but its good.

Dan Jurgens must have loved Simonson's writing so much that it stuck to his subconscious.This is a cheap way to get people to buy the comic: DEATH OF ODIN may sound interesting but the story was flawed and doesn't know which direction it wants to go. Dan Jurgens may be the worst THOR scribe ever.

Unfortunately, the Maidenform, Vanity Fair, Lily of France, and other associated brands, are fitted for women who are filled out evenly, not low-busted. I have always found these labels to gap at the top of the cup in my correct size, but cut in and leave an unsightly line at the top of the cup if I try sizing down. I had hoped that a lower-cut style with padding would solve this, but it did not. To me (as someone who sews) it seemed like the cup sizing was not changed to accommodate the pad, and the top edge of the cup cut in quite a bit. The dent with a roll of excess breast over the top was definitely a fashion \\"don't\\". If you're built less full across your upper chest and are looking for something that will move everything up, this is probably not the first brand you should try."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite Bra","review":"One of the only very natural looking \\"push up\\" bra I've able to find- the padding is set lower in the bra for a more natural look under clothes.

I would highly recommend it- I own one in every color!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not perfect for me but overall a good buy","review":"I have had small breasts since... well my whole life, and am constantly looking for a bra that will enhance what little I have. This particular bra would have been excellent IF I had the assets to fill the entire cup. That said, it is comfortable and I like the fancy frill on the sides and up the straps. I was worried it may irritate my skin but it isn't coarse like some other bra's extra frill is (I have very sensitive skin). I would have given it 5 stars, but like I said it doesn't quite suit precisely what I needed.

Browde, who has sold over twenty million albums has worked with such artists as Poison, Joan Jett and Ted Nugent. From narcoleptic nuns, nymphomaniacs, the Mafia, a huckster televangelist, dying Latin teachers, corrupt school administrators, inept policemen, unscrupulous lawyers, buffoon reporters, half -- witted rock and roll musicians, transsexual record company presidents, drug addicted disc jockeys, greedy family members and the lovely Nina Pennington, this novel is a must for anyone who lived or wanted to live in the '70s as a teenager."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"The talk time for the handset is about two hours, which I consider to be very low for a cordless phone and more comparable to a cell phone.

The book is mentally and technically sloppy. Mentally, the comparison of GNP to total corporate receipts is nonsense - ideological pap. The GNP of Israel is less than the corporate receipts for Ford. What does that tell you? Ford has automotive competitors, shareholders and no army --- the comparison is ideologically motivated anti-business nonsense.Technically, among the numerous errors I found, the worst was the statement that Wal-Mart had 60% of the U.S. retail market.

That information is not vast, and he rarely includes them in the book. I was hurt to find that on the cover George portrays himself as the \\"genius behind the Beatles\\" and shows a picture of himself and the Beatles, yet fails to mention them as he should. If you are looking for information on the recording process this is the book for you, but if you are looking for information about the Beatles I feel you will be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Posted Bio","review":"Just to point out --The biography posted is for George Martin, the sci-fi writer,who isn't the same person (as far as I know!) as the Beatles'producer. FYI."},{"rating":"1","title":"a big letdown","review":"First, let me say that I absolutely love the Beatles and am a huge fan and admirer of George Martin - that's why I bought this book. However, it has been a huge disappointment for me. It manages to take a fascinating subject and make it boring. It didn't really reveal any new Beatles facts and is not very fun at all to read. This story has been told better in a million other places. Also, it's old - the copyright date for this version is 1995 but that's for the paperback version - it really came out in the late 70s. Sorry George, you're great, but this book was a big letdown.P.S. What's with the terrible grammar in the title? Who came up with that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This is a blandly written book, that should have more of the Beatles in it. And Martin is so full of himself, John Lennon was right when he complained that those who worked WITH the Beatles thought they WERE the Beatles. And Martin basically makes that claim when he says, \\"John and Paul were the big talents in the Beatles. George, Ringo and I were also-rans.\\" To include himself as being as important as George and Ringo in the Beatles' success shows nauseating conceit. LET IT BE is a great Beatles album, and Martin had NOTHING to do with its production. The Beatles might have been successful without George or Ringo, but I doubt they would have been enduring phenomenons. But I can still see them having been phenomenons without Martin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beatles","review":"A must read for anyone involved in the making of music as it pertains to production and recording. It however exhibits George Martins conservative nature and is someone bias from his perspective. A much superior book is Here,There, and Everywhere by Geoff Emerick. It is the same subject matter but much more detailed and objective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing new to Beatles junkies, but educational on producing","review":"If you are a Beatles junkie, you will want to read this just like any other book on the Fab Four to soak up more knowledge and learn first hand from someone that was an insider with not much to gain by not telling the truth. However, I found nothing that was very revealing that I have not read before about how songs were recorded or evolved in the studio. The exception, of course, is there is a lot of details about what a sound engineer and a producer really do for any studio recording. This information is more for those interested in techniques though, and not anything to do with the Beatles, except that there were some pioneering going on between George Martin's knowledge and the Beatles music. They both were learning from each other which is why there were such a great combination."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining & Informative look into British recording history","review":"Naturally, George Martin's association with The Beatles as their producer gets a good amount of ink, but having read so much about that in other publications, I found the book to be more interesting from a standpoint of how far the recording industry had come from the time Martin entered it, to when when the book was published in the mid-90's - literally from direct-to-wax recording, using hanging-weight gravity propulsion for record cutting machinery, to multi-track recording capability. For anyone with a fascination, or even a cursory interest, in the history of audio recording, \\"All You Need Is Ears\\" is a fun and informative read, which I found hard to put down until the end. And, even with all I had read about The Beatles' recording sessions, there were still a few surprises from Martin's memory archives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Overview","review":"I good read if you are looking for an overview on Anglican/Episcopal Christianity. The book opens with a brief history of the Anglican Church - not a true history per se - but an historical overview. The development of the current Church is discussed, along with challenges and changes in Anglicanism from the Reformation through the end of the last century. The remainder of the book discusses Anglican theology of worship, prayer and the Incarnation.The Anglican/Episcopalian tradition is currently undergoing profound conflict on many of the elements of the theology of the Church - especially as it pertains to ordination. The book will be well received by anyone looking to better understand why these conflicts not only exist, but almost must exist in the Anglican Church.

I hoped that music was a kind of reconstruction of the Ancient Greek music, but no, it was modern mix of depressive academic avant-garde and Oriental-Greek folk style music. Maybe as a product of modern Greek culture it could be interesting to somebody (I prefer Vangelis), but if you are trying to understand the spirit of the Ancient Greece and antique poetry - this CD wouldn\`t help you.Try CDs by Ensemble De Organographia with the instrumental music of Ancient Greeks and CD \\"Melpomen\\" by Conrad Steinmann and Schola Cantorum Basilensis - they sings the lyrics by Sappho in original, very impressive and beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"black chrome sockets","review":"Decent little set of tools, black chrome..laser etched. typically I use craftsman or snap-on, but took a shot at this set for around the house work.

The case was nice and thin, easily stuffed under or behind many vehicle seats."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT Black Chrome NOR Laser Etched","review":"This is not \\"laser etched\\" black chrome, whatsoever. Each of the bits has a baked enamel finish with painted sizes in gold; you know how long that will last with use, don't you? If the case were decent, once the lettering disappears off the bits, one could find the size with the ETCHED PLASTIC numbers, but the plastic is an injection molding form that is paper thin. This should last for about 6 weeks of use before it crumbles. Very disappointed, to say the least. Save your money and purchase something other than the \\"New\\" Stanley. Sending it back.

Tyler Fairy or Tyler Scary is a disgrace and should slapped senseless like his assinine fanbase. Just because he gives you a cheesy rags to riches story of his life and throws some Gospel songs in his secondhand plays dont make him the best thing since bread and butter.

If I wanted to see a stage play, I'd go to a theatre. I thought the idea to make this a stage play took away from the realism of the movie/play.

Sure, he returns to the themes that were present in his previous plays (infidelity, child abuse) but I have to say that the writing is simply superb. As soon as Madea hits the stage, the jokes come at you like a fast spitball. Since I'm not really a fan of musicals, I only tolerated the singing in Mr. Perry's previous DVDs because of the good script. But in \\"Madea Goes to Jail\\", the singing is a perfect compliment to the play. The gospel favorite, \\"Jesus loves me\\" is an absolute tear-jerker. Trust me, you definitely won't be disappointed with this DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"funny and thought provoking","review":"As always Tyler Perry will have you laughing and crying at the same time.

We ended up watching it twice. It is the best TP DVD we own in my opinion. All the others are great and quite funny, but they seem to die out at the end. This one kept up laughing all the way through. The singing was great, the songs took us back to the 70's and 80's.I believe there is a difference between not personally liking something and something being poorly done.

Even more so is the Halle Orch. a wild card. It is capable of sounding quite at home in Sibelius -- witness the great Sibelius fourth that Barbirolli recorded in 1969 -- but you'd never know it form this out-of-sorts program of Sibelius's most popular occasional pieces. The brass chords that open Finlandia are so grating that it's hard to continue, and things don't get better later on in this rough-as-sandpaper reading. Every item dates form a two-day session in Jan. 1966, and the ship never rights itself. It's too bad that the complete Sibelius edition that EMI put out to honor Barbirolli begins with this same CD; it must be one of the few outright duds in the later career of an underestimated conductor who rose to eminence, quite deservedly, in the five or six years before he died."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Subtitles","review":"Despite all claims on the DVD, booklet, and box, I have found no way to get the subtitle option on the onscreen menu to work and no way for the English subtitles (or Spanish ones) to be shown.

It was satisfying, enjoyable, thought provoking and useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Opinion of a Newcomer","review":"Rebecca Blood's book, The Weblog Handbook, proved to me, as a newcomer to weblogs and and self-professed technophobe, to be extremely useful and accessible. Her clear and semi-formal language was comforting and inviting. I felt as if she were talking to me as a friend with a common interest; her tone was one that seemed to anticipate and respect my trepidation. In addition to her language and tone, I found the content of her book to be extremely useful. I have to confess to not having read similar books, and cannot adequately compare her work to others like it. I found particularly useful, nonetheless, her description of the possibilities for weblogs, possibilities that I had not previously considered. I also appreciate her \\"netiquette\\" advice that, if taken to heart, will make weblogs, and the web in general, a welcoming and productive place. Her book definitely piques my interest in weblogs, as well as my desire to participate in them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teaching a writing teacher to blog","review":"The Weblog Handbook is now an addition to my Rhetoric and Composition Studies bookshelf.

Most people can gather what blood has outlined through experience and reading other blogs.

Her passion is evident, and for a beginner, absolute-just-heard-of-blogging-and-wants-to-know-more person, this is the perfect book. Conceptually, this book is a great help.If you know or have any experience with bloging, you might try elsewhere, this read might be boring. She gives great examples, but they are difficult to understand because there are no real to life visuals.Great, easy read, okay execution, but not for experienced bloggers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes me want to start my own weblog today!","review":"I like Rebecca's Pocket and have been considering starting my own blog so I purchased this book. The best thing about this book is that Rebecca is obviously very enthusiastic aboout blogging, especially about what it can do for the confidence and writing abilities of the blogger. The book gives some practical questions potential bloggers need to ask themselves before starting a blog. The only reason this book isn't rated higher is that it is a little outdated - but it still has good information.Did I end up starting a blog after reading a book? Not yet.

Terrible research, incorrect information, and psuedo-pop psychology from the author detract from this tragic tale of four slain innocent women. It's hard to support a book that cannot get even the most basic facts correct: for example Steven and Cary Stayner lived on \\"Bette Street\\" not \\"Betty\\" and Joie Armstrong's murder date is listed with two different dates---despicable. For a more thorough, much better written, and accurate outlook on this truly fascinating story I was much, much more pleased with Dennis McDougal's \\"The Yosemite Murders.\\" Plus McDougal is not afraid to take on the FBI who bungled this case, while Smith comes across like a FEEB lapdog."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit dull","review":"Cary Stayner's poor excuse for turning into a murderer is that he was in the shadow of his younger brother (who was kidnapped as a boy)??? If standing in the shadow of a sibling is reason to become a murderer then half the country would be out there killing people. The writer gives a very tabloid type of read. There is nothing substantial to the book. John Walsh gave a chapter in one of his books to this story and I remember him describing the room that the three women stayed in. It was described so chillingly that I got goosebumps."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor and poorer","review":"Unfortunately, I probably read more information and had more insight on this crime having read the local paper.

It is impossible to comprehend their ability to deal now with thier older son being the perpretator of these ghastly murders. This book details the investigation into those murders & offers insight to the shadow Cary has lived under all his life. It is not a page turner in the sense it is suspensful but once started you cannot put it down as it reveals how the tragic circumstances transpired & then relates Cary's confession of the hideous crimes. If you are going to follow the trial I recommend this book for the background it provides."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shamefully Inaccurate","review":"As a person who happens to be friends with Cary Stayner (correspond often), I would have to agree with the previous reviews. According to things I've learned first hand, this book is TOTALLY INACCURATE in many areas. For example, the book said Cary didn't attend Stevens funeral...that is an outright LIE!

It was merely boring, predictable, and by the numbers. For one thing, it's only called The Graveyard because that's an interesting title; for another, it's set in---get this-----a summer camp. At night. With a killer on the loose. You have horny twenty-somethings, a nude scene---with a woman and not a man nude, by the way---and a shower scene with still more nudity. The characters have no discernable characters, and the only thing that was missing was a hockey mask. It's like the director and writer didn't even put any effort into it all. Oh, yeah, and there was a bunch of running and yelling and a stupid cop and misdirection and....stuff, none of which made much of an impression at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too bad","review":"I rented this DVD and actually really enjoyed the first 30 minutes. The title is misleading as the graveyard is only a backdrop for a sleep-away camp type slasher flick. The characters for the most part are good and the suspense level is more than expected for the first 45 minutes, but then it drops off quick. The killer is known almost immidiately and a few characters never really fit into the plot. Overall, this is no classic, but fits the general mold of 80's slasher flick done 20 years past it time..."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor man","review":"1st 10 minutes were all right but it went to nothing but a waste of my time after that!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS IS BLOODY MURDER 3 PEOPLE","review":"Well my title says everthing this movie was suposed to be bloody murder 3 but because this series of terrible horror movies was so trashed and got such a bad reputation the makers decided that they will .......... * stop production ? * ..........

The following scenes take place in a summer camp and then the movie's final scene close in graveyard where the story trys to come together and end there. There are quite a few big bloopers out in this movie that I cannot believe went by the editting staff. One of the biggest examples is when the cop got knocked over, hit his head on the tombstone, shot and dropped his gun and he was suddenly gone. Not too mention a few others. I seen better acting in Night of The Living Dead zombies than I did in this movie. Most of the script was well written but was ruined by the bad acting."},{"rating":"1","title":"This should of stayed in the Graveyard","review":"A group of friends go to a graveyard for a game of hide and seek but something happens that night when their friend Eric is accidently killed.

They all camp up at this camping resort with cabins and what not. Suddenly someone is starting to kill everyone off one by one. No logic in this brain dead thriller killer movie.

The only real saving grace for this book is the humorous Southern slant on vampires and the interesting history behind the old Mountain Man as he recalls his terror in 'Nam. The ending is predictable and disappointing. If you're looking for a good vampire book, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"I thought this book was going to be a boring one , but once I started reading it I couldn't put it down.

I can't tell you how much you will love this book if you are sharing yoga with a loved one. My sister snatched mine off my bookshelf one day and said she would borrow it and now refuses to give it back she's having so much fun with it! It has lovely photos, clear descriptions and great yoga positions that channel amazing energy between you and your mate! It is completely user friendly and can be understood easily for a beginner to a pro at yoga. It simply offers a few more additions to yoga that can include your lover for a completely sensual experience! At any rate, I am now buying myself another copy...these are things I do not want to forget! Wonderful Book! Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine debut novel by a talented writer.","review":"Lelia Kelly's \\"Presumption of Guilt\\" is a fine legal thriller/police prodecural. Her protagonist is Laura Chastain, a corporate lawyer with a talent for criminal defense work. After getting a high-profile client off the hook, Laura takes on the case of a cop who is accused of killing a suspect. Laura gradually finds out that she has taken on a case that is extremely complex and potentially dangerous. She also becomes romantically involved with an older man with whom she falls deeply in love. Kelly writes dialogue that is funny and sharp. Her plot is fairly tight and engrossing until the end, which is a little too complicated and has one too many coincidences. Having read this book, and the next in the series, \\"False Witness,\\" I recommend Lelia Kelly's novels to fans of this genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable holiday reading","review":"The first novel by Lelia Kelly is not an earth shaking renewal or a highly literary thriller novel. However... she does provide you with a very well written and exciting few hours of escape.Lawyer Laura Chastain is certainly someone I could enjoy in a couple of sequels. She is a modern heroine that simply tries to live her life as good as she can and is not too bothered with all the psychological problems some of our current lady protagonists seem to need these days ( Scarpetta e.g.).Instead we have a fast rolling storyline and a good plot lived out be real and, mostly likeable characters.Only one recommendation...simply enjoy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Spellbinding, couldn't put it down.","review":"I dearly hope Lelia Kelly writes another book soon. I couldn't put it down. I work in a law firm and usually read every legal suspense thiller I can get my hands on. Ms. Kelly's book is now one of my favorites.

I found it in the Astrology section, and had hoped to find information that will help in recognizing the charts of people who have the potential for violence. Instead, I found a book that was shallow in the extreme. There was very little on any of these cases to explain the pattern of energies. The greatest value in the book was the birth data. Using this, the astrologer can construct the chart and do his own deliniation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely Simplistic","review":"I find it very painful reading. First off, the interpretations of the charts are very run of the mill. The authors do not take time to explain the aspects fully and they tend to gloss over them in a hurried way. Also according to them, the fourth house rules the father and the tenth rules the mother. That is backward. Most readers who know even a little about astrology know that the opposite is true. This book was obviously made for money- and unfortunately, the authors got mine. A much better read is \\"Destined for Murder\\" Profiles of Six Serial Killers, by Sandra Harrisson Young w/ astrological commentary by Edna Rowland. This book is much shorter, yet it is better researched, more concise and the data is more accurate.

One must weigh a unity and strength of purpose, an entirely idiomatic response to instrumental colour and texture (the dark, craggy hues of the first two movements especially striking); and most important of all that very special, very characteristically Barbirollian radiance, humanity--call it what you will. One point of interest for those of us updating our LPs (and EMI have made a splendid job of the digital remastering): among minor orchestral mishaps in the Scherzo, were four bars of missing horn obbligato (at nine bars before fig 20). Not any more! The original solo horn player, Nicholas Busch, has returned to the scene of this momentary aberration (Watford Town Hall), and the absent bars have been ingeniously (you would never know) reinstated. There's even a timely grunt from Sir John, as if in approval. Something of a classic, then."},{"rating":"2","title":"love","review":"i love this because it is much more comfortable then a comb that is all metal. its better on the hands than a metal handle. downfalls are rotating teeth can make a rattling sound,which isnt a huge deal and also that you dont get to pick your color. it works very well though"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not just for pets!","review":"I love, love this comb. I managed a Veterinarian office for 20 years and the rotating teeth combs were wonderful to groom a long hair pet (I have a poodle and it makes getting small tangles out of her hair much easier). Worked so well that many of us purchased them to use on our own hair. I've used one for years. My original broke so I purchased this one and it's the nicest one I've seen. It's sturdy, but, also comfortable in your hand. My granddaughter liked using it so much, I bought her one too! She says she never had such an easy time getting all the tangles out her long hair.

I was told by my groomer to get a comb like this and it was the only one I could find online and in stores. I'm very happy with it. My dog doesn't hate to get brushed now and it gets all of her knots out. It's worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy, and at this price, you might as well get a professional one.","review":"I groom professionally, and I ordered this comb as a cheap temporary replacement for a professional (metal) comb, until the professional one I really wanted was back in stock. To put it simply, I used this comb a total of three times before I got fed up and asked to borrow one of my coworkers combs until I could get a better replacement. This comb is flimsy, and it doesn't penetrate nearly as well as a real grooming comb. At all. If anything, I think it's more painful for the dog too, because it has too much bend and give, making it snag and pull too easy instead of going straight through the hair. For LESS money, you can buy a metal/durable comb that will not only last longer, but will be easier to use, and less of a strain on your poor dog. I recommend a stainless steel comb from safari, if you're looking for an inexpensive, yet fantastic comb (I believe it's 6.99, which makes it cheaper than these plastic/crappy bamboo ones)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Pet Comb I have ever found.....","review":"The rotating stainless-steel teeth on this comb make an easy experience of combing your favorite pet, dog, cat, rabbit, etc. I use mine every day and my two cats love it. You can use the course side of the comb for thick or tangled hair. Then, you can use the fine side of the comb for finishing your grooming. This leaves the hair tangleless and shiny. It also helps to remove static from the hair. Buy it!

Since many kids of all ages love Care Bears, getting this book would encourage small children to read! They could also cuddle with Tugs and care for him.

I can substitute vegan cheese in all the vegetarian Mexican dishes I know and essentially have the same repertoire.Other than that major flaw, some of the recipes are good and seem fairly authentic.

Rinse the car off with the hose.DON'T EVER PUT THE MIT IN THE SOAPY CAR WASH WATER! You will just get the water dirty and end up scrubbing your car with dirt.

I had the privilege of knowing Juan because Karl Price happens to be my uncle. One might say that this would color my thinking of the book and therefore this review, but, being one who also likes to write, I think the book is very well-written. Writing it in the first person, with Juan telling his own story, makes it all the more heart-wrenching.

They both loved the music and the vibrations.I like that there is three settings on it for the music. There is one for just the music, then there is one for both all the music and the lights, and then there is one for one song and the lights.

The movie is full of fierce action, but it takes plenty of time to develop the characters, too.I enjoyed many aspects of the movie, the fact that it prefers to develop subtle romantic tension between Jet Li and Christy Chung than to have them kissing each other. Interspersed within these moments are some kinetically charged action sequences that make Steven Seagal and Jean Claude Van Damme movies feel lethargic in comparison. Li is a real treat to watch on the screen, moving gracefully and doing all the great moves and martial arts his fans are accustomed to. Surprisingly, he shows he can hold his own with a gun, too.New Jet Li fans should try to look for this film. There's a lot to appreciate about it, the film's full of great action, it's humorous, has characters we care about, and knows how to thrill the audience at the same time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy Bodyguard from Beijing - Not The Enforcer","review":"...P>This film was originally called The Bodyguard from Beijing.

Being a moral guy that I am - I liked this movie for the absence of cursing and sex.

The story is quite impressive (if you can get past the despicable dubbing), which makes the action more dramatic and important. The few action sequences aren't all that stunning, but the one at the end is outstanding. Most of the action is with guns. There is a kung-fu fight at the end that is pretty cool, but they put the bad guy on a wire, so it doesn't match the rest of the movie which shows Jet Li doing all of his stunts without one (even though he really should have had one) But that is forgivable too.

Even though the story wasn't deep or orginal, this was a great movie. However, this DVD had some of the worst picture quality I have ever seen. The color and clarity was poor. Almost half the screen was cut up and the other half was filled up with big text subtitles. The Trailers were cut up scenes just put together in a sloppy sequence that didn't flow at all.

There is only two action scenes in the whole movie, with only one containing martial arts. Now when buying/watching movies of this sort, you're not looking for Grammy Winners, but for more of martial arts. The last complaint I have for this movie is that its subtitled and not dubbed.

If you want to see an hour of boring dialog and laughable (supposed to be serious) acting, get this movie. If you like Jet Li for the same reason I do, leave this DVD out of your collection, buy Fist of Legend or Black Mask, or ANYTHING but this!The final fight sequences are great, but they are only 10 minutes or so of the entire movie that's worth anything.

After all, who doesn't need a good laugh after a horrible, miserable breakup?The bottom line, however, is that I just didn't find this book funny -- not even mildly amusing. Take, for example, a selection of \\"Sassy Scoops\\" offered by the author for coping with your ex:-- Post his number on the campus bulletin board as \\"pizza delivery.\\"-- Trust your inner guidance system. When that little voice in the back of your head tells you to kick his ass, go for it.-- During a post-breakup shopping spree, cute shoes qualify as a \\"need\\" and not a \\"want.\\" Pick up any pair with a heel. They'll make you appear taller and thinner and give him an instant height complex.Funny?

It made me feel like I could get my life together again and for a while I felt like a truck had hit me. It also made me laugh so hard at some of the things going through my head. I'm giving it four stars because I think that some people might prefer a more clinical approach to dealing with a breakup. I personally did not find the clinical style books to be very helpful though. I liked this one because of the advice, but also how it helped me formulate a game plan for getting through this experience. If you have a good sense of humor, you will really really like it. I also recommend Letting Go, by Cabot although it is very clinical. It would be a good one to get in addition to this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"After I broke up with my boyfriend (whom I lived with for almost 2 years,) I was devastated. I read this book, among many others, hoping to find some comfort or insight into the process of breaking up and grieving (with also a little humor!)Instead, this book insulted me with its immaturity. In the first chapter, the author writes under the headline \\"Sassy Battle Plan\\" to \\"secure embarassing photos of him to use in the future.\\"I mean, if you only saw a guy once or twice and are just feeling a bit annoyed or if you still find high-schoolish \\"schemes\\" funny, than maybe this is the book for you.But if you are looking for any kind of useful advice about grieving and moving on, this is not the book to buy.

Gifts from the earth most definitely have power, but I have found that not all people react to the same stone in the same way. I prefer to find my own way rather than wade through the gushing affirmations. The author seems to pick almost at random meanings to be assigned to the minerals and stones, except for the obvious attributes long assigned to pink quartz, rock quartz, elestial crystals, etc. If this is a legitimate field of inquiry (i.e. the study of rocks and how they affect us) then serious and strenuous research is what we need, not ladies running around in long dresses and dreaming up \\"pearls of wisdom\\". The earth is infinitely complex and needs -- and deserves -- a more dignified approach. I actually tossed this one out, when usually I give my unwanted books to the Library. Not a good book to give you real insight into the field."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fanfreakintastic!!!","review":"I'm very pleased with this purchase.

I am a former English teacher, and the entries are poorly written, lack organization, and so generic that it is difficult to find any distinctions between stones at times. (Is there one stone that is not \\"good for meditation?\\" or that wasn't in the breastplate of the high priest?) The bright spot of the book is the number of stones that it discusses, but without pictures, volume alone is negated. It reads much as a collection of research from other sources all dumped together without any attempt at organization or rewriting. An appendix with a summary chart of stones and their primary functions would have helped this book tremendously, since the individual entries are so difficult to follow. Ideas are repeated in many entries, and this book is so difficult to use that I intend to get rid of it soon and find something more concise and user-friendly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Reference!","review":"This book is very complete - but does not have any photos of the stones. It is still a very valuable resource on every type of crystal, stone, and mineral imaginable, but it would help to have photos to identify them if you are not familiar with them already. The companion volume, A Mineralogical Pictoral, is meant to accompany this volume, I assume.

Of all my books this is the most informative reference, the only thing it's truly lacking are photographs. It would be nice if this book would have a companion that had photographs of the different stones and crystals, without images this book is lacking. I use my Crystal Bibles volumes 1 and 2 By Judy Hall as my photographic references and I use this book to get the detailed information about the properties of the stones.With all of that being said, this book is essential to have when studying stones and crystals and their properties. One other perspective is that the book gives a male and female perspective of each stone which gives a more complete description.Bottom line, I highly recommend this book to everyone that would like to know more about stones and their healing properties. This is a great and useful resource!."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very thorough","review":"This is an extensive collection of information that is unsurpassed.

It's very rare that you'll find a type of stone (no matter how obscure) that isn't listed here.My only beef with it is that stones are more individualized with what they're suited for, than Melody would have you believe. (For instance, all of a certain kind of amethysts aren't suited for exactly the same thing, and the same goes true for all of any kind of stone...Still, it is pretty much \\"the encyclopedia\\".

The acting is harsh, even by B-flick standards and the jokes either don't make sense or just aren't funny. (Like Judy's cousin purposely sabotaging the food orders. Why?)

If one can get past the fact that this book is actually a part of the Earthsea Trilogy, and how different it is from the others, then it would have gotten a four-to-five star rating. Therefore I would recommend it for anyone who hasnt developed a love and sympathy for the original characters. But as for me, a reader of the original trilogy, I simply couldnt ignore how out of place this book was and felt compelled to give the story a low rating. For me, it remains the Earthsea TRILOGY."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of place","review":"I suppose Tehanu is a decent book in its own right, but I don't know what inspired LeGuin to try to add it to the Earthsea trilogy instead of just making it a completely different story. She removed almost everything which made the first three books so great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"I'm a great lover of the Earthsea Trilogy, but I will never count this book as a part of it. It was a complete rip-off of Dreamsnake by Vonda N. McIntyre, a book I know LeGuin admired since it quotes her positive reveiw on the back cover. It has no where near the charm as the original three (the first being the best, in my opinion- it goes downhill from there)."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Unfortunate Turning","review":"This book is an unfortunate ending to a really excellent and imaginative trilogy. It's very disturbing to have a character (Ged) whom you liked and respected robbed of any dignity and reduced to a whining loser who can see no better way than to wallow in self-pity and scrabble around in the dirt and herd the goats. Why did the heroine abandon what she was offered--learning and wisdom that might have helped improve the world--to become a boring housewife? Only the dragons maintain their original charm. This is supposed to be a great feminist novel. Well, please note that the positive social change here is still in the hands of a man--the young king. A very sad progression on the part of the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Feminist\\" manifesto?","review":"I don't know about other readers, but I found this book to be incredibly antifeminist. Forget about what Le Guin did to poor Ged. What is feminist about taking the character of Tenar--a former priestess and student of magic--and sticking her in the kitchen barefoot and pregnant? Let's not assume that every book that deals with women is automatically a feminist work.Besides that, Le Guin seems almost embarassed about the Earthsea books. If that's the case, why not just leave the trilogy as it is?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring!!","review":"It is as boring and developed as the second book. Hmm.. could I start a new journey with the quests of Lebannon.. or, could I write about everyone becoming farmers.. The emptiness between the pages is so mind-blowing since it is so obvious what the deal is with Therru. Feels too much like a sell out just to make a couple of bucks off a new book while sacrificing a legacy."},{"rating":"1","title":"I fail to see the point","review":"Tehanu can only be described in one simple word: boring. It takes a very long time for the plot to thicken in this book; the characters are so deeply developed that the author leaves little room for an actual plot. The ending of the book is very unsatisfying, it left me asking \\"Now what?\\" I also found the dialog of the characters choppy, and difficult to comprehend. However, I do like how deeply the characters WERE developed, despite the terrible plot. I also really enjoyed the concept of there being a central character that is actually female. (Rarely does a science fiction book dare do this.) Tehanu is a book not about setting and external circumstances (like most sf) but of the deep, emotional conflicts of human nature. It's really too bad that this awesome concept was presented in such a boring, pointless way."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yucky","review":"Oh gosh, where do I begin? Wait, I know, this book STINKS! I was an avid reader of Mrs LeGuin's books until I read this piece of fire-fodder. How can she expect to keep any readers, especially those of the male gender, if she writes like THIS? I loved the first three, but this one is bad beyond words."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful story of life after the excitement dies down","review":"This was a great book. How often do we get to see characters 20 years after all the adventure? It's crazy to think that their lives will still be exciting and wonderful. We all change, and so has EarthSea. Tehanu tells the story of a woman who used to be someone. She then settled down and had a normal life. Everyone forgot who she had been. But she never forgot who she used to be, and never stopped wondering if her choices were right. How true for all of us. I would reccomend this book to readers who are not afraid of some uncomfortable and depressing parts. It's hard to see a hero cast aside by fate. But really, they're not dead, they just have a new life to begin."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disapointment","review":"The first three books of the Earthsea trilogy we magnificent works of art. The were real fantasy with adventure and danger and a real foe to fight. Tehanau was nothing like them. The characters hardly travel. All the magic that capitivated readers seems to have faded. This seemed to deal more with a woman's place and where it should be. I think that what LeGuin is trying to say is true, woman should have equal rights. But when writing a series you have a duty to the readers to make the series flow, to give them what they want. Tehanu did not do that. Perhaps this series should have ended with The Farthest Shore. I wish LeGuin would write more stories of Earthsea in the flavor and style of the first three."},{"rating":"1","title":"This one should never have been written.","review":"The Earthsea Trilogy was and is classic- and a trilogy it should have remained. Book four is both unnecessary and completely forgettable."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Trilogy Gone Sour","review":"This book was a dismaying shock. Having loved the first three books of this TRILOGY and discovering the existence of a fourth, I eagerly read the latest addition. Unfortunately, I found it to be FAR removed from the original set by not only its tone, but it was also written about twenty years after the first three. In fact, the only similarity I detected was that the characters' names and the surroundings were familiar; however,everything had been warped by a set politics and religious opinions that are foreign to the land of Earthsea. This book was as disappointing and repulsive as the the other members of this ill-fated trio were captivating and brilliant. A great trilogy it was, and a trilogy it should have remained. As it is, Tehanu has caused my taste for Ursula LeGuin's works to turn sour."},{"rating":"1","title":"How is this an award winner?","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed Le Guin's first three books in this series. I thought they were excellent fantasy. This one however, is just bad. There is no other way to describe it. It plods along, it is preachy, it ends terribly, nothing exciting ever happens.Le Guin is a first rate author and I really liked The Left Hand of Darkness and The Dispossessed. This is one to avoid, however."},{"rating":"1","title":"what was that?","review":"I read all the other books and thought they were great, but for some reason I couldn't follow this book. I had to keep rereading every thing she wrote. This book just couldn't keep my attention."},{"rating":"1","title":"From fantasy to feminist polemic","review":"I had read the original Earthsea trilogy as a teenager, and found the world le Guin created and the story she crafted within it to be compelling and utterly original. How disappointing to learn that she spent the time between the trilogy and Tehanu, apparently, watching the Lifetime Channel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I was a fan of Leguin. One of my all time favorites is the Earthsea Trilogy. Until I bought the next books in the series. Completely different. Perhaps interesting and compelling reading if you are a hardcore feminist, but otherwise: forget it. I read a book for its contents, not to hear about someone's the political point of view wrapped up in a science fiction novel.The main character, Ged, is basically written out of the series. He appears here and there, not doing much. A bit blundering around as a wise unemployed sage. Of course he shouldn't, for he is ... <horror> ... a man.The first three books are a must have. The next books in the series, and certainly Tehanu, are a definite must -> NOT <- have."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you don't like books with a plot, this one's for you.","review":"After reading Tehanu, I decided to check the reviews here. After seeing a number of 5* rankings, I wondered what I had missed. So I reread it. I came to the conclusion that I didn't miss a thing. You can skip to the last 12 pages of the book and not only not miss any action, but also understand the overall point. After droning about the nature of female power for what seems like an eternity, she puts us out of our misery with an anticlimactic non-event.Terry Goodkind has the same intrinsic problem in that he writes diatribes about the evils of communism. However, formulaic as his books are, they at least have plots. I find it tragic that she abused a beautifully developed (and best-selling) fantasy trilogy to write a treatise on feminism.The first three books of the series were very enjoyable. I would recommend them to anyone who likes fantasy. I would recommend this one to anyone who needs a bird cage liner."},{"rating":"2","title":"How do decent people behave in the face of injustice?","review":"The Earthsea Trilogy was important to me in my teens, but Ihaven't felt inclined to return to it; it doesn't seem to have asmuch to say to a thirty-odd-year-old. Tehanu seems to mebe a much more difficult -- and mature -- book. It faces some central questionsof life:What should we do where there is injustice andsuspicion? How does a decent person behave when childrenare abused and old men without power disrespected? When disfigurement makes achild disposable?Many of LeGuin's books consider the proper actions of peoplecaught in complex political and personal situations:Malafrena, the Earthsea books, most especially Four Ways toForgiveness. Tehanu is the most personal of these books.I'm not sure, but I suspect it will be most accessible to womenwho are past their early twenties."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can you say Tehanu was a good book?","review":"This book was the worst book I have ever read. The first three books Ursula Le Guin wrote had at least a worth while plot; though I was disappointed in the quality of their writing. But this book was the worst! It goes on and on about nothing and just has some parts that you read and think to yourself Why am I reading this? I had read alot of reviews about this series before I read them; I guess I expected them to be more. If you are looking for a book to compare to Tolkien's and Lewis's this series is definately not worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was Tehanu written by a ghost writer?","review":"I loved the Earthsea trilogy (it will always be a trilogy to me) from the first time I read it, in high school. Years later, they are even better. Tehanu is not cut from the same cloth. I was sorely disappointed with the plot line, character development, general tone and themes of the book. While the first three books contained wonderful, compelling and unforgettable tales, this one seemed like a cross between a romance novel and some sort of psycho-mystery. It gave me the same feeling in the pit of my stomach as watching The Phantom Menace and listening to them explain the Force in terms of science. I can only hope that Ursula LeGuin herself actually writes any future books, because I can't believe the same author wrote this as the first three."},{"rating":"1","title":"So it not with a bang...","review":"... but with a whimper. The Earthsea trilogy was one of the revelations of my pre-teen years, and I suppose this is one of those lessons of adult life. (You can't go back)."},{"rating":"1","title":"dragging.. dragging","review":"I hoped that this book, which won the nebula, would be a great wrap-up to the series. There is definitely a sense of closure at the end of the book, and loose ends are tied up... but the book was flat out too boring for me. As another reviewer said, don't look for a plot. Don't look for any major developments either, until the last, what, 10 pages?? I was dissapointed as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sad change - the trilogy should have stayed a trilogy","review":"I think this book is the worst of the Earthsea books. Although part of the Earthsea series (trilogy), it has a very different flavor than the other books about Earthsea. I found it to be extremely politically oriented - basically, it had a feminist undertone that ruined the whole point of reading a FICTION book. Who wants to read a tale about a different planet, only to find an opinionated piece on a problem of ours? I certainly don't, and everyone I know that reads fantasy feels the same way. This is a great disappointment for me as well as many other readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eviscerating your own classic work","review":"Dull, dull, dull. One of the two most disappointing books I've ever read. I read the first three books many years ago and have re-read them many times since then. All three are quite brief, but only because there is not a single unnecessary word in any of them. Unfortunately, Ursula LeGuin has decided to sacrifice every other virtue of her writing in favor of a polemical rant. Is it supposed to be \\"empowering\\" for women to be a book where nothing of importance happens? And the villain, who scarcely rates mention, seems motivated by little else than a mean streak of misogyny. If you enjoyed the earlier volumes as much as I did, save yourself the disappointment of reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Earthsea is always great","review":"This book continues right from the end of The Furthest Shore. The story is slower then the other three, yet it is also much deeper. The primary themes again are being: who are we? Especially who are we after loss? For Tenar/Ghoa it is the loss of husband; for Ged the loss of power, ceasing to be a mage. Also it is man's struggle to conquer death.We also learn in this book that in earthsea, man and dragons were once one race. Men are the children of dragons that horded and built fortresses and forgot how to fly. Therru is an adopted child of Tenar and we find out that she is really the daughter of Kalessin the oldest of dragons. Yet we also find out that Kalessin is really Segoy the creator of earthsea.Segoy leaves his daughter with Ged and Tenar saying he will one day be given a child by them.Key Notes on Names:Tenar / Gohn - ArhaGed / Sparrowhawk - Hawk - DunyTherru / TehanuKalessin / Segoy - OldestOrigon / Aihak"},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book - wise, sad, caring and mature","review":"I came across \\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" by chance about 10 years ago - I was completely entranced by it and couldn't rest till I got the other books in the trilogy as well as anythong else by Le Guin.The Earthsea Trilogy was fascinating - but Tehanu transcends the others. It's wonderfully mature and full of a wiser enchantment.It's all about courage and compassion and carrying on - I think this is the best book that I've ever in this genre. After reading this I even felt that Tolkien's works were rather silly by comparision,"},{"rating":"1","title":"very fine Swords and Sorcery","review":"A superior and literate fantasy, well constructed; forming an adult completion to the equallysuperior but rather lighter Earthsea trilogy. Like all good work, not easy to classify by genre.Retired ex-wizard faces evil and vengeful opponents; but the real subject(s) are childabuse, aging, and coming to terms with loss. Very fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"LeGuin attempts to destroy her own creation","review":"What a surprise Tehanu turned out to be! I got the impression when I read this book that LeGuin, much later in her life, regretted making the heroic male character Ged in her Earthsea Trilogy, and so she added this novel to destroy Ged. Through out this novel, we are treated to endless, tiresome scenes of an impotent and useless Ged. It seems that LeGuin wants to shove into our face: \\"See! See! Ged is a whiny, useless man! He is nothing like the noble, likable character you thought you knew. Oh no. Ged is an evil man, and all men are bad, bad, bad!\\" It really is unrelenting in its portrayal, there is nothing enjoyable or lighthearted or redeeming in the entire book. After reading this book, my impression is that I would never want to meet Ursula LeGuin, because she sure seems like a bitter person."},{"rating":"2","title":"A story not like the rest...","review":"I've loved all the Earthsea books, but Tehanu stepped outside of the environment of destiny-changing magic, battles, and journeys. It was pleasing to have the entire story contained on Gont, and just a few cherished characters introduced or reintroduced.It's beautiful in a more quiet and still way than the three predecessing books are, and focuses inward to the family and the few people involved, instead of to a whole world. All \\"themes\\" aside, LeGuin lovingly reveals what life AFTER the adventure is like... reality, as it were, to Tenar, Ged, and even Arren. Where the battles fought are with those closest to you, instead of with the nameless evil... those hardest battles of all.I cherish Tehanu for all the ways it is unlike the three previous books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ged, Retired","review":"I'm not sure why this book was written. LeGuin must have had something in mind to extend her Earthsea epic to a tetralogy.There's some nineties, EarthChild brand feminism. LeGuin complains of \\"lazy boys\\".Gone are the desperate battles and legendary characters of the first three books. Maybe that's what Ged thinks about while he lays on the radiator like a neutered Tom, silently nodding at idiotic new characters. I'll be honest, I didn't finish the book. In my mind, I gave him a Viking funeral."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"Ignore all those people who have said this book is a mature philosophical work about women. I do not deny that Miss Le Guin is an astounding writer but the truth of the matter is the Earthsea Trilogy does not need this tacked on, pointless little book. The characters from the previous books are not shown as broken down and dispirited as they are not remotely the characters from the previous books. What Le Guin has written is a turgid, kitchen sink drama about a couple that live on a farm with some child abuse and sex thrown in. There is none of the magic of the first three books and this book is simply not worth reading. Avoid at all costs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad , Bad , Bad Book ...","review":"Look , the trilogy itself was great , mainly because it was very easy to read , and because the stories were fun , interesting and magical. However , Ursula chose to ruin all the fun I had by writing this last novell. It is NOT a fantasy book for the child in every one of us !!! It's NOT an easy read , it's NOT magical , and it certainly gives you the blues. I got into big depression after reading this book mainly because I was expecting one more brilliant performance of Sparrowhawk , who we all learned to love , I wanted one last performance. But instead I got a novell with a crippeled SparrowHawk that deals with child abuse , rape , aging and getting in terms with your past. This novell ruined the whole trilogy for me. If you enjoyed the trilogy , do yourself a favour and don't ruin it for yourself by reading Tehanu."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is LeGuin tired of writing?","review":"I can accept the plot inconsistancies with the previous books in the \\"trilogy.\\" I can accept her vague style of writing. I like her ideas and think they have potential. But I would have thought that, with the passage of time, her writing would improve. Unfortunately, not only does it not improve, it actually seems to have deteriorated. She spends the first 90% or more of the book developing the background, then rushes through the plot development and the climax (if it can be called such) in just a few pages, as if she were sick of the story and of writing in general and just wanted to get it done with. What a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"pointless piece of garbage","review":"The Earthsea trilogy is quite good classic fantasy.

I wouldn't recommend it but I did get through the whole thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"good, great, not bad....","review":"It was very detailed and let us know every aspect of every person in the story.

It was a good book, not my favorite, but definently something I would tell people about."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly Written & Boring","review":"The only reason I finished this book was to discover who the killer was, but I skipped through most of it. The plot moves too slowly; after the first killing, the second one takes too long to occur. The characters are not all that likable and not very interesting so you really don't care if they are killed or not. The crime scenes are not very descriptive and it is evident that the author knows nothing about being a detective. As others have mentioned, the writing style is something that a middle school student could have written. The ending is boring, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better","review":"The synopsis of the book made it sound fairly descent, but I was wrong. The first murder took up 50% of the book leaving me to wonder when were these other \\"murders\\" going to happen. The main character Jamie seemed flat and boring. She was engaged to her boss and yet seemed to not really care for him or even show him any respect. (If you read the book you'll know what I mean). The last \\"murders\\" did not happen until the last 35 pgs of the book. By then I sorta figured who the murderer was and not really surprised. I do not reccommend spending more than what I spent on this book (1.50) because that's all it's worth. If you want a good murder mystery read a James Patterson book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This is a pretty standard mystery without much to surprise a reader of these things. The protagonist is a tough lady detective. The murders are imaginative. The flashbacks are standard fare.Really without the soap opera tie-in, there's nothing to distinguish this book from a thousand other mysteries coming out the same year. Buy only if you love these cliches (and some do) but even then be prepared for boredom."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't care for it","review":"I am a long time fan of One LIfe to Live and that's the main reason I bought The Killing Club.

Be prepared for lots of cheesy anime cliches, pointless dialouge, and to be confused by mostly everything. I won't say that it was a total waste of time to watch it, the art was decent, the voice acting was okay, and the characters had the potential to be really cool... but they weren't. If there was more development of the characters, and more explanation of what was going on and why, this could have been better. I would suggest renting this if possible and not spending the money on it when you could get something else for your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yay!!","review":"I can't believe someone actually had this DVD, it is absolutely wonderful!

The...uh, for lack of a better term, hero, Shibas Scotch is faintly reminiscent of Dark Schneider from the Bastard!! anime series, but lacks most of Dark Schneider's redeeming qualities. I gave it two stars because the characters are interesting if not particularly likeable and the animation is superb, but the plot is mostly T&A and excuses for T&A...the only unalloyed praise I can give it is that watching it caused me to go out and buy The Sorcerer Hunters (which is ten thousand times better) just to find out what the heck was going on.

This is simply a companion book for the deck itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't expect more than Pretty","review":"Beautiful artwork, but the cards are very cold and sterile. I'm a sci-fi fan who appreciates the creation of alien worlds and inventive traditions, but for tarot cards to have depth, they require archtypes and symbolism that the reader can relate to their own life rather than newly created worlds the reader is not familiar with.

Many years & many moves later, it went missing so I was glad to find it here & ordered this deck + book combo. Sadly, it seems these are not really available. I ordered & on the date they were to arrive, I was refunded with no email or explanation of why. I figured it out this morning (a week later) while looking for who to contact about a missing shipment. The tracking number never even made it into the USPS system, so I guess it never even left the warehouse.The deck itself I always felt was well drawn and colorful (but not blindingly so).

I was about to give up when I read Don's advice. Thanks Don! Nevertheless I agree with all the negative reviews of this device.

I expect a soundtrack CD to replicate the mood of the film, but this CD ends with the up-tempo, Euro-pop songs from \\"Before Sunrise,\\" letting the listening experience end on a harsh note. To solve the problem I re-ordered the songs on my ipod, and added in the Ivy song from the trailer as well as a Nina Simone song. Problem solved! So yes, this is a good CD but not a great one.

This book was written by Marty Bergen who is a prolific bridge writer. This book has nothing to do with bridge. It appears that he uses the male gender on the Schlemiel pages and the female gender on the Mensch pages. I guess he was trying to be politically correct but as a man I didn't find this offensive.

In this transfer we see less of the \\"black bars\\" at the top and bottom of the screen as the 16:9 image has been cropped to fill up more of the 4:3 space. So, while we see an almost full 4:3 picture, in reality we have actually lost peripheral screen detail in the process.

The book is very straight forward and the examples are such that they guide you through quite easily so that the reader can follow along without much trouble. Chapters 7 and 8 are really nice with their XML information and examples. XML is great if you need a pages that load fast and are efficient.The descriptions that come in these chapters increase your understanding of why it is such an important part of the overall structure. MSDE I personally find can be a bit of a pain when setting it up but with this particular book things seemed to go ok.

It was not the same as the one that I already own. This product (and I believe they may have sent me the wrong item as the one I received had green handles) is designed for a larger pecan or walnuts, and will not work on the medium sized pecans from our tree. The product is appears to have been crafted from inferior materials as the blades have already bent with very little use. If we had been able to use them with our pecans, they would most likely be completely broken by now.

I had to refit the blades because metal was left in the blade seats from the machining that did not allow the blades to seat properly. The shoulder screw was not seated for the plier hinge and the blades were so roughly sharpened that there were huge burs hanging on the back and they were completely dull. I happened to have the skills to make the repairs and turn it into a great tool but for someone without those skills this product would have been useless out of the box!

My dad did it this way as well as my grandfather and I carried on the family tradition.Well, I got old and arthritic and my hands hurt using the pliers, so I bought one of those \\"inertia nut crackers\\" but after using it a few days, I hated it because the rubber bands either broke or slipped off and the shell bits went everywhere.This new nut sheller works better than anything I've ever used. It doesn't hurt my old hands, shell bits don't go flying and the \\"teeth\\" help hold the pecan in place. The meat of the pecan is easier to find and it is a breeze extracting the nut from the cracked shell. The teeth along the cutting blade do a very good job of penetrating long pecans and short ones too and it is easy on most attempts to get two each full pecan halves rather than bits and tiny pieces like the old grabbing a pair of pliers from the tool kit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"Just had to tighten the screw on the side of it and then take a file to the teeth so that it would grip the nut rather then slide off the side of it.

The book is very short (although in this case it is a blessing) and offers no real insight into the war in Iraq. I found the book to be poorly written and it fails to capture the essence of these wonderful troops going to war. The author spends a lot of time complaining about the conditions he is suffering through and not enough time capturing what the soldiers experience. The 82nd Airborne is an elite army unit but he reduces them into cartoon characters instead of letting us relate to them as people. His continual attacks on the left were also a distraction, save that for another book. This book was obviously rushed to be printed instead of focusing on the quality of the story. Bottom line there are much better books out about the war in Iraq. Save your money and get Devil Dogs, or the March Up. Get anything, just not this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated It!!","review":"When I first picked up this book I was beyond excited to read it. However, from almost the first page I was disappointed. Mr. Zinsmeister did an aweful job writing this book. Instead of focusing almost exclusively on the soldiers he decided to spend most of the book either discussing himself or his political views. I might have been willing to overlook his obvious conservative bias if he had bothered to accurately portray the otherside when he decided to debate how his view was correct. This whole book wasn't worth the paper it was written on."},{"rating":"1","title":"God, Country & Apple Pie","review":"I am very reluctant to write this review for two reasons: I have not served in this theater of operations, and I have very little to contribute that has not already been written by the other reviewers.

Granted, he placed himself in harm's way, however, the book royalties will serve no doubt as some compensation. What really sticks in my craw is being told what an honor it is to die for your country, especially by a civilian on a thirty-day journalistic tour.

The author has some interesting views on war generally and on the character of the US soldiers in particular, but he fails to give a pwerful image of this very importand campaign. It is true that action begins after thw first 70 pages and that the author talks a lot about himself and his personal experiences and inconviniences but these are not the main failures. The really disappointing feature is the absence of these small but interesting and little known details that thrill the readers who have not been witnesses themselves to the horrors and the adrenaline of a real battle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Last of it's kind","review":"This is probably the last WIP movie ever to be released in the unrepentant WIP genre. Yes, it's offensive. Yes, there are rape scenes. That's what a WIP(women in prison) movie is about. The offensiveness is justified because the girls come out as victors in the end. This movie is unique because of Lori Jo Hendrix's casting. Most WIP movies this graphic were filled with unattractive European women and were made in the 70s.

Baron Chase has a snarly fretless tone and snappy funk chops, but he doesn't let his bass dominate the arrangements. Seven of the ten tracks are very strong, with memorable melodies and interesting arrangements. The other tracks are weaker: a couple of acoustic-y tunes that sound like intros searching for melodies, and a remarkably uninteresting remix of the title track.

Further, I'm afraid I also found the prose at times overbearing: statements to the effect that 'People with PhD degrees are of a higher mental calibre than those without', and similars, are really out of place.

Taleb doesn't always go through every step of his calculations, so they're difficult to follow.Does anyone else notice these errors or am I getting caught in the algebra? An example is on page 38 towards the top:He says that 12,500,000/.985 is 1,269,000. Even with the rounding (shaving off the 355), I'd say he's off by a factor of 10. Shouldn't the answer by 12,690,000? To confirm this, in the next paragraph he writes that a 1 cent rise in the futures price will yield $125,000 in profits on the future (12,500,000*.01) or $126,900 on the forward hedge. Intuitively, it seems that to get $126,900, you could divide $125,000 by .985 or multiply 12,690,000 (the answer you should've previously arrived at) by .01.There are other errors like this throughout the book - anyone else notice them?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of Henry Ibsen's \\"A Doll's House\\" Starring Claire Bloom","review":"I was not even able to view this item, let alone review it, as the DVD kept showing \\"Invalid Region\\" and would not play on my UK system.

It first tells you to install the hardware and connect up the cables. Then it tells you to install the software. Problem. If the machine can't see my HD because I just installed the hardware but there is no software supporting it, it's not possible to install the software.

As boy sopranos go, rather husky but still very pure and expressive. This final recording is not in my opinion Anthony at his best. His vocals on here have passed the peak of perfection stage, and it is clear through most of the album that his voice is changing rapidly. Having said that though, it is still a very enjoyable 'escapism' ethereal offering from this former top boy soprano. 'Blow The Wind Southerly' quite a soothing and unusual sound, with Anthony's low keys and an adult female soprano duetting with him on this my favourite track.A final musical farwell from a much missed unique former choirboy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious!","review":"This episode was one of the best.

Ben Counter's addition to the final installment is wonderfully written and is a very exciting and quick read.CPT Loken and faithful remain on track with their sworn allegiance to the Emperor to the very end. Which brings me to the only gripe about this book, the final chapter! I am not going to give away any secrets but after everything that had happened from the first book till now it was so obvious what was going to occur yet our heroes still succumb to the error of believing in their Warmaster who had completely gone through a metamorphosis in the weeks prior to the attack!Still as stated it was a wonderful read and seemed to have gone quicker than the 2nd book. I am patiently awaiting the continuation of the series with the Flight of Eisenstein and Fulgrim."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS CRAZY!!!!!!!","review":"I am an avid reader of fantasy and science fiction and I can tell you there is no sci-fi like the Horus Heresy.

The action in the book could have been a little more compared to other books in this series. If you are new to the 40k world there are two other book you need to read before this one is going to make sense, this book is number three in the Horus Hersey series, which I think it is up to 23 book now!Now the bad.It isn't available for the Kindle!

I prefer CAT5 Cables over Wireless because physical wiring has a higher Data Rate and is nearly impossible to hack. Up until now I've settled for tossing some rugs over them, but there were still areas the wires were exposed.This Fellowes Cord Cover solved my problem ! The raceway underneath has plenty of room for all my cables, and it is so heavy that it lies flat without taping it down.Note that Network Cables do not present a Fire Hazard as they do not provide any power worth speaking of, and do not heat up. But the Fellowes Cord Cover is actually rated for Power Cords, which explains it's extra weight and durability.Well worth it !"},{"rating":"2","title":"A real page-turner...","review":"I'm only 3/4 of the way through, and this book really has me going! Not only is the story line well-structured, but he introduces the tension (the phony meetings) early enough that you have to keep reading to see what happens next. I read over 100 books a year, and this is the first one in two years that caused me to check the last couple of chapters to see if the two characters were still alive! Another feature that helps the reader keep moving is that the \\"sinister force\\" isn't fully explained up front, and only small snippets are released as you read. Even at this point in the book, I still don't know exactly what this company does. As a result, I can't wait to get home from work so I can finish this"},{"rating":"1","title":"To read this book or watch paint dry is a difficult decision","review":"Ever wonder how some books manage slip pass the editors and actually get published? Graham Watkins' \\"Interception,\\" falls into that catagory.Granted, writing about computers and the online world is not easy. A lot of complicated stuff has to be explained. But when you add over writing and bad writing to the mix, we can only hope that the story will get better. And it does for forty pages but on page 295, everything falls apart. Even an Internet newbie will not believe that our hero can be so stupid. Rather then wake his son at two in the morning in order to ask a few questions, the father decides to let him sleep even though murder and mayhem are taking place a few miles away. Mr. Watkins trys to explain this silly decision away, but not even more of his bad, over writing can make it work.Knowing what I now know about \\"Interception,\\" if given the choice of reading this book or watching paint dry, it would be a difficult very decision."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"A friend loaned me this book.

But there has always been a thought in the back of my mind as to what I'm missing, so I purchased this book (along with several others), and I'm very happy that I did. It's a good reference guide and I've learned some things that I wasn't aware of and gained some better insight into the software. The only drawback is that being a book about a graphical software package there could be more screen shots to go along with the nice \`meaty' descriptions."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Math Teacher","review":"I've never really bought this, but I'm reviewing this because my math teacher used this book to teach us about a lot of what we were learning at that time. The problems in here make you think hard and it helps with learning about real-world problems, inequalities, problem solving skills, strategies, and more.

It is his greatest album and combined with another album, More of that Honey Horn Sound you hear true magic. This album, is also a very good combo of two of his better albums done when he was at his peak. A good mix of smooth jazz and toe tappers. A great follow up album if you are just now discovering some of the best music ever recorded. (Well after his Honey in the Horn album any way.) for those who want to hear the best trumpet player who ever lived, here he is. Al ruled the Playboy charts as the king of Jazz trumpet in the sixties. He is still the best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Enthralling","review":"For some people, Al Hirt stands pejoratively for a kind of trumpet playing that is less than artistic. It is important to realize that Hirt is a type of artist who was part of his time, and that time was the '60's, in its adult contemporary mode. If you're familiar with the brass and voices arrangements from this period by Ray Conniff, these two Al Hirt albums from 1964 will fit nicely into that mode. The arrangements are spare sounding and peppy, with lovely vocals by the Anita Kerr singers. The albums were produced by Chet Atkins, the master of the \\"countrypolitan\\" sound of that era. Hirt plays as only Hirt can, with zest, wonderful rhythm, and golden tone. The most touching moment, for me, is Hirt's vocal on Willie Nelson's \\"Night Life,\\" recorded quite a few years before Willie became a star. This is music to be enjoyed and savored."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Al's Best","review":"I bought both Al Hirt Cotton Candy/Sugar Lips and Honey in the Horn/That Honey Horn Sound.

While it may be demonstrating that the big hare loves the little one more, it never acknowleges the little hare for what he could do. For instance, \\"'I love you as high as I can hop' laughed Little Nutbrown Hare... 'But I love you as high as I can hop', smiled Big Nutbrown Hare -- and he hopped so high that his ears touched the branches above. That's good hopping, thought Little Nutbrown Hare.

I found the story demeaning and would never read it to my child."},{"rating":"1","title":"More interesting to the adult than the child","review":"\\"Guess How Much I Love You\\" is a nice simple story about a parent's desire to express his love for his child. We have had this book since the birth of my daughter and have read it to her on different occasions. However, it is not a book she pulls off her shelf to be read to her. Usually it is the adult visitor who oohs and ahhs over it and insists on reading it. The plot is just not interesting enough to hold my daughter's attention through the whole story nor to draw her back to it repeatedly. The book presents a lovely theme, unfortunately the story itself does not hold interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love is not about competition","review":"I am a mother of two small children (ages 3 and 1) and I do not like this book. Several people have given it to us as gifts and I have gotten rid of it. It is about a competition between a parent and a child about who loves whom more. Love is not about competition--this book is nothing more than a game of \\"one-upsmanship\\" between family members. In our family we love each other without trying to quantify it. This book has been extremely overrated in my opinion and I don't understand why. I don't think its lesson is one parents should be imparting to their children"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring illustrations, and unproductive storyline.","review":"The idea of the book is cute, but like others who have reviewed it here, I'm not a fan of the storyline: trying to \\"out-love\\" another person with no real point to the story.Also, this was given to us when my son was about 12-18mths old, but at that age, I prefer illustrations where a \\"face\\" is easily discernible, and ideally, colorful. These pencil drawings are so pale and small, an *adult* can barely make out the hares' faces/expressions. As of right now, this book bores him. And even when he can follow the storyline, I'm not sure I want him to!!So, this is a \\"filler\\" book on our shelf that rarely gets read. It's just not much good for kids who don't speak yet, nor is it any good for their self-esteem if they CAN understand the message, ya know?Update: my son is now 4 and it still doesn't hold his interest -- probably give it to the library next time we go..."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite book ever!","review":"This is a perfect baby shower gift!

I bought it myself for my daughter because I think it's a good idea to talk about how much parents love their children. But I'm uncomfortable that at every turn, the father hare has to outdo the child hare. That doesn't seem like love, that seems like competition. I'm glad so many people like this book, and that's fine, but it doesn't work for me. I like the style of the writing and the drawings.

It is such a cute story that I bought the baby book for my daughter. This is the first book I have ever bought for my child. I love reading it to her. We act out the parts and she laughs. I can hardly wait until she understands exactly what the book says. When I was little I used to play the who loves who more game with my mom and dad.

So, this was an especially wonderfully gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Illustrations Are Beautiful","review":"I have to agree with the other reviewers who pointed out that this book's weakness lies in its message to the child. No matter how hard the child tries to express his love for his father, it never measures up to his father's love for him. This completely invalidates the child's love. I really don't know how this book has gotten to be so popular . . . could it be marketing?

It all seemed very negative and competitive to me. I felt that the parent was trying to show the child that his expressions of love were inferior. This book has a lot of hype surrounding it. There is the expectation that a parent HAS to like this book, that it is somehow profound. After all I had heard, I expected to like this book. The undertone of the book was troubling, however."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big nutbrown hare demeans little nutbrown hare over & over","review":"I'm sure the author had the best intentions in writing this book, but he failed miserably. No matter what the little bunny says, the adult bunny one-ups him. Others have written about this already, but I cannot see how anyone finds this a positive book when the adult is so competitively focused on \\"proving\\" that he loves the little bunny more than the little one loves him. (What, pray, do you get by winning this argument anyway? A child who thinks, \\"You're right, I don't love you all that much.\\"?)Moreover, my 2 year old is bored stiff with the story. It's not the length - he enjoys longer stories such as \\"Harold and the Purple Crayon,\\" \\"No Roses for Harry,\\" and \\"Corduroy\\" - it's the content. This book should be avoided by any thinking parent."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not care for this book.","review":"This book did not keep my daughter's attention.

The pictures are dreadful and the story is unexceptional and lacking in interest. My daughter hates this book. The narrative is awkward and repetitious and the pictures are not visually interested. Anyone with average intelligence could make a better story up on the spot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Like the Message","review":"I know many people love this book. I don't know why. We received one as a gift, and after reading it to my daughter, I was disturbed by the story. I felt sorry for the bunny whose parent invalidated his expression of love on each page. As many other reviewers said, it was a competition the adult wouldn't let the child win. This book contains a mean-spirited, misguided, sad, and disturbing message."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wonderful Book!","review":"This is one of the sweetest books out there. My daughter and I love to read it together. My only compliant is that this book didn't interest my daughter until around her second birthday, I assume because of the lack of color. The illustrations from an adult perspective though are beautiful, as is the message."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guess How Much I Love You","review":"First of all, I resent Elisabeth Steadman's comment that \\"This book should be avoided by any thinking parent.\\" Those words are both insulting and dead wrong. Even if one blindly looks at the \\"competitive\\" aspect of the story, the adult bunny lets the little bunny \\"win\\" in the end, only \\"one-upping\\" him after the little bunny is fast asleep. (I can't believe this is even fodder for debate.) Really, this book isn't about competition at all. Rather, it's about the unequivocal love between parent and child. (Some readers are obviously, and sadly, missing the point entirely.) Personally, I find this to be one of the most heartwarming bedtime stories of all time. My two-year-old son loves it as well. For a special treat, get the CD of the same title, which includes a special reading of the story by its Irish author, Sam McBratney, as well as some beautiful lullaby music."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book Ever!!!","review":"We bought this book for our daughter when she was 9 months old. She has loved it ever since. I can say without any doubt, this is her favorite book (she currently has 173 books). She loves it so much that we bought 3 copies of the pop-up version. One for her to play with & read on her own (this one has been glued back together 6 times now), one in good condition that we read to her & a spare just in case something happens to one of the others. Since we live in Singapore, we don't own a car, so we often take taxis or use the subway system. Depending on the time of day, it can take up to 40 minutes to get home. When she has her book, she barely even notices. She is now 15 months old & although she can't read the book, she mimics the sound effects I make when reading it to her at the same places I do them. This was a more than wise investment. We read it together & I believe she is really starting to understand the concept of having parents who love her \\"up the moon & back!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"confusing for little ones","review":"Whilst the message in the book is very sweet, the way in which the book is written is difficult for a toddler to follow:The mum and baby are Big Nutbrown Hare and Little Nutbrown Hare, which said repeatedly gets confusing because they don't hear the big / little part. I guess you could change it for Mum and Baby say this that or the other, but that's not the point here.Of all the books we have my son never chooses this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Favorite","review":"Ever since we got this book (2 years ago) it has been one of my children's favorites, loveable pictures, easy language, and leaves them feeling loved by the people who mean the most in their lives right now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"This book brings tears to my eyes every time I read it - - and I've read it about 100 times so far.

The child tries and tries until he collapses, exhausted - and still the father won't accept the heartfelt message and chooses to outdo his tiny child and have the last word.That this book is popular and well received is disturbing to me.The illustrations are very nice - and I'm hoping that this is the attraction people feel, since the message borders on psychological abuse."},{"rating":"1","title":"How cute! The parent belittling the child's love!","review":"This is a story about belittling your child's love for you, and saying that your love for them is bigger and better. And if the child is tenacious enough to continue professing their love, wait 'til they're asleep and get the last word in. \\"Yahoo!

The trouble with this book, in my opinion, is that it makes love competitive -- I didn't really like the way the whole thing is kind of a battle of one-upsmanship. The fact that the book ends with the bigger rabbit insisting on getting the final word in kind of bothered me. I guess to some people, it's an endearing book, but it sure didn't work for me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Am I not good enough?\\"","review":"Although my children (ages 1 and 3) have loved this book very much and requested it as a nighttime book for months now, there is something I find a little disturbing about this story. I know that the \\"oneupmanship\\" theme is a big part of this book, but as I read it, I feel badly for the little bunny, who no matter what he struggles to come up with, can never seem to be good enough for his father. I realize that that was not the author's intention, but there is something to be said for letting the children \\"win\\" once in a while to build their self-confidence. I'll bet that Little Nutbrown Hare's love for his Daddy is every bit as strong as his Father's love for him, even if his arms aren't as long and he can't jump as high."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply horrible","review":"This book is terrible and I can't understand why so many parents think it is so great!!! If you really analyze what this book is saying, you'll see that it plainly says that no matter what your child says or feels or expresses, the parent is always better. The parent is always bigger and always outdoes the little nutbrown hare. I read this to my child and couldn't believe the message I was sending her. I will never read it again. In fact, giving it one star is generous. I will be tossing this book into the trash to take it out of circulation. Every child should be made to feel as though his or her feelings matter just as much as someone who is older and bigger."},{"rating":"1","title":"BAD!!!!","review":"Ok,Yeah.This book is sad and it deals with a rabbit whos mothe loves the father more?

A less secure little bunny would have retreated into a corner after the Big Hare's refusal to acknowledge how big his son's love is for him. Not big enough?Not a good example of how people should relate to others, much less fathers to sons.The author is also showing us how much better they are by being too sophisticated to use baby words like Daddy, bunny, or baby. It's too wordy for the age range."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did not entertain a 2 year old","review":"This book didn't really entertain the two year old I bought it for, and I can't really blame her. The illustrations are not particularly colorful or engrossing. The story is also kind of boring for a really young child and the message will probably be entirely lost on one. Frankly I think this book is more for the adults reading it to children they love than for the kids themselves, which isn't necessarily a bad thing, just something to be aware of."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book!","review":"This is an excellent book for young and old alike.

It has brought us closer together.The woman who gaves this to my son, a co-worker of mine, died last year and whenever I read this I think of her and how she used to read this to her grandchildren.

It makes a special present for any new parent --I've also thrown in the plush little hares that you can find that go with this story! ENJOY!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best little book ever","review":"My husband and I love this little book. It is a very touching story that is especially great for a father to read to his baby (especially a son). The illustrations are beautiful. The reason why I gave it only 4 stars is because, although we LOVE the illustrations, they are pretty small. I think larger drawings would be better and more interesting for babies and very small children. Otherwise, the story is interesting and heartwarming, and not at all a chore to read over and over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect baby shower gift","review":"Every child should have this book. I gave it to my kids when they were babies and read it to them every night. I now give it as a gift to all my friends' babies."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book!","review":"This is a great book about a parent's love for her child!

People who see this banter as \\"competition\\" are reading way too much into the story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book for Cuddling...","review":"I've read this book for a few years to my niece and have now started with my infant son.It reminds me of the phone game I played with many of my relatives as a young child...\\"I love you more. No I love you more. I love you an infinity plus one.\\"I loved the way comparing the quantity of love made me feel when I was far away from some of my loved ones.When I read this book to the little ones I love, I feel the same warmth inside and hope they will too.Highly recommended, especially if the \\"I love you more\\" game is a family tradition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this book!","review":"This is a sweet little story about a little nut brown hare and a big nut brown hare.

Later I was searching for a christmas gift for my son and came across it in the store. I remembered liking the book, so I bought it. When I got home I realized that we already owned the book! Now we have 2 copies!The story is very cute and children enjoy hearing it. Everyone has \\"I love you\\" battles (who loves who the most) and this book is basically a story about a father rabbit and a baby rabbit who are loving each other so much that they are trying to out do each other's love."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bond with your child!","review":"Children all over the world will LOVE to have this book read to them. It can be a real bonding experience between caregiver and child.

They don't have the attention span for this sort of thing, especially one without a rhyming or more predictable plot.My niece turned two before she was really interested in this book. The only way I could read it to her was right before she fell asleep. Now, though, she will even request it.I can understand why people think this book is too competitive. However, it always appears to me like it's a sort of a game - who can come up with the most elaborate description? instead of an actual competition. Certainly the little nutbrown hare doesn't get upset during the book (and one day he'll be taller than his father, jump higher, etc.) However, if you're concerned about that, I would strongly suggest you read the book first, before you buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful book","review":"This is a must have book and a great gift to for new parents. The illustrations are wonderful and the story does such a great job of illustrating a parent's love. This is a book that children enjoy and parents love reading again and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly sublime tale of familial love","review":"On its face, the story is entirely cute and accessible to children and, really, should be read by a parent to his\\\\her child. Ultimately, however, it is a subtextual tale of the ultimacy of parental love. Told as a silly and sweet contest of wills, the tale recounts the competing protestations of how much love the Big Nutbrown Hare has for Little Nutbrown Hare, and how much love Little Nutbrown Hare has for Big Nutbrown Hare. The poetry of the interaction exists in the loving way each tries to best the other in a gentle challenge. Its denouement is classic, exalting an ultimately pyrrhic victory as ultimately a classic sacrifice. This one is a favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story for a father to read to his child.","review":"Guess How Much I Love YouThis classic children's book is a bedtime conversation between Big Nutbrown Hare and Little Nutbrown Hare (both male) about which one loves the other one more. Big and Little Hare are shown enjoying being physical together, and the book also subtly addresses the differences in abilities between grown men and little boys. A great book if you have a little boy who is in a competitive phase or enjoys being rough-and-tumble. The Leap Pad version combines the book's positive message with educational activities as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Daddy/Daughter Reading Time","review":"I wasn't sure what to make of this little book when my wife first suggested that I read it to our baby daughter before putting her to bed. But now it's our favorite. I realize Big Nutbrown Hare and Little Nutbrown Hair are probably father and son, but I'm not too concerned with that. My daughter is still a toddler, and all she knows is that daddy is holding her in his arms and reading her a story. It's a cute story. It's a little silly. But it works. It works for both of us."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad message","review":"I disliked this book SO much, the parent in the book is practically competeing with his child. I especially hate how on the last page, the son says, \\"I love you to the moon,\\" and after he falls asleep, the dad says, \\"I love you to the moon and back.\\" People wonder where kids get one-up-manship from."},{"rating":"1","title":"NO, I love you more than you can ever love me, so there!","review":"Don't buy this book unless you enjoy belittling your child's feelings. The entire book is about the little hare telling the big hare how much he loves him, only to have the big hare trump what the little hare says with responses like, \\"But I love you more (e.g. longer, higher, wider, farther, etc.).\\" This book is going to the dumps."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't hold my daughter's interest","review":"Whenever I read this book to my daughter, she starts fidgeting on my lap and looking around for her other books. The illustrations are beautiful, but somewhat monochromatic (the hares are brown of course, but there's not much variety of background...). The other off-putting issue with this book is the one-up-man-ship of Big Nutbrown Hare. The book may purport to be about unconditional love, but Big Nutbrown Hare makes a point to show Little Nutbrown Hare that he's always going to have the last word and most clever reply. Based on these two factors, the book rates one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Hard to Read Aloud","review":"I found this book to be very hard to read aloud.

Runaway Bunny is a similiar book and much easier to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Kind of Competition Is Hurtful","review":"I use this book as an example of a bad parent figure. Big Nutbrown Hare competes with Little Nutbrown Hare as to who loves more. The parent figure disheartens the child figure by devaluing the little hare's feelings of love. At the end, after tearing up the smaller rabbit's self-esteem, he \\"gets the last word\\" after the smaller rabbit falls asleep, clearly unhappy. My kids feel horribly sad for the little rabbit at the end. I own the pop-up version of this book, but we rarely read it. I recommend \\"Mama, Do You Love Me?\\" or \\"The Runaway Bunny\\" over this book if you're looking for a good \\"loving parent\\" story. It could have been so much better -- real parents of young children appreciate the depth of love without resorting to competition. I do love the illustrations, though!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the message I want to send to my kid...","review":"My husband and I have agreed to remove this book from our daughters \\"library\\". It is a story about a child that is trying to tell its parent that they love them. But every time the child tries to come up with a way to show them, the parent just keeps one-upping the child, instead of showing appreciation for what the kid is trying to say. The worst part is the ending, after the kid was shot down all day long, and he says to the parent \\"I love you all the way to the moon\\", and just as the parent is tucking in the kid, and the kid is almost asleep, the parent whispers \\"I love you all the way to the moon and back\\" ...as if to insure that they got the last word in. I really don't like this book..."},{"rating":"1","title":"The father hare isn't a good example of unconditional love","review":"I am disappointed to see this book so frequently being compared to other loving \\"classics.\\" It bothers me that, instead of accepting the little hare's love, the father hare feels compelled to always top what the little hare has just said.

The dark sides of humans, which make a man gets up in the morning to start killing his neighbor, which make a man to be hypocritical and indifferent to the massacre and torture... I hope you, Peter Maass can get some comforts by knowing that many who read the book were deeply moved with your strength, courage, and honesty.

Maas fails to mention that ethnic cleansing, torture of prisoners, massacres of civilians and political manipulation was also perpetrated by the Croatian and Muslim, factions in this brutal civil war. In place of any real analysis of the causes, events and results of the war Maas gives the reader emotionally gripping anecdotes. Rather than describing the complicated reality of the war he prefers to present it as a clear cut case of 'good guys' vs 'bad guys'. In many ways, this book is very typical of US media accounts of the Bosnian civil war in that it is very obviously written from a Muslim point of view. -Oskar-"},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative:","review":"What I like about Peter Maas' book is the reasoning and narratives the author often takes one on, about the affairs in the Balkans.

I wish that the whole book was actually about him and not Ulric, Oona, and Elric."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This book is just awful. The longwinded explanations of the nature of reality bog the story down. The plot didn't make any sense, and only some of it actually features Elric. The rest of the characters are boring. They weren't boring in A Dreamthief's Daughter but they're boring here. Oona and Ulric had some life then. This, and the stupid metaphysics, make for an incredibly dull book. The earlier Elric books were great fun and I was looking forward to more, but I was let down. Good thing I checked this out of the library!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment","review":"I've read other Michael Moorcock novel, and thought I would like this one, but I found The Skrayling Tree impossible to get into. I like a little complexity in my novels, but this one became convoluted and so hard to understand that I just gave up after a while. There was so much theoretical discussion about multiverses and balance and chaos, but not much emphasis on plot, and as a result this story suffered immensely. I didn't find any of the characters interesting. The one part that piqued my interest is when the characters went into Niffleheim, since I am a big fan of Norse mythology, but my interest quickly faded. Mostly I just wanted the book to end and I surprised myself by trudging through the finish line. Not an enjoyable read.Carl Alves - author of Two For Eternity"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sounding Good","review":"In addition to his biggest hits (Dreamin', Your Sixteen, etc.) this CD has numerous tunes I had not heard Johnny B. sing before.

On this album, only Sweet Suzie gives a hint of the real Johnny. Forget the rest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boooor-iiinng!","review":"This album lacks creativity, originality and inspiration. The rhyming style on the first song \\"Alibi\\" sounds suspiciously like Kanye's \\"Spaceship\\", doesn't it? (Biting is a hip hop no-no, shame on you). Whoever produced \\"You don't want it\\" should be fired, because that damn casio-sounding flute or string or whatever it's supposed to be is just wack. The production and lyrics throughout the whole compilation are way below average. I guess the Conduit crew thought they could throw some big hip-hop names on there and have a hot album. Well they were wrong.

While I was in Atlanta I bought a few of their mixtapes out on the street. I got hooked! When I got back home I tracked down their latest CD on Amazon and ordered it. Right now its the only CD that I bump. Its wild to me that this CD is better than most of the major releases of this year. The album as a whole provides some tracks that you can just bump in your ride, some club tracks, and some stuff you can just sit back and really think about. Just the fact that as an independent label, rappers like Juvenile, Devin the Dude, David Banner, Bun B and others appeared on their album, shows they are handling business! I definitely recommend this CD to anyone who likes quality Hip Hop."},{"rating":"2","title":"not what I ordered but so much better","review":"Amazon has this CD listed as Inspirational Favorites, Vol. 1, but the photo of the item shows a baby and says SWEET DREAMS.

I had 2, 20 pound weights on it and the support struts started to bend. The problem is the two struts that come down to connect to the curved connector to the rear drop-out. The two struts are connected at slight different points and presumably the curved connector is supposed to flex to provide \\"suspension\\". Unfortunately, just riding the bike for 5 minutes with 40 pounds on the rack cause the ends of the two struts to bend so the rack is now useless. This is a very poor design unless you plan on carrying less than perhaps 20 pounds on the rear rack. The designers need to have a much better understanding of suspension mechanics!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ignore the positive reviews","review":"Don't buy this junk it's horrible: the eyelets for connecting to the bike are positioned incorrectly so that they won't fit on your bike right and will damage the paint.

So I purchased an inexpensive copy and watched it again.I've often thought about how funny it would be to have a 24hr camera recording your life. Many moments, usually related to funny kid moments, would be great to capture and revisit. On the flip side, everyone has moments that don't want to live again but all of these shape who we are.I'm not a great movie reviewer but I will say that I love the creativity of this interpretation of life-after-death. It is humorous with a lot of satire at how we live our daily lives.Albert Brooks and Meryl Streep do a wonderful job of acting and the supporting actors are all great too.The love story theme is okay (with a kind of corny ending) but the concept of reviewing your major life choices after death is interesting and it is really all about the interpretation of them and the lead-up to them.A fun movie that doesn't have to be taken seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worked perfectly","review":"Played without a hitch.

I saw it in its first run; it seemed like another B comedy movie with an overworked plot and little character development beyond the usual hackneyed yucks and cheesy Hollywood sentiment. The theology behind it was certainly non-parochial -- it was incomprehensible and chaotic. Putting together a rich, believable and detailed theology that makes sense is not a job for the faint hearted, and certainly not a job for Hollywood screenwriters.The Wizard of Oz? Sure.It's a Wonderful Life? Absolutely!Kill Bill, Parts I and II? Well, ok, but send the kids to bed first.But this movie was just a good excuse to get out of the summer heat for a few hours. Nothing more.I don't understand all the glowing reviews, but as the French say: Chacun à son got (diff'rent strokes for diff'rent folks)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Or should the title have been FEAR STRIKES OUT?","review":"With a film titled DEFENDING YOUR LIFE, wouldn't you think it will be about someone who has to defend his wrong actions on Judgement Day? Instead, it throws a curve. Without giving away the story, DEFENDING YOUR LIFE is not about a lowlife (dishonest car salesman or philandering husband) who has to sweat out his deeds in the afterlife. I think that would have been funnier than what the film turned out to be. At least DEFENDING YOUR LIFE wasn't predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unevolved.","review":"I expected more from this movie. Though the plot topic was intriguing; having one's life reviewed by beings of higher intelligence who decide if you can move on, it \\"devolved\\" into cheap cliches (heaven is a place in which one can gorge themself and not gain any weight... ugh, how pedestrian) and judgements based on whether one stands up for themself, nevermind being good/kind/generous, etc. Also, I thought the film was from a keenly male perspective. This somewhat oafish Al Brooks really does not seem all that charming, and I could hardly believe that Meryl Streep's character, the \\"good hearted\\" Julia, would be so entraced with his \\"humor\\" that she would find him irresistable and decide not to move on. All in all good concept and some humorous parts, but the rest was just...too unevolved to be enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brooks' worst","review":"This is Albert Brooks' worst film, and that's saying a lot! The story line is superficial and absurd, Meryl Streep is limited to giggles and long kissing, and--worst of all--the movie is not funny. I laughed once and smiled once; that's it. The flashbacks are especially dull. One might have hoped for much more in such a looooong movie.As for Brooks' vision of the hereafter, one need only groan at the superficiality. Still, Brooks gets credit for having such a lightweight idea and dull script put on film.

An unusual choice, but an insightful one. Brooks' humor is not for everyone, but intelligent and sophisticated comedy never is. For those who like their comedy a little smarter and wittier than the norm, Brooks is a gem.A good introduction to his work is this 1991 film starring Brooks and Meryl Streep. It takes a warm and hilarious look at the after-life, seen through Brooks' own eyes. This film is far more thoughtful and original than your standard Hollywood fare--a very welcome change.Streep is very funny and charming in this film, with none of the pretentiousness that clouds some of her films. Rip Torn (\\"The Larry Sanders Show\\" on HBO) gives a supporting performance as good as you're likely to see.Take a chance on a comedy that actually aims above the belt.

I have watched this again and again to make up for all the people who didn't see it in the theaters. I have given it as a gift many, many times to people who have never heard of it.

The entire shoe support mechanism eventually just fell apart, rendering the saw unusable. Something a little more substantial is needed.

While it defines terms well it also leaves out explanations for most practical applications that are tested for in the problems. There is no way to check your actual work, since even the homework manager only provides solutions and not a detailed methodology as to how the answers were arrived at. It is amazing that this has survived to 7 editions without someone organizing the chapters and the material in some more organized fashion. Unrelated concepts are thrown in at the end of chapters with little explanation. If you want to learn accounting terminology this book is okay.

The only thing this did for him was lock his mind into something that really didn't work as well as other options which I offered later. I hate to see people thinking that a program like this is like a designer standing next to them, which is how they promote it. If you're going to invest all that money in your house, why would you let an amateur design it?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for Diff kids!","review":"I use this book for my 6th grade Diff Language Arts class.

There are a number of glaring errors and omissions of original text. If it is at all possible to read the work in the original, one must. My rating is of the translation, not the original."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too confusing","review":"This book aimed to be revolutionary, but is too confusing and becomes less and less interesting throughout the pages. If you want to read something enjoyable... choose another book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Indispensable","review":"These books provide often needed support in my job as a database developer. They are a must have for any developer who wants to expand their knowledge and be able to create a much more robust application. I would highly recommend this for anyone wanting to learn more about Access. Of all of the books I have, these easily outdo them all in readability and ease of understanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"An example of the very best in technical writing","review":"I have had many editions of this book, and these guys are true craftsmen. Every edition is better than the prior edition. They are thorough and very thoughtful about real-world needs. These books are an example of the very best in technical writing. As an Access Developer for the last seven years, I am very appreciative to them to have these wonderful resources available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Access 2000 Bible","review":"I have to say that I have found this book extremely useful. I am developing a prototype and it has been an invaluable aid. Most of the problems I have are with Access rather than Getz et al. I read a previous reviewer's comment that the index was poor but I have found it easy to find the things I need. If you're seriously into developing Access 2k apps and have only dabbled before this is the book for you!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best...","review":"I've been programming in Access for over six years and have never come across a more comprehensive and easy-to-follow set of books than these Developer's Handbooks (both Desktop and Enterprise). I started with the 2000 version and will always purchase the next versions as they become available.As an old Access 95 Microsoft Certified Professional (MCP) I thought I knew the majority of the ins-and-outs of Access programming. Paul Litwin, Ken Getz, Mike Gunderloy - I give you my thanks for teaching this old dog new tricks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of useful information...","review":"These books are great resources for the Advanced Access Developer. Let me stress the word \\"Advanced\\". You should have a good understanding of Access and VBA before using these books or you may find yourself lost in a sea of overwelming information. The only real grip I have about the set is their size. I would have been willing to pay extra if the set were broken down into 4 easy to manage books instead of 2 monster 1000+ page books. At any rate if you're already comfortable with Access 2000, these books are a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very valuable book","review":"This is a great book to read for anyone who has ever struggled with setting or keeping boundaries.

I've found it very helpful. So much so, that I find myself re-reading and going back on chapters. This book has taken me the longest to read and have yet to finish it just becuase I keep going back and finding out new stuff. I do refer to the biblical references and find that helpful as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boundaries","review":"Boundaries is an excellent book that everyone should be reading when they are teenagers.

A must for everyone who wants healthy relationships!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book on this subject available","review":"This is the best book on boundaries available, period.

I thought I absorbed it at the time, but now a year later, I find even more concepts from the book sinking in. The concepts in this book have saved my life. They are also now helping me raise my child and enrich my marriage, as I am currently reading the other books in the series, \\"Boundaries in Marriage\\" and \\"Boundaries With Kids\\". I recommend this series to all human beings, regardless of religious belief. The tools found in these books can truly help you achieve a peaceful, fulfilled life!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Take Ownership of Your Life","review":"Wow! What an incredible book. The lessons and advice within each chapter are life changing, if you put them into practice.

Well worth the money spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"helpful","review":"I found this book to be helpful to me as I am encouraging someone who is struggling in a way that boundaries are needed.

I believe it is helpful for any relationship or situation whether it be marriage, work related, family or friends. I would recommend it for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This book has great information on what boundaries are and why we need them. If you can find people who will help you with out judging you may find this book very life changing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clearly Defined","review":"Written by psychologists and incorporating a Biblical perspective, Cloud and Townsend offer anecdotal, clinical and spiritual evidence as they explain the need for limits in our lives. Individual chapters address specific relational areas, e.g. family, marriage, children, workplace. The language and terminology are easy to understand, and the overall tone is encouraging."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"This is a fantastic book. When it first came out I skimmed it but did not read it thoroughly. Over the years I have probably given away at least a dozen of them and recommended it to countless others. When recently asked to teach a series on the topic of personal boundaries, I finally sat down and read the book carefully. What a treasure! I highly recommend the book as well as the workbooks that are available to accompany it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Condones spanking children","review":"I was very much into this book until I go to the part where the author says that spanking children is necessary at times. In my opinion physical punishment is a severe boundary violation - if it were not for that, I would rate this book higher as I like everything else he writes. Dr Cloud seems wise, genuine and caring but his words on spanking seem inconsistent with those qualities - that was a disappointing shock to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Speaking as a family counselor, it's enjoyable.","review":"Research is 75% of what we do, and this book is worth the read"},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting somewhat","review":"I ran into a girl that had read this book. She loved the book strongly. I became interested because of her strong beliefs. Some things she said showed the book had not helped her in some ways.The book talks a lot about defferent kinds of boundries. The book takes a religion viewpoint on everything. It also tries to cover everything. There are few ideas that are not covered in the first part of the book. The author also wrote 4 or five other books on the same theme.How much subtance is in the book? Well, maybe a page or two. Why did I give it such a high rating of two stars in place of one star?I did like some points the book made. He won me with the story \\" of a wall around your house or a fence with a gate that would open and close\\".I probably did not get enough out of the book there were only a few points and you had to hunt to find them. I may have skimmed too much.There are probably much better books to get but I do not have a suggestion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent treatment of boundary issues","review":"\\"Boundaries\\" has been around for quite a few years, but the updated edition is very worthwhile. The author iswell known and respected, and hiscommunication style is straightforward and real. Boundary issues apply to everyone. The workbook has an accompanying DVD which is designed to be used in groups, but I find it to be equally effective in individual counseling. As you go through the questions in the workbook, the group leader or counselor is going to end up benefiting nearly as much as the counselees will. The approach is decidedly Christian, which I prefer, but I can see this exercise having value for those of any faith or belief system. This workbook is easy to read, concise, insightful, well-exampled, personable, and fantastic at triggering conversations that I have seen work real change in people's lives. I would recommend it to anyone, anytime! In fact, I need to get a few more workbooks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great concepts","review":"If you can implement the advice from Boundaries into your life then you will be better for it. The book explains why it is appropriate to sometimes say \\"no\\" to people. Some of the fictional examples are unrealistic and detract from the good advice (a woman tells her boss that she will not work on his last-minute project, and as a result she is promoted and her former boss is assigned to be her assistant). The authors like to quote scriptures to support their ideas, but they jump between several translations of the Bible and you get the impression that the verses don't always say exactly what is desired. Despite that the book contains useful concepts and it reads well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Changed my life","review":"This book had helped me to understand that being a \\"good Christian\\" does not mean to give everything I can to dealing with other people's problems. It shows the difference between \\"boulders\\" and \\"knapsacks\\", the healthy way to deal with both, and signs that I am not dealing with them responsibly. This book helped me to come to terms with suicide attempts by a close friend that I thought were my responsibility to prevent, and to deal with the devastation I felt following her overdose. This book helped me to distinguish between my issues and other people's issues, and helped me to realize my responsibility to take care of myself and set and enforce health boundariesPS: I have had this book for over a year, have read it several times, and refer to it on a regular basis when making decisions"},{"rating":"2","title":"Boundaries","review":"Cloud & Townsend are excellent speakers with excellent knowledge and have a great presentation....but not in this! The information they have is so valuable, so life changing and so very LOST in this video. You will spend much of your time watching graphics including an irritating pencil streaking across the screen for endless periods of time. This nonsense interrupts the speakers so often you almost want to give up watching it. You cannot even skip to the next session to avoid it.Cloud & Townsend gave a presentation in a video years ago that I viewed and it was so remarkably well done. I even tried to buy it...but it does not exist. I tried to get the audio version of this video and sadly it is not presented by these speakers but someone else who you cannot stand to listen to. My advice: they completely re-do this project (both video & audio) and fire the graphics people, the reader, and do their presentation without interruption. Only then can their message be heard and understood."},{"rating":"2","title":"just what I wanted","review":"The book was as described, well packaged, and came quickly.

It is very helpful for dealing with difficult relationships and learning how to grow out of dependency in relationships. Very readable easy to apply. If you find yourself being trampled on by others and feeling angry because you feel like others use you then this book is for you. I learned the importance of two letters by reading this book and I am happier for it. N - O.

I am a person of very strong faith and really was turned off by the constant references to the Bible. If I wanted to read a collection of sermons I would reread my Bible and not have some one do it for me.The book should be listed under a catagory of religious books and not one to help you discover and control your boundaries. After about 100 pages, I stopped reading and removed the book from my device because I was feeling so annoyed with the sermonizing and lack of any really in depth study of the title subject Boundaries.

From how bonding takes place with parents, to how to stop letting people control you. If you were raised by an older sibling. You probably need to read this book. Most of the older siblings, have a stronger control on siblings, than parents. They have something to prove. They are in CONTROL. And, guess who is being controlled, and sometimes those controlling spirits, just don't dissapear. We have to recognize when we are being controlled. And, know what to do about it.

The latest fad is defining boundaries. While there may be some helpful ideas here, many are based on plain misapplications of biblical texts.

People who think they are \\"too kind, too giving\\" are often nothing of the kind. People who feel they are weak are often tyrants.People who feel their boundaries are too weak often run all over others in reality.The individual I referred to above is still choosing all her daughter's clothes at almost 15 years old.

A lot of psychological dysfunction and pain is caused by others trampling on a person's life, self-respect, and dignity.

While this book does give insight to setting boundaries with everyday regular family issues, it gives nothing in reference to the fact of those who are in severe, abusive, controlling and manipulative relationships with parents who may be bipolar and personality disorders.

There are many other causes of boundary issues that this book does not address or help you resolve."},{"rating":"2","title":"unique contemporary perspective to biblical relationships","review":"Boundaries is a spiritually inspired work of divinity. Not on par with the bible, yet should be used as a companion for dealing with everyday life. Perspectives that never occurred to me why problems happen to me were focused upon for the first time. This material should be used in a chuch bible study or local missionary effort. The view of Jesus through the eyes of John Townsend and Henry Cloud, shows a truely loving parent having eternal wisdom to offer us. This view shows acceptance, tolerance, encouragement, strenthening advice, and mostly about love. A must for anyone travelling down the spiritual road having a deep desire to further relationships with God, and other people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good lessons","review":"This is not the first book about this subject that I've tackled. The concept is good, and timely for our culture and our lack of boundaries. Too many references to the Bible for my taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christians are not supposed to be Doormats","review":"Being a good Christian doesn't mean putting up with everything that happens in life. We are not doormats and this book helped me see that. It is okay to preserve yourself and keep a sound mind - away from others that take advantage of you. If you are upset by how others treat you or how much you end up \\"doing\\" for others and the church, then you are doing so out of our human need to fulfill what being \\"Christian\\" is...we need to bear good fruit, and that means setting limits."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good to read and reread to become a good friend.","review":"Boundaries, along with counseling, has given me tools to work toward a more functional marriage as well as being a better parent and friend."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book will change your life if you let it.","review":"I was profoundly affected by this book. It is impossible not to evolve into a better, stronger, more-centered person after reading \\"Boundaries.\\" Cloud & Townsend move you with succinct writing and scriptual references to dig deeper, take responsibility for and have control over your life, and to become the best You that you can be. I refer to the book often and consider it a second Bible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye-opener","review":"Boundaries awakens a Type A person's perspective on life. When we try to be all things to all people, we are nothing to ourselves. This book guides the reader through valuable inner reflection to identify the sources of life's chaos. You then learn to change your thinking and behavior to instill control into your personal and professional lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freedom~","review":"This book is like a breath of fresh air.I can have so much freedom because of realizing that I don't have to be bound by all these silly obligations I put on myself!This is so helpful in evaluating why friendships are frustrating sometimes.Although I don't always agree with their notions on why these boundaries become a part of one's life, I have gained so much insight into the issues themselves and the examples of relationships help to put into practical application."},{"rating":"2","title":"required reading for \\"nice\\" people that need to learn to protect themselves","review":"This one introduced me to the writer and has been a book that has helped me through some of the toughest times in my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learned more from this book than my parents ever taught me","review":"The authors explain many different reasons that people struggle with in relating to others, and why many relationships can be so frustrating on both sides.

It has really been helpful in the way that I deal with others, and I believe it will do likewise for any reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great help for structuring your life!","review":"This is a wonderful help for structuring your life and not having bad feelings about saying no when you should.

Poor theology and Scriptural interpretation abound. A topical book - study often takes some \\"bird walks\\" on context, but Dr's. Cloud and Townsend stray far off the course here. This book is absent of any teaching on Grace, empowerment of the Holy Spirit, and I'll agree with another reviewer, it is heresy in it's evaluation of Jesus' example. Using the Bible as a justification to \\"hurt\\" but not \\"harm\\" friends or family doesn't really sound like any part of the Beatitudes - because it's not! This is a psychology book, not a Bible study book. Read \\"Grace Awakening\\" by Chuck Swindoll or \\"Why Grace Changes Everything\\" by Chuck Smith for a better look at God's real power for daily living."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can't find the message through the Biblical Quotes","review":"This book is a terrible disappointment to me. The very valuable messages within it are obfusticated with Biblical quotes and references in almost every line. Sometimes it does not even say what the Bible says- just gives a Book, chapter & verse, making it necessary to flip back and forth from your bible to this book in order to understand it. It is very difficult to understand what it is saying because the Bible verses get in the way. It seems to be written for someone who needs ammunition to fire back at a Bible thunper who is overstepping your personal boundaries.The content of the book would be wonderful if is were untangled from the Biblical references. After reading a chapter, I feel as though I have been fending off a religious prosetylizer at my doorstep- and that person would also have been overstepping my boundaries!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Farce","review":"When I ordered this book I was led to believe it was based on the science of mental health. What I found was that it was a book on Christian values, Bible verses, and virtual preaching. Instead of sound psychological protocol I was given Bible classes. I am not anti-Christian, or anti-religion, but I don't expect to buy a book on psychology only to find it is about two men's religious values. I returned this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading description not happy","review":"I am shocked and annoyed to hear that this book is more about the bs of god and the bible than the real life problem of boundaries.I am so over the religious rubbish, it has nothing to do with the real world. i am a realist and believe that religion does more harm than good.i want my money back, this book should be clearly marked as christian and not self help!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Irrelevant and bad acting","review":"When I heard that my small group was doing Boundaries, I was excited since I had read the book and liked it. Unfortunately, the DVD doesn't measure up. It basically gives little skits to start off the discussions, but the skits don't seem to have much to do with the content of the book or even the discussion questions in the Participant Guide. Moreover, the acting is pretty bad, and the \\"plots\\" are slow and predictable. In fact, half way through, we stopped playing the video because so many people stopped coming! I'd suggest skipping this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read.","review":"I wish I had this book 15 years ago. I could have learned how to communicate and figure out what's mine and not mine. Everyone could benefit by this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"For Christians only","review":"As someone who is not a Christian I found this book to be basically incomprehensible. All of the concepts are couched in biblical quotes or Christian theology, and as a non-believer I could not glean from it general principles that would seem to apply to me. Without a thorough grounding in the Bible I think that this book just doesn't make sense. I would not recommend this book to a broad population, as it assumes that one's motivation for modifying behavior is based on the teachings of Christianity and interpretations of the Bible. I quite frankly didn't *understand* most of it and could not untangle many useful concepts from in between the numerous Bible quotes. I would not classify this as a work of psychology or a self-help book outside of a Christian context."},{"rating":"2","title":"Boundaries, by Cloud and Townsend","review":"The book gives an in-depth review of how people get so \\"off-track\\" with their lives, and emphasizes that most people need professional, or a support team, to lift them back to productive lives.I like the thought that \\"will power\\" attempts to place our will above God's power.Thank you Cloud and Townsend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book. Don't be fooled by title.","review":"This is a wonderful book. I've also seen the videos. The title is not good because it gives the impression one is to establish \\"walls\\" between people. This is not the point of the book. It is a wonderful book about how to establish manageable limits for yourself and also for those around you ... yes, this is possible. Not easy, but possible. Good book if you live among family and friend, and co-workers... (which everyone does, of course!)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"This is an awesome book!

It'll put you to sleep if you're not careful. The disc arrived with a sticker on the front that said \\"Made in Japan\\". Maybe that explains the weird name \\"Frencher Style\\". Not much English on the liner notes, and the artist(s) names aren't even given. Contains all the cliche songs (April in Paris, La Vie en Rose, La Marseillaise, Un Homme et Une Femme) done in an extremely cliche style. Boring!

There is a lot of accordion music out there that's so much better than this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"After searching for this book in bookstores and libraries, I finally found it on Amazon. I'm truly sorry I spent so much time looking for this book. I found it dull and uninteresting.

Yes, it does come with 2 in the box. One, I put in wrong, and then, you can't put it in again. Then my daughter gave her 2 hair cuts with the other extension, and now we are done. No more hair extensions - meaning Barbie cannot get any more haircuts until I go to the store and buy more. Barbie's real hair has to be hidden under the hair smock so you don't cut her real hair. You have to cut the extensions. So after 15 minutes of fun and a few haircuts, you can't use the toy again, until you get more extensions. Please beware before you buy. I did not know this when I bought the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed","review":"I bought this Barbie for my niece's Easter present. I put the first extension in wrong and there went the fun. She calls me about once a week to ask me to buy her more hair. I can't find it anywhere! Don't think about calling Mattel to order it either. They send you back to the store. I wish I had gone with the SpongeBob Barbie instead...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this is you have a hairsylist in training!","review":"Boy, I wish they had this doll when I was a kid! Instead of taking my long hair down to pixie length, I could have worked on Barbie instead. That's what my 4-year old is doing, and she loves this doll. And maybe she can keep her waist long hair! The only thing that would be a great improvement would be if they had more than two extra hair pieces. The mechanism is very good, although the hair does appear sparse since the delivery system in the back of the doll only goes to the center of the doll's head. After the base hair is cut, the real Barbie look is compromised. However, it keeps the scizzors on Barbie and not on my daughter. It is hard to find the accessory of the replacement hair at this time. As the doll enters the market I would expect this will be easier to find. All in all a great toy to allow a natural tendency to be safely expressed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Waste of money. Can't do any hair styles with them except cut. Hard to manage and a waste of money. I was stupid enough to buy 2 of these for xmas presents."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most disappointing Barbie","review":"The box and ads are completely misleading for this Barbie. It doesn't say anywhere on the box that you need to buy refills for the hair extensions. Also, the hair gets all tangled up in Barbie's back which makes it difficult to pull out of her head without opening her back up again and straightening it out. This was a good way to show my daughter how commercials exaggerate how good products are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good resource","review":"I purchased the dictionary about four months ago to assist in my seminary classes. I have found this a helpful resource and sometimes have even just opened it up and read about a topic or person that I come to. The entries are detailed enough without being longwinded.

The article on the means of grace, for instance, does not discuss the Lutheran view. The reader is often given the impression throughout this work that the standard or only view on various theological questions is that of the Reformed faith as opposed to the Lutheran or Arminian. That is problematic in that one of the chief founders of modern Evangelicalism, John Wesley, would come to typify the Arminian branch of Evangelicalism.That said, the articles are of a very high quality and serve as an excellent resource for theological terms and ideas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Christian Theology resource written besides the Holy Bible","review":"Walter Elwell has organized a magnificent dictionary for Christians using the expertise of multiple scholars to deliver the best Christian Theology resource besides the Bible itself.

The contributors, all brilliant scholars, were very fair to the opposing view, adequatley describing thier position and only rarely critiquing it.I found this to be a fresh evangelical approach to the Neo-Orthodoxy that I am exposed to daily. I recommend the second edition which has been updated to include modern scholars as Packer and Lloyd-Jones.Final AnalysisThe qualities of this work are its objectivity, freshness (without being preachy), and its broad expanse of topics. The downside would be its tendency for being wordy and laborious on some issues. Do not let this prevent you from buying it, just be forewarned. All in all, a handy tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great work, but sometimes biased.","review":"No doubt this is a great volume and is an essential reference work for evangelical theology. The dictionary provides a good overview of the evangelical position on many contemporary issues in theology.I am periodically disappointed, though, at the biased perspective of some of the articles. For example, the one on \\"election\\" simply assumes a Calvinist position (though many \\"evangelicals\\" are Arminians, and many Arminians even contribute to the dictionary). In this regard, Van Harvey's classic \\"A Handbook of Theological Terms\\" is superior in its unbiased treatment of terms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Valuable Tool","review":"I work extensively through church and community volunteering with the impoverished.

The acting was so stilted that the lead vampire wasn't so much undead as just dead boring, most of the rest of the characters looked as if they were reading their lines from cue cards, and the best I can say for the gore was that I wanted to ask the vamps to brush their fangs after eating.This was just the first third of the movie.

There aren't many printed version of this text, so my professor has to make due with what is available. However, NORILANA BOOKS ought to be too ashamed to call themselves a publisher. Sometimes, independent companies shouldn't do what the big boys do. This book has too many typos and the chapters are incorrectly numbered. For example, when I finished reading chapter 22, the next chapter was 13.Now onto the book: I'd rate it 4 STARS. The story is very interesting and draws the reader in from the beginning, because McCutcheon's is a good writer. I would recommend this story to anyone looking to read something outside their normal realm. I just would highly recommend they download the free Google Books version. Or see if there is another version offered on Amazon.

Best of the series IMHO."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing because it could have been so good","review":"Mr. Hilderman uses family relics and actual letters written by soldiers to give a good view of the period, but his allegation that the Confederate army only carried on the war in the end because of forced servitude is ludicrous. The swell of patriotism carried men into the ranks, and love for their families and homes kept them there. While some letters and diaries of the period do express the \\"rich man's war, poor man's fight\\" sentiment, far more continued to risk their lives out of the southern-born-and-bred sense of duty to their states and families. Hilderman does these brave veterans, as well as their descendents, a disservice by stating that they fought only because they were forced into it. Two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"They Went into the Fight Cheering","review":"Mr. Hilderman's book is simply a \\"sour grapes\\" attempt to cast wildly inaccurate aspersions, (and passing them off as history), on the courage and commitment of the Southern soldier because of his own personal excommunication from the Southern history and heritage community. This book is not worth the time it takes to read it, and the best possible use for it would be to hang it on a nail in the outhouse and let nature take it's course. It is South bashing at it's absolute worst.....from a man with a HUGE axe to grind.

I am interested in the human story surrounding the War and found myself \\"in their shoes\\": the inner turmoil of the men as they struggled to balance their desire to maintain their Southern heritage and way of life with the realities of leaving their families and home to go to war, the stress of being left behind as a wife/mother/child. The actual letters reproduced in the book (which to my joy includes the vocabulary and spelling of the era) were particularly touching and added to my human experience as I read.[...]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Comfortable, but small","review":"As far as comfort goes, the gel rest attached this mouse pad can't be beat. The fabric and the gel wrapped in it make for a soothing writst rest that will work better than any of the hard rubbery mouse rests out there. I've used those, and they don't compare to the comfort of the gel pad.I did find the size of the mousing surface to be too small. Perhaps I could have turned up the sensitivity of the mouse even a bit more, however, I already have the sensitivity cranked up, probably 3/4 of the way. I would run off the edge of the pad and have to pick the mouse up to put in back on the mouse pad while working. If the surface was slightly bigger, this would have earned a 5-star rating from me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not comfortable and too expensive for what you get","review":"This gel mousepad with wristrest is pretty hard on the wrist, you really have to press hard to get it to conform to the shape of your wrist, is isn't very comfortable.

The wrist support is very firm and really reduces the stress in my hand. The bottom surface is anti-slipping and the pad remains solidly in place.

The size also appears to be perfect; I use a 17 inch monitor and I do not run out of pad space. The only complaint that I have is that I just discovered that this pad comes in other colors than the blue displayed on this page when my product arrived and I looked at the enclosed cartoon. In case you did not like this blue one: MW311LE is black, MW311MX is black/gray and MW311BH has a beach theme on it (all available on Amazon).

I thought that this was because the mouse had some tiny scratches on it. So i cleaned it and used it again..no luck.Today i went to staples to have it exchanged for a similar mousepad. To my dismay, the pointer still goes awry if you move the mouse slowly if used with a Mx500 mouse.

These are not overly interpreted performances, but rather understated, no frills Bach playing in the style of say, Richter.You'll find very little to dislike in Jarret's playing. He plays with joy and yet a reverence for these revered and oft studied works. His technique is more than adequate, his phrasing is right on the money, and his tempos are very conservative.Overall, I'd say that these performances hold up well with the best available recordings out there by classical pianists such as Schiff, Hewitt, Tureck and Richter, and therefore I highly recommend it.Enjoy"},{"rating":"2","title":"Jarrett is the best","review":"I consider Jarrett the best interpretor of Bach. The reason for this is that he leaves his ego out of the picture. He let's Bach's music speak for itself.

Great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Keith seems to enjoy playing music as shown in the score","review":"It is good at the fugues of A minor, B flat minor and B minor.

After several days trying to find out the problem I ordered another FireWire card by a different manufacturer. It worked fine. I then started trying to return what I consider a defective product. Amazon and Adaptec refused to accepted it, and advised that I get a RTM from the seller. The only problem is the condition in which they want the product returned. It must be in the original container complete with all of the appropriate stickers.

It has been a fantastic paring knife. It has really good heft and balance. It feels really good in the hand. It is easy to handle when cutting up food. The blade is sharp and I have not had any issues or struggles with this knife. Because I keep good care of it and keep it sharp, I have not ever cut myself with this knife and neither has anyone using it in my house. A bad dull knife is a lot more dangerous to use in the kitchen, this one makes for safer cooking. The price is not cheap, but you only need a few knives in the kitchen and a paring knife is a must. With good care this knife will last you forever and is well worth the money.

Arguably his best album, there are so many classic cuts here. The Wicketsh-t Will Never Die is one of the hardest first up songs ever, he lets u know he aint f%&kin round on here, then My Homie Got Shot and Mental Stress are 2 songs with INCREDIBLE beats, where he tears up the mic, then Chatty Ass Nigga and Slug Froma 45 are both classic, C.A.N features Natas. Therapy features his brother James \\"DEADBOY\\" Smith, and Make Me Wanna Holla and Would You Die 4 Me are 2 of my favorites, both awesome beats and awesome sampling. The 3rd verse in Would You Die 4 Me is one of my favorites on the album. 24/7 is another classic cut, top beat, great chorus and wicket lyrics, and Closed Casket has a wicket beat and Esham hits it the hardest here. Overall, this album of course is 5 stars, like many other Esham albums, but this one is one of the best Esham albums ever. Every Esham fan should own this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Esham's most gangsta","review":"This album by far is one of Wickit Godfather Esham's best albums.

Although I agree that the suspense is there, I find I can't wait to just get it over with and find out \\"who dunnit?\\" already! The dialogue is predictable and repetitive to the point of being boring and the love scenes are ridiculous. Maybe it's because I am listening to it rather than actually reading it myself. Maybe the voice actress is my problem with it. She performs the women's voices well but every time she speaks as one of the male characters I almost laugh out loud.

My husband had to buy all new larger inserts & use wood glue to fix it. I purchased this for my daycare kids to hang their coats on. My daycare kids (ages 2-4)were NOT rough at all on this at all. I even helped them put their coats on the pegs to insure they were hooked on right or it wouldn't fall over on them. Base of this item is very poor also--not solid at all--tips over VERY easily. This is a Kid's Coat Rack for goodness sake. They are not going to know they need to \\"balance\\" their coats evenly on it other wise it will fall over on them.

I missed that there is little emphasis on the positioning of your arms. For a nonnative English speaker the advice is spoken in a very hectic manner compared to other workout videos that I know.

I had a few years of ballet in college and a few years of ballet workout class. My teachers then were entertaining and encouraging and broke a sweat, unlike Melissa Lowe, who is like the girl you hated in high school only with less personality.

Beginners will have to rewind it frequently to understand the exercises; advanced students may find it helpful for teaching purposes.

The exercises in the tape are not aerobic, but the precision required in performing them will definitely be a good workout, for the body and the mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull, Mechanical, Ho-Hum","review":"I took a couple of years of ballet in college (a few years back). It was an excellent workout and always a joyous experience. And, as a musician, it helped me with phrasing, posture, etc. I think dancing should at least be slightly fun. It looks as if Miss Lowe has done this all her life. No doubt she is an excellent dancer, but she lacks all enthusiasm as a teacher. Also, she doesn't give a run-down of the steps before doing floor exercises. I could get the adagio after a few repitions, but not faster-paced stuff--some explanation would help and could be put at the beginning or ending of the tape so one wouldn't have to watch it after learning it. There must be better tapes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and a little too easy","review":"Ms. Lowe has made an excellent tape for true beginners. I danced ballet several years ago, and given it up. Recently I've been doing Pilates and yoga which led me back to my old love.

Alas, Ms Hawkes writing style would surely be a boon to insomniacs if it could be condensed and put into a bottle. And quite aside from its potent lethean side effects, it is at times immensely irritating, as in \\"and now I am going to talk about the next thing I intend to talk about...\\" Aaargh. And then there is the frustrating defect of much writing from those of academia, the \\"just-who-in-the-hell-am-I-writing-for?\\" neurosis: the book seems aimed at a general lay audience, yet esoteric terms and proper nouns are tossed off like so many sparkles on a birthday cake, words familiar only to those with a graduate education in the subject.

But it provides no evidence to support such an outlandish claim. Sure, there are lots of crude drawings of buffalos in this book, and some pictures of bones and things that I guess are shaped like tools. But there is nothing convincing. It almost seems like the author is making things up as she goes along.Anybody can go out and find some crude drawings of buffalos on a cave wall. It doesn't prove that there were people living on The Earth two million years ago. I've made crude drawings of buffalos (and arrows) on rocks in the mountains many times throughout my life.In a few years, will scientists say that my drawings prove that prehistoric men used bows and arrows to hunt buffalo?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Satisfied!!!","review":"This product was delivered as promised and was exactly as indicated.

And they haven't. But I don't feel secure when I'm sitting in the chair. I also feel like I'm on the verge of toppling back if I lean back, which is the whole point I ordered the chair: for back support. And although the straps are adjustable, the only way I feel secure is if I have the straps tightened all the way, which doesn't seem like a heck of a lot of flexibility to me. It's also a bit tricky if I want to reach anything that's not immediately next to me.Needless to say, the chair is not what I expected.Still, I do have something nice to say: The chair is light and compact, and I'd rather use this chair, as flimsy as it seems, than not have any support at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product, Great Value","review":"I ordered this Crazy Creek to take to the camp where I work.

John did the one thing he could do for Joey, he scored touchdowns. John ended up winning the Heisman Trophy as the top player in collegiate football. At the awards dinner, John gave one of the most emotional and inspirational speeches ever delivered, as he gave his trophy to Joey.This book tells the whole story. It has moments of humor (as Joey asks John to score 4 touchdowns in one game). It has moments of triumph (as John actually scores 4 touchdowns in one game...just for Joey). It is heartbreaking and spirit-building.My only complaint is that it reads more as a movie adaptation (the movie starred Marc Singer as John). I would have liked to hear some from John, himself.Even so, everyone will benefit from reading this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something for the sensitive","review":"Fun! Exciting! Action Packed! That's NOT Something for Joey. Based on the cover you may think this is a football book. We got tricked into that, also. The book's main subject isn't totally based on football; it's a loving book about the relationship of a boy and his brother. The most fast-action pass we received was when the little boy goes to the hospital. This book is for people who want a serious novel with a well thought-out meaning.

The bad news is that there are 100 pages in the middle I just didn't care about, and I cannot believe the protagonist runs her own successful business, bakeshop or no, because in 300 pages, she spent so little time there that I'm amazed no one's stealing from the till or smashing the windows.

The colors aren't the best choices for a black nano.

That's right, people like the author can be, and should be, arrested if they go to Ecuador and try practicing this voodoo. These therapists all seem alike. They all think that being gay has something to do with effeminacy, they all think that homosexuality is a disorder or disease or problem or whatever, they all think that you should switch to heterosexuality because organized religion says so, they all think that psychoanalytic psychotherapeutic psychotherapy has all the answers, the answers always having something to do with your parents or your failure to play football or whatever, and all of these voodoo priests are Republicans who get their news from Fox or World Net Daily. I dare you to find even one reparative therapist who is a Democrat.

This album (not on Impulse! ) is an amalgamation of the 10-22-63 concert in Stockholm, and the 11-3-63 concert in Berlin. The music is as powerful as you would expect from this legendary band. Check out the version of \\"Lonnie's Lament\\" which predates the studio version recorded in April of 1964. Also of interest; the cadenza from \\"I Want To Talk About You\\" ( compare to the famous version recorded on \\"Live at Birdland\\" lp ). This cd contains a 20 minute version of \\"My Favorite Things\\". There are many beautiful moments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"This album has caught a lot of bad press over the years because most critics have voiced the opinion that none of the participants were fully engaged in this project. This can safely be called THE David Crosby Byrds album. He's all over the music. Chris Hillman and Roger McGuinn back up and audibly let David have his way. Gene Clark and David are in fine voice and the cover songs are great. \\"See The Sky About To Rain\\" is awesome and McGuinn's \\"Rock-n-Roll\\" is very ragged but very right. Crosby got a great sound on this record. The instruments and vocals are crystal clear. It is one of my all-time favorite Byrds Albums. It's better,in its way, than anything after \\"Notorious\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Byrds Reunion Album Not A Bust...","review":"This album received alot of negative press. I assume the critics were thinking that by reuniting the original Byrds would create a masterpiece of Byrds sounding songs. Instead they got an album of good country rock songs from five very influential musicians. Obviously Crosby,Hillman,McGuinn,Clark and Clarke were at a different stage musically in their careers when this album came out. They had moved on from the more pop oriented sound of the Byrds. Some very solid song writing(\\"Long Live The King\\",\\"For Free\\" some good covers(Neil Young's \\"See The Sky(About To Rain)\\" and \\"Cowgirl In The Sand\\" and most of all some quality musicianship(love the mandolin fills throughout the album) lead to an underappreciated effort. I think most people would be pleasantly surprised by this cd."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album, several homeruns","review":"It's such a shame that this record still spilts Byrds fans after all these years.I loved this album when it first came out and still think it's great. The Gene Clark songs are all homeruns, whether he's singing his or Neil Young's songs. Crosby did a great job getting the acoustic instruments to pop out and sing. Makes sense that the electric 12-string is de-emphasized here.What a shame these guys couldn't get along.I see another fan didn't like Crosby's version of For Free, but I think this version's a great interpretation that takes advantage of the best of what this version of the Byrds had to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated","review":"I can't understand why this album is so underrated. It features great vocals by the late great Gene Clark, wonderful mandolin picking by Chris Hillman (missing from most Byrds albums), the familiar reedy vocals by Roger McGuinn, and good songs on every track. The ringing 12-string (I think) electric solo on the last track by McGuinn (or maybe it's Hillman) on the last track is worth the price of the album. One of my favorite records."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Last Official Byrds Studio Album.","review":"As far I am concerned The Byrds are the greatest band of all time.Therefore for me to give 2 out 5 stars indicates that something is seriously wrong.I have owned this CD for some years and have just played it again.I can only recommend 2 songs, which are Full Circle, and (See The Sky) About To Rain, and neither can be described as must haves.With the best will in the world this must be the least important album to have, so if you don't know The Byrds, please try any other of their many releases."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE THIS ALBUM!!","review":"I'm a long time fan of the original and later versions of The Byrds. This album is the reunion of the original Byrds, recorded in 1972, and released in 1973. It's one of my favorite Byrds albums, especially the Gene Clark and David Crosby songs. I'm very happy it was finally released on cd. I still have my original vinyl copy, but I played it so much, it's pretty well worn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff!

For many, the world of loyalty marketing and its results may seem incomprehensible, or worse yet, unquantifiable. However, in his new book, \\"Loyalty Marketing: The Second Act\\", Brian has conveyed the importance and power of building real loyalty with the consumer. His frequent use of case studies spanning several industries, illustrates and quantifies the benefits of building an effective loyalty program and putting it to work in even the most competitive and mature of markets. In today's business environment, it's not enough to simply attract new customers. The silver bullet for success is the ability to retain those customers through the years to come.Whether you are a proprietor or charged with the marketing initiatives of a large retailer, Brian's real-life examples and insights captured in his latest book, will give you the competitive edge to secure profitable and loyal customers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brian Woolf has done it again!","review":"To me, Brian Woolffs Customer SpecificMarketing(1996) is one of the most revolutionary and influential business books ever published in Japan.

It was a bunch of poorly constructed essays that rambled on forever without making any important points. I was curious as to what the women (aside from Miss. Shamburg were like)that worked with her-- but she really didn't write about much other than herself, her grandmother and some clients she saw.I also felt that by Shamburg saying she couldn't tell the readers any more because she had to protect her client (a writer's duty--or something to that extent), she was really just covering up her inability to write anything meaningful. Major disapointment. There's no life to this book. I can't imagine why anyone would find this insightful. Perhaps because there aren't many other books out there written about S&M in this manner?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mistress ruby ties it together","review":"A very disappointing book.

You feel as if you have been totally mislead.Mz Shamburg wrote a series of articles for her local paper while she was acting as a dominatrix, and these may well be some or all of them, I have the feeling, reproduced in this book.This book really has nothing to offer, and you would be best to save your money, and your disappointment and look for another book on the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"Scotch Self Laminating ID protectors","review":"This is a perfect item for a small business needing individualized badges.

The author delves into the beginnings of the well known lines and shipbuilders, including some that did not make it. Although focused on the North Atlantic, there is good coverage of other routes. Many anecdotes and stories of people. Colorful descriptions of conditions on ships. Some numbers and statistics, though not enough. Beautiful black and white and color pictures, though, again, not enough. I wish the book was longer, it had more numbers, including tables and charts of annual traffic on routes, market share of companies, revenues or profits. Even so, a delightful volume that is superior to most other offerings on this subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"TWO GREAT GLEN ALBUMS","review":"There's one song on this 2-CD set that's worth the price alone: the achingly beautiful \\"I've Been To Town\\".

These are awful.I instead used the Safety 1st wide latches (pack of 7) which don't have great reviews on Amazon, but were easy to install, and work well for me. They are not spring loaded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly flawed design","review":"I've bought tons of stuff on Amazon and this is the first time I ever felt the need to post a review to warn people away from something.These latches look fine but have a fundamental design flaw. The slope where the two plastic pieces come together isn't correct. If you position the pieces properly so the drawer won't open unless the latch is pushed down to clear the lip, then the drawer won't close smoothly on it's own. You have to push the latch down when you're CLOSING the drawer as well, which clearly isn't what people are expecting (or what the designers intended). I tried many tiny adjustments in the positioning and found none where the drawer closed smoothly but remained secure when closed.Insanely bad design. If the plastic pieces were sloped just a bit differently, it would work fine. What were they thinking?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Design","review":"Pros:None except: function of first installed latch was so poor it was obvious they could not be used. This saved me the trouble of having to install / uninstall more than one latch.Cons:1) almost impossible to align; tip of latch changes locations as you tighten screws because soft plastic distorts. If tightened prior to plastic distortion then latch is loose / unsecured.2) latch is too short. My hands or medium sized and I cannot fit my fingers in between door and frame. I needed a tool to press down on latch.3) screws too short. They were sufficient length to install latch but not for catch. Catch had to installed upside down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Consider other options, first","review":"Got these because they were the only ones at the store. They looked good in the package, but looks were deceiving. They are really difficult to install correctly, and I have lots of experience working with wood and cabinets. They are made of a light weight plastic that distorts when tightening the screws, causing the latch to go out of alignment. Alignment is critical. If the latch is a little low, it doesn't catch. A little high and it jambs against the catch and breaks off. I've replaced about half of the latches in about a year's time. I'm replacing them now with sturdier latches from another manufacturer.I do not recommend. Moreover, I am more critical of any product from this company."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This book was VERY disappointing.

Certainly, his art history series differs greatly from his masterpiece,An Instance of the Fingerpost: A Novel. They are lighter in general, though this one has some heavier topics. It is also easier to figure out whodunnit though the plot is a bit complex. It depicts the pragmatism of the police--ignoring the call of justice though. Realistic, perhaps, but a bit sad nevertheless. However, this one does have some humorous dialog in it--more than the others I've read:p. 17: As he took a step back and put his foot on an old sandwich cunningly hidden under the armchair.p. 105: It is dangerous to form an opinion about someone merely on his choice of wistaria.p. 155: Even had he been her husband's fairy godmother that was no excuse for turning up at such an hour.But, my favorite part is the p. 130 Attack of the winos!

Not much (should I say - nothing?) to do with art, or art history. Yeah, there is a picture, but it plays a minimal role in the book. That scene at the end, drawing parallels to the paiting, is so crude, I'd rather not have it there. In general, Pears is rather heavy handed as a writer (at least in this book, I have not read anything else by him). No finesse... The book is still a decent mystery. It is just not very exciting. If you are looking for a mystery with a european setting - look somewhere else. You can replace \\"Rome\\" or \\"Paris\\" in this book with... Berlin? Chicago? and you won't even notice that these names were not there from the very beginning.I see people commenting that there are better books in this series - I hope so, but I may know now why my local bookstores do not carry this series at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beatifully Beatlesque","review":"Wonderful, touching album.

The comparison is indeed attractive and sometimes evidential.

Zobel's The Boston Massacre has, for a few decades, been available as an example of American history as opposed to American mythology. The author is clear about the misrepresentations on both sides of the tension but it is his look at the ways in which the radicals controlled the town, the politics and the media through the use of the mob and terror tactics that is refreshing. Boston merchants and politicos, such as Samuel Adams, manipulated a situation for their own ends and began writing their own version right from the start. After the success of the American Revolution , this version would be enshrined as official history. The book starts slow and is a little dry and often confusing for those with with little previous knowledge of pre-Revolutionary Boston politics but it picks up speed and energy as it races toward the day of the Massacre itself. A refreshing look at an event that was small in historical impact but large in legend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meticulous Massacre Rendition","review":"Hiller Zobel's meticulously researched and painstakingly told rendition and reconstruction of the story of the so-called Boston Massacre dispels myth, evaluates possibilities, and, from the perspective of a lawyer and law professor, dissects and analyzes legal proceedings.

There is little else to say here, other than if you know DM's sound, this is still it, just with facial hair and a deeper voice.\\"Sister of Night\\" exemplifies this maturity, and the bankable hit, \\"It's No Good\\" still show they haven't lost their ability to make great songs in spite of Alan Wilder's departure from the band. \\"Barrel of a Gun\\" starts the album with a whomping punch and echoes back to the days of SONGS OF FAITH AND DEVOTION. \\"Home\\" has got to be the best vocal performance Martin Gore has ever done in his entire career.

Each and every song on the cd has that classic Depeche Mode tinge to it, but with an underlying new flare.

It still is getting better and better, after two years. I love all the songs. Personal favourites are beside \\"barrel of a gun\\" \\"sister of night\\" and \\"the bottom line\\", but my opinion changes all the time. One period I am convinced \\"Insight\\"is the best track, the next I think it's \\"It's no good\\" etc. Now I would say it's \\"Sister of night\\". Black celebration is my second favourite album.

The instrumentation on 'Ultra' is pretty inventive but most of the songs do lack positivity and maybe even musical willingness. You simply get sleepy, 'cause they're all in the same far too slow atmosphere.Especially the hit single 'Barrel Of A Gun' is embarrassingly boring. Not worth the former Depeche Mode quality stamp.Only highlights are 'It's No Good' which COULD make it to a 'Best Of' compilation, and 'Freestate', especially its crispy guitar.Depeche Mode needs to work on this adjusted style. It can work.

If you're a Depeche Mode fan, then this is your album, but if you're into Depeche Mode's more dance/industrial sound(Violator, Some Great Reward), stay completely away. But if you're the traditional DM fan, and like the music for the lyrical content, then this is perfection. Maybe Martin Gore should just stay away music, and just write poetry, and that's a real complement, he seems to have the ability to get his emotions to paper quite well."},{"rating":"1","title":"It used to be better","review":"I don't like the way DM changed.

Alan Wilder must have seen the light and escaped while he still could. This is a mishap of Air Supply boxset proportions (apologies to Dean Rasmussen). Its only mitigating factor is the fact that it towers over the negative-four-star effort \\"Songs of Faith and Devotion\\" and the negative-eighteen-star live rendition of those tunes.

This recording relies too much on the high tech recording process and not enough on the quality of the songs. All of those people who are giving this CD five stars are probably Depeche Mode fans who have trouble being objective. I think that five stars is a bit much especially compared with some of their earlier stuff. Depeche Mode seems to suffer from the \\"few good songs mixed in with a lot of boring filler\\" syndrome. I'm so sick and tired of buying CDs with one or two good tunes and a whole host of crappy numbers.

A couple of months later, I listened to it a few times over the course of a week, and I realized that this is a damn fine album. No, it's not as bouncy as \\"Violator,\\" but it's a far more complex and mature album than that one. \\"It's no good\\" is the best track on the record, \\"Sister of Night\\" is haunting -- I love the way they combine so-called \\"conventional\\" instruments with their trademark synth-pop sound, \\"Barrel of a Gun\\" is really good too (and suprisingly good live, too, saw them in San Antonio last November -- there's life in the band yet!), and \\"Uselink\\" is another standout track."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good 5.1 Mix","review":"Enjoyed it.

Recorded after Alan Wilder's departure, the record is soaked in cavernous bass synthetics and aggressive percussion. The 2nd half of the disc is a brooding suite that finally resolves itself in the gospel-tinged ending of \\"Insight\\", a welcome relief after a long but compelling section of dark Euro-pop. Not their most accessible LP, but definitely worth the journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"I originally had bought this to keep the child I babysit involved in the creativity of this facinating world....the heck with the kid...I am so involved with this new world that I can't focus on my daily task.

They had gotten out thru the air holes at the bottom. The company replaced the farm and the same thing happened again only this time I had placed the farm on a paper on a table so when they got out they could not get out from under the farm. I cannot get my money back because it is over the 30 day guarantee. I didn't get the first ants until after the 30 days.

We sent off for more and had a total of five living ants. These five were great for about a week then slowly starved to death because they wouldn't come out of the sand tunnels. My seven year old was so disappointed and heart broken when he realized they had all died. It was really hard to even see their tunnels because the instructions say not to move the farm for fear of collapsing the tunnels. Now, we're waiting for spring to gather our own ants.

Just the other day, I asked Danny by email if the ants had arrived and (with his mother doing the typing) his answer was, \\"No. Maybe the ant guys came while we were asleep.

All you can hear is the drums and the lead guitar. The bass, rhythm guitar, and vocals are most of the time, inaudible. The lead guitar has that screeching, bad-quality sound that is common to most live recordings. This is definitely my least favorite of all Beatles releases.

In looking up minerals I had a working knowledge off, either through lapidary, collecting myself, or dealing directly with miners, or mine owners, I found several inconsistencies which lead me to doubt the information of minerals I am looking up and have no knowledge of.

It has all the elements that we have come to expect in this genre, the best friend, the fake girl friend, the first encounter, the betrayal, and then the resolution. While parts of the story line feel forced, the overall sunny tone of the film, and the compelling characters help move it along nicely.

Not living in Germany, I can't say how accurate the cultural items were, but they were beievable, and the way the actors sensitively portrayed the individuals was very well done. The lead and his best friend, Achim, and the girlfriend were portrayed well. And, for those of us who've been there, the scene on the boat dock was lovely (the entire scene, not just two boys).

He playes Part I on piano and Part II on harpsichord. I have no idea why he does that.

Like Resident Evil you only have so much items to keep you going. You have to be careful. Learn how to position yourself with the enemies. Use the traps that are available. Take advantage of bombs and know how more XP is gained. Battle system is tactical.Once you figure out this system it is a lot of fun. One of my favorite games. It will challenge you all the way to the end. A gem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great fun...but frustrating","review":"This installment in the series plays very differently. Everyone complains about the new SOL system in the game. To put it bluntly it works something like this:1) Make your way through a dungeon.2) Either die or quit the game3) Choose to either restart the dungeon with roughly 10% of you rexperience (i.e. \\"party xp\\") and all your earned cash,or,Restart the entire game with 10% experience and all your cash.4) Repeat until strong enough to get to the next save point.P.S. every time you transform into a dragon (Ryu) you consume energy that cannot be replenished unless you start the game over entirely!The motivating factor compelling one to finish this game is the frustration of it being so darn difficult. On the plus side, the battle system is really fun and some of the attacks look super-cool. Plus, there's a mini-game where you build a fairy village (like in other bof games) which is totally fun as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too hard ,, but intresting.","review":"Were to begine.

I had to let the PS2 run for 3 days because I couldn't find any save tokens. It Sucked!!!!! Especially when your girlfriend tripped over a power cord and had to restart again!!!!!!Although Capcom had newer battle tactics and different try out for this game, you were limited with only 3 characters through out the game and you had to finish the game with a charcter who kept dying on every boss you face.If you are a truly huge fan of BofF and have to play this game, it's an interesting game.

I never played the first 2, but III and IV were great games. This last installment all but killed it. First and foremost, the BEST thing about breath of fire {any of them} was the main characters ability to transform into a dragon. Its what set the BOF games apart from the rest. Is it present in Dragon Quarter ? Well, yes and no. Its there, but you definately won't be using it. Theres a gauge, everytime you use the form it drains the gauge. Theres one BIG problem. The gauge CANNOT be refilled. Nothing ..... and yes I do mean NOTHING will refill it. When it drains completely, you die. When you think about that, along with the fact that the last boss can only be defeated in dragon form .... Well, what we have here is a BOF game without dragon transformations.

They are not your typical Linda Howard novels, since they are written in the first person, through Blair's eyes. At first Blair appears to be the stereotypical fluffy, dumb blonde, but there is way more to her than that -- puh-leese!Lighthearted and totally entertaining, this was the first book I ever finished and started immediately at the beginning to read again. I'm pretty sure I giggled as much the second time as I did the first.Linda Howard does an excellent job of portraying Blair, who is very sensible with a lot of grit and courage, as a superficial bubble-head. You just know she and her cop fiance are going to have a wonderful, eventful life!A delightful read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy This Book!","review":"I love this book and the characters.

They had great chemistry together and never forgot each other. During a murder investigation he comes back into her life and wants her back. Her thoughts? They walk out, they gotta crawl back. Get the picture? Don't you love her already? Wyatt gives as good as he gets but she knows how to push his buttons, especially with her many lists of his faults she leaves lying around. I couldn't put this book down and laughed all the way through it and the follow up book Drop Dead Gorgeous. I hope the author continues the series.

I found myself skipping over pages and pages of could-care-less info. The female lead was so weak and mealy-mouthed...the fact that the male lead simply had to look at her neck and she would get all weak-knee and fall into bed with him, was just pathetic.I've read a few of Howard's books and thought they were great, but her last two have been simply nauseating...I couldn't even finish \\"To Die For\\". Yech!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't you hate it when an author disappoints you?","review":"I feel like Linda Howard owes me the price of this book. You get comfortable with an author and you buy his/her books because you are sure you will enjoy them. This book could have been written by Linda Howard's Barbie doll, or maybe her 17-year old neighbor. Shallow, self-centered characters and the male love interest is nothing less than a stalker. Half way through the novel, I was hoping the killer would find what's-her-name and put her out of all our misery. Never finished the book and that's the lowest rating I can give a novel,"},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointing","review":"So I tried to read the book and that was bad enough. The audiobook made it that much worse I believe. The lead character, Blair, is just plain annoying. She is the type of character that usually is a supporting character, not the lead and it definitely fell short. I think that the narrator just added to my annoyance with the whole book. I really miss LH's beginning good reads. Hopefully we will see more of those in the future, and hopefully give them a chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! Humorous romantic suspense - and one of her best.","review":"I used to avoid first-person stories, but this one was so well-written that first-person worked. I think this is one of the best Linda Howard books to come along. The characters seem real - the story was exciting -- with much humor. Even in the last exciting suspenseful scenes, I died laughing. Linda Howard DEFINITELY knows what it is like to be a Southern woman. I wanted to throw in my 5 stars for this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great Howard book...","review":"One of my favorite things about Linda Howard's writing is her ability not to get \\"stuck in a rut\\". This story is very funny, lighthearted and reminded me of \\"Legally Blonde\\". The book jacket and the content were at serious odds with each other! My only complaint was the suspense part of this story - the idea of \\"who done it\\" was not given to the reader through the story and was only introduced at the end, in a not very believeable way. The humor more than makes up for it however."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Linda Howard I have ever read","review":"Let me first say that I have read almost everything that Linda Howard has wrote, dating all the way back to the early 80's. This book was by far the worst thing that I have read from her. I honestly could not believe that Linda Howard wrote this. I hate saying this because I think she is a terrific author and can do so much better. The main character, Blair, was a dizzy self absorbed women. Half of the book was spent focused on how beautiful Blair was and how everyone wanted to be like her. Linda Howard fans, save your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the most all-time stupid books ever written","review":"Stupid, characters not believable -- there is nothing good about it. It's an insult to readers everywhere. Linda Howard has written some decent books, but she must have been smoking crack when she wrote this."},{"rating":"1","title":"True Romance?","review":"I am a long time fan of Linda Howard. I was excited (as most fans are)when I saw her new book on the shelf. Let's face it. She is tried and true and you know what you are getting when you pick up one of her books. While I did enjoy aspects of the plot and the characters, the sizzle that is her trade mark is absent. Great plot, memorable charecters and smokin' love scenes are the reason we love Linda;implied love scenes can be left to another author.Her love scenes remind me of the Harlequins I read as a teen."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Disappointment!","review":"I'm not sure what's going on with Linda Howard, but this has got to be one of the worst books she's written in a long time. It was even worse than, Kiss Me While I Sleep, and I didn't think anything got worse than that.The 1st person account was \\"totally tacky,\\" especially as we didn't know what the hero (Wyatt) was thinking. The plot was boring and predictable, and the sex scenes (always Linda's best parts,) were just plain boring. I agree with a previous reviewer who mentioned that it read like a harlequin romance.The story did not read like a typical Howard story. It almost seemed like she wrote this story YEARS ago, but just decided to publish it. Take my word: Don't pay full price for it like I did. You may just want to borrow this one from your local library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save yourself! This is terrible","review":"I am normally a big fan of Linda Howard and her delivery of romantic suspense. Either her 13 yearold daughter got a hold of Linda's computer and submited a juvenile manuscript under her mother's name, or she has had a labotomy. The dialogue was valley girl-esque, the heroine a shallow, game-playing idiot and the hero was completely undeveloped. This book is to die for - you read it and you will want to kill yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Read","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. I laughed through a large part of it. I am someone who has always had a prejudice against cheer leaders. Linda Howard makes me think twice about my perceptions, while making fun of them. I'm looking forward to reading more books by her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Funny","review":"This is Linda Howard at her funniest. A heroine who has \\"ditzy blonde\\" down to a fine art, but who is actually smart as a whip...a hero who is constantly baffled, befuddled, and bemused by her. If you're from the South, don't miss this one: you'll see traces of your friends (yourself?) and family. The whodunnit is exciting, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated the first person outlook","review":"I really do like Linda Howard, but this book was not even good enough to finish. For one thing the first person point of view was terrible, and I found myself not even liking the main character, she REALLY got on my nerves! I mean, how can you read a book when you do not even like the main character?!? Sorry Ms. Howard, I have really liked your others, but I think next time I will have to check the ratings before I trust another of your books by sight alone."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment","review":"Normally I snatch up a new Linda Howard book and relish reading each and every word. But this is not what I've come to expect from the author of such jewels as Sarah's Child, Duncan's Bride and the MacKenzie series. Her \\"inner beach bunny\\"? Give this one a miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is there two Linda Howards?","review":"Maybe it's wrong to review something that you couldn't finish, but you should know that this is nothing like any Linda Howard book you've ever read. The first few paragraphs I thought maybe I was reading one of the characters personel journal. When I got to the second chapter and the first person POV didn't change any, I went to the back cover to see if this was really the same Linda Howard that I thought it was. I pushed through chapter three and just couldn't go on. It's a silly book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I didn't like the first person point of view that she uses in this one. The story was kind of lacking and the steamy sex that is characteristic of Linda Howard is missing . I have been a long time fan and this will be the first of her books that I will donate to charity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Howard's writing, hate the heroine","review":"I'm not sure how Linda Howard managed to write two books featuring this character - Blair Mallory. I've read half the book looking for some redeeming quality within Blair's vapid mind, and I finally give up. This is not to say that Howard isn't great. If you want to read some of her quality stuff, please read \\"Cry No More\\" and \\"All the Queen's Men.\\" Loved those books, and loved the people in them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not up to her usual standards","review":"This book was pretty bad. I have read other books by Linda Howard and they were great. The cover looked like it was a serious book with suspense. Instead, this was a silly, and unrealistic book. Also, the constant bickering between the main characters was very tiresome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another fun story from Linda Howard","review":"Have you ever read a book where you just instinctively KNEW how to figure out the main character right away? Well, in this story, you can pin down the main character in a few paragraphs: A cheerleader with brains and vanity.Despite that, the main character is a hoot. Her attitudes and mannerisms were just plain fun to read, and her past history with the police Lt. was brilliant. The constant bickering and playful banter made the romance come to life, while the thrill of the mystery surrounding who is trying to kill her comes across vividly.Linda Howard is all about incredibly detailed characters and fun plots. This story fits that bill well. I enjoyed it, and I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"To die laughing","review":"I loved this book, mainly because of the heroine's smart ass wit. I am very happy to see this female character step out from the cookie cutter virtuous heroines you become used to. She does not feel overly obligated to help those who wrong her. She seems to be a real strong person, caring and I love that. However, I wasnt happy about the hero in this book. Particularly his remarks about their sexual relationship and the no means no thing. hey if a woman is resisting your ass, take a hint and move on. That was the main chink in the chain for me, kinda pissed me off. But I love Linda Howard, she is one of the best alongside Anne Stuart, Judith McNaught(see Perfect)."},{"rating":"1","title":"First Person destroys interest","review":"Linda Howard is one of my favorite authors. I waited with excitement for To Die For to come out. After reading this book, I was so disappointed. I just couldn't get into the first person. It took so much away from the book that I really couldn't get into the main charaters. If you like the first person story line, you will probably like the book. For me it just didn't cut it. Sorry, Linda. Please go back to writing your books like After that Night, Mr. Perfect, Cry No More, Shades of Twilight, Dream Man, etc. I will just have to wait and see how the next one reads."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"I had enjoyed the last two Linda Howard books I read and was looking forward to an enjoyable read, but this book is a stinker. First the main character is annoying and since the book is written in first person, we hear her babble on so much. what she is eating how she exercises, her clothes.... blah blah blah I was actually hoping that she would be shot and killed. Second, there is no plot. Reading this book is tedious. Third, the \\"hero\\" is a macho cop who displays all the warning signs of an abuser. Being held against one's will is made into a romantic thing when it is sick.Linda Howard ought to be ashamed of herself for writing this."},{"rating":"2","title":"The book is a hoot!","review":"All I had to do was plug in Reese Witherspoon in \\"Legally Blonde\\" as Blair's character and the whole tone of the story was set.....right down to the 'Pebbles' hairdo.The best part was that LH had a character that believed that a man had to work for a woman.Steamy, funny, with just enough suspense and a super cool, romantic, sexy leading man. What more can a girl ask for?"},{"rating":"1","title":"He cranked my tractor?","review":"When I read that line I knew it was going to be downhill all the way. Is this really Linda Howard? If it is, it reads like an early manuscript that got rejected three dozen times and now that she's famous, oh, what the heck, let's publish it too. I couldn't even LIKE the heroine and the supposed hero never added up to much either. I kept reading because of my faith in Ms. Howard's ability to tell a story but sadly, this time my faith was not rewarded.He cranked my tractor? Yes, that line is really in the book. Enough said."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's Happened to Linda Howard","review":"I don't know what's happened to Linda Howard. Never the author of superior prose, her books were generally ok and fun to read. Lately, however, her writing reminds me of a high schooler's effort. Her dialog is almost embarrassing to read. I found myself skipping whole pages because I couldn't bear listening to the inane chatter from her heroine who seems to have no respect for herself. I loved Mr. Perfect and Son of the Morning. Maybe I just have to reread those and forget her new stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"No thumbs up for 'To Die For'","review":"I agree with another reviewer that the narrator of this book was annoying. Why the need to use a pseudo-southern accent? It just made the female character sound more vapid and unappealing. After the first tape, I decided enough was enough."},{"rating":"2","title":"One heck of a cheerleader","review":"I have to admit, there's not a character I thought I'd relate less to than Blair Mallory - the first-person heroine of this novel. She's a fitness-bunny, naturally blonde, and she coordinates her flip-flops with her underpants (which, DUH, coordinate with her outfit.).But she's just fantastic. Sometimes, the metaphors or statements she made (Yeah, and Napoleon's stint into Russia was a day trip) stretched at the edges. But overall, she's a great character.The plot is pretty good, but is definitely second string to the romance. The supporting cast are well drawn, and the denouement (I've always wanted to use that word, even if I can't spell it) didn't let me down.All in all, a great beach read. Too bad it's snowing here.(*)>"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth a second read","review":"I have to admit that when I first read this new novel by Linda Howard a couple of weeks ago, I was at first disappointed. It didn't seem to fit the usual style of books I've come to expect from my favorite author. However, I gave it a second look last weekend and took a little more time to really give the first person, bantering dialogue style another shot. Now this is one of my favorite Linda Howard books! It's fast paced, and intellectually interesting to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surprised by bad reviews","review":"While I didn't think this was Howard's best (that would be After the Night) I thought it was quite good. A real page turner. The focus was on the relationship as it should be in romance. I like 1st person point of view, but I think it is more challenging for the author. I'm not always sure about these humorous things. Sometime they seem forced or repetitive, but Howard manages it well. Seems to me the writers of the bad reviews didn't give it a chance and signed off too early. The ending was in keeping with the tone of the book, but I can see that those who are serious about action adventure would find it a bit flip."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Disappointment!!!!","review":"I'm not sure what's going on with Linda Howard, but this has got to be one of the worst books she's written in a long time.

You may just want to borrow this one from your local library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pathetic","review":"This book was a waste of my time, the author's time and anyone else involved in getting this book into print. Linda Howard has written some wonderful novels, so I kept reading, hoping things would improve. It's pretty sad when you start hoping the heroine DOES get killed. I liked the other characters, and liked the town, it was just the nitwit that I could have done without. If the point was to show that even a self-involved impressed-with-herself Southern princess deserves happiness, then the objective failed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpected Surprise","review":"Although LH has never written in the first person before, she did it fairly well here. I was able to pick up on the hero's emotions throughout most of the book. Blair was enjoyable, but perhaps resembled Stephanie Plum from that series a little too closely. Wyatt was a huge improvement from LH's last few books although he'll never be \\"Ranger\\" or \\"Morelli\\" from the above-mentioned Stephanie Plum stories. Since LH's last few books were so boring, my expectations were exceedingly low with this one (picked it up at the library) but I have to say that I was pleasantly surprised with this story. Perhaps LH is back on track."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great guy, annoying heroine","review":"I love all of Linda Howard's books, but this one is way down on my list. I found myself wondering what an intelligent guy like Wyatt was doing with this chick! She is a very annoying heroine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beyond Disapointing","review":"I was disappointed by Kiss Me While I Sleep; but this book just went too much in the opposite direction. It is fine for someone who is not used to the execellent quality that Linda Howard usually porvides in her novels. Until I regain confidence in Ms. Howard I will not purchase any more hard cover books by her; instead I will wait until the second hand paperbacks are available."},{"rating":"1","title":"To die from boredom","review":"Probably the worst Howard book that I've read. To Die For is pretty much a carbon copy of all those latest bestsellers about shopping addicts. The main heroine is annoying to the point when you really want her dead. She keeps repeating how she is so smart and great, but misunderstood as a dumb blond former cheerleader stereotype. However she acts and thinks exactly like one of those proverbal \\"dumb blondes\\". And that's besides her inability to say \\"no\\" to sex with the main male character, even though he behaves like a chauvinistic pig and she knows it.The plot is weak and totally cliche. Very disappointing. Not something I expected from Linda Howard at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disliked this book","review":"I couldn't even finish this book. It was just something about the main character and the way this book was written. I'm not a big fan of Linda Howard, though her book Dream Man was pretty decent."},{"rating":"1","title":"seriously lacking","review":"I was very dissapointed in this book. The main character is very hard to like at all. Annoying really. Half way through I wanted to stop reading, but I continued. I like most of her books, but this was definitely a dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"This story died a slow death!","review":"It took me 4 days to finish a Linda Howard book!!! I put it down time and time again. Unheard of! This story was so sophomoric I cannot believe Linda wrote it. But the Dedication gives a hint. A high maintenance friend who gave her the inspiration for the story.It was almost as bad as Janet Evanovich's co-written books. Awful! No way did it come close to her MacKenzie series. I did like \\"Cry No More\\". Wyatt just didnt do it for me this time.Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning the MP3 version is downright painful","review":"I just could not get through the audio version of this book. The narrators voice was irritating and painful. Her voice gave the impression that the Heroine? was a vapid, celf-centered narrow minded bimbo. And geez why does an author feel the need to take up 8 minutes in dialog on how the Heroine chooses what color of panty to wear that day? I kept listening hoping that something awful and paiful would happen to her.."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not at all what I expected....","review":"I love Linda Howard's books. I frequently read them repeatedly. There are only two now three, that I will not reread. When you read a James Patterson Book, you know what your getting, a first person narrative, but even he allows the other person's thought processes to be known. I found this book completely one sided (obviously after the first chapter). Granted, you have a little foresight into Mr. Bloodsworth's actions but it is superficial. I would have found the story more intriguing if she (Howard) wrote at her best. Filling all the pertinent characters with life, and charisma. The book, yes, had it's funny parts but, I found myself speeding through the thoughts sections of Blair, they were tedisious and repetitive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I Expected.","review":"If constant bickering is what you like reading about, this book is for you.I was thouroughly disappointed after the first 100 pages. The book felt cheaper to me, and I couldn't find the suspense after that.The book just does't hold a mature feel, and it read like the two main characters where still in highschool.The only way I'd recommend this is if you'd read avery other romance/suspense novel there is."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissappointing","review":"I agree that the last few Linda Howard books haven't been that great - no plot, or just plain boring, but the sex at least was hot and steamy and it made up for the horrible story, but her new book, To Die For had a really boring first person story and what the heck happened to her hot and steamy sex scenes?? She glossed over the sex like it was a Harlequin novel. I feel cheated!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I didn't buy it hardcover","review":"I normally really like Linda Howards books, but if I had read the first couple pages before I would have never bought the book. I hope her next one is better than this. The character is very shallow.

This is until Jan's 20-21st century saxophone weaves its way into this otherwise heavenly image. The sound quietly fades in out of nowhere and eventually drowns out the vocals. It then seems to meander in and out thoughout the rest of the song. If you like John Dowland meets Kenny G., this is for you. Otherwise, if you're looking for \\"pure\\" early music, you might want to stick with other Hilliard Ensemble music sans Mr. Garbarek."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tedium","review":"As an enthusiast of the Hilliard Ensemble, I was greatly disappointed by this early music / jazz \\"cross-over\\" album.

The saxophone completely destroys the intention of the music. While the player may be very talented in his own repertoire, he imposes his ego on this music, changing what should have been a transcendent spiritual experience into a showcase for his personal musical opinions.

This is my kind of escapist literature, which is scary, edgy, and disturbing in a charming way. \\"Trash Sex Magic\\" literally flirts with the reader. One minute you are laughing at the classic trailer trash speech patterns and environment (you can almost smell and touch it) and the next minute you are squirming in your chair because - well, the sex is magically hot. The characters are simple - until they are not, and you can't help but root for them (even the rather evil ones).

This book was entrancing right from the beginning, with its incredibly lyrical and sensuous language. It kept luring me in every night, keeping me up late reading it, until I finished, not unlike the characters are lured and sucked into irrevocable events and their fates.It has a mythical feel, almost fairy tale like, in the vein of the original Grimm Bros. tales, with a lot of mystical darkness in the mix. But it's not all dark either, there is lots of light, including the pleasurable words that seem to flow across the page and into your mind, painting wonderful word pictures.Having lived near the area where the book takes place, I can also attest that the author does a fantastic job of intertwining reality into this fantasy tale. The characters--human and animal--are as real as my own two hands.This book is truly something different and special, and the author has a fresh talented voice in a crowded literary fiction market.

What I hear in his music is a tasteful blend of \\"Kind of Blue\\" Miles, just enough bebop, and a bit more modern harmonies that are both hip and beautiful.

They might be on par with the $15 range of speakers, in sound quality. There's virtually no bass despite their claims on the box.

Some of the new versions here are markedly different (none more so, I feel, than \\"Corazon\\"), and fans who already own the EPs might find the changes jarring. Most are for the better, and in some cases (\\"Flight 180\\") are nigh-nonexistent.The album on a whole is excellent; full of catchy melodies and charming songwriting. The music is more minor-key than their debut, Charm School, but it's still recognizably Bishop Allen.

There is a self important smugness to Friend's writing that suggests a certain barrenness of Spirit, no matter how fertile the terrain he visits.

Repetition wouldn't be so bad if these looped beats were better -- more danceable perhaps. A solid groove to move to is a good justification for repetition in electronic music, but this isn't really a dancefloor album. Some reviewers suggest listeners approach it as a soundtrack. Well, unfortunately, there is no movie, and there are no visual images to prop this music up. As such, the album falls flat. To be fair, there is one standout track on here, entitled \\"Gone.\\" Holmes apparently knows its all he's got going for him, because over 1/4 of the album is \\"Gone\\" remixes. \\"No Man's Land\\" is also good, however, these two tracks can't justify the purchase in my opinion.

Sayao IS JULIETTE- ardent and tender with sadness when appropriate with a shimmering voice- she phrases like the great artist that she is- and she was physically beautiful.I saw Corelli twice in the role- he was exiting and looked the part - but really not in Bjoerling's league in this role.I prefer this opera to Gounod's more famous Faust.There are highlights of Romeo & Juliette with Bjoerling form a 1940 performance from Sweden where he is even better.

This album is completely the Erasure I missed. Sure, it's a bit melancholy, but you know what? Sadness sometimes inspires the greatest musicians to do their best work, and much of that is apparent here.

Never straying from the synth-pop path, Andy still sounds like an angel. Why not five stars? Well even the best can go a bit wrong sometimes. Admittedly there are times when a song or two won't sit too well, but hey thats ok! Erasure has been around so long that mistakes are easy to forget. I have nearly their entire discography and I can say good and bad about every album. Erasure is easy to listen to. They aren't around to make a huge polictal change, or to insult a certain group of people. They are simply here to make music for everyone to listen to. Take a moment to enjoy Erasure.

Nighbird is like reconnecting with old friends.For some reason something drew me to this album after not being interested in their work for 10+ years. I don't know if it's the HIV disease(no longer a death sentence mind you) that Andy has contracted or the top notch sequences from Vince, but there's something rather special about this album.For children of the 80's, it's time to rediscover a lost friend.

So, I bought Nightbird with extremely low expectations ... and was surprised at how much I liked the album. \\"Rocket to the Moon\\" is one of their best ever songs, while \\"Breathe\\", \\"No Doubt\\" & \\"Don't Say You Love Me\\" are solid, as well. Conversely, Tracks 5, 10 and 11 are really just awful. Seriously --- those three songs are embarrassingly bad, and I skip them every time I play the CD. I agree with an earlier reviewer that the intros, endings and especially the bridges are pretty disappointing. \\"Rocket to the Moon\\" is SO well done ... but the bridge is almost non-existent and has this goofy, \\"here-comes-a-spaceship\\" feel.

For first time Black 47 listeners, who maybe arrived at this CD via the companion book, my only wish is that this leads them further to that fountainhead of music which is the entire 15 year of work of Black 47. There are anthems throughout their many records, and with this new record, \\"The Day They Set Jim Larkin Free\\" joins the likes of James Connolly and Bobby Sands MP as a Black 47 anthem. Larry Kirwan's songwriting shares memories with the listener of earlier times in Ireland with a New York club scene feel.

Not only do you have to deal with oncoming hordes of zombies, but now you have another worry...being chased by a Nemesis that will come after you no matter what you do to try and stop it. The addition of Nemesis made this game one of the most enjoyable, and my favorite of the Resident Evil's. The addition to now be able to walk up stairs without pressing a button really did help way back when, though wondering how that was ever not a feature in the games is a bit of a puzzlement. And on the subject of puzzles, the only flaw this game has is the \\"water puzzle\\" near the end of the game. Only because it is totally random.

I can go all day and smell fantastic, and not worry about extra spritzing OR smelling, shall we say, less than fresh. A great buy.Don't forget to check out Clean's other scents if Provence doesn't strike your nose as quite what you were hoping for.

It's definitely not classic surf rock like The Ventures, or Satan's Pilgrims, and it's much smoother than Man or Astro-Man but with the same kind of reckless, fun vibe and static-charged twist on the traditional surf instrumental.I can usually listen to this record all the way through, but I don't typically replay it over and over the way I do with some surf records from the Moon-Rays, Satan's Pilgrims, or the Space Cossacks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Item pictured and described is not what is sent","review":"Item that is pictured is not what is sent.

When a new grammatical point is introduced, minimal exercises are provided which allow you to practice it, and most of those do not have an answer key. Tables of declensions and conjugations are provided in the back, but in the main text they are replaced instead by verbal explanations which often left me flipping through the pages trying to find the appropriate form. The dialogs and text selections are too numerous and complicated to absorb effectively. Intermediate-level students will find it a useful tool for review and additional learning, while casual learners will find it a place in the recycling."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly organized","review":"This book lacks a thorough description of grammar, choosing to selectively omit concepts when the author fiunds it too difficult to tackle.

When we used the effective carb count that the whey low product states on its packaging to figure carbs, his blood sugar shot up immediately. We have tried it several times with the same result. I have to conclude that this product is making false claims about effective carbs and being a low carb product. I won't be buying anymore. Sorry it took me so long to find out.

Maybe he thinks he has enough talent to be appreciated for his own skills. Maybe he wants to boost Brooklyn Zoo instead of capitalizing off of Wu's fame. Whatever his reason may be, he put together a pretty good album and featured some little known but talented rappers. I hate to admit it but \\"Got's Like Come On Thru\\" is one of the best tracks on the album. About Buddha himself: He has a cool voice, energetic style, and decent lyrics.

For me, Buddha Monk got a very rare thing that Guru once called 'the voice'. Like KRS-1 or Chuck D, he's got a deep and powerful voice that makes him unique in the rap game. It's a shame that the Buddha Monk doesn't get more attention and media coverage because he really deserves props and shows in this album an important potential yet to come. On the production side, quality control is, with a few exceptions, maintained, and you get a dark and paranoid vibe punctuated with heavy beats.If you love good hardcore Hip Hop made by people who got love for the game and true skills, do yourself a treat and pick this up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Headphone Commute Review","review":"In this electronic shoegaze album, a Genoa based post-rock band explores everything from glitchy beats to ambient vocal overlays. Currently consisting of five members, Port-Royal is a band that has rotated various members throughout the years, yet managed to keep a consistent sound. Listening to Afraid To Dance, one can soak in the sense of loneliness and a desire to wander through an early morning fog only to get lost among the oldest Italian streets. The music of Port-Royal incorporates carefully synthesized pads, dreamy space-rock guitars, and at times, distorted, solid beats, with arrangements swirling among transparent boundaries of one's mind, combining the ethers with oxygen, only to leave a slight trace of memory on the surface. Port-Royal is at the forefront of the movement that bridges the multiple modern genres together into an amalgam of what we can proudly call music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lisle 38850 pulley puller","review":"This puller was only used on a GM power steering pump pulley.

The old school graphics [stink] out the new feel of Resident Evil 2. It has been improved a little, but not enough to make a difference. The lack in graphics make the game less scary, making the point dull. Buy it if you don't have a PS1 or PS2. You won't find a big difference.

It's very well written and I think other long-time fans of Bruce will enjoy it, and how the Springsteen connection is treated. If you look at the author's website (beverlybartlett.com), she is clearly a devoted fan of Springsteen music, and it shows in this book. I'd recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book!","review":"I thought this book looked like it would be amusing, but it really surprised me. I laughed out loud at the way it made fun of modern royal watching, but it did so without disrepecting those of us who enjoy it. And the Springsteen angle was inspired. Anyone who has made a decision based on a song will appreciate that. The thing I wasn't expecting was the page-turning intrique that surrounds the princess -- once the plane crashes, I couldn't WAIT to find out what really happened.It's also a lot of fun trying to guess who the narrator is -- all in all, a fun read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"out of my genre","review":"I don't normally read this kind of book but with the interesting premise, I had to grab this. Lots of twists, and it should launch some discussions among Springsteen fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top-quality chick lit","review":"Princess Izzy and the E Street Shuffle is one heck of a fun read. On one level, it's a lighter-than-air, melt-in-your mouth confection. But this tasty treat offers up surprising substance as well. Like best-selling British author Anna Maxted, Bartlett writes chick lit with an intelligent voice that ever so deftly delivers a commentary on contemporary culture. It's this ability to surprise as well as delight, to deliver insights while dishing up a fun escapist read, that gives a satisfying heft to this confection of a book. This is one you'll remember long after you've finished the last page."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'd drive all night...just to forget this book","review":"I picked up 'Princess Izzy and the E Street Shuffle' because of my affection for the Boss. Even with my cursory knowledge of chick lit (and yes, as a female I'm in that demographic), it fell flat--way flat. I could see the author (sorry, the heroine) sighing over pretty much anyone else, but Bruce just doesn't seem to fit. It was downright painful at times to read how she (the author this time) took that conceit and twisted it into a supposedly clever plot device. So many chick-lit books are clearly 'Mary Sues,' and this is no exception; it's glorified fan fiction. Save your money and buy a Springsteen album. You'll definitely get your money's worth. He's the real deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Contrived","review":"I don't normally read chick lit, but I am a Bruce Springsteen fan, so I thought I'd check this one out. I found it to be contrived and over the top. The end of chapter \\"shockers\\" were trite and the whole thing was just basically kind of silly. The author's website even offers a Reader's Guide for this book. I don't think serious reader groups would discuss a chick lit book that has no real susbtance. While the writer does have a relaxed writing style, it doesn't help with the labored plot points. And how many more books are we supposed to stomach that are PINK? The bookstore shelves are a sea of these pink, too cutesy, \\"look at me I'm so hip\\" covers. Just because you are marketing to women doesn't mean we will only buy books with pink on them."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great item overall...","review":"This looks great and it was a steal for the price.

What I found really valuable was that Hillman describes the technical and creative mistakes he made when he was starting out. Hopefully I can avoid those pitfalls now that I'm aware of them. I'm already familiar with most of the technical issues that are covered, however I might have saved myself a lot of time and trouble if I'd read this book sooner.The projects he describes probably should have been included on a DVD with the book.

I use it every year. I get a certain perversive pleasure from doing my taxes.It is not extremely clear here.. but all this item does is let you load ONE state's tax forms on to your computer. You can just as easily--- no wait... MUCH more easily--- just download the program for the same (or a lower, if you look around) price and without the postage or the wait. I have to file in more than one state, so I took a chance on this product letting you utilize forms from multiple states, as its title and description seem to imply.

I paid more for this package than for the federal version because I thought I would have access to all the states that I needed. Very misleading!!

I won't do my taxes without either. But, I have to give the state version four stars (not five) because it lacks a lot of the help features that come with the federal version of the program. For example, in Massachusetts you have to break down interest and dividends for inclusion into various tax brackets (it's worse than the federal form) but TurboTax gives very little help in figuring out what goes where. (May be other state versions are more helpful). Still, it is a lot better than the pencil and paper method and one year my state may just include comprehensible instructions with their tax forms."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poor choice","review":"I purchased this book for my daughter (eight at the time) sight unseen.

This isn't the sort of book you buy to read once. It is the kind of book you buy to keep in your desk drawer and glance at periodically.

So they are not very healthy. I was pretty disappointed with this book and I'm sad to say I don't even use it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative, easy to use and well written.","review":"For me this book needed to have recipes & basic information that I can use...it does! The information it provides is considerably better than I hoped.Secondarily - the layout, the coated pages and the easy to flip spiraled pages make this really easy to use. In fact, it is more functional then most every other cook book I have ever seen.What I didn't need is read-ability, but this has that. One would expect an instructional guide to offer expertise and Shakespearen quality not required; but the author does have a likable, easy to follow style and is clearly a writer, not just someone that knows her way around a juicer.I should point out that this is the only juice book I have purchased so my comparison might be lacking."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book excites me!","review":"Having never juiced anything but citrus before and making smoothies i knew the transition might be intimidating. I purchased this book BEFORE purchasing the juicer (Breville 800JEXL) and the book WAS my inspiration. As others have said, it is laid out systematically and even some of the recipes have commentary to help you make the leap into more earthy concoctions, such as with beets.We have made about 15 of the recipes so far and are delighted each time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"This book was purchased for my mom as a health guru book. She informed me that she's been \\"juicing\\" for a long time but now this book gives her the ingredients to make the juicing address specific ailments.

I didn't know what ginger root was before and now I have to have it in almost every juice I make!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for Int. Juicers","review":"The only reason I am giving it a four is because I am spoiled by the other juice book by the same author---the one with pictures. Other than that, they are basically the same book and perfect for people who like to juice. What I like about this book is that it is plastic, wipeable material, which if you re like me, this kind of book is perfect because you can just wipe down the book with a paper towel if you say, have carrot juice explode everywhere. There are also A LOT of recipes. This book is no-non-sense, straight to the point, juice recipes. I appreciate that. I buy this book for everyone I know that wants to start juicing and everyone loves it. I actually owned the other Juice book until it was never returned and bought this to take it's place. Frankly, I find that I don't even miss the other version with pictures. Highly reccomended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this book!","review":"What a great little book! As a beginning juicer, this book was exactly what I needed to put our family on the road to better nutrition.

Highly recommended for not only its simple recipes but also for the attractive presentation."},{"rating":"2","title":"YUMMIE","review":"Healthy is in. But mixing up tasty drinks is not as easy as it sounds! I found this book super helpful. Plus you can edit as you wish; ad more or less. The recipes make great smoothies and fruit drinks.

An excellent assortment of juices and smoothies to enjoy whether for health or just pure pleasure. The book is so well organized and indexed that it makes finding whatever you're looking for a breeze. It gives healthy detoxing recipes and samples of cleansing weeks, etc. Every recipe has a rating system for energy, immunity, etc. A \\"plus\\" is that it's truly a pretty picture book! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Bummer.","review":"Well, I knew it wasn't going to be the same with Ville on vocals. I don't like Sentenced, so I hoped he would emulate Juha-Pekka Leppäluoto's voice. He didn't. It bugs me. Knowing this, I tried to get into Charon (J. P.'s voice is what I adore about Poisonblack). However, Charon's songwriting isn't dark enough to support J. P.'s voice! So, unfortunately, \\"Escapexstacy\\" is all that appeals to me from this group of Finish artists. This one was a disappointment, sonically. I love the lyrics, but I miss the powerful vocals."},{"rating":"1","title":"","review":"This is lightweight stuff, alterna-pop music disguised under the Metal banner. Poisonblack continues to be a more an accessible unit that strongly employs melody in every aspect of the music-from the clean vocals to the constant keyboard passages. People have compared them to Sentenced in the past, and while said band is even softer in their musical delivery and pretty much overated, Poisonblack injects a bit more of life into their songs. It doesn't really help their cause, though. You'd have to be a follower of the rock-oriented bands of the Metal genre to really like what this band has to offer. Just don't call it Metal, as it gives a misinterpretation of the whole genre as a whole."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Polished and Well Produced","review":"Though many of the bands compared to H.I.M. sound similar, Poisonblack does separate itself a bit in the fact that the songs have enough interesting things in them that I still listen to the album regularly a year later. They sound much more like Charon, which seems to have a stronger following, but at least the album \\"The Dying Daylights\\" doesn't last as long (for me) as does this record. There is a more diverse range of tempos compared to that Charon record and the guitar solos stand out much more. Not quite as dark sounding as Charon, but they sound more like Ozzy and Sabbath at times, which I like alot.Two types of albums I give 5 stars to: Ones that are very blazingly new sounding, or albums that I can still listen to a year later. This one is the latter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Release, but...","review":"This doesn't really sound like Poisonblack, probably due to Ville taking over vocals... which isn't a bad thing for a huge Sentenced fan like myself. However from a purely Poisonblack perspective, I find \\"Escapexstacy\\" to be a superior release. If you're looking for something a bit more like that one, I'd recommend \\"Songs for the Sinners\\" by Charon featuring the same singer.That said, \\"Lust Stained Despair\\" is a strong release. The tracks that stand out most to me are \\"Love Controlled Despair\\", \\"Rush\\", \\"Raviotar\\" and \\"The Darkest Lie\\". I was a bit put off initially by the first track, \\"Nothing Else Remains\\". This is the worst track on the CD in my opinion, although it isn't a bad song on it's own per se. I'm giving this one 4 stars. It's very good, but I'm left feeling a little... Hollow as Poisonblack once put it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sentenced part 2...not Poisonblack","review":"The title says it all. This is mostly dark, power metal in the same category as Sentenced. I know V. Laihiala was that bands singer, but he should stick to writing and playing those awesome heavy groove laden riffs like the debut cd Escapexstacy. His raspy vocals do not, in my opinion, convey the lyrical content he has written. The lyrics are in the same line as that first cd, and there are moments like \\"Raivotar\\" that show why his debut was awesome. Bring back the original band, re-record this (J. Kukkonen and J.P. Leppaluoto are part of the soul to that first release) or give me my money back. There is some great playing here, and the artwork is great. If you like Sentenced, raspy vocals do not bother you, and cannot get enough of lead guitar licks from times past.....then by all means buy this. But this, to me, is not Poisonblack."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never heard the first album","review":"I really like this album. Metal heads have a bad tendancy to sub catagorize everything and if it isn't in a sub category then they hate it. Well this is like that it's just a Metal CD not too light not to hard. Just good guitar and drum work with good vocals and good songwriting."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's just not the same...","review":"Remove the vocals and the style is there. It is unmistakenly Poisonblack. But add the vocals (no longer those of Leppäluoto) and what we once knew as Poisonblack is gone.This CD has some great guitar work and some catchy riffs, but Leppäluoto's voice is what made the first CD so great. Now we have Poisonblack style with Sentenced vocals -- it's just not the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good on theory, good samples to start out with","review":"With this book, without any previous socket knowledge, I was able to write a functioning socket application for downloading instrument data from a ticker server...however, when it came to a crunch, the samples provided with the Windows SDK were more useful than this book. Still a good book, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"ernest harts german shepherd book","review":"ive owned shepherds all my life and worked them in the army. this is by far the best,most comprehensive info on shepherds i have ever come across. as a breeder i recommend STRONGLY to my customers that they get this book and not only read it, but study it as a reference tool for the rest of their lives. i cant rate this book any higher. sincerely, Jim Michaels"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not D'Nealian","review":"This book is not very good because it doesn't have that many practice pages, there is basically just one line of cursive on each page.

I read your review and it made me go back and listen to this. I've changed my rating from 3 stars to 4. This is an album I've always admired a hell of a lot--just didn't really enjoy listening to it all that much. It's like Pink Floyd, King Crimson and Radiohead wrapped into one. It's not as \\"neoprog\\" as Spock's Beard or The Flower Kings --too much influence from the 90's. And the tunes don't exactly grab you, but they do sneak up. It's loud, meaty, sometimes harsh, occasionally lyrical - a beautiful piece of work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Radio Head, Pink Floyd, oh man","review":"All I have to say is that this album is so relaxing. i have it in my playlist next to Opeth and Dying Fetus. This is defintely a good album to get especially if you like Radio Head, Floyd, and Opeth. For some reason they all just blend together. Also Bright Eyes goes with it in some way. If you're a stoner you'll understand.Get this album, you won't regreat it at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wont heal given time","review":"I dont have much to add to a number of excellent reviews others have already penned for this album. However, I'd like to draw attention to the immaculate production, courtesy of Steven Wilson. He's evidently a perfectionist, and listening to the dense, layered soundscapes on this album it's hard to blame him. Check out the wall to wall melodies and luscious harmonies on the excellent \`Lips of Ashes', the super cool guitar tone throughout \`Wedding Nails', the crystal clear acoustic guitars on \`Trains' or the cathartic, emotive strings on \`Collapse the light into earth'.Every song here is a winner, thanks to impeccable songwriting, production, and playing. Gavin Harrisons tight, hard hitting, deceptively complex drumming is an inspiration. This really is an album for the future. Highest possible recommendation."},{"rating":"2","title":"...what?","review":"I heard about this CD indirectly from one of the guitarists from my favorite band, Peter Lindgren of Opeth, and was interested by what he had to say about Steven Wilson of Porcupine Tree. \\"How bad could it possibly be?\\" I asked myself. May i be burned at the stake for ever doubting such musical mastery. \\"In Absentia\\" is absolutely incredible. For some reason though, PT fans are apparently displeased when PT is compared to Pink Floyd. Guys, get over it! Yes, in many ways they're distinctly different but the musical ingenuity had me thinking of \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" the entire time i listened to it! I simply lack the articulation and brainpower to really describe how good this CD is, so just do yourself the favor of buying it, and by buying it, you do me the favor of knowing there's at least one more person in the world who has witnessed such brilliance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overblown","review":"Porcupine Tree finally has made it to the major leagues, and the technical side of \\"In Absentia\\" reflects that. The sound is crisp and booming (credit engineer Paul Northfield), but the soul is missing from the songs.It appears that Steven Wilson has had a field day in the studio, for every track on \\"In Absentia\\" is littered with excessive effects. (The tired \\"voice on the telephone line\\" effect is used on at least three songs alone!) The effects detract from anything that Steven Wilson might be trying to say -- either lyrically or musically.If you're new to Porcupine Tree, check out \\"Lightbulb Sun\\" or \\"Stupid Dream\\" for the band's melodic side and \\"The Sky Moves Sideways\\" for their prog side instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Four stars and growing...","review":"I've listened to this four times so far, and each time it grows a little more on me. This is my first PT CD. After the disappointing (to me) Spock's Beard release of \\"Snow\\" I decided to give the prog music a rest for a while Then I stumbled on this, and was impressed by the reviews, and decided to give it a shot.It just keeps getting better. The lyrics are sometimes hard to understand, which hurts the CD a little, because there are some really nifty lines. The music goes down a variety of paths, sometimes heavy and modern, sometimes light and retro. Most of the music is done with a deft touch, only occasionally is it overbearing or artsy for art's sake. One thing that impresses me is how the whole album is good; this is a CD you can listen to all the way through and not get bored with. In another few weeks, it may be a five-star review for me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliance, run to the store and by this album today.","review":"I had never heard of PT before, I saw that it was CD of the year on IGN and blind bought it.

I actually saw them live too. In Absentia is a pretty good progressive rock album that can be compared as a blend between Pink Floyd and The Cure. Sounds pretty good huh? But dont mistake it as only being that. The transitions in the songs are done really well. The crisp and gentle sound of the acoustic guitar along with some really ambeint keyboards is a real treat to listen to. Stephen Wilson's gentle voice and soothing lead guitar is an added plus. I wish this band was bigger than the crap MTV and VH1 feeds us.Highlight in this album: Trains"},{"rating":"2","title":"read my somewhat tame review","review":"One reviewer hit the nail on the head: a lot of folks sure do \\"blowhard\\" about this group. While I'm giving this album a deserved 5 stars, my review is certainly tame compared to some and you won't catch me saying things like \\"best album ever\\" or \\"perfection\\" or anything even remotely close to that.What I will say however is that this is a very solid collection of good music. There's nothing here that blows my mind, but the melodies and rhythms are complex enough to keep me interested from the perspective of being not only a jazz listener but a musician myself. The playing and the writing are both very good and the production quality is excellent.I'm into it. This is my first album of theirs and I'm likely to check out the rest in the next few weeks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good intro into progressive","review":"Being a metal head i heard about this band on the opeth cds i own. deffinatly a good cd and i don't like a lot of prog out there (dream theater is yucky to me). one of my main gripes with alot of music in this genre is the voice of the singer. I love this guys voice not to high pitched and the accent comes through just alittle. Good prog for people who like metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome, prolific, accessible...let me fetch my dictionary..","review":"I had actually gone into the music store looking for something else entirely - they didn't have it, so I picked up In Absentia instead (having heard of PT briefly in the late 90's), and I was blown away. The band's sound has become quite accessible, while retaining the complex, multi-leveled lyrics that had interested me in the first place.Simply put: This is an awesome CD. Worth every last dollar. The video is pretty wicked too. ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"5 stars is not enuff!!","review":"It's been a while since I have heard an album that I just can't get enuff of. New prog at it's absolute best. The album at times rocks loud ala Dream Theater, without overdoing it,but also has the most amazing vocals and harmonies that stick in your brain. Short songs that are very accessible to the point of being- pop? Naw I didn't say that. Anyways this cd belongs to anyone who appreciates prog or britpop or just plain good music.A must buy for 2002."},{"rating":"2","title":"At it's Best.... alternate creativity!","review":"Just saw them 7/8/2003 LIVE at the Twilight in Tampa, FL. Excellent performance and great choice of songs. This IS the MOST ORIGINAL Band out there, there is similarities but no comparison to other groups.

Amazing guitars, Fresh/original melodies, great vocal ranges, also song lyrics are really really good!Everything you could ask for...very fun but mature music.

This recording kind of took me by surprise its alot heavier than the early Porcupine Tree that I am use to and its also very progressive , kind of like blending Threshold with Spocks Beard but even better again. Its also very ambient I would recommend this CD for anyone into prog rock and prog metal this band have come a long way since the sky moves side ways. This recording has a great balance of light an shade and plenty of emotion , give it a go i think you will be surprised just how good it is."},{"rating":"2","title":"best band I've discovered this year","review":"Yes I'm new to this band, so I can't tell you how this disc compares to their previous releases. The quick-and-dirty take on these guys is that they are Yes for the new millennium, with a darker mood and a metal edge. But there's lots more to them than that. What stands out about them is how they juxtapose so many different elements, over the course of the CD, and in individual songs. You might hear bits that remind of Pink Floyd or Sense Field, and guitar solos that bring to mind Jeff Beck or Alan Holdsworth. You'll find beautiful ballads punctuated by metal riffs, futuristic mechanical noises, full-on instrumental metal romps, mesmerizing storytelling, and a hymnlike closer. This album will transport you from your day-to-day world. Intriguing, irresistible, highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of PT's greatest - vinyl pressing amazing","review":"I'll leave the music review to someone else... but I wouldn't have bought this on vinyl if I didn't think it was amazing. :)The vinyl pressing of this album sounds exceptional. So many new records today are very poorly engineered, but this was a pleasant exception. The sound is full and clear, bass is perfectly balanced -- there's no distortion or mistracking that I've been able to hear. The dynamics going from soft, acoustic to loud bass and drums is flawless. Being very familiar with the DVD-A copy of this, there's nothing lost at all. It has all of the fullness and presence of a high-quality digital recording and all of the warmth and organic sound of vinyl.One of the best new vinyl purchases I've ever made."},{"rating":"2","title":"My new favorite band","review":"This is one of the most creative, entertaining CDs I've heard since the 60's. At times it reminds me of Pink Floyd, Jethro Tull, Led Zeppelin, Crosby Stills and Nash, and Joe Satriani. I can't stop listening to this CD. It's been a long time since I was stuck playing just one. If you like progressive rock the first 6 and last song are essential songs in your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best PT album","review":"I've got several different copies of this cd for extra tracks etc. It's rare that I would buy different versions, but this is simply a great album. Gotta say, however, the band would be better if they had a \\"real\\" bassist. Nothing imaginative in the bass area that would make the band even better. Great drummer. No doubt that Gavin Harrison is the most professional of the bunch, but a drummer PT doesn't make. The rest of the music is driven by sheer and powerful songwriting and a great mixture of the hard rock song and softer melodies. Definitely their best album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soild CD. Great Drumming.","review":"I heard of Porcupine Tree by watching Gavin Harrison on a Modern Drummer Drum Festival DVD. Harrison is amazing and he plays some Porcupine Tree material for his set on the DVD. So I decided to to pick up this CD for the track \\"The Sound of Muzak\\". Overall, the CD is solid stuff if you like Tool, Pink Floyd inspired prog rock. Not as heavy as your typical Tool track, but very melodic and fantastic drumming. They have a ways to go I think but this is definitely worth picking up, not only for the drumming, but as a good effort all around. If you like good melodic prog rock, I would check these guys out."},{"rating":"2","title":"In Absentia, porcupine tree","review":"A good, solid Prog Rock Album with a bit of an edge. I like Deadwing a little better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just brilliant!","review":"I love Dream Theater, Opeth, and many other older progressive bands. As I have gotten older my love for progressive music just continues to rise. I have read about Porcupine Tree quite a bit but never went and bought anything from them for fear I wouldn't like it or would have to \\"try\\" to like it. A friend of mine who always gives good recommendations told me to buy this cd. I did and after 5 listens and some time to get to know it, I can honestly say this is a masterpiece in writing. There is so much brilliance here I don't even know where to begin. I will just tell you to buy it and experience it for yourself. Then you will know. I knew I was going to like it after one listen, but after a few listens I began to love it. Highly recommmended for complex, creative writing and an effortless listen. I can't wait to check some of their other stuff out."},{"rating":"2","title":"good music, really dumb band name","review":"One of the fun things about being a pretentious metal nerd is observing how Opeth and Porcupine Tree influence each other. If you listen closely, it is obvious when Steve Wilson enters the Opeth scene in \\"Blackwater Park\\"; remember \\"Patterns in the Ivy\\"? And of course the whole \\"Damnation\\" album is taking its cues from the Porcupine, as are songs like \\"A Fair Judgment\\" on the \\"Deliverance\\" album.Well, Steve Wilson picked up a few tricks of his own from Opeth. I chuckled to myself when I heard some of the familiar Opeth chord progressions worked into songs like \\"Gravity Eyelids\\" and whatever track 6 is called. The result of this Porcupine + Opeth cocktail makes for a great alternative hard rock record with some definite heroin moments, (see the Cult of Luna review).Think of it this way: it's an Opeth CD that still rocks but that you can play around your normal friends without them saying \\"Oh my God...\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Pass up that TMV crap, this is REAL prog rock.","review":"I'm glad I got into this band. This is a masterpiece of progressive rock. Steven Wilson is nothing short of a genius. He is an able songwriter, can sing, play guitar, play bass, and play keyboards. It's a shame bands like this are overshadowed by false prog rock like The Mars Volta. Many great tracks will await you, but my personal favorite at the moment is Blackest Eyes. The fact that this band is also affilated with Opeth and Dream Theater makes them even better. Check out all 3 of these bands(as well as the upcoming side project between Mikael Akerfeldt, Steven Wilson, and Mike Portnoy). Don't check out The Mars Volta or Coheed(their song Welcome Home is a big ripoff of Led Zeppelin's Kashmir)."},{"rating":"2","title":"In Absentia - Porcupine Tree","review":"In the first few moments of Porcupine Tree's major label debut, I found myself afraid that the band had forsaken its traditional sound for something else. But \\"Blackest Eyes\\" quickly settled into more familiar territory. The rest of In Absentia followed.Similar to previous efforts, Stupid Dream and Lightbulb Sun, In Absentia showcases the songwriting ability and musical talents of Steve Wilson and crew. The music is atmospheric with soaring guitars, excellent bass and keyboard work, and huge drums. As usual, vocal harmonies are plentiful.There is a slightly harder edge to some of the songs and a greater sense of whimsy in a few instances but these elements add to, not distract from, the overall focus of the album. All-in-all, this is another great album from Porcupine Tree."},{"rating":"2","title":"awsome blade","review":"You should get this blade if you wont to win.So get this bladeand win you have to get this if you are a big max fan from the show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Draciel","review":"I'm a rookie blader, so this review probably won't be as good as some others, but eh.

The author makes a lot of statements but doesn't back up many of them with facts.His second book, \\"Black Diamond II\\" is much better as it concentrates on KISS collectibles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth A Dime","review":"Nothing in this book is new. If you read enough articles on the band you would have the exact same information provided by Dale Sherman, who happens to be just an average writer in the first place. There's also a negative tone to this book as if Sherman was angry at the band when he wrote the book, and instead of coming across as insightful, he instead comes across as petty.If you're going to spend your money on a book about KISS, it would be better to buy one by someone who was either there or spent the time actually doing some credible research. \\"KISS AND SELL,\\" and \\"Kiss: Behind The Mask,\\" are both better books to spend your money on. Of course if you'd rather give Dale Sherman your money that's fine, and in the meantime I have some swampland in the Mojave Desert I want to sell you..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book ever written on the rock group KISS.","review":"This was one of the best books about KISS I've ever read.

His alleged conspiracy theory is generally of the same order as most conspiracy theories throughout history: paranoid, fanatical, and blind. It would match well with \\"The Protocol of the Elders of Zion,\\" a notorious anti-Semitic forgery. If this book had been written about any other faith in America, it would have been condemned as bigoted.

At least, it gives me a valid basis for commenting.In his writing, Wood never takes a breath, or any other pause for serious reflection. He manifests no rational evaluation of competing thoughts on any page of the text; he merely spews a haphazard series of diatribes.

The financial power base of the church tends to be glossed over and this chapter alone makes it worth picking up a copy to read. However, it should be noted the author seems like he carries a lot of baggage from his LDS days. The book could have been half as long taking out the repetitive sections and the long-winded rants from other disaffected ex-members. Those in Utah and surrounding states have the culture described in the book, but the further out into the missionary field the church culture is not so stridently all encompassing of members' lives and more nearly matches mainstream American culture."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought it was satire!","review":"Reading this book, I began to think that it was meant to be satire.No one realy believes this conspiracy stuff, do they?

As Dr. Wood repeatedly asserts, the LDS church's agenda is -- at best -- questionable, and -- at worst -- unseemly. Although I found his claims consistent w/ some of my observations, there are other books that temper Dr. Wood's rant-like writing style with cold, objective, fact presentation. Two such books are Brodie's \\"No Man Knows My History\\" and Abanes' \\"One Nation Under Gods\\". I gave Dr. Wood's book two stars simply because the book does not reflect the writing style of someone w/ a Ph.D. A cursory edit of the manuscript prior to publication could have gone a long way!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you are anti-Mormon, pro-hatred and false information... this is the book for you.","review":"It is interesting to me that in this day and age, people feel justified in the blatant bashing of another's religious beliefs. This kind of bigotry would never be tolerated against any other religion or people. I am deeply saddened by the writers and publishers of this and other hate-filled books and by all those who endorse them. The reader will find little to no accurate information on Mormonism in this book- a writing that is clearly based on an anti-Mormon agenda. For ACCURATE information about the Mormon church (or The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints, as it is properly called) try reading something that is actually written BY them and not AGAINST them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Book","review":"I am so happy I found this book; I was trying to find a book like this for years. When I got this book I couldn't stop reading and still haven't. I got this book because it gives you a simple layout into the truth of exactly what the Mormons are doing and what Mormonism is actually about. It is a really simplified book about the details of Mormonism. Allot of people don't know what Mormonism is about, what the people are like and what happens to them when they get involved. This book tells you how the Mormon religion was designed and created, along with what it does to people who get involved. A part of this book I really liked is that it tells you what actually happens to people when they decide to leave Mormonism. I hope everyone can discover what the Mormons are plotting to do, and through getting and reading this book I now know, and all of my friends will as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misrepresentation","review":"I only read the introduction to this book, but what I read was ridiculous. Several aspects of 'Mormonism' (not its' true name) are severely misrepresented by the author, obviously NOT an expert in this area. I compare it with politics - if you want to understand the Democrats' stand on an issue, don't ask the Republicans - they will only have dirt to throw. I think a lot of people should think for themselves on things like these instead of accepting anything they see with a cover - we should be very wary of authors such as Wood who only seek to incite people against each other. Read it if you like, but in finding several inconsistencies in the introduction alone, I would caution you to not blindly accept this. Use your own God-given sense of reason and study it using other sources and compare this sharply inflammatory book with others that are more moderate - otherwise you'll be carried along with the author to conclusion that are not true."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"If you are looking for tips to improve your writing, look elsewhere.The 'instructions' could all fit on one page and consist of such helpful hints as \\"choose your voice, point of view, and setting...the choice is entirely up to you\\". \\"Write a rough draft...\\" \\"Edit your draft for logic, clarity, and plausibility.\\" \\"Continually read excellent fiction.\\"The section of exercises is simply a list of 20 topics with this instruction: \\"Write a very short story about one of the following:\\"The glossary is less than two pages long and has no examples.I was expecting each story to have an introduction that told me why it is a masterpiece and what to look for.

Many typos and contradictions makes one onder how throughly this book was proofread. Further, many topics are simply a rehashing of a number concepts covered in other books of the same publisher, such as the osi model. These topics are not on the exam and serve only to waist the time of anyone interested in the material on the exam.

'Down With Wilco' is as great a listen now as it was 4 years ago.

He tells a sweet and sugary account of Bear's storied life, and leaves out the true tales of Bear's excessive drinking and also of his extra marital adventures.

I think Bryant was an outstanding coach, but you'll have to look elsewhere if you want any REAL enlightenment about the life and times of Bear Bryant....."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Anecdotes, poor flow","review":"The book is a bunch of short stories on Bear Bryant that have no logical / chronological flow. Tough being a college football fan who wants a better appreciation of Bear Bryant and can't get into it. Some of the stories the author does not even finish, sort of sets you up for the punch line without the punch.

But boy, was I disappointed.It was said that the author Dawn Reno had composed a heart rending narrative.Talk about misleading the buyer. What a joke! I wasn't remotely touched by what I read.The story was under-developed in some enormously significant places.Edmonia was accused of murder, and a few sentences later, she was exonerated.Reno neglected to show Edmonia agonizing over her fate. There was no trial. Nothing.And worse than poor development, and a story that lacked depth, Reno's prose was as flat as three day old Pepsi. I realize that the story was written for young readers, but that is no excuse for drab writing.The book was a waste of money. I'd been better off donating the cost of the novel to a worthwhile charity."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Resource","review":"Johnson takes the reader through a method of Biblical exegesis and analysis that includes looking at all passages of Scripture in the terms of their historical setting, what did they mean to their historical audience, and what do they mean for us today. His gift to the discussion is his illustrations of various interpretations of New Testament passages in light of the Judeo-Roman War and destruction of the Temple, as well as the persecution of the early Christians. His approach is one of asking fundamental questions, and reminding us that if something looks kind of fishy (like \\"herds of swine\\" when pigs don't congregate in herds) should draw our critical thinking to deeper meanings of the text. A good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"one hit wonders","review":"i bought this lp 4 no pigeonz xpectin there to be otha good stuff on here. but o was i in 4 a surprise. it was simply horrible.cheapskate was the only othere song i could manage to listen to. sporty thievs are not lyricists and cannot pick beatz whatsoever. i'll admitit maybe this review is a bit harsh but they trul deserveit. they're a disgrace to rap. they remind me of the queer weird al yankovic jockin off otha songs. do urself a favor.

I saw this TV for sale in a Circuit City ad. Only $899. I inspected it. The tv looked OK, not as good as the other models like the DLPs. I was all set to buy it until I came back a day later and on closer inspection, I noticed that the TV was displaying the colors off and creating a ghost image of everything in red, yellow and blue. That looked terrible. I tried fixing the colors on it but to no avail. The sales rep at the store tried selling me the floor model for about $100 less and adding a warranty in; that just really confirmed my belief that this TV has major problems. This TV is big, bulky, presents horrible color and not worth the money. Save your money and go for a DLP TV. Although slightly more expensive, they are worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Movie ruined by stupidity of main characters","review":"This movie was extremely disappointing. How many horror movies have been ruined because the main characters make stupid decisions over and over? Although this film had tons of potential, I found myself spending most of its duration saying, \\"Why are you doing that?\\" or \\"How can you be so dumb?\\" The writing is lazy. Rather than the characters getting caught up in realistic conflicts, the horror continues only because they can't remember to hold on to a weapon, they hide in stupid places, or they trust those who they obviously should not trust. Skip this one; it will only make you mad."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Nasty Little Gem!","review":"I did not expect much from this movie when I purchased it, but it completely blew me away. WOW!

The \\"Chav\\" sub-culture puts American bullies to shame as these kids are virtually primal in their vengeance. The sociopathic leader was especially numbing to watch when he used his friends and, essentially, blackmailed them all into extreme acts of viciousness.

Tell me again why he's so popular. In the first 10 minutes it was clear to see there was nothing new or interesting here. Incredibly stupid scenarios. The violence is tough and gritty, but still falls flat because the acting is so lousy and scene after scene is just too lame to be even remotely believable. In other words, a typical horror story. The \\"victims\\" were annoying saps, and the pack of kids, while vicious, still lacked the credibility to be viewed as anything other than brainless. I wanted to like this, but it's tough to find a decent movie with all the required elements in this genre. After reading the positive reviews, all I can say is, \\"What is wrong with you people anyway? There are movies head and shoulders above this.

The top half of the plug is 2 feet long only, causing the bulky power supply rectangle to hang in the air if you place your HD on your desk. This pulls on the part of the plug that into the enclosure down and because of this angle, the slightest tap to the wire causes the power to disconnect and then reconnect again, and as any other electronic, powering on/off repeatedly is BAD for the machine and causes data corruption.

As if one great guitarist wasn't enough, John Scofield makes Sco-Mule one of the best tracks on the c.d. and Derek Trucks on slide guitar makes Worried Down With the Blues another great track. Haynes also shows off his considerable song writing ability on Soulshine (soon to be a classic and covered by many other bands), On The Banks of the Deep End, and Beautifully Broken, all absolutely beautiful songs.

The tracks lack intimacy and warmth, both in the performance and in the recording.These guys don't really understand the blues, so don't buy this album if you're looking for good blues or blues rock. GM's resident guitarist plays OK but lacks passion and more than that he lacks his own style - he plays like a good studio guitarist. The two flashes of brilliance on this album are both provided by guest guitarists, Derek Trucks and John Scofield. I played this CD twice and found it so predictable it wasn't necessary to put on ever again ...I much prefer the Black Keys or Jon Spencer Blues Explosion for a fresh approach to white blues rock.

Since then, he has collaborated with many top guitarists like Jeff Beck, Al Di Meola, Neal Schon etc. In 1984, Jan had a great opportunity to score for Miami Vice which he did with great style & flair to match the ever-popular TV series. Now, for the first time, the entire musical score has been brought out in a 2 CD format. Disc 2 is unreleased material mostly re-worked by Jan. The music stands out superbly. Jan's playing is unsurpassed. Definately if you are inspired by TV/FILM music or are a fan of Jan's music, pick this one up. You won't regret it !"},{"rating":"2","title":"The soul of \\"Miami Vice\\", the spirit of our times","review":"In obvious as well as subtle ways, the prescient and still timeless \\"Miami Vice\\" explored the darkness and tragic spirit that is America. In today's post-9/11 world that rots at its core from corruption, duplicity---covert and overt---Jan Hammer's compilation comes at an ideal moment. Let us remember the TV program that dared show us how things were, and still are. This is the music of not only that time, but this time."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best From Jan Hammer!!","review":"From one of the '80s best television shows is the Ultimate Miami Vice music collection!! Jan Hammer commented that he composed three possible selections for the Miami Vice theme, and the people liked the first selection best! This is truly \\"The Complete Collection\\" from The Original Miami Vice Theme to Turning Point. Many of the songs on the first CD could be found buy purchasing various Miami Vice Soundtracks and Jan Hammer CDs, but the second CD has songs that I could not find on any other CD. This is a definate MUST HAVE for any Miami Vice fan, or if you're just a fan of Jan Hammer's instrumental music. Again, a great CD set and I'm glad Jan Hammer finally released it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Gripping","review":"Anyone who has seen even one episode of Miami Vice can recognize just how instrumental the score to that show is. This double-disc sets brings that all back. No other show before or since could give you such a forboding feeling as Crockett & Tubbs cruise along the canals and beaches at four in the morning. Top down, butterflies in their stomachs, not speaking a word. There is so much here that's more than necessary, but it all becomes essential as soon as you hear it. Even the calypso/carribean pieces have such a gritty edge to them. Tangerine Dream or Vangelis are the only ones who could score a length of film this well. And Jan Hammer outdoes even them on this abundant set. If you love driving, atmospheric music, you really can't get much better than this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flashbacks from the 80's hit series Miami Vice!","review":"When i first watched this television hit series ,i was immediatelly struck when i was listening to its soundtrack.A fresh breeze of music.

This album reminds me of the big hair metal bands of the 80's complete with the hard throbbing sound of the Rods/ Whitesnake etc. plus some of the token metal ballads. Amazing stuff. Made me flashback 25 years. Anybody got a liver they aren't using? I was partial to \\"Dreamer of the Night\\" with the gaps in the intro. This is one of my \\"snob\\" metal albums I play to impress steel heads and let them guess who it is. Metal heads can't go wrong with this. No filler tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Melodic Metal!","review":"This album is amazing! It's no wonder Inner Wish is touted as the best metal band of Greece. I didn't even realize they made metal over there! I was pleasantly surprised after stumbling on their music on youtube, and sought out a couple of their albums- this being one of them. They aren't all fast driving epic songs like Dragonforce, but as with them, there's no screaming or growling, and the emphasis is on the music and the lyrics, as it should be!Yes, there are a couple lines that don't quite sound right, but taking into a consideration that English isn't their native language, they do an absolutely amazing job- and if you're familiar with metal at all, you're used to quirks like that and overlook them to really enjoy the excellent sounds that you just can't find very often in mainstream music. Hoping for more from them in the future!"},{"rating":"1","title":"where is the first movement??","review":"While it may be a great recording, the absence of the first movement means that for me it cannot be a first choice for this wonderful symphony.

Lots of verbage too. I don't need 5 lines of text explaining why the author chose to use an underscore as part of the name of the folder he created, or a whole page dedicated to the installation status bar.

If you like a VERY firm wrist rest, you'll love it, but I personally find it too hard, hence the four stars instead of five. It does provide relief from the hard edge of my desk, and it is the perfect height for today's flatter keyboards, but I prefer a softer wrist rest with more of a pillowy feel.PROS:InexpensiveGreat height for today's flatter keyboardsNice fabric covering (looks like it should wear well)Non-slip backing on the bottom works greatNot prone to leakage like many gel-filled alternativesGreat if you like very firm supportCONS:Too firm if you prefer more \\"give\\" or softness in a wrist rest"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome rest!

I first heard this when I was in college at George Mason University in Va. I believe it was 1987 or 1988. I was never into classical music until I heard this piece. My professor explained all the pieces that we studied. This was my favorite. If you know the story behind the music you can transform yourself. This is what I do everytime I hear it. A great way of meditating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leave this album in the 22nd row","review":"A rather poor attempt on Elton's part to fuse his music style into the popular disco era. The album is admittedly quite a deviation from his standard works and the songs were rather disturbing to my melodic ear. Drink and drug diluted his work and creativity. The lyrics were not typical of Taupin's either. \\"Do it nice and slow\\", \\"mama don't love you\\", and others were quite repetitive and represented a lack of creativity. The album should be taken off the shelves and placed in the archives along with Cold Spring Harbor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fans can never be objective...","review":"From the OBJECTIVE reviewer...\\"Shine on Through\\" is the one decent song, but Elton and pop disco don't work well together."},{"rating":"2","title":"serious elton fans should not be without this album","review":"This a great early Elton album - best known song from the album \\"Mama can't buy you love\\" but the other songs are great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"you decide!","review":"Not high on my priority of EJ albums to have. I liked the version of \\"Shine on through\\" but in general I thought that too many 3-4 minute songs were needlessly dragged out, with the addition of synthesizers and percussions, to undesirable lengths. Elton explores an interestingly variable voice range in bellowing out certain selections. Some may like this better than me...but caveat emptor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, bad execution","review":"Here's what I don't like about this toy -1. The state boundaries are not the piece boundary. Meaning, you could have a black \\"state boundary\\" line running in the middle of a piece.2. Some pieces straddle 2 states or more.3. If your child accidentally touch a piece placed (which is common with a jigsaw), it will say the name of that state. Too sensitive; which renders the sound feature useless.I like most M&D; toys, but this one is really frustrating because the idea was great, the execution was horrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly cut pieces","review":"This puzzle was said to be an awesome educational item, but after ordering it, I found the puzzle pieces were not cut exactly how the state was leaving some of the boarder on another piece. Then 1/2 the puzzle failed to say the name of the state and the capital. It was over priced and poorly designed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great idea, but poor quality","review":"It's one of the best toys I have got for my 2.5 year old. Once she got it, she kept playing it for three days and remember all the states and their locations. The only issue about the product is the poor quality of the wood material. My daughter got splinter in her finger on the first day of playing, so that I have to sand it piece by piece with sand paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice puzzle but not totally up to par","review":"Mellisa and Doug make great puzzles; that is a fact. This is a nice high quality puzzle. It lost a star because its a little too sensitive and sometimes doesn't work right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great toy -- breaks in a heartbeat","review":"Purchased these for my four year old twins who love puzzles. They worked fine to start, but after a few days they both broke. They weren't subjected to rough play or anything, but now some of the states don't work, and they go off at random times, like when you walk near them, or turn the lights in the room off. I've had to take them out of the kids' rooms because at all hours of the night I would hear \\"Idaho -- Boise,\\" and \\"California -- Sacramento.\\" I was extremely dissatisfied with their durability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Counter productive","review":"I thought the puzzle that gave states as well as their capitols would be great for my 5 year old daughter. I was VERY disappointed when I realized how the map worked. If you put ANY state over the \\"Texas\\" sensor the map identifies it as Texas and gives the state capitol as \\"Austin\\". No matter what state you place over any particular sensor, the map gives the state and capitol information related to the sensor...not the puzzle piece. My daughter propmtly held up South Dakota after putting it over the Minnesota sensor and proudly proclaimed South Dakota as Minnesota. I will have to turn off the voice portion of the map so my daughter does not get confused. I certainly wouldn't recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"a bit disappointed","review":"I bought this for my 4 year old for Christmas. There are a handful of things I don't like about it. One, the pieces aren't necessarily shaped like the state. It's hard to explain, but each state is outlined on the board and then the actual piece isn't necessarily that exact shape. It's confusing to my daughter who normally does great with puzzles. Two, when you put a piece in place you hear the name of the state and the capital...which is great. But I was wish it only announced the state if it was the RIGHT piece. YOu can put Kansas in Colorado's spot and it will say \\"colorado, denver\\". Three, the pieces are breaking easily and my daughter isn't hard on things. Four, the sound is light sensitive...if every piece isn't in place and you turn the lights off or on, you start hearing all the states/capitals being announced. A bit annoying.At the very least I would go with a regular puzzle of the United States...skip the sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"No ON/OFF switch","review":"The biggest problem I got is it doesn't have an on/off switch. So when you turn on/off your light, or even when there is a cloud passing by in the sky, it will start to talk. Think about it: you turned on/off the light in the middle of the night to get something, all the sudden you heard \\"Alabama ...\\", quite scary isn't it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"M&D USA Puzzle Plus Sound","review":"I would recommend not buying this puzzle. Just buy the regular USA puzzles. The cutting of the states on this puzzle are not even. Parts of states are cutoff on almost every piece. Some of the puzzle cuts include 2-5 extra states. In addition is the terrible sound functionality. Instead of having some simple button being depressed when you put the puzzle piece down it has some kind of sensor. There have been many times at night when I go by my son's toybox and the puzzle starts calling out state names just from the wind passing by it from me walking. :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Talks in the night","review":"This puzzle will start rattling off states and capitals at all hours of the day or night. A draft, a slight light change, someone walks by, and it starts talking. Even with all of the pieces out. I've had to remove the batteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great educational puzzle","review":"The puzzle is great. My daughter loves it. However she can't really hear the voice reciting the states and capitals. I thought it would have said more like the states nickname or another fact. I expect alot from a Melissa and Doug puzzle I guess. We'll have this for years for our other children and it helps me brush up on my geography too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wooden USA Map Sound Puzzle","review":"Sorry that the states were not cut out more acturately. I like that it says the states name and capital of the state as you put the puzzle piece in place. Have not given it to my grandson yet, it is one of his Christmas gifts so can't rate the fun value. He has been asking where realitives live so decided this puzzle would be a great tool to use to show him where we are moving to and where others live. He likes puzzles so I am hoping this one will be enjoyable and well as a great learning tool."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointment","review":"I usually love Melissa & Doug products, but this one is not what I expected.

I am motivated right now to write this puzzle as the puzzle is in the other room randomly spouting off states and capitals, it is possessed and has been since day one. Furthermore the only way to turn off the sound is by taking the batteries out of it. What kind of sound toy doesn't come with an on/off button? But that isn't the only reason to not purchase this puzzle. The pieces are not cut accurately making it impossible for a young child to figure out where anything goes if they are relying on looking at the pieces as they would a traditional puzzle. Don't waste your money on this puzzle, at least don't buy it full price, you can probably find mine at and others at your local Goodwill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy, not worth the money....","review":"Bought this for my son thinking it would be fun and educational... When it arrived several of the sensors were already broken... Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully comfortable","review":"I know it seems gimmicky, but you'd be amazed how comfortable and soothing the wrist rest is. It's not stiff like some can be, but it still provides a lot of support. While it's a little graphic, but best way I can describe how it feels is like uncooked steak or pork- it has tension, but it also has give. Really, if I could have given a better description I would. I hope it doesn't turn you off from this product, I can't recommend it highly enough!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Gel is HARD.","review":"I got this to replace the my current mouse pad, which is (supposedly) exactly the same model. I bought my old one back in early 1999, it is well used, has seen better days, but still has plenty of life left in it. My old one has soft gel that conforms to your wrist and flexes when you move your wrist. This one does not. It is very hard gel and has a lower profile than the older one. Technically, it does provide wrist support, but so can a brick. The mousing surface actually is softer, but that it a moot point, and it is thinner, which gives a lip at the edge of the pad. Actually, the pad is softer than the gel, pathetic. BTW, the old one was made in USA, this one is made in China. Sad, sad, sad replacement and I will be returning it.Oh, and to the reviewer that compared it to uncooked steak: close, but less rare, more well done and left on the counter over the weekend."},{"rating":"2","title":"An vitally important topic.","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. For many years, I've considered the understanding of our evolutionary drive towards dominance hierarchies to be of utmost importance to the future direction of our species. Rare are books that address this topic. Rarer still are books that address it as succinctly and pragmatically as this. Until, as the authors assert, we come to understand and accept the biological roots of our natures, we're doomed to the same endless cycles of oppression and violence we have seen throughout recorded history. To control our nature, we must acknowledge the truth of our nature."},{"rating":"2","title":"I give this book 5 stars","review":"I read the Broken Blade,in school and I loved it.

It's like Myers can't keep himself from nudging the reader and saying, \\"You get it, right?\\"Another odd thing about this book is the number of women who are young, blonde, gorgeous, lissome, curvaceous, well-built,etc. Every young lady is a hot babe and the author wants everyone to know it.

You'll have to follow its many references to gather the whole knowledge together. Recommended for those with good skills in C++ and class programming but are willing to build some board games for fun. Interestingly, it gives some insight into AI and 3D gfx, but never deep enough for someone to start any serious project. The attached CDROM contains complete projects which does help a lot (but nothing that you can't find in the Web)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trouble in Paradise","review":"The metaphorical possibilities of the Culture as Garden of Eden were always going to be too ripe and juicy not to pick(sorry); so we get the Fall of Man on an Orbital, where the best human game player in the universe is tempted by a sneaky, whispering box of mechanical intelligence. And well done it is, too -- humourous, colourful and thoughtful. In the second half, where we descend into Hell as Fascist Galactic Empire, things get a mite polemical, and it's not as fun. The planet of fire, though, at the end, is a great concept and the metaphoric coup de grace."},{"rating":"2","title":"very different from the last book","review":"When I first started reading this book, I didn't think I would like it very much since it seemed so implausible, but as it went on, I got to liking it more and more.

The author does a fantastic job of making the alien game of Azad believable and exciting, even though we don't really ever learn the rules. I'm looking forward to reading the next book in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"quintessential","review":"PoG is one of the quintessential IMB books imho. If you read the description and note the \\"politics\\" and \\"political\\" tone, you can just replicate that meaning into every possible scenario. Politics within the Culture, within the game, among the politicians, layers of backstabbing and manipulation. All this on top of the Culture ethos involving AIs and human modification.I read it years ago and think of PoG as one of the quientessential IMB works along with Use of Weapons, Excession, and Feersum Endin.If you can recommend to me authors/books which share this level of detail and convolution, please, I welcome the recommendations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not amongst his best efforts.","review":"Normally Banks presents a plethora of new ideas and interesting characters. Aside from his typical sarcastic robot, there is not much of interest here. It is quite obvious where everything is going from the moment Gurgeh reaches Azad we realize this will be the rehash of old tropes--the \\"good\\" gambler who needs to defeat the evil ones despite tremendous odds, and a blunter version of an old Star Trek episode, the \\"aliens\\" display a more extreme version of the faults of Western society. (And, of course, the good Culture agent needs to save them from themselves, much as Star Trek crew members had to in the old show.) Both of his main themes have been done often, and done better, by other authors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read Bank's books ASAP, but in what order?","review":"I've read all but Bank's short story collection and all have been good. Of the SF books, start with Consider Phlebas and Use of Weapons, which really bring out the darker, meaner Banks, and then go with Player of Games for light ?! relief.I really enjoyed the earlier \\"Culture\\" novels and in Player of Games found the Empire very credible. I'm sure that any resemblance to Earth is totally in my own mind.Player of Games is one of the first books where the deviousness of the Culture Minds really begins to come to the fore, whilst basing the story around an all too human games player. It's a near perfect balance, especially compared to Excession where the shift to the non-human elements makes us care less about the final outcome. I've only read Player of Games five times so far, so it's got plenty of mileage left!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blacklisted - Georestricted - Not Free SF Reader","review":"A good Culture novel. The protagonist is a chess master on steroids, basically. An expert at all sorts of games, and what he does for money.A bunch of those sneaky Culture AI types recruit him to take part in a game that enthralls a whole planet a long way away, as part of what is basically a political and espionage plot, as said planet's rulers are not nice people, to put it mildly.The artifical companions are again wonderfully snarky (think K.I.T.T., that sort of thing, if you need a tv reference, or occasionally, O.R.A.C.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"couldn't finish it","review":"This novel could have used an editor.

The description of this is deceiving. If you don't know everything about the Culture, none of this will make sense. The book is supposed to make sense due to all the things the Culture is capable of. Banks seems to make up stuff as he goes along. The Game is never really explained. I guess it is if you understand The Culture. I didn't and the only reason I finished the book at all was to see if and how the guy made it through. If that's enough for you, then by all means..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor","review":"I was not surprised when I heard that Banks had written this a long time before Wasp Factory or Consider Phlebas. Compared to some of his later work, it is appalling!The story meanders at the best of times and it could have easily been shortened for better effect. It is quite obvious that Banks had no idea about \\"pace\\" back then. The language is uninspired.To clarify my meaning - his editor must have been drunk or asleep or both!!!The most glaring failure of this novel is the inconsistency of idea, plot and characterisation. For example, at the most basic level, how can a character go to \\"his\\" house, when supposedly the Culture has no concept of personal property???Fans of the Culture novels may argue this, stating that this is precisely the negative aspects of the Culture that Banks is illustrating. But somehow I doubt this is true.Ill-conceived at best. Give it a wide berth."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exotic Villa Lobos from his french years","review":"Even before the Rite of Spring-ish bassoon lines in choros 9, the influence of Stravinsky and others working in France during the time Villa-Lobos was there can be heard strongly. These pieces still manage to sound quite original because of the immense percussion, and of course the choros rythyms. These are colorful, exciting, and typically brazilian in the composer's style. Although I don't know of other recordings of this to compare it to, the performance sounds magnificent. My only complaint is that the whole cd is just over forty minutes in length. I keep wanting more!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brazilian exotica","review":"The choros was - and possibly still is - a popular form for street musicians in Rio de Janeiro which inspired Villa-Lobos to write music in a characteristic Brazilian idiom. It is hard to imagine these works, with their need for a full orchestra, being played in the streets of any city but the combination of percussion and complex rhythms certainly evoke an image of the variety of ethnic origins which form the culture of Brazil. I have not heard these pieces before and so have little to compare them with. Certainly the Hong Kong P.O. enters enthusiastically into the spirit of the music - perhaps someone more well-versed with Brazilian music would be better placed to comment on the authenticity of the performance; to me it seems to convey very well the mood of tropical South America. I would recommend this CD to anyone with an interest in 20th century music, particularly that of Stravinsky, who might well have written works like this if he had spent time in Brazil."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to Read and Enjoy","review":"Instead of dazzling us with grammatical acrobatics on obscure and arguable rules of Greek as many do on this topic when defending what cannot logically be defended, Brian Holt takes us straight to the Bible, and breaks everything down so all can understand.

The discussion on most scriptures is very brief, followed by a flippant comment. I had expected a thorough, in depth discussion of a complex doctrine, but unfortunately, this is not the book for that. The discussions on problems with translation are very interesting, but most other discussions were too brief, and even condescending.

I took economics in college. It was a mix of graphs for laughs combined with a totally pro-business outlook. Unions were bad and workers were described as responsible for unemployment because of greedy wage demands. The idea that bargaining power might matter was completely absent. Thomas Palley has written an antidote to this. This is economics written clearly and lucidly. Best of all, I did not feel that I was being not told what to think, but rather I felt lead through the economy in a way that gave real understanding.

This was his lineup for 6 years that played at small clubs all over (which I was lucky to see numerous times) and reestablished interest in the blues. Many of the numbers are from his two best albums: Blues Breakers with Eric Clapton and The Turning Point. Two of the better guitar solos are Walter on \\"Rolling With The Blues\\" and Coco playing the classic slow piece \\"Have You Heard\\", the 1st Mayall tune I every heard. The finale, \\"Steppin' Out\\", features them both trading blistering licks and is a great finish to an excellent album. This is possibly the rockin'ist lineup he ever had and is must for serious John Mayall and blues fans!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Book Review","review":"I purchased this book to read as part of a book club. The book is a compilation of \\"horror\\" stories. I say \\"horror\\" because the stories are not at all scary. Some of the stories are written in old English-type style which makes it hard to follow. Some are quite suspenseful and build you up only to let you down with no monster or demon or murder to follow. I am trying to get through the book but it is tough because none of the stories are holding my attention."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Disciple of John Henry Jowett","review":"Used repeatedly for several years as a daily devotional book with my husband we consider it to be one of the best we have ever seen.

They are everything that everyone says they are! They take about 10-20 minutes to break in and with in that time there should be constant tuning so that your peg doesn't stick and then you sit there almost breaking your hand... But the A string is perfect! There is something about them that give you total control of your dynamics and it really can make your instrument sound even better (even though I play a F.Costa viola from Fein Violins and it sounds amazing already!!). I typically prefer the Helicore C but the C from the Pirastro pack out shines it in every way possible! If you are looking for the best string for the viola, these are your best bet (for synthetic core, if you prefer traditional gut core strings, then Pirastro has those too)."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's tiny...you can buy a lot more of Anais Anais for cheaper","review":"Just don't buy this item.

The same short melody is repeated over and over again throughout the sixteen tracks on the CD.

The movie was good but the score to it needs a redo. I give the score a D. I guess James was just too tired of making scores he just put a little bit of movie themes to this movie. What a waste of time he did. If you had a suggest to A Beautiful Mind or Field of Dreams what would it be? Field of Dreams because it's the way it meant to be from the movie and it's done really well. Yeah, the movie's breathtaking I thought but the score itself is really dumb.

I am NOT a fan of soundtraack music and consider it largely worthless and boring musically. While it is true that Charlotte Church does \\"all the vocals\\" on this CD, be fairly warned that there is only one \\"song\\" on this CD with words to it. It is quite good, as is everything CC does, but don't buy this (as I naively did) thinking you will get a whole album of CC music.

I believe his final was A Beautiful Mind.A Beautiful Mind, from beginning to end, is filled with emotion and power. From the amazing descending piano montages to Charlotte Church's hauntingly angelic voice....everything so majestic and expressive.The whole first half of the CD are my favorite tracks.

Despite that the first track sounded somewhat like \\"The Machine Age\\" from Bicentennial Man, this score is one of his most original. I only rated it with four stars because I did not have a chance to see the movie itself, so the music I heard did not really have a story behind it which I could completely follow.

The song \\"All Love Can Be\\" is very good, actually.My favourite tracks are: \\"A Kaleidoscope Of Mathematics\\", \\"Saying Goodbye To Those You So Love\\" (Contains a beautiful piano solo) and \\"Closing Credits\\".On this cd are also some nice interviews with James Horner and Ron Howard.If you liked \\"Bicentennial Man\\", I think you'll like this album very much."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be careful of sizing","review":"I can't fully review this product because I was completely unable to use it.

One is a priest and one is a nun, but they share the trait of being cold and hard to get to know. They also seem to have an unusual propensity to endure more penance than most who have a vocation for the religious life. When the local priests' housekeeper is found dead, the police assume that it is suicide. Sister Joan disagrees and, as usual, conducts her own investigation. She suspects the two newcomers but it could always be a townsperson or someone from the nearby gypsy camp. This is a good addition to the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Check out \\"Plectrist\\" before buying this","review":"The first eight tracks are the 10\\" LP \\"Let's Have a Session\\", which was a sort of play-along, intended to allow a musician or singer to practice with the backing of a top band. As such, although they are complete tunes, they are not complete performances. The track listings for 1-4 and 5-8 are reversed, which may indicate the extent to which the absence of the melody obscures the identity of the tunes (at least to the compiler). These are interesting if you are investigating comping, but probably a little sparse to play for regular listening.The remaining tracks are the originally released 12\\" LP \\"Plectrist\\". This is most likely what you are looking for. The stand-alone version of \\"Plectrist\\" currently available on Amazon (Nov. 2008) also includes three alternate takes of \\"The Way You Look Tonight\\", and one of \\"Lullaby of the Leaves\\".

Everything was pretty much true for the most part. One HUGE area I'd disagree with was Naples review. The book states that if you really want to see a true picture of Italy that a trip to Naples is a must. I highly recommend you stay away from Naples and stick to the other areas: Venice, Rome, Pisa, Pompeii, Florence. I went to all of these places and loved them all EXCEPT NAPLES!The book needs to add that if you don't speak Italian then Naples is not an area to go to!

I've been hoping that it would get better, but alas--I'm afraid not. Hannah becomes more immature in each book. I've decided that she doesn't deserve the \\"decent\\" boyfriend--the one who would make an honest commitment to her. She does deserve the other one who lies to her and tells her continually that he is sorry for looking at and dating other women all the time. Come on! Where are her brains? I think the story should focus more on Lisa--she's the smart partner. Even Hannah's sister Andrea is a more interesting character than Hannah. I'd like to know what Joanne Fluke is trying to prove here. As she's writing each book, is she deciding that she doesn't like Hannah, so therefore portraying her as such a 'bimbo'. She's losing me as a fan of her writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hannah's attitude is getting old","review":"Hannah is really getting on my nerves. I can see this series going down the same road as the Diane Mott Davidson series, where the main character becomes so annoying I won't be able to read the book. Basically, the main character (Hannah) is dating two men. They all know about it and they are both trying to win her over - quite civilly. In this book, Hannah's becoming increasingly sure the one of her men (Mike) is seeing an old friend of his - for more than just a friendly chat. Which throws her into fits, and all of her friends side with her - if he's seeing someone else, she should dump him because that's not right. But it's perfectly okay for her to go on seeing Norman, sure! There's one thing I hate more than stupidity, and that's hypocrisy. Sadly, that is one of the central points to this story. The recipes are good, but I don't think I'll be able to stomach any more of the books - even though the mysteries aren't half bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Losing interest...","review":"I think this will be the last Cookie Jar murder I read. I have found that since about the second book I have either been able to figure out quite easily who the killer was because there is a very clear pattern to the writing. Ms. Fluke usually makes a brief mention of a new character or a minor event that usually gives it away. I find myself reading quickly to get to the end of the book to see that I am right every time. I am never surprised, and I don't find that interesting or fun. I'm also weary of the Mike/Norman situation. Seriously, who can get to know two men well enough to receive proposals from both of them. It's too silly to enjoy. Hannah would get SO jealous when Mike spent time with Shawna Lee, yet it's ok for her to blatantly have two boyfriends. Ridiculous. I'm moving on to another series...."},{"rating":"1","title":"a dissenting opinion","review":"This is an OK book, if it's the first of the series one has read. However, for those who have read Fluke's earlier \\"Hannah\\" mysteries, it is a crashing bore. Hannah, her mother, sister, suitors, etc. are interesting, well-delineated characters. The problem comes with Fluke's setting: her idyllic, Minnesota village is such a great place that readers of more than one of these cozies know from the outset that the crime was committed by an outsider. This series has become the most formulaic I have ever read: Hannah will dither between her two suitors, Mom will continue to be charmingly demanding and eccentric, everyone will need block heaters in the Minnesota, and I won't read any more Hannah Swensen mysteries."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too condescending","review":"Does Fluke think that her readers can't connect the dots? Every joke is explained, it is just too much. And the cat \\"talking\\" to her is just a little too much. Hannah is a little too smug in this one - she leads people to believe that her cat is killing rodents but she doesn't really have them do it. She's rude about anyone who watches their figure or wears make up. The story line in this one is just weak. She is downright rude sometimes then so non-confrontational later. But my biggest problem is that she lets Mike get away with dating someone who tried to run her out of business. I've loved several of her previous novels because they are fun, but the over explaining is just getting to be too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Peach Cobbler Murder & Sugar Cookie Murder","review":"I really like the style of Joanne Fluke's books.

It must be hard to balance ongoing character development against individual plot-lines in a series like this, but this book had more soap opera than sleuthing: the body didn't turn up until after 1/3 of the way through. I'll read on, because some of the earlier books have been good, but I might start looking for a replacement for this series as my source of light-and-fluffy reads."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why all this murder?","review":"Fluke's narrational talent deserves a better canvas than mere murder.

I'm sure Steven Farley is a good writer, but his style is not his father's and his efforts to continue the Black Stallion stories from his father should be put to rest. The violent deaths of three horses in this book are enough to halt any fan of Walter Farley's. The relationship between the Black and Alec is missing the depth and understanding that readers of the series are used to. Time to go back to the originals and leave these new stories to others less familiar with Walter Farley's work."},{"rating":"1","title":"well...","review":"I haven't finished this book yet, but I can already tell it's not gonna be good. First, Steven Farley just can't write like his father. Second, he doesn't know anything about horse racing! In a big race, the America Cup, the Black's main challenger is a two-year-old colt named Ruskin. The race is a mile and a half.Already, two problems.1. Two year olds don't race against older horses here in America. Duh!2. A two year old in a mile and a half race? YEAH RIGHT!The writing was poor, and the author didn't write enough details in the race.I'm already nearly done with the book, but I won't say any more, because all I need to say is that this book isn't worth buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"I didn't like it","review":"I'm sorry, I just didn't like the book. I think all writers have a style of their own, and I don't like Steven's way of writing. He doesn't seem to put as much feeling into the description of Alec during the race, and in other parts too. As a matter of fact, I wish he would just leave his father's series the way it is and not add on to it. And I don't like the way he portrays Alec in the other series about the colt, Raven. What I'm trying to say is that I don't like any of his books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I think that Steven Farley is doing a superb job carrying on his father's tradition. The book, about a hopeless situation caused by on accident on the racetrack, is a mystery also. A great one for young horse lovers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read for Any New Home Builder","review":"Even if you don't have chemical sensitivities, it is probably better to live your life without the added out gassing that many home products give.If you are so fortunate to build your own home, then this book is a must read for ideas and ways to make it less chemically and more ventilated. The ventilation sections were some of my favorites as I currently rent and am always looking at methods to keep my old (and probably chemically laden home) well ventilated.It would be difficult and potentially extremely expensive to implement all the ideas, but even a few could make a huge difference in your well-being and your children should you have them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Clamp-style cuteness","review":"Nothing unexpected happens in this one--everone should have figured out who the lady watching from the shadows was, although her reason for hanging in the shadows is a bit insane--she freaks out when she's around people she loves. This is in the Cardcaptor Sakura vein of Clamp work, but lacks the depth & suspense of CCS, likely due to the length of the work.

I believe the problem is with screw castings that are too large. I called the company and they were willing to replace the unit, but that is not the issue here.

Buy a set of Mozart's violin concertos or maybe Don Giovanni if you're so inclined. Work out to it if you want to. His Piano Concerto No. 20 is a good one to get your blood goin.

If you don't, just turn it down.Characters seem to coexist in this game. If you kill 100 opponents, it doesn't make sence for your brother to say, \\"good job general.\\" Relationships between characters carry out into gameplay(Liu Bei-Zhang Fei-Guan Yu;Sun Jian-Sun Quan-Sun Ce-Sun Shang Xiang; etc)Overall it is a great game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grab your weopon and go to the battle field!","review":"This is a fun game.

The cs1 package that comes with the book uses text based concepts and does not work well with the oop idea that is central to java. A much beter package named javabook from the \\"Introduction to Object Oriented Programming in Java\\" by Thomas Wu gives an oop start from the first page and you can extend this package to give you all the tools you need to write a fully functional application."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book tries to be everything but succeeds to be nothing","review":"I wouldn't recommend this book. It assumes you're a complete computer novice, and thereby wastes a lot of pages explaining concepts like LAN, Internet and so on. It then goes on to describing the Java core language with ill-written examples. Now and then, chapters about writing applets appear at random places. There are also chapters about \\"The Software Development Process\\". All this doesn't leave much room for what the book is supposed to deal with.The interesting parts of Java (and OOP) are given a shallow coverage, and suddenly the book is over, leaving you hungry for more.

I have read more than half of it and I am still unclear on how to implement object oriented ideas in programming. I have taken classes on object oriented design, database design, and some UML, but this book doesn't really give reasons for writing programs the way they are written in the examples. Most of the other students in my class (an upper division master of information systems class) are also a little sketchy on why things are done the way they are in the examples in the book. They usually just copy code from the examples to finish class assignments (as I do, also).

The authors must not have checked out their code since there were many mistakes throughout the examples.

Even though I faithfully read and highlighted each section, I was still completley lost. While I normally appreciate succinct writing, this book is a little bit *too* right to the point. I don't find the explanations of key concepts to be thorough enough for a rank beginner like myself, and the code examples are not really all that helpful.In hopes of salvaging my GPA, I went and bought Learn To Program with Java by John Smiley, and found it to be much more useful. The book is written as if you are sitting in a programming class, with fellow students who ask very lucid and insightful questions.

The book never introduces any new materials unnecessarily until we cover the easier ones. Its explanations on object-oriented programming was especially great; I could not understand it when I read other books on programming at high school, but I grasped the idea with this one book. For example, the book uses many everyday examples to explain about the relationship between objects and classes. I finished my cs1 course but I still use it for reference.

While the pictures are beautiful, the text is way too advanced for the 4-8 age range listed (eight years might be the lower end of the range for this book).

My only objection is the picture on the page where the story about the year 325 during the reign of the Emperor Constantine I.

It is a typical day in a daycare with a loving daycare provider named Sherri. She is a teacher, mother, housekeeper, artist, cook, caretaker and much more. If a child is new to daycare this is a good way to break them in before they start. It is a very nice sized book with colorful artistic pages. There are good lessons in the story also. If they are in daycare it is a good present to give to your provider to read to the children. They never get tired of listening to it. My kids are 7,3, and 1 and all still love it.

I have been using stevia for over 15 years, so I know the ins and outs of using it pretty well, and I love it.I currently mix droche cocoa powder with stevia powder for a hot chocolate drink and it definitely has a super dark chocolate flavor which i like.So when I saw this product I thought I'd try it...what a complete disappointment. It tasted horrible. It's taste reminded me of what fresh potting soil smells like, and it left gritt in my mouth...so unless i happened to get a bad batch of this and they cut it with soil, don't buy this. Hopefully, me wasting my money saves you from wasting yours. Make your own with cocoa powder.Also this is what the usage directions on the lable read exactly... \\"Suggested Use: Blend 2 1 sp in Oz liquid\\".

The theological holes in Wagner's beliefs become much more glaring in his presentation of present-day Apostleship. He has great and exciting stories, but he becomes less and less connected to the Word. I would take extreme precaution in applying his principles because they seem to be founded more upon a mysticism and less on Biblical example. Just be careful."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Original thought","review":"This book had a great potential to add further insight into the New Apostolic Movement.

It hasn't been used very often at all, but no one has mentioned this discrepancy before now. (And this has been triple checked by a patron, the librarian, myself, and my other coworkers - it's just really bizarre).Disc 1 is labeled as having the 4th and 5th symphonies, but actually contains the 1st and 2nd. When we play the disc, the music and the captions verify this.I don't know if this is one fluke disc or if there are a whole batch that have been made incorrectly, but felt this was definitely worth mentioning to potential buyers. If a patron had let us know about this sooner, we would have tried to exchange (and am sure Amazon would have obliged), but it's been almost three years now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quit messing around and buy it!","review":"This works as others have noted and accepts all the normal types of primer boxes used for packaging primers. The grooved surface is the only one that works for turning the primers, so this is the one to dump the primers onto. Then with a little mild shaking (mild is better than harsh) flips all the primers the same direction. If you don't like the orientation you put the other side of the box over the one you shook it out on and then flip it over, take the other side off and your primers are ready to pick up.Like everyone else has said, this is something you need if you are using a tube-type primer feeder. It works as well as anything out there and is very inexpensive. If you're loading primers into a feed tube and don't have one of these, stop messing around and buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good DVD","review":"I love Keaton.

I decided after my last hunting trip with my cheap ones fogging up, focusing troubles and poor low light viewing that it was time to shop. I read numerous reviews and had decided on the Bushnell excursions ex. After ordering them I read one final forum that suggested the Infinity's while discontinued in 2009/2010 were worth the time to track down. So I ended up with 2 to compare side by side. For my type of hunting (out 1 hour before sunrise, glassing in woods 50 to 200 yards) either pair would have worked but in the end the simpler quick focusing of the Infinity won me over. They gave me a better predawn view then even my scope. I will not go back to cheap glass again besides these retail for $479 but can be found for 185 to 225 on eBay or amazon.
