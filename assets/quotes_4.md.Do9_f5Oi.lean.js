This is the best album I have ever heard. Just enough of a mix of guitars and strings. The best track, the old Savatage track, \\"Christmas Eve (Sarajevo 12/24) opens with a haunting guitar riff, and is joined with thundering drums, pounding bass, and sliding strings and bells. This is the best and newest thing to hit christmas. The songs are traditional songs that are revved up, just enough to get a heavy feeling, but not so much that they loose the feeling of christmas. The other songs, are original songs written by Paul O'Neill (who, may I add is a sheer genius) The lyrical songs feature some of the most talented vocal performers. There is not one bad song on this album. This is a \\"must\\" in anyone's album collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some good","review":"There are some good songs on it, but overall I didn't care for it.

Just when you believe that the excitement might fade, you are plesantly surprised by the pleasant and constant stimulation of your being.This will be my featured CD during the holiday season with friends and family"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with instrumentals","review":"I've been a fan of TSO for a while, owning their Beethoven's Last Night CD and having heard their christmas music off and on for several years. I had read the reviews here, however, and listened to the CD with no expectations. What I heard was good instrumentals, but horrible vocals. The vocalists are trying very hard to sound operatic, and failing. The average punk band sounds better than the vocals on a few of the songs, which is a real shame consider the spectacular show that they put on live.To anyone who asks, I recommend going onto one of many sites where you can purchase individual songs, downloading all of TSO's instrumental songs from the three christmas CDs, and burning a CD with those. Save yourself the grief of the poor vocal performance and buy what's really worth listening to--rocking christmas music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected!","review":"I was very disappointed after listening to the samples of this CD.

The samples with singing, just isn't what I was looking for."},{"rating":"1","title":"One or two decent tracks, but.........","review":"if you are one of those who mistake volume and overproduction for creativity, you will undoubtedly agree with all of the glowing reviews here. I checked out this album and thought it harmless enough. Two nights ago I had the misfortune of seeing them in concert (thankfully I didn't have to pay for the ticket). Wailing guitars, pyrotechnics, lasers, falling snow, band members running through aisles, physically exaggerated guitar licks and plenty of fist-pumping did not impress me. It merely served to distract me (as the album's over-production distracted me) from the pretentiousness and mediocrity of this music.It's hard not to like the studio 'Sarajevo' but this train derails very quickly beyond it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Savatage deserves the Credit! Wake up People!!!!","review":"With all due respect to all you people who loved TSO, I think you should wake up and go straight to the nearest CD store and buy Savatage albums and give it a listen because TSO=Savatage! and Basically the Christmas Eve/Sarajevo song is basically a song on the Dead winter dead album for Savatage! Even Back to a reason II is the same Back to a Reason song sung by Jon Oliva in Poets and Madmen album for SAVATAGE! So,, why does TSO get the credit and Savatage doesnt! Is this Fair!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yuck!","review":"Listened to it once. I'm going to give it away as a White Elephant gift. Only a couple of songs were worth listening to.

HE SAID HE THOUGHT IS WAS TRANS SIBERIAN ORCHESTRA. I WENT ONLINE AT AMAZON.COM TO SEE IF IT WAS THERE AND SURE ENOUGH I GOT TO LISTEN TO IT AND WAS THRILLED THAT I LOCATED THIS CLASSICAL ROCK GENRE.

She played it quite a lot right around Christmas, and the songs I heard were very good, sweet, very appropriate for the season. I know that she's enjoyed this CD very much, in that she loves Christmas music and this is a group she enjoys very much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome blend of classical music and heavy metal","review":"I have seen Trans-Siberian Orchestra live in concert twice, with their sold-out Lost Christmas Eve show. It was after the first show that I bought this CD. Not even the best quality CD can compare with a live orchestral version (love their version of Pachelbel Canon), but it helps me recapture the excitement and energy of the live show. I just have to turn it up louder! I am fast approaching 50 years old, so this kind of music brings back 70s rock for me but in a much more meaningful way. I only wish TSO would produce some non-Christmas classical/rock albums! If you have an appreciation for the Christmas classics, especially songs like Carol of the Bells, you must give this one a listen!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is Holiday music! BABY!","review":"Damn, what a good album. It's great way to compose Christmas music together with hard rock. I've never heard anything like this before, I was just blown away when I heard Christmas Eve/SaraJevo 12/24, A Mad Russian's Christmas, O Come All Ye Faithful/O Holy Night, and First Snow. This is what Holiday music should be, instrumental rock and some singing to go with it. I suggest to all of you to get this cd no matter if it is Christmas music you can still listen to it when ever you want because it's a cd that can be played whenever you want,due to the Hard Rocking Guitar RIFFS. GET THIS CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Stunning!","review":"There are few times when I can listen to a CD over and over again without feeling bored soon. This effort by TSO is a welcome change. Each song has a different feel, and the musicianship combines both classical tracks with harder tracks. In addition, the music is pure brilliance. Every time I listen to it, I gain a new appreciation for the mastery done. Wow. Words really can not describe it. I'm really at a loss for why anyone would have reason to dislike this album, since the tracks run the full spectrum. Buy yourself a gift this Christmas, and get this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the FAMOUS Scott-Todd wplj christmas album.","review":"Yes this is it.

Music should \\"soothe the saveage beast.\\" This \\"music\\" is not pleasing to my ears. I wouldn't waste my money to buy it. There were three songs on this cd that I would listen to and enjoy and that deserves one star. Electric guitars can be used without sounding offensive.

I was disappointed by this disc. While the arrangements are generally inventive, bringing together lots of unexpected instruments, I think the songwriting is pretty mediocre. There are two or three excellent and surprising tracks---the reinterpretations of traditional songs. Beyond these, the original songs are painful to listen to. Tasteless.The disc overall is too dynamic (loud/soft) to serve as background music, so it kind of defeats the purpose of Xmas music, doesn't it?What I'd like to hear from TSO is a rearrangement of the entire Nutcracker Suite! That would be way cooler than their original cheesy songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Christmas Surprise","review":"This is a great album. I can't put my finger on it, but it really is cool. Sounds corney, but check it out. I hear all kinds of musical threads on this. Van halen, Rick Wakeman, Meat Loaf, Emerson Lake and Palmer, Genesis, Robben Lumley, Christmas music..... Old City Bar is a classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"The first time hearing this cd was amazing. The rock in the classical pieces was so moving it was like I heard the dead rock sensations and the classical composers in a musical conversation. As I further heard what this story-song is all about. I realized that the rock is the symbol for frustration in the country and the classical is like the peace trying to shine through but almost every time that it comes out the anger sets is again. If my parents would let me I would buy it today. That is how wonderful this music is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"I had heard a cut off this CD on the radio, I liked it so I bought it. I enjoyed all of the music. Then after listening a time or two, I dug out the liner notes and read them. Now the entire work made sense.

So when you get the CD read the notes."},{"rating":"2","title":"I FINALLY FOUND IT!!!!!","review":"I've been searching for AGES to find the group that does the electric guitar version of the \\"Carol of the Bells\\", which I kept hearing on Entertainment Tonight and other shows. I was so jazzed when I found out that it's on this album, and it's called \\"Christmas Eve/Sarajevo 12/24\\". Like mackeul said, if you only need one reason to buy this album, THIS is it!!

Sure not all the tracks are great, but I haven't heard a cd that with enough variety to tickle my various musical fancies since Jason Becker released \\"Perspective\\" (best album ever) back in 90's.But those with closed minds take heart, this disk isn't for someone looking for just another Christmas cd, but if your looking for a new twist on those old Christmas songs that you loved growing up and also some originals, take the chance and spend the 14 bones (big deal).

The songs have a wide range from melodic and gentle--to hard hitting with electric guitars. The singers, instead of making the songs, beautifully support the instrumentals of the songs. Each of the songs are capable of standing alone as instrumental versions, but the singers add an extra level of depth. I really love this album and feel bad for not paying closer attention before I reviewed it the first time. I will definitely by the other TSO albums!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Mannheim Steamroller meets Joe Satriani","review":"A truly unique work, this album combines electronic music, hard rock, & minimalistic music to make for a great Christmas recording.

Finally it is quite overpriced for the flimsy cheap piece of plastic that it is.

While I love my Kitchen Aid Pro5 it is only 475 Watt power, and a 6 was only 575 Watts so I opted for the Cuisinart at 1000Watts instead as the Kitchen Aid doesn't have the ability to do 4 loaves of bread without over heating and shutting down. The Cuisinart does the Job. The Head wobbles a little as it mixes and the fold back top for other uses collects flour dust from the mixing which is a constant clean up problem- wished it closed more solidly so that flour wouldn't get into it. Makes wonderful bread and the price was fabulous. I would highly recommend this for a more serious bread maker since it does 4 loaves in a nice deep bowl so easily. A good buy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Close Enough to Perfect","review":"My Kitchen Aid Artisan stand mixer finally wore out after 10 years of use. My inclination was to replace it with a bigger capacity Kitchen Aid, but after doing considerable research into the various mixers available on the market, I eventually settled on the Cuisinart 7 quart SM-70BC. I chose the Cuisinart because: It has a 1000 Watt motor; a two (not one) handled, extra deep mixing bowl which locks into position in such a way that it doesn't overtighten; 12 variable speeds; an automatic timing feature; and non-stick coated paddle and dough hooks for ease of cleaning. It has worked beautifully, even making extremely stiff pasta doughs with ease, and it doesn't dance around the counter like my Kitchen Aid mixer did. My only slight reservation is the splash shield; it is a little tricky to snap into place, but not a big issue. It's all the mixer a home cook could ever need."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this stand mixer.","review":"I finally took the plunge and bought this large capacity stand mixer and have used it many times since my purchase in mid-December.

It's a little lighter which makes moving it easier as I get older so I like that. The size of the bowls combined with the tilt head is fabulous and easy to work with. I made 50 lbs of mashed potatoes for Christmas and with two bowls it was a dream. I've also made tons of cookies already and it's just wonderful to operate.

I researched mixers online prior to my purchase. I first looked at Kitchen Aid. They now have a bigger stand mixer but in my research I found out some of their parts and design are inferior to the old kitchen aids from the past. I have to admit that I have only used it once so far. I tested it on a homemade red velvet cake recipe. The icing is extremely thick and I make more than I actually need. It came through with flying colors and the next test will be soon. I will be making my sons favorite chocolate chip cookies and the dough gets pretty thick. If it flies through, then I will be extremely happy. I will check back and update at that time. The only draw back is you do have to scrape the bottom and sides.

It did not mix well, just okay. It left clumps of flour on the sides and bottom. I owned this for less than two months when all of a sudden it just ceased to work. There was no warning. For this amount the 7 quart bowl was great, but not worth it. I had a Kitchenaid for 10 years before it gave me problems. I had this Cuisinart for a month and a half.

I owned this mixer for 4 years, and it has not been heavily used, occasional cake, and holiday cookies until 2 months ago I decided to start making bread. I made 2 loaves a week, after a 1 1/2 months, the motor burnout. I NEVER have the speed over 2 when mixing bread dough because I was afraid to burn out the motor. The recipe I use doesn't make a heavy dough either. So now I have to pull out my old KA until I decide what I want to do with this burnout motor. What a waste of $450.

Breaking after 6 uses and to deal with customer service that I had was really disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality finish","review":"I purchased the Cuisinart 7-quart stand mixer about five weeks ago. The non-stick coating started coming off the edge of the flat mixing paddle after using it for at most 10 times. When I rubbed my finger along the damaged area, it left a black residue on my finger. Cuisinart was willing to send me a replacement paddle since the mixer was under warranty, but I would have to send the damaged one back to them at my expense. I was concerned about a new paddle having the same problem, and also about the overall quality and durability of the mixer since the paddle deteriorated so quickly. I called Amazon, and even though it was beyond the 30-day refund period, Amazon immediately offered me a full refund and even sent me a pre-paid shipping label for the return. Now that is great customer service! Based on my experience, I would definitely discourage anyone from purchasing this mixer, and definitely encourage everyone to buy from Amazon.com."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a KitchenAid","review":"I have this 7 quart model, and the hinge is loose so that the top bounces quite significantly when mixing heavy dough. Today the dough hook separated from the threaded pin that is inserted into the mixer - the threads stripped on the cheap aluminum dough hook. I called Cuisinart, as while this is an obviously defective part / design, they essentially blew me off - 2 1/2 years after purchase - so ignore the purported better warranty....I have used KitchenAid mixers extensively in my culinary training, and in spite of their own issues, they are much sturdier, overheat less, bounce less, and I've had better warranty experience with them"},{"rating":"2","title":"Measusurements of Intensity in Strength Training","review":"This is THE best book on the concepts of progressive resistance strength training that I know of.

First they use a lot of fancy math to show what bodybuilders all ready follow, they use a rep range of 6-10 to increase size and strength. Using partial reps in bodybuilding has it's place but not every workout. Of course they take partial reps into static holds in their even worse book Static contraction training. If you are looking for quick results take roids otherwise real muscle gains take time. Champion bodybuilders usually take about 9 years of traing to reach their peak. Like wise get away from ego lifting. Strength for a bodybuilder is a means to an end not the ultimate goal. If you care so much about your one rep strength you are a powerlifter. Nutrition and cardio info from this book is seriously lacking and not helpful if you are interested in being a bodybuilder. Overall save your money and don't buy this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the best bodybuilding book ever written.","review":"Since the early 1970's there have been hundreds of bodybuilding books written.

If you're going to read this book, be prepared to plow your way through many controversial aspects of muscle-building technique. Have faith, though; you'll come out the other side with a total understanding of the one and only requirement for building large and strong muscles.Exercise is my business ...

However to those still entrenched in dogmatic bliss, I have the following:Some of the people who address the shortcomings of the training method address in PFT will find that these limitations are discussed if one is to read the book carefully. A few points are: You will avoid overtraining and stagnation if you increase your rest time between workouts as your intensity, i.e. Power Factor and/or Power Index increases. At the beginning, the authors recommend a schedule of somewhere around every 3 days to a week. But you CANNOT stick to this schedule! As the authors explain throughout, more and more rest will be needed between workouts."},{"rating":"2","title":"The number 2 bodybuilding book in the world!!!","review":"This book is very very good almost exceptional. High intensity training is the best way to train, traditional volume training simply doesn't work except you eat all the farmacist's drugs and groth hormones.POWER FACTOR TRAINING overloads the muscle with the most important thing, huge weight.Mike Mentzer's theory isn't fully correct because he backs up full range of motion.I have seen in myself that range of motion doesn't mean anything,my muscles have grown like never before, and i am defenitly much stronger.The musclefibers contract and respond only on huge stress,high weights.This book lags behind only to Peter Sisco's and John Little's new book STATIC CONTRACTION TRAINING.For me these 2 bodybuilding experts have changed the way of training for ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another fad","review":"This is one of the most novel books on strength training I have ever read and attempted.

I truely believe you can get something out of any book you read; but this book put a stretch on that one.

With Panther though, there isn't much need for this unless there is a Windows ap you just can't live without or if you already own a ton of Windows software."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reliability Issues","review":"Beware -- there are some very nice features with the eMac and OS X but there's some bad stuff too. I love iTunes and iDVD and have made some nifty gifts with these apps. However, OS X is so different from 9 that it's hard to adjust to. Also, my eMac that I bought little over a year ago broke last night and it's been difficult navigating through Apple Care (which of course I would highly recommend)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great filters","review":"I haven't had a lot of chance to use this product but from what I have used it, it is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality cookware","review":"I had been interested in purchasing a dutch oven but really did not know which brand to purchase.When a shopping alert on simplyrecipes.com came up for the Staub 5 quart Round Cocotte in Yellow I grabbed it! It was one of the best purchases ever! I love the \\"french\\" oven for its superior quality and excellent ease of cleaning. The black inside also is a plus as I know that other brand has a white inside that gets colored with whatever you've cooked. I highly recommend this product.

Slow-cooking in the oven (braised pot roast), and slow-cooking on the stove-top (long-cook chili.) Not a mark on it, despite the fact that I have an electric stove/oven and also both times I cleaned it using the dishwasher. For those looking, this pot is highly recommended. PS: Note - the lid weighs as much as the vessel does!

Glad I got it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"I just used my new pot tonight for the first time, and it is wonderful!! Super even heat and my risotto was perfect. Love the color, too (\\"pesto\\")."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superior quality","review":"I purchased this 5 quart Staub cocotte and could not be happier with it. I use it for braising, soups, chili, etc. and the quality far surpasses that of Le Creuset. Stuab products are well-made and simple to clean and the lid is tight-fitting which is essential for braising. I absolutely love the white color - it is very clean and modern looking and beautiful to look at. The white round cocottes are offered in 5 quart and 6.5 quart versions from Staub. I will definitely purchase the 6.5 quart version, as well. Love it!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product!","review":"We gave the Staub to friends as a gift.

Not only does it look better than Le Creuset it performs better. The lid fits better and the color is outstanding: grenadine in my case. Staub is a little heavier than Le Creuset but I think this speaks about Staub's quality. And speaking of Amazon, I had a problem with a 8 quart I bought. They replaced it free with no hassles. This is serious cookware. I highly recommend Staub and Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incisive, Beautifully Written","review":"Mr. Cooke is a very bright, amusing, observant man -- who writes so extraordinarily well you'll wish to re-read passage after passage for the pleasure of the sounds.

How much is it? Good morning, etc.). One of the things I liked about it was, it was short and simple, short enough to listen to on the airplane (hence the name). After all, most people in the Netherlands speak very good English. I just wanted to learn enough Dutch to be courteous. Although the packaging said you can use it without the accompanying booklet, I wouldn't advise it! The phrases are spoken once without being repeated, and I needed the book to keep up. Besides, its useful to know how Dutch looks written."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very good.","review":"Brookfield has some excellent books on grip training with many good techniques.This, however, is full of really, really basic techniques for using cables, things that you would think of yourself in about 30 minutes if you pick up some cables and have a go.There are so many other things you can do with them that are not even touched upon. There are other books on cables / bands work that are far more comprehensive / useful. \\"Therapeutic Exercises using the Resistive Bands\\" by Caroline Corning Creager comes to mind.John what are you doing! I was hoping this book would be chock-full of innovative techniques. It looks mostly empty, full of white space, a few bad photos of some really basic techniques.About the only innovative thing was to use a towel through the handle to extend the range / give the grip a bit of work.So sadly I have to give this book one star.

My only concern is that a lot of sugar and oil are used in many of the recipes and therefore they are not low in fat (and are high in calories).BUT desserts aren't supposed to be low fat etc. so go ahead, if you are missing having GREAT desserts due to a milk allergy, then this is the book for you!Be sure to try the carrot cake, it is the best I've EVER HAD!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is NOT a cookbook for vegans!!!","review":"I am very disappointed in this book. As a vegan who does not use ANY animal products (milk, butter, eggs, meat, fish, poultry, etc.), I was lured by the idea of a \\"dairy-free\\" dessert cookbook. When I received it and looked through it, I was astounded to note that almost every recipe calls for eggs!!! There is a note in the front of the book that EggBeaters may be substituted, but since they are animal-based, I don't use them - ever. This was a waste of my money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Add to your library!","review":"I ordered this book because I'm in the process of purchasing a home. Yes, I'll get a certified inspector. Yes, my realtor will accompany me on the inspection. I wanted some additional knowledge prior to the inspection, so I knew what to expect (and not expect). The book is very clear in its language and makes for a quick read. My only complaint is that it lacks color pictures. With black/white photos, sometimes its hard to see the damage to which the author is referring. I'd recommend this book to someone either purchasing or selling a home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wayyyyyy too simple","review":"I do NOT recommend this book to anyone, regardless of your skill level. What I was hoping for was a legit pocket guide to aide in my inspections. I am just an everyday homeowner, and have basic understanding of mechanical and electrical systems. This book may serve somebody as an introduction to home inspections if you have absolutely no idea what goes into a house. If you are in this category, it may help you understand what a home inspector is doing. It does not help at all in completing your own preliminary inspection. To be clear, I was NOT expecting this book to teach me how to inspect a home; I was expecting it to provide a convenient reference during an inspection. I would recommend The Home Inspection Book: A Guide for Professionals by Marcia Darvin Spada, but it may be too detailed. At least it has a checklist. However, don't buy the Pocket Idiot's Guide - the first crappy Idiot's Guide I've ever bought."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Pocket Idiot's Guide to home inspections","review":"If you have never bought a home before and never considered the aspects of a home inspection this book would be OK. I am going on home number 10 so this book was too basic. Frankly, I bought it because it was cheap and I got what I paid for. That aside, for first timers this is not a bad introduction. It does cover all the bases. My one suggestion is don't be passive in the inspection process. Take part from start to finish in the actual inspection. Ask questions. The roof is always a key area and some inspector won't go there; they should. Water and power issues are big money if problems arise so make sure they are thoroughly inspected."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-have book","review":"Love the book.

Her first hand understanding of the situation in Cuba comes thru very vividly, just like her love for Cuba and its history does.

The English narration is too distracting and the Turkish phrases are spoken in a way that it's hard to retain them or develop your own pronunciation. The words and phrases presented are random and do not build on each other.Audio courses in a language lab have a 'repeat' button so you can jump back repeatedly until your pronunciation matches the audio. A language cd like this one, which of course doesn't have this feature, should compensate with more repetition. And the repetition should not be intermixed with English so that the phrase you are learning remains in your mental ear. As it is, I did not find myself retaining anything from this audio course.If there is a better cd audio course for Turkish out there, please let me know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Language Learning Tool Ever","review":"It is hard to believe that anyone would have the gall to sell something like this useless product. What you basically get is someone yelling the English phrase at you, followed by a native Turkish speaker mumbling the translation, once, never to be repeated again.There is no effort at deconstructing the sometimes long Turkish phrases into digestible parts. There is no effort at drilling an important phrase, by, say repeating it, even once. And there is no effort at building a vocabulary set. After listening to the entire tape and following gamely along, repeating the words, I had learned a total of one word.A single session with a Pimsleur tape (which attempts far less words) would be far more useful than this absurdity.

A lot. Bennett does not necessarily follow the standard recipe for lesbian romance novels. This one opens with two stories about four women. The plot then twists, turns, and finally converges into one story line. All the characters achieve some semblance of personal growth. Some live happily ever after, others don't.This book has a lot of sex, a moderate amount of foul language, and is very well written.

I received the earglove and tried it out right away and I could hear! This product has made using my phone much more enjoyable!

It is also more comfortable than ear bud because you don't have to put rubber in your ear. The Max can be changed to fit either left or right ear. The anwser and mute switches are very convenient and you can use voice-dialing if your phone supports it.Before I bought this one, I trusted that my Sanyo 8100 is at least above 90% in sound quality and I have always been very satisfied with it. But, noticeably, the Max can still improve sound quality a lot.I got a Jobra(something like that) ear bud free when I bought my cellphone. It always falls off and the sound is actually worse than my cellphone alone. The Earglove gives you an almost real face-to-face conversation in which you can shout and swiper, and the comfortability and clearity justify it well for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ear hook wore out after two months","review":"The audio quality was fine for me and I liked the volume control.

People on the other end said they could hear me fine, but it doesn't do much good if I can't hear them.Now that it is past 30 days, I can't return this item to Amazon for a full refund.

It's stylish and comfortable, but in the end, to darn quiet. I double checked to make sure my phone was cranked up, but this headset is just not loud enough. I couldn't see using this while driving in traffic, you wouldn't hear the other person.

It is not a \`vivid portrait'. It must stem from Shach's background that continues to haut him in making an effort to be condescending in order to blow his own horn on the lives of others in order to seek some acclaim to bolster his own ego as an author.

I'm a closet Tiki drinker with a Hawaiian shirt collection who will host a party in the back yard every once in awhile and this book is my go-to guide. The drink and food recipes here are easy and fun with room for tweaks of your own. There are many guides, how-to's and side notes on techniques and recipes. You can become quite the amateur bartender/cook/host. The cultural references and history inside clear up a lot of myths on what a Tiki drink is and how the one you are typically getting at you local bar and restaurant may not be it. The only thing I have to say that keeps this item from getting a 5-star rating is that it has a little too many references to Trader Vic's Brand products.

The technique that Sora and Layla spend this volume training for is pretty neat, but the real treat is the training itself. Layla's attitude toward Sora has finally comes full circle as they move from friends to partners.

Who could resist 'Finger Lickin' way to fight fat. Incongruent!,I thought.Closer examination of this book proves it to be educational. The chapters are just the proper length to hold my attention. The \\"To Do\\" lists relieve guess work and frustration. The recipes inspire the taste test.

However, by breaking down the events of the war into a roughly chronological sequence, Musciant is able to produce a narrative that allows readers to see the war at a strategic and tactical level. Naturally there are some overlaps of chronology as the Battle of Manila Bay was fought and won before things really got set up around Cuba and Puerto Rico but these things do not disrupt the overall quality of his richly detailed narrative. Definitely worth a place on the shelf of anyone interested in 19th Century American History."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gack. A boring, difficult, unrewarding read.","review":"This thing...this book of Musicant's...isn't hitting on all of its cylinders. Musicant is incapable of maintaining a coherent chronology. His source material is limited. The work is not difficult intellecutally -- in fact, the opposite -- but is made difficult by Musicant's consistently poor use of English; he so often puts adjectives in the wrong place that the reader frequently has to stop and try to figure out (or guess) what he means...the difference between"},{"rating":"2","title":"From Gothic Beauty #11","review":"Imagine if Jim Morrison had been born in 1980, listened to electronic music, and became a computer hacker by his late teens. Imagine the effect this would have on his words and music. Now imagine him releasing a novel in conjunction with his music, and you start to get a picture of the multimedia package recently released by Jeremy NeeDLE and Six Gallery Press. The book, Elizabeth Must Die, is a \\"mix of computer lingo and group therapy.\\" I blew through this book in about 2 days; and while listening to the music of NeeDLE, I found myself in a bizarre underworld where words and music melt into a psychedelic paranoid haze of sex, drugs, and... hardcore electronics.

Because it is Ancient Historical Fiction the author used not only the verses from the Bible but myth, legend, and what is known about that period of history to come up with a plausible story about this famous man who saved himself and his family from a terrible flood in obedience to God. What is amazing is that this book was written in 1985 but many of the issues it raises are things we are dealing with now for the first time in our known history.

Dr. Fischer has written a synopsis of each paragraph highlighting the salient points. His writing style is very clear and direct. Moreover, the Index which Fischer provides to Dych's English translation is invaluable for research - since there isn't an index in Dych's book. (Personally, I feel the Index alone is worth the price of the book!) The Introduction is also very helpful in understanding Rahner's thought and the structure of Foundations. Anyone purchasing Rahner's Foundations of Christian Faith should also purchase this book.

And so much of the characters lives are indeed revealed during a snowbound incident. There they must come to grips with the truths in their lives and what it means to love, lose, and love again.

She seems best, however, at describing the landscape (with an almost lyrical, poetic manner) than at developing a solid and coherent plot. I found the relationship between Marlis and Candice to be unbelievable, and the entire Eleanor-thing was also a little perplexing.I am disappointed in how Erdrich describes Fargo. Her descriptions are basically those of a late 1940's Fargo, and certainly does not jibe with what Fargo, North Dakota, is like nowadays. Makes me wonder if she's been up here lately.

They are generally fun. This one is definitely not. I just want you to know that I join a website just so I can let you know of my frustration. The camera angles are so annoying its hard to see what you are doing. The action is so so bad, but its pretty bad, because you die really quickly. It is also not a consistant game play, you can hit someone one moment, and do the exact same thing the next moment (while the enemy responds the same way) and not hit them, and then get hit. The play is not consistant. it would be so bad if maybe you could save when you wanted, after you get passed a hard spot, but you can't, they take you back and you have to do it all over again and again.

While it's amusing both he and I were very quickly bored. The book is \\"read\\" to you and then you get to interact with the images on the page, but there are very few actual \\"games\\" and even those are uninteresting. Objects and characters move, speak or do silly things when you click on them but nothing is challenging or requires any thought.

Very cool '70s-'80s retro styling is a fun change of pace from the more current styles of today... and for the great price I paid, it's tough to go wrong. Quality is surprisingly decent given the price, however the watch body seems to be some kind of chromed plastic and the band is definitely on the lighter/flimsier end of the watchband spectrum. No complaints here, but obviously you are getting what you pay for in terms of durability and weight. This men's watch would probably be a perfect size for most women, as it's very thin and compact, and the band is easily adjustable. For men who are used to a somewhat larger watch (like me), beware that this one will look and feel very small and delicate on the average guy's wrist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty enough for a lady!","review":"This is a very snazzy little watch that doesn't look at all unfeminine.

I no longer need many of the fancy bells and whistles of the past. Water resistance so I can wash my hands without fear, and one alarm that is loud enough to wake me. Also, simplicity in changing settings is a plus. I agree with other reviewers, however, that the band is the only drawback. It turns out the band is very rigid when on the wrist. Also, when I went to look for some information on how to adjust the band......it was non existant. Fortunately, when forced to try it myself, it was fairly intuitive. I still give it five stars because of the low price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Casio watches are accurate with long battery life","review":"A great watch for a fantastic price.

I have a fair amount of computer experience, and even a fair amount of pagemaker experience, but after reading through the first 4 chapters, I couldn't help but feel that this book was just put out to make money on the popularity of pagemaker and not better explain it.

As for an good advanced pagemaker book, this isn't it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Large book....but not very good","review":"There is a lot of text in this book, but that is as close to compliment as I'll give this book. Someone who has never used a computer before may find this book useful for the first hundred pages, and then will likely, like I did, become very frustrated with slow pace, and constant repetition of the basics. There was no need for this book to be 900 pages. Pagemaker, including all of its advanced features, could have been explained in far more detail in far less space.

Since that site is recommended by people who are really into car care, I'm pretty sure they are selling the real thing and that this is a cheap imitation.

It's loaded with well-made features, but it has one major flaw that prevents it from being a great watch: the display. Unlike the nice silver color of the digits as seen on the official picture, the numbers actually show up a dull bronze. This makes the watch very difficult to read without a direct light source or the backlight on.Other than that here are some good points:-well designed interface-well builtA few minor faults:-unit runs a little fast (gains about 30 seconds/month, i.e. gains about 1 second per day)-the design of the band/case is somewhat blandOverall conclusion: I recommend this watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Casio Watch","review":"I like the item, the wrist band was a little large for my wrist but the actual watch was worth the cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"it look good, but that's it.","review":"it look very good ,but you have to extra careful , because it gets scratched-up very quick.and it is hard to setup."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good watch for the price but a bit too small","review":"The watch looks pretty good with all the features I wanted, but the dial is a bit too small for my taste.

Very bad experience. Never again."},{"rating":"1","title":"The band fell off 33 days after I received the watch.","review":"I liked the features this watch has like the alarm feature, but it can be pretty confusing to set the features.

Casio cleverly excludes the band from its warranty as a \\"consumable\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon lead me the wrong way","review":"I was shopping for a wrist watch that was auto setting time from Colorado Springs atomic clock. I was to Amazon, one of my favorites, and brought up watches and read the reviews. Amazon listed this watch as similar and I bought it. It is both analog and digital and has the date and day. It is not calibrated by Colorado and therefore shouldn't be catagorized with those that are. I got the watch and it looked good but setting it up was almost impossible, so I paid $5 to have it set. It is back lit and when I tried to read the time it would barely light up and the lost the day and date. Too finicky to wear it went to the bottom of the drawer. My fault for not reading every detail, Amazon's fault for grouping it with the right group of watches."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks good, but no instructions on adjusting strap size","review":"This watch seems to have all of the things I was looking for, especially a repeat alarm so I can log my activities during the work day. Unfortunately, I can't figure out how to adjust the (metal) strap to fit my wrist. I called Casio Customer Service, and spoke with a nice lady who assured me she would send me the neccessary instuctions via email. That was over a month ago. I guess I should call again..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what is described","review":"I purchase watches with full metal cases because I am hard on them. The product description says it has a stainless steel case. This is misleading. The bulk of the case is plastic with a thin layer of metal over the plastic. Not a plating, but a thin metal case with the plastic case on the inside. Also there seemed to be a large amount of plastic and rubber involved with the watch band to case connection. The watch only weighs a few ounces, but is on the large size giving the impression of a very cheap watch. The kind you get for free when you order something from a catalog. This watch might survive a white collar lifestyle, but anyone that works with his hands would destroy this in weeks or shorter.As for the timepiece itself, it is legible, but I only had it for a few minutes before arranging for its return, so I have no idea how accurate it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Light, cheap feel","review":"band may be metal but it's so light and cheap it could break just as easy as plastic. Overall construction feels cheap and lame. Very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great features, terrible watch","review":"The connection between the band and the bezel broke after barely a month. Casio's return policy isn't clear-- but boils down to you have to return it for them to evaluate whether they'll cover it. I refuse to pay money only to be told I have to repair an item that is almost brand new. It's too bad-- I really like the display but the quality is poor (too much plastic, I guess). I've since purchased a Timex that doesn't have as nice a display but is a metal case and seems more robust."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleek looking, good features","review":"So this is the first watch I've bought in a long time (cell phones had pretty much replaced them as time-keepers for me) but i'm really happy I did, cuz I love this watch, its inexpensive, got great features (stopwatch, world clock, timer, 5 alarms + snooze, ana & digi), water resistant to 100m, and the one thing I love the most is that its got this feature where if you lift your wrist to see the time the back light goes on automatically! So overall I really like my buy, the reason I gave it 4 stars and not 5 is probably more my fault than the manufacturers, but I managed to scratch the face within a few hours of wearing it. :( But overall great value for money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Thick, unversatile","review":"First, I didn't expect a skinny watch, especially at this price, but it looks/feels thicker than any watch I own, including my Casio WaveCeptor (atomic) watch. Clumsy and unattractive.Second, I expected the digital display to be a little more versatile. It appears the top (smaller) line can be either the day of the week, or the month and day. The second (bigger) line can only display the time. Well, that's stupid, as there's no reason to have the time always displayed both digitally and analogically. I'd like to have the top line give the day of the week and the middle line give the month and day. But that's just not an option.Finally, the only change you can make in the size of the bracelet is a one-time change making it 3mm smaller in circumference. Any more adjustment than that and you need jeweler's tools to remove a link.I expected better from Casio."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good watch","review":"Good watch with useful features in a good price. The only thing is time zones are not all correct. But I will still recommend it for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice watch but had to return it","review":"I noticed that the watch band only has two adjustable settings. I made the adjustment to the smaller setting but it was way too big. Probably need to take out a link or two. The procedure to do that is on a youtube video that is more involved than I wanted to try. Too bad Casio didn't feel the need for more adjustable settings on the band.

The watch appeared to be all steel, but is in fact a mixture of coated plastic and steel.This is my second Casio to break in such a manner.

Shopmeko would take it back if I had all the packing and it was like new. I expected it to work and as far as I am concerned, was falsely represented and defective.

The metal parts are sturdy and dependable, but the plastic joints were what let me down. After a while one of the hinges snapped off and rendered the watch useless as there are no replacement bands for that. Also, I am still unsure how to get the analog interface to line up with the actual digital time. I read the directions several times. Perhaps the error occurred when I set the watch to NYC time, however they still get no points for ease of use.As for the people complaining that the watch is too big, you're either going to have to get a remover tool or take it to a jeweler and pay the $10 or so for the service. I'd honestly recommend something with all metal parts. I work my tools pretty hard, but I almost never blow out a watch in a year.

This time I wanted the analog/digital combination and the Casio Men's AQ160WD-1BV really caught my eye. I loved the black face with the white hands for easy visibility plus the extra large digital read. My habit of just quickly glancing at my wrist to tell the time is something I wanted continue and this watch meets that need. I read all the reviews on Amazon about the negatives and it took me a couple of days to decide to take the risk and buy it. I am so glad I did! I've had the watch for a month now and it has met and exceeded all my expectations! If there is any negative it would have to be that the digital face of the watch is hard to see in the daylight unless you turn it at the right angle.

I love the size of the digital layout and the metal band is durable. To resize the band, push out the pins from the side that looks like screws.Pros: Accurate, good looking, multiple alarms, timer, and stop-watch.Cons: Metal band latch sometimes deforms, making it hard to latch. You have to bend it a certain way to make it work. The analog hands sometimes get out of sync with the digital time. You can fix that easily, but annoying sometimes. Lastly, at night you can't use the watch features. There is a light, but it occupies a button used for setting alarms and such. So if you are setting your alarm, you can't see the display. Timex has a night feature that, once enabled, turns the light on with every button press. My former watch had it and it was a very handy feature.Great for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good watch but disappointed","review":"I was looking for a watch with both analog and digital outputs. I found this one that fit the bill. It wasn't very expensive so if it bit the dust at work I wouldn't mind too much. The only problem I found was the dial window. It's plastic. Soft plastic. Unfortunaly only a week after buying the watch I already had several scratches on the face that made it more difficult to see the face. If the dial window was more resilient I would be very happy with the watch and give it 4 or 5 stars but as it stands it gets a 2... barely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap construction","review":"Strap is either too loose or too tight, because the links are a little too big.

The watch had literally died.

It looks hefty but holding it instantly reveals that the bulk is cosmetic. While the watch looks to be made of metal, only the strap is.

Also, The silver ring around the glass (plastic) does look a bit cheap, would have been nice if it matched the band. I specifically was looking for digital but with the analog silver classy look, for the price this was the one. I started to notice when I need to know what time it is I look at the digital and when I want to know how much time I have left (till the hour and such) I look at the arms for quick reference.

Only complaint and I shouldn't actually complain because it was only 28 when I bought, a piece of metallic rim around the dial has lost its shine. I wish they made this model with slightly better rim. I wouldn't mind paying extra bucks for that. My former Casio was $70 and continues to look impressive (except for scrathes on the glass, but its 3-4 years old).Casio's are great. I currently own 3 of them in working condition.

It is well written and presents interesting ideas.The second part of the book however leaves something to be desired.

The suspension and hat were both included and in great condition, unlike another vendor that I ordered from on Amazon.My only complaint is the FedEx Smartpost shipping.

We're both union construction workers, just different trades. When I ordered them, I wondered why they were so much cheaper than the very same ones other vendors were selling. When I received them, I found out why. They were dusty, one had a small crack in the rim, and both were expired. (Yes, hardhats DO expire. Look at that barely visible calendar on the inside of your hardhat.) My bf and I still ended up keeping them and using them ... it wasn't worth the hassle of sending them back. I've wacked my head a few times with this hardhat on. I've been accidentally hit with falling nuts and washers. My hardhat hasn't shattered, so it's doing what it was meant to do. I'd buy the MSA Skullguard again, it is the gold standard as far as hardhats go, I just would not buy from the same vendor.

Fits the space perfectly and holds 24 of my favorites. I have standard size jars from different spice companies and have no trouble getting them to fit, but larger ones won't. The bottles go in and come out easily. The only problem I had was that the bottles flew out when I went over a speed hump or a rough railroad track too fast. That was easily fixed by cutting pieces of thin cardbord and inserting them in the racks while I was on the move. No more flying jars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Needs More Width","review":"Nicely constructed of quality wood and I like that it has 4 shelves.

There is a wire inside around the top spokes that apparently either came apart or snapped a small piece off.

But lately. . .I don't know what to say. I'm sure I'm in the minority here, but Charming the Prince was awful. And so is this book. A silly plot, contrived partings, heavy-handed attempts at humor, the stereotypical sisters, I could go on and on, but I won't. Suffice it to say, I was terribly disappointed.

As is typical with Medeiros' novels, this one has a snappy plot, fast-paced dialogue, and is chock full of the author's trademark humor. It is not, however, her best character study, as the hero is not as strongly developed as he could have been.

I fell in love with \\"the Dragon\\" right along with Gwendolyn and to me, that's true magic! (I have to confess that I also fell a little in love with Tupper, too!)

They are now in love, even though I wasn't sure how they got there so quickly. The whole book moved like that, you are just supposed to take it for granted that they \\"love\\" each other, when you're not even sure how this could be.

She is bound, staked, and left in the courtyard of the ancient fortress of Weyrcraig to die at the hands of the Dragon. Gwendolyn, however, does not believe in dragons, and the Dragon does not have much of an appetite for virgins.

I love dark, tortured heroes in general, so he attracted my attention at once. The heroine, on the other hand, was something completely different. She was stubborn and childish. It is all right that she isn't a typical beauty, but it really isn't necessary that she is referred to as being fat. As for the story, I liked the whole dragon idea. It was fresh, and had me interested in a minute. But, unfortunately, only for a minute. I don't know what the heroes saw in each other. They didn't even know each other. There was only passion. And from the moment when Bernards identity was revealed, things went downhill."},{"rating":"2","title":"new book, new favorite","review":"The bride and the beast was a lovely romance, not like some where the whole object is to praise a womans lush svelt golden body, or the mans bronzed muscles. It was more like what one would hope for on a odd day to make you feel comfortable and happy. The dialoge (or banter) was a lovely mix with the dark and sexy \\"dragon\\".

This is just the kind of book and attitude that makes people think that runes, tarot, and other divination systems are evil and the devil's work. If you are interested in learning about runes, consider reading ANY other book on this subject. You will be glad you missed this one, just like you are glad you didn't drink that glass of sour milk.

Sometimes we recite it just for fun (yes, we are nerds). We find the Napping House in pictures, remember the Grandma who broke the bed (or the cat who clawed the dog!), see a rainbow and think of the book.However, if you're looking for a cute book, a book you'll read with enjoyment but that will not live with you or touch you, a book that you'll give away when your kids have outgrown it, \\"The Flea's Sneeze\\" is fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 DOAs","review":"BOTH CDs contained tracks with 1 or 2 seconds of static in them.

Hearing the \\"street bands\\" and the \\"Desert Winds\\" was great, since I'm a big fan of source music, and the \\"new\\" Duel of the Fates?

Williams did a great job by making this music and Lucas did a better job by releasing this CD, lately. This is a 100% isolated music only track for the ones who enjoy listening to the music uncut and completely identical to the edition in the movie. But you still need the first CD, for it has unity in itself. But this CD's last 20 minutes are high-tense without interruption and this is the longest you can get. BUY this CD, put the movie in the VCR and play them simultaneously. You'll witness the triumph of \\"storytelling\\" with music. For the ones like me who know the movie by hard, enjoy the music everywhere. May the force be with John Williams..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the soundtrack, but not the noises","review":"I bought this set a long time ago and loved it, but it was stolen. Then I found it for a great deal here on Amazon so I bought it. I some of the tracks still on my computer, but wanted the complete set once again. I actually didn't have a lot of time to listen to it until recently and I also noticed the same \\"pink\\" noise that another reviewer mentioned. It only happens a dozen times or so like he mentioned, but it is really annoying when it happens. Sad to think that probably a bunch of these discs are like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"People are too harsh","review":"I've read a lot of people were disappointed at the release of the 2-CD Ultimate Edition. Sure, there were a few flukes: No cue commentary on the inside sleeve jackets or unreleased scoring and the fact I miss William's 70s style a great deal...but if you want the first two, you'll just have to wait until Williams is good and ready or buy a bootleg. Let me tell you something: Before this came out I had 3 bootlegs of the score, the longest of which was 2 Cds but lacked about 20-30 minutes worth of scoring, and I have yet to find a better, more complete release. The first CD release was rather iffy to me, it still collects dust on my CD rack, while the 2cd is played rather often. For you bitter, cynical people who apparently have lost all faith in Williams altogether, I strongly suggest grabbing Michael Giacchino's score to Medal of Honor and Medal of Honor: Underground. It's 70s-early 80s William's brillance."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Definitive Star Wars Episode I Film Score","review":"John Williams' latest \\"Star Wars\\" film score is a splendid mix of both the old and new, in which he intriguingly blends choral and orchestral music in several sections of the score. By far the best segment of the soundtrack is \\"Duel Of The Fates\\". I am quite impressed with Williams' complex orchestral textures throughout the score; certainly it is among his most elaborate compositons for film. And yet, I did not find it nearly as memorable or as compelling a score as those he's composed for \\"Empire Strikes Back\\" or \\"Schindler's List\\". Still this receives a highly favorable recommendation from me to fans of \\"Star Wars\\" and John Williams' film music. Of course, it is brilliantly performed by the London Symphony Orchestra."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lo mejor, la música","review":"Sin lugar a dudas, este CD doble es largamente mejor que la pelicula.

I've owned both CDs, but this terrific set blows the other out of the water. It makes me wish more record companies put out these kinds of sets.That said, we've got the definitive soundtracks for Episodes I, IV, V and VI. So where's Episode II? Come on, Sony!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A promising item, but disappointing.","review":"A good, decent score by John Williams. Some of his recent work isn't quite as great as his older stuff; classics like Star Wars, Jaws, and Raiders of the Lost Ark. But, this is still a great soundtrack, nonetheless. The Duel of the Fates is worth it alone. What I like most is that every single piece of music from the film is here. I feel that I'm often annoyed with other soundtracks that omit random tracks for whatever reason. Not the case here. It's all there.Buyer beware, however, as this product is flawed. It took me two purchases and a little research to discover that every unit of this product has a gliche where discs skip. So, know that it's not just your particular item or the CD player. I'm not really sure why they would put a defected product on store shelves, and for a high price. So, if you're not too picky about having the soundtrack in its entirety, you might be better off getting the original edition instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUYER BEWARE READ THIS","review":"As another reviewer stated this release has several glitched spots on the disc where it suddenly emits a LOUD pink noise. Bugged me so bad the first time I purchased the CD again.... just to discover it's a faulty recording.The music is so good!!! But the glitching (at least 12 different places) is annoying enough to make it not enjoyable. It seems they didn't always sell these flawed discs? Can't imagine them being this way since the release 9 years ago."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible.","review":"Wow! I had been waiting so long for this CD and I am living a dream! Absolutely Amazing. I love it, the whole thing. Especially the Duel of the Fates track with dialouge in it. I've listened to it so much in the past two days I practically know every track. I would highly recommend this CD for any Star Wars fan. It is a absolute must!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD!","review":"This is a great orchestral soundtrack. I wish there was special expanded editions score to Episodes II & III."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice to have it all, but the best tracks were already released","review":"I think the other reviewers have said it best: it's great to have the entire score from Episode I, but the best tracks had already been released on the earlier disc. There are a few gems here, such as the Tatooine street singer and Jedi escape from the Trade Federation ship, but because this is the music as heard in the film, you sometimes don't get to hear a particular song or theme all the way through. For example, Duel of Fates, one of the best Star Wars tracks ever, is split just as the fight scene was in the movie, so you never hear the full version on this disc. I'd recommend getting both this Ultimate version and the previous release so you can hear the music both ways. Also, I've listened through both CDs twice and have had no problems with the sound (other reviewers have alleged static). I just wish Lucas would release an Ultimate edition of the soundtrack to Episodes II and III, which had even better music!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much analysis, not enough biography","review":"For a book in a series of biographies, I got this book expecting just that. Instead I found out only a little about one of my favorite authors, instead being overloaded with critical analysis. Many times Mikkelsen simply judges part of Cooper's work as good or bad with little explanation as to her judgements. Some of her analysis was good and the summaries of Cooper's works were useful, but I believe she did a bit too much analysis. Many times she read into scenes ideas that I did not think Cooper intended, often subjecting the writings to various critical approaches with little regard as to what Ms. Cooper meant when she wrote those scenes. It was just like my high school English classes - overanalyzation (sp?) without any thought of what the writer originally meant or what the average reader will get out of it. Less analysis and more biographical information would have been more pleasing to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Technical - Hardly Practical","review":"This thick book is filled with ALOT of technical terms and references to things that I will never do with my home movies.

But if all you want to do is make better home movies, check out John Fuller's Make Fantastic Home Videos. In a short amount of time, he tells you exactly how to shoot home movies just like the pros do it.

My other watch is also a Casio, from the Waveceptor series--solar, atomic, analog/digital--and it set itself as I removed it from the box.

Very badly designed watch. Did not expect this from Casio. And when I returned the watch, I got only half the amount I paid. Extremely unhappy with Amazon also that puts up these kind of watches in-spite of so many negative reviews.I actually got a very nice watch for $10 from Walmart about 6 years ago that I used extensively for 3 years and now carry it as a back-up that performed so good.

It is not an Illuminator light, just a plain old tiny bulb. I guess for $20 I should not expect much but I think next time I will spend a little more and go for a real metal watch. The old thing I can say I like is that the band is metal and does not have that little plastic end of the sports watch that keeps coming out of that \\"keeper band\\".

I am genuinely happy with the purchase. I agree with some reviewers that it takes a little time to figure out how to set the watch but my patience was rewarded and I figured it out. Setting the Casio really isn't any more complex than setting the Timex; just a different sequence of button pushing.I found the backlight to be more than sufficient, unlike some reviewers. It should be noted that frequent use of the backlight diminishes the duration of battery life but the watch takes a standard battery so replacement expense is not going to be prohibitive when the current one runs down.This is a good looking, functional watch with lots of features at an amazing price point.

I'm an airline pilot, thus travel half my life usually having to change time zones once/day. I just sold my Breitling and needed a watch like this, however, I have found that the face scratches very easily and now I'm looking through a cloudy face. Worse than that, setting the hands (the digital and analog \\"float\\" and aren't tied into each other) is tedious. Hands can only go forward, and only slowly (as in about 6 seconds/hour). Thus, changing time zones can take up to 3 min's. That said, I could buy 200 of these watches to the cost of a Breitling Aerospace, so I shouldn't complain.

It looks very nice but, it is made of a cheap metal coated with a shiny plastic. The band bends easily and becomes misshaped and pinches your skin and is very uncomfortable and has no way to adjust to your own hand size. Inside the watch was a complicated setting system where you had to hold a button for 10 minutes to set the digital time then do it again to set the analog time. This process was extremely time consuming and tedious. I do not recommend purchasing this watch for all of the above reasons. So far it has been imposible for me to find a good metal sports watch under $20."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable","review":"I got this watch in March 2011 and after 1 year, it stopped working.

You have to push one sequence of buttons EIGHT TIMES just to move the hour and minute hands. If you are trying to set the hour hand ahead 23 hours in Spring, you have to hold one button down for several minutes while the hands cycle ahead very slowly to set the correct times.

It was not difficult as one side of band has 7 links, the other 6. If smaller adjustment is needed, remove one of the links from the side that has 7 links, don't remove the link next to the clasp, remove the one next to it. Look at the back of the band. You will see arrows and below them, a small opening with a round raised nub. To remove a link, insert a small jeweler's type screw driver and PRESSING DOWN, at the same time push on nub in the direction of the arrow and the link will come out part of the way. It can be removed with needle nose pliers or if it's already loose enough, may be able to pull the pin out with your fingers. The watch has many great features.

The performance itself is too slow. The pianist are not the best Rock 2/3 players. Far from William Wolfram. Obscure orchestras which is OK if they're good. The dynamic range is much less than my other recordings. I have compared various sections with the CDs from better recordings and pianists. I cannot listen to the Naxos dvd after knowing what it should sound like.The video is well done and offers beautiful images with good production values.I suspect Naxos took an obscure, existing, poor audio recording they had access to and put it to video.I would suggest one should research the artists and orchestras before buying any of these musical journeys.

However, I became terribly dissapointed when I discovered that the DVD only contains pictures of different landscapes and \\"poetical\\" motives, accompained by the music.To be honest, I looked forward to enjoy the music performed live in a concert hall or something in that direction.So why by a DVD, when you can purchase an ordinary CD performed by better known orchestras and solo artists to a lower price?However, if you like to stair at the TV, watching russian landscape with a casual russian appearing from time to time while listeing to Rachmaninov, this is a great chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Be warned, this is not a live recording","review":"BE WARNED! If you think this is a video recording of an orchestral performance, you will be sorely disappointed, as I was. It is merely a SOUNDTRACK of Rachmaninoff, with pretty travelogue visuals glued on. There are NO VISUALS OF THE ORCHESTRA AT ALL, no shots of musical craftsmanship, pianist fingers skimming over the keys, musician faces concentrating, cellist fingers sawing, lips pursed on the oboe, impassioned conductor guiding the orchestra through the moves to bring an art object into being, etc. -- nothing of that. It is merely a travelogue plus audio CD. You may as well play the CD in your car, while driving through your own visuals.

Shannon zips between traditional-sounding folk and boundary-pushing Celtic-fusion... She may make more conservative folk fans grumpy, but listeners looking for innovation have rallied around her for years.

One of the things I love about the book is it promotes open dialog between parents, but also sisters and friends. I have seen it work in action, and my daughters made up their own 'sisterhood' contract which we posted on the refrigerator, and refer too, often. The chapters you can review first if there are subjects that are sensitive to you, however, I found the 'sex' chapter very well written and received by both girls. Our next step is to have a 'sisterhood sleepover' where the girls invite their friends, and we have some open discussions on self respect and respect of others. This is an excellent tool for a parent, or guardian of a young person."},{"rating":"2","title":"A valuable guide for girls","review":"I checked out this book and decided it would be perfect for my 16-year-old niece. The authors come across as really friendly and open, and they talk in a way that today's teens and preteens will understand--like big sisters. They tackle pretty much all of the major issues that girls face today and they do it without being the least bit preachy. Rather than just telling girls what's good, bad, right, or wrong, the authors continually reinforce that girls need to make their own decisions based on respect--for themselves and for others. The real value of the book is that the authors give the girls tons of information on which to base those decisions. I think kids really respond well to that approach--empowering rather than admonishing.

While on the holds list at the public library for Peyton, I decided to give her earlier works a try. This particular book was so horrible, just in the first few pages, that I don't think I'll waste time with anything else she's written. The story is non-existent, the characters are all the same and the tone is just silly. I couldn't tell if the narrator was drunk, but I definitely thought the writer was too shallow and patronizing to deal with. It didn't help that the author photo shows a prissy Janowitz standing in the middle of nowhere, rolling her eyes. Rolling her eyes at her own book, I think.

I'd like to think Janowitz is a better writer than Krantz, but frankly I'll take glitz, sex, and shopping over this senseless surrealism. Janowitz has a fine eye for detail, so her descriptions of the scenes were amusing, but the characters seemed indistinguishable from one another, and I cared nothing for their fate.

But the worst part is, the soundtrack is muffled, the music cheezy, it sounds like it was recorded on an 8 track in the back of a Dodge. The Mandarin version does not include software, as other versions do. Some sections of this just don't apply to Mandarin like they might in the Spanish or French version(i.e. the repeated use of the alphabet). What you get for the price is 6 \\"episodes\\" on 2 DVDs, which is about 1 hour 40 minutes, and then you get an audio CD which is just the soundtrack without the pictures, and that's it.

From surfing the best waves the world has to offer, the early days of the world tour and the unavoidable changes of the 70's.

I did lots of comparisons and am very happy with product. Easy installation and being able to pick legs/armrests up for cleaning is a bonus. I like that this adjusts to different widths. I do agree with other reviews about armrest being a tad shaky, but unless you opt for a permanent structure i.e. grab bar, I think all of the toilet frames would be shaky. I do not feel unsafe in any way, in fact the safety frame gives me a felling of being safe and makes it easier to use the toilet while a recuperating from surgery. Makes sitting and getting up safer and easier. Material is rust and scratch resistant which is also I nice feature because I live in a very humid climate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"My mother loves it. The only thing that caught me was you have a 50/50 chance you'll connect the two arm pieces incorrectly - I did. It was an easy enough fix to turn the short arm piece 180 degrees though.

And the bonus interview with Bill Moyers and George Lucas is fascinating too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant documentary!!!","review":"I have read all the books of Joseph Campbell, and none of them match the interview made by Bill Moyers with Joseph Campbell. Seeing Joseph answering questions of the human imagination, made me realize that he's a better speaker than writer. It made me see the real man behind extraordinary books. If you are after a visual explanation of what a Myth might be, then this 6 tape documentary is a must for your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"YOU CANNOT AFFORD TO MISS THIS","review":"There are many worthy videos out there, many books offering guidance, opinions, etc. but nothing compares to Joseph Campbell and Bill Moyers' the Power of Myth. To understand our culture, our religions, our fixations on good and evil, and our day-to-day existence, get your eyes opened and watch this DVD. I'm 46 years old, and I've struggled with aspects of Christianity, the other religions around the world, and my own seemingly unchartable variations of self, and to find Mr. Campbell addressing these issues and more is beyond great. I owe my new perspective of life to this series of interviews. I'm not so fond of Mr. Moyers, although I am grateful he did the interview, he is just not my cup of tea. However he did an EXCELLENT job and I applaud him. Thank God and the Gods and Goddesses from the beginning of time for Mr. Campbell and his studies."},{"rating":"2","title":"a message to improve the world","review":"i'll keep this short and sweet... if everyone followed joseph campbell's truely spiritual message, which encompasses all religions (myths), then the planet would be a much better, peaceful place.- stuff to live by. both profound and practical."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Myths Powers","review":"I think I have not yet seen another series quite like this. I first watched this about 20 years ago, and later purchased the DVDs enjoying the new view with fresh eyes a decade later. I like Moyers style and Campbells thoughts. Ahead of his time and making very interesting intercultural connections throughout.For me this is a 5 rated video, but you must understand I love academia and anthropology/spirituality. This will not be a documentary for all - I promise that. If you do not regularly find yourself seeking out documentaries and tend to spend more time in front of Hollywood style films I would encourage you to watch this - but understand that it is something very unordinary here.There are a lot of lengthy reviews here - but if you want to watch something on mythology and the power of the myth - this is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Words of Wisdom","review":"This serves as an excellent introduction to Professor Campbell.

Happy searching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoot me now...","review":"Joseph Campbell thinks about thinking too much that it has become unhealthy. His nonsense ramblings with Bill Moyers damage the young, still functioning, minds of America's youth. Campbell's story telling skills are sketchy and hard to follow. Campbell believes that all myths are part of human's subconscious and that if humans make mistakes they are unaware of what they are doing. Maybe the myths from the past aren't related to the subconscious. Honestly, has anyone ever proved that this hidden mentality exists? We cannot touch, hear, or see this state of mind. Yet, according to Campbell it must be real, it has to be the root of all good and evil in the world. For every error in this world he blames it on some fluke attitude. Wake up Campbell! Its called the subconscious for a reason-its hidden."},{"rating":"1","title":"Empty-speak, thy name is Campbell","review":"Credulity, thy name is Moyers.Interesting only if you enjoy hours of somebody speaking without anything to say.

I have trash and recycling cans outside and near my front door (I live in a townhouse) and they just looked ugly and needed to be hidden. I put this up and it hides the ugliness great. You can configure it however you like and I have made right angles so only one panel faces the front.

Kleiber's \\"Eroica\\" is marked by great rhythmic control and consistency, intensity, and a clarity of textures that is rare, even amongst the more technically-minded of conductors. I normally prefer a broad Funeral March, but Kleiber brings it off at a more marchlike tempo, because of the great intensity he brings to the music. As for the Fifth, no one has ever matched the ferocious onslaught of the First Movement or the majesty of the Finale in this performance. And the recorded sound, particularly in the Fifth, is awesome. As for the orchestra, only Mengelberg elicted such potent playing from the Concertgebouw as heard here. Now, more Kleiber from Decca, please!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Erich Kleiber's Beethoven","review":"After reading other reviews of this recording I was expecting an excellent performance, and I was not disappointed. It is vibrant, with a powerful forward driving force in both the III and V symphonies. Beautifully cohesive performances which strongly remind me of Talich's recording od Dvorak's New World symphony in the way the works are treated as a unit. The sound is a little tubby by modern standards but the ear quickly attunes to this. Overall, performances well worth having and to my ears more satisfying than Kleiber's later recording with the Vienna Phil (although the sound recording is of better quality)."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Movie couldn't be any better.

This movie tries so very hard (to the point where it is obvious) to be \\"adult\\" and handle an array of topics about sex and love. BORING! I've seen better films on LIFETIME, especially that one movie with Fred Savage beating women! In Search of is literally worse than television drama, there is NOTHING racy, over the top, or jaw dropping about this movie except for the smugness that seeps through! This film was a waste of time and somebody's money. Not bad for a community college class project, but other than that, about as intriguing as a monkey throwing feces at the camera! Actually that would have been preferred over the waste of celluloid that, In Search Of, is. If you are over 65, conservative, have lots of cats, love Jesus, don't know a thing about sex, and bored, this movie is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"For a short overview, this is extremely well done.","review":"We can't compare this little 90 page gem with weightier works. Still, this is a wonderful read. The author leaves behind much speculation and gives a well researched, easy to access, reading of Ruth. While she may have missed one important element in Chapter 3, namely that Ruth is asking Boaz to be willing to fulfill the spirit of the Law, not the letter of the Law by asking him to act as a Levir, not merely a Go'el...which then inspires Boaz, who then plays the same \\"spirit of the Law\\" card to dear old Mr. So and So.

This book is one of the exceptions.This work covers the major theories of pscyhotherapy and makes you feel like someone who has a firm grasp of them when you read it.

Doris and Marsha are suddenly speaking perfect Karentine (they couldn't in the other novels), the Tates' have Dwarfish ancesters instead of the Elvish ones as named in the first book, we have [over-sexed] aliens (actually, everyone is over-sexed) and someone named Kathy (where did she come from?). I kept expecting Garret to wake up at the end and find that this was all a bad dream.I give this book 2 stars only because I truly enjoy the rest of the series (to the point of reading them every third month or so).

I read all the novels chronologically several times a year (and have been doing so since I first picked up a Garret Novel in 1994).This book was a huge disappointment. I do not like stories that mix Science Fiction and Fantasy. (I like my Sci-Fi science-y and my Fantasy magical), and was surprised that Glen Cook added the Sci-Fi element to this series. There was too much gratuitous sex in the novel. (all written with good taste, but still - it was off-putting).

I am sorry I did. If my dog had not grabbed it I would have returned it. If you have read the other books in Glen Cooks Garrett series how can you help but be upset by this pale immitation. Gone is the marvolous pacing and quick wit. It has been replaced with bad jokes and worse style. It is ham handed and lacks the subtle sense of irony and twisted sense of humor that I have come to enjoy in a Garrett Mystery.

But now I have nothing to add that other fans of the series haven't already said.Indeed, this is Cook's weakest, darkest and most inconsistant book in the Files of Garrett PI line. Did he lose the will to write it, and only did so because he had a contract with the publisher? Did Mr. Cook lose his notes and didn't know who or what his characters were anymore (I was waiting for Morley Dotes to chow down on a steak any moment)?More's the pity becuase the events could have been the basis for Garrett's biggest adventure yet.

Certain key scenes (such as the one which opens the film) are simply missing, and others are contradicted altogether (in the film, the poisoned dress is fatal; in the book, the wearer survives and is sent to the Tower). Conversely, Amy Robsart's name and questionable death are in the book, but not the movie.These points might come about if the movie were loosely based on the book, but IIRC the book is based on the screenplay. The book is fine on its own, but as a novelization, it's mind-bogglingly bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book didn't help me...","review":"I started this book because I heard the movie was great.

For example in Chapter 22, titled the \\"Trading Diary\\", after just 30 business days (41 days) the model trade in the book yielded a return of just 1.04%.Indeed, the basic premise behind the pairs trade, forgetting all the fancy statistics I found is to simply to look at the chart and see if it's tradeable (i.e has it got a range-bound movement!!!).

It loses the seriousness of the themes it conveys by over-glamourizing the situation. In my opinion, it used more artistic licence than should be allowed, and even had major changes which undermined the whole concept of Offred NOT being a heroine, and lost the ambiguity of the ending. Whilst interesting for someone not already acquainted with The Handmaid's Tale, if you already know Margaret Atwood's novel you will be disappointed. I would reccommend reading the text to anyone who has watched the film and wants a deeper representation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Did they read the book!","review":"The book was full of action and suspense yet the film lacked all of this. The film lacked the feeling of opression and inner rebellion that offred experienced throughout the novel, and turned the ending into something like a trite romance movie, the same applies to her relationship with Nick. The regime of Gilead is barely addressed, and instead it seemed to concentrate on offred's relationship with men, changing the plot until it was barely recognizable, a dead Luke and Commander? Ruin the plot why don't you! However, Serena Joy (Faye Dunaway) gave a good performance in a totally new role independent of the book, as did the commander."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent","review":"This was a decent movie with fair acting and some interesting points, but it fails to go anywhere.While we get some background on the necessity of the Handmaids, we never really learn the purpose of the war, or any details like that. The movie is pretty boring, with passive acting which really doesn't stand out, and Natasha Richardson wasn't very convincing at all that she wanted to see her daughter again. I don't know; the book was very good, and although the movie follows it, it lacks something, andis just a long boring mishmash of potential.If this is on TV, you might want to watch, but otherwise just read the book and leave it at that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not That Bad","review":"I liked the concept of this movie and I really didn't think it was that bad. However,the acting was dry. The story itself was the compelling factor. I had no idea this was originally a novel. Now, instead of buying the movie I'm going to buy the book. This way I can be abosrbed in the story without having the visual details delivered to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange Things Afoot","review":"A very strange visionary tale that I believe suffers in adaptation from book to the silver screen, THE HANDMAID'S TALE does boast a very solid performance from an exuberant Natasha Richardson and an unusually stoic Robert Duvall. While I'm not exactly certain whether or not the point of the picture is made as soundly as it could be, the theme of genetic perfection is often times handled all too delicately on film. That said, the films does contain the pivotal scene of attempted conception, with Duvall and Richardson doing the nasty, while Duvall's wife aids somewhat in the process; this single scene, filmed in almost a basic documentary style and void of passion, stays with the average viewer long after the picture fades."},{"rating":"2","title":"thought provoking reading and viewing","review":"I taught this particular novel and showed the movie in my AP senior lit and comp class several years ago. After I made the decision to teach the book, I read a review in The English Journal by another teacher who had taught it. She raved about it. My students said the same things hers did...\\"Why did you save the best until last?\\" I lent my video to a student who lent it to a friend. I never got it back. The book and the movie force us all to examine how we view women...how we view women in the church...how we view women in society. They force us to examine the separation of church and state. The book is not the product of a bored, sick mind, but rather the product of a contemporary feminist author whose work routinely asks us to reexamine ourselves. The video is a good representation of the book, bringing to life events portrayed. The book is better, but the video is certainly worth watching.

If you want to see a film about a childless future, go and see Children of Men instead, which isn't perfect, but it is gritty and portrays a rather more realistic dystopia.Mind you, if you want to see a really mental dystopic future society, watch \\"Zardoz\\", that has Sean Connery wearing a belly dancers costume and flying around in a big giant head!

Everything I need and nothing I don't need. Hey, it even has instructions that are understandable!!On a side note - after many years, we still can't figure out my wife's digital watch - incomprehensible instructions. That's what I wanted to avoid with this purchase. I also wanted to avoid the larger G-shock models - they have a lot that are too bulbous for my wrist. This design is one of the smaller ones - I wouldn't purchase anything bigger.Alarms? I only need one. Readability - I need good contrast so it's easy to read. And, Indestructible! For $40?

Im a 41 yr old male that is HARD on everything I own. I work in the repossession business in GA (hillbillies are the craziest!!), and I need a watch that is just no frills, take a beating, accurate to a fault GOOD! This is it. Driving and operating a wrecker is hard on everything that touches it. If you dont think its hard work THINK AGAIN! Its nothing like what they show on the tube. Not even close. This watch can take the punishment required for the job. The only thing its missing is the retro pac-man function that some watches had in the 80's. That would be too cool. Then I could play pac-man while staking out a car ;pBut seriously, this is a really awesome practical everyday watch. And less than half of what some other big box stores want for it.

Now, I just glance down at my watch and copy the data right onto the document without having to think.The fact that this watch is virtually indestructable is an added bonus. I look forward to using this watch for at least a decade.UPDATE:I've been using this watch for 3 years now, going on my fourth. This is my favorite daily watch by far. I have dropped it countless times, banged it (by accident) against walls and tables god knows how many times. Lived in really humid environments for long periods without getting any moisture inside the watch. I also swim regularly during the summer time with my watch on.

Got it for a great price on amazon, $40 for a time tested, durable watch.My only issue is the top left button being too small. If this button was strictly for setting time and date, this wouldn't be an issue. Those are occasional use....The problem is that it's the reset for the stopwatch/timer also. Frequent stopwatch/timer users, may get a little annoyed using their nails or fumbling to reset.One alarm, timer, stopwatch, date, day, and time viewable in the main screen. Wish this came with the auto EL feature, but oh well....Other than that its a perfect watch. Everything said about the durability is true.

I thought it looked great, but I went with this classic G-shock instead. I spent $40.00.We both got our watches. His is fancy, has a pretty big face, and a bunch of features he doesn't seem to use. It's fit for deep sea scuba-diving, which he doesn't do.Mine is simple, tells time, and I can set it to an atomic clock myself.

I find that when taking a quick glance while working I need to be more deliberate and angle the watch towards me more than when I had a high contrast analog face, especially in dim light.

As a military aviator, I was initially impressed by the ruggedness of this watch but after 2 decades where I have replaced it only twice for a broken watch band and a dead battery, the value of this simple yet sturdy watch has been astounding.

I also had a titanium Breitling available. The Casio was my first choice for work. Over those years, I changed the battery twice (never because it failed) and I changed the plastic band three times (cracked due to rough use in woodworking - I kept an extra on hand). The time piece NEVER failed me - accurated to about 25 seconds per month and EASY to adjust to the precise second for on-time departures. If the styling fits your desires, this watch should be your first choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best watch I've found for the price.","review":"I'm so glad Casio is still making this classic version of the G-shock watch. This is the best watch I have found in this class. I own one of the original versions with the small light bulb for a light instead of the illuminator. The light has gone out, but the watch still keeps good time. It's still tough. It's still water resistant. Been through so much that I've had to replace several bands. Watch remains sound. I bought the illuminator version to have a light and to have a watch that wasn't beat up and scratched up like my original that I've had for well over 10 years. It functions just as well and has taken plenty of abuse in it's own right. Take it from someone who abuses their watches, this is a good watch to have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dope Watch","review":"This is the cheapest legit G-Shock you can get. I'm really happy with it. It looks good with almost anything & the time-telling is perfect. I like the timer as it comes in handy throughout the day for making tea, food, or just keeping track of whatever you need to keep track of. Alarm is pretty quiet & won't wake you if you sleep heavy. I missed a morning appointment because of it already haha. The stopwatch is great too if you use this for sports. It is crazy waterproof so don't worry about taking it to the pool, in the shower, doing dishes, whatever. I'm sure if you're looking at a G-Shock tho that you already know it's indestructible. Just because this is the cheapest one doesn't mean much. It still performs. I really wish they made a white one of this model near this price too. Will probably buy a few of these as gifts.

I am a heavy equipment mechanic and wear one all day and with the abuse i give it all day it holds up pretty good. Replaced my last one after roughly 6 years due to repeatedly bending and breaking the pins and finally wearing the holes so it wouldn't hold a pin anymore. I don't really fault the watch for that cause i am always catching the watch on things while im working on equipment and proper fitting replacement pins are hard to find unless you buy a replacement band with pins. Only problem i have with this watch is that everyone i've owned either gained or lost a minute about every couple months.

Good to great tunes and very good production (not terribly slick for this type of music). Rick Witkowski adds a bit of guitar here and there....never a bad thing.If you're a Crack The Sky fan who managed to stumble onto this review, by all means pick it up.

There are new tenants since Mr. Woodhouse dies and the Knightleys finally end up at Donwell."},{"rating":"2","title":"Joan Sutherland - The Art of the Prima Donna","review":"Joan Sutherland - The Art of the Prima Donna is the earliest recording with the amazing dramatic coloratura soprano and it is truly a gem. Sutherland sings the works of Arne, Handel, Bellini, Gounod, Verdi, Mozart, Thomas, Meyerbeer, Delibes and Rossini. The end result is nothing short of spectacular. The booklet contains well-written music notes by Alan Blyth and all the lyrics. Highly recommended indeed. 5/5."},{"rating":"2","title":"best ever!","review":"I rate this cd as the best representation of the art of the colorature in recording history-and that is no exaggeration. I am absolutely confident that every opera buff who listens to this recording will be blown away by Sutherland's shere mastery of technique and overwhelming sound. Ms Sutherland remains the one and only...the greatest coloratura ever heard..."},{"rating":"2","title":"most popular coloratura recital of all time...remaster","review":"This came out in 1960 and has been overrall through the years the best selling coloratura recital ever. By a landslide. Why? Sutherland is superhuman. She sings the most beautiful she's ever sing. Beat and forces Callas to retire.The reason it's not selling as well as it was even 2 years ago is becuse everyone has it. but this remastering better sound warrants a new purchaseThe special thing about this \\"Art\\" is the great remastering. Showing the glorious Sutherland sound for the first time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trained Seal?","review":"The problem with Sutherland was actually more serious than the \\"poor diction\\" mentioned by most critics. She seemed to have no concept whatsoever of opera as music drama. If you ignore the text in an opera, you cannot deal with issues of character or dramatic incident. You cannot even phrase musically. It is very easy to think of Sutherland more in terms of a circus act than as a musical artist. She was \\"husbanded\\" by Bonynge as a voice machine and never progressed. (Interestingly, listen to her 1959 Donna Anna under Giulini's guidance - she almost seems to be singing Italian. It's one of her rare fully \\"operatic\\" performances). The shame is that the voice fetishists ate it up, giving her no impetus to grow as an artist."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautiful Remastering of A Beautiful Classic Recording","review":"This recording has long been cherished as a standard in classical music. I have the Analogue to Digial Remaster (ADRM) CD set issued in 1989 of this and just compared it with the new ADD 24-bit digital stereo remastering from the original analogue mastertapes, and the sound enhancement is fantastic! I would strongly recommend this recording to everyone, even those that already have the 1989 issue. You won't be disappointed!"},{"rating":"2","title":"a Must","review":"This is one of the best recordings I've ever heard. Joan Sutherland's voice is very beautiful and clear. We can ENJOY the wonderful sound and voice of Joan Sutherland. Whenever I heard this disc, I think there is something special in Joan's voice. Compared with Callas' voice, Sutherland's voice lacks dramatic ability. But who cares? Sutherland's voice is beautiful. And this is one of the discs we can enjoy. I think this album is very enjoyable for even non-opera fan. ENJOY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Voice of the Century\\"","review":"Sutherland is the \\"Voice of the Century\\". Her \\"Art of the PRima Donna\\" is one of Decca's best selling recital for a coloratura ever.If you want to hear the most amazing display of vocal fireworks ever recorded. Buy this. You will not be disappointed.I even like it better than the legendary Norma and Lucia with La Stupenda."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sutherland's best recital! And remastered","review":"This is certainly one of the great cds of our time. Sutherland is stupendous to the point of possible \\"Coloratura of the Century\\" status here. I am also a fan of Callas, and she certainly is as great as Sutherland, but in a different way. Sutherland has the voice, Callas theater. Both are valid.I have to disagree with the review person who gave Sutherland one star and call Callas the almighty! Only GOD is almighty. Callas is great, but she is not almighty. This aside. I want to really recommend this recital again.The remastering of \\"art of the prima donna\\" makes it a must for all Sutherland fans to upgrade to this. The biggest difference is the size of Sutherland's high notes. And the echo effect of the older \\"art of the prima donna\\" release is now replace by a much nicer, more natural ambience. Listen, you'll see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most impressive cd for a coloratura, bar none","review":"This is the most impressive cd by a coloratura soprano that I can think of. I myself have worn it out several times even in cd.I highly recommend this.That's why they call her \\"La Stupenda\\". Because she is the best and is incomparable. This cd proves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A vital addition to any community or college library European history collection","review":"Prisons are tools of politics, both to detain opponents and as something to rally against. \\"A Chronicle of Jails\\" was an assortment of essays and memoirs written by Darrell Figgis in 1917.

For $50 ...it is only 10 min clips of interviews with her. I was hoping her entire sudition would have been on it. Did not happen.

I think Susan would be upset with this DVD charge and production."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is an interview with Susan - it runs abt 15 minutes.","review":"This recording consists of an interview with Susan, running about 15 minutes in all. That's it.The interview is nicely filmed and sprinkled with brief snippets from her famous audition (the one we all saw on YouTube), some recording sessions, and her travels. The interview is preceded by a one-minute introduction of hideous visual quality and featuring background music from Carmina Burana.I paid $2.00 for my copy (used), and that's about what it's worth, assuming that you really like Susan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soundtrack by Zbigniew Preisner","review":"I was upset to see that no artist was mentioned on the details page of this entry. Zbigniew Preisner is one of the best film composers in history. It is difficult to find his scores on CD in America.

You won't regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Price!!!","review":"The price is simply ridiculous. I seriously doubt it paying over a 100 dollars is worth it. People are just so greedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Performances of the Grieg and Schumann Piano Concertos","review":"I strongly commend Philips for reissuing these exceptional recordings of the Grieg and Schumann Piano Concertos. Kovacevich's fiery, dramatic performances of each score are filled with ample passion coupled with excellent technical skills at the keyboard. Without question, these are among the most exciting performances I have heard of either concerto. Sir Colin Davis and the BBC Symphony Orchestra are admirable partners with Kovacevich. The sound quality is quite good with Philips' lastest image bit digital remastering."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lite weight only","review":"If you're using some lite weights on this, it will be fine.

I have an ancient one that I then repaired."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Big","review":"Cost is nice, material is good, but its wayyy too big. My head slips between the straps.

Only issue it seems kind of big for my head but overall it works great"},{"rating":"1","title":"Have to Buy Head Developer First","review":"Before buying this product, I read the NUMEROUS reviews saying that it is way too big for the human head. I figured these reviews must have been written by people with small or medium-sized heads, that certainly no company would produce a neck developer too large for my own rather large head.Apparently you're supposed to use the head developer before you buy the neck developer, because only someone with an unnaturally large head would be able to use this product as demonstrated in the photo. I can kind of understand Everlast's position here: they don't want you to isolate the neck, neglect the head, and develop an uncomfortable disproportion between the two.If you don't intend to buy the head developer, you can still kind of use this product by carefully placing the straps or keeping them in place with your hand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Needs re-engineering...Good concept, Very bad design","review":"The only reason this thing sells, is that people don't know it won't fit them. All Everlast has to do is add some adjustable straps to this to be able to size it, and beef up the metal hooks and this would work good. But they don't. My question is, just who at Everlast tested this product? They didn't have anywhere near a normal sized head!! I wonder if somewhere down the line their manufacturer didn't screw up on the measurements of this thing. Don't waste your money on it unless you have the time and tools to modify it. By the way, I never write reviews, this is my first one, that should tell you how bad this thing is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Might work if wearing a motorcycle helmet - or not...","review":"Believe the bad reviews. I have, by all definitions, a \\"large head\\" but this was designed for Andre the Giant. No adjustability at all. Slides around and often doubles as a blindfold. No practical use. Likely will return if that path is of low resistance."},{"rating":"1","title":"For big heads","review":"Terrible product. I think I have a normal sized head and this thing is very loose.

I am not a small man and my dome is about a 7 1/2 hat size. That being said this thing is still huge! It is so big in fact that my head slips in between the slots of the front/back and center strap. I have to wear a knit cap just to make it stay!! All that and it still does what it supposed to do. Just be wary of the size."},{"rating":"1","title":"good for beginners only","review":"I was dissapointed with the construction of this head harness.the stitching started to rip with only a 40 pound load.the sizing was alright, only a little slack - which was easy to pad with a beanie."},{"rating":"1","title":"would have been nice if you could adjust it.","review":"Bottom line is this would have been a good product if you can adjust it but you cant. I were a size 7 5/8 to 7 3/4 in a fitted cap and this thing is way too big for my head. After folding a large towel on my head and then placing it on my head on the towel it was then ok at best and did work for the simple up down motion. It really not worth the price and am not sure what group of people this was tested on because some people think I have a big head so I dont see how this fits most heads unless you have a helmet for a head. Oh and without the towel it will dig into your head like its trying to reach your brain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way to big for a full grown man's head!","review":"If you happen to have a head the size of a watermelon this is the perfect thing for you.

Don't buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Badly Designed","review":"I bought the Everlast Neck Developer today from a UK store. I wish I hadn't bothered. The S hook that is supposed to go through a hole in a standard diameter weight disc, is too big to do so. The hook is made too wide and won't fit through. I'm not surprised that the advertising photos I've seen for this product don't ever show it with weights attached. You'd need to put it in a vice or use a pair of pliers to squeeze the hook until it's narrower. I'd rather just return it to the shop.I should have known really. Most Everlast products I've ever bought before were cheap rubbish and had to be returned to the store.This product deserves no stars. Don't buy this product!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointed when it finally broke","review":"Had this thing for about 6 months and it finally gave way. The strap with the attachment on it broke. No way to fix it, the stitching broke and the rubber flimsy insulating strap inside the strap snapped. Another problem I had was that this thing was just too big for my head. This could have been the problem , that the weight was not distributed evenly through the straps. But all in all it was great getting to use this and getting to know this product. I have definately strengthened my neck with it and am happy with the results but not satisfied. I am currently looking for something a little more flexible for side to side neck strengthening. I was only able to do front and back neck exercises because the thing was so big I couldnt do anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad advice","review":"I felt this man's dislike of the medical field from page one and I will not allow another's negative and personal feelings challenge my success.

One has a Hep D co-infection and is following the Hep C treatment which is interferon. Interferon cures about 70% of Hep C patients, so you do have treatment options. Milk thistle and other herbs just don't do anything, no matter what this quack says. There is no conspiracy. Hep C like all chronic hepatitis cases has a spontaneous cure rate meaning the body will cure the virus by itself. Nothing in this book changes the spontaneous cure rate. So there is lots of anecdotal evidence of cures but these \\"cures\\" are just not caused by anything this book recommends.I know a diagnosis of Hepatitis is a scary thing.

Before picking up this book, you need to be aware that this delves into a bit of Freddie Mercury's life offstage. If you can't handle learning the color he picked out for his kitchen cabinets, his drug of choice, or the fact that he shacked up with a man, then you probably shouldn't consider adding this to your library.Personally, I liked the book a lot. It isn't the greatest piece of literature on the planet (subjective, I know) but I find it really cool to get some hints about Freddie as a person rather than just as a musician and entertainer. And while I may be an embarrassingly huge fan of Freddie and Queen, that doesn't mean that I instantly love every single thing that's ever had to do with either of them. If I thought this book was crap, I'd tell you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good?","review":"I just wonder one thing..... all of you people who thinks this book is good and that it gives a true account of what really happened, don't you think it's quite telling that the only one who has NOT written a book on Freddie is Mary Austin? She is the only one who has actually kept the secrecy he wanted and not tried to cash in. I first thought that it might be intresting to read this book because I am a big fan, but I later realised that if I truly admire his music and his creativity, I don't need to know everything about his private life. And if you truly love someone, you don't have to go and write a book about them splashing out all horrible details about them. Jim did obviously not like the fact that the house went to Mary and that the place of his burial was left only to her, but he must have known that she would be the only one to honour his wishes and she has, his other \\"friends\\" and lovers more than ready to share everything intimate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Openhearted man.

My husband got it right and said, \\"Jim Hutton was only a gardener who got benefits\\". This is NOT a capture of Freddie Mercury, this is Jim Hutton's fantasy of what HE thinks went on between him and Freddie. Hutton was EXTREMELY jealous of Mary Austin, who was Freddie's long time confidant, who was Freddie's dearest friend. I would adore anything that Mary would put down on paper about Freddie because Mary is the ONLY one who knew Freddie best. Not \\"the gardener with benefits\\". Absolute trash, Absolute National Enquire (America) or Sun (UK) material. I know it's not nice to speak ill of the dead but Jim Hutton had no IDEA. None at all and he should have left well enough alone, because he was not there, he was only there in his fantasy world. The pictures were nice, that's why I gave it two stars instead of one one star."},{"rating":"1","title":"A review on a book I have not read and with good reason!","review":"I don't think that Freddie Mercury would have liked the fact that one of his lovers would write a book about him in shocking detail. Freddie was a very private person and would have been furious if people all over the world knew the private details of his life and last moments. I find the whole idea of even writing a book about him completely disrespectful. It is because of his beautiful art and powerful voice that we should remember him and hold him dear to our hearts. Freddie deserves respect in death, and I think his former lover did him a disservice writing this piece of obvious trash. I will not be buying this book, and if you are a true fan, you won't either."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete rip-off and torture to read!","review":"I'm a die-hard Queen Fan and this book was a complete chore to read. It's obvious Mr. Hutton has nothing to say which explains why 95% of the book has to do with Freddie's garden, Freddie's Cats, and Freddie's expensive taste in dinnerware.One can literally turn to any page in the book and one of those three things will be elaborated on with excruciating detail. I give this book a 1 and it earns it only by its moving description of Freddie Mercury's final moments. This \\"insider's look\\" could have easily been written in 15 pages. Woe to those who sift through the other 229 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it!","review":"When this book came out, a friend bought it for me. I read it within about 2 hours and proceeded to throw it across the room. It was written poorly and I felt, written to gain a buck from the tragic death of Freddie. I found myself questioning if the author was telling the truth. Since Freddie is gone, we obviously can't ask him; I will stick with my original thought that the author is a 'hanger-on' who only wanted money. If the author truly knew Freddie, he would NEVER have written a book about the personal life of a very private man; Freddie would not have approved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mercury and Me by Jim Hutton","review":"Freddie and Me, June 30, 2009By Zahira Andujar \\"zandujar\\" (PR) - See all my reviewsAs I was reading first Freddie Mercury will be upset about this book. At the end, a man who gives so much, I think they should not take good care of him in last days for example the cleaning manteinance, bath him as he like frequently, and the worst they let him had the wet bed and also they had doubt in change it, if Freddie can talk that time, I know he scream and put all of them out of his home. They seem just want the Garden Lodge, and the gardener seems cold heart. Very sad story Freddy Mercury give a lot and the others just take. I think he really love Mary and she did very good at the end put all of them out of Freddie home. None of them really cried from heart, only thinking where they will go? Not missing him at all, only missing the good life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truth or false?","review":"Starting reading this book it seemed really interesting - what the reader can't understand is how, since the author keeps mentioning how Freddie Mercury cherised his privacy, the book is full of detailed descriptions of the most private actions of Mercury! This doesn't show that much respect to his memory... Since Hutton knew how much Freddie liked to keep his privacy he should have respected this wish of his eventhough he has been dead six years now. Also, many people including the surviving members of Queen, mention that the book contains lots of mistakes and false events - especially concerning Mary Austin's, Freddie's lifelong friend, behaviour.A book for the author to get money as it seems, unfortunately, unless of course there are things we don't know."},{"rating":"1","title":"Many errors, seems like an updated NT3.5 book.

By revealing details of their so-called \\"private\\" relationship, Hutton quite clearly shows that his respect for Freddie was, indeed, nil. Freddie, so noted for cherishing his privacy, has been horribly insulted by his ex-lover via this book. Oh wait...the book does illuminate one item flawlessly: that Jim Hutton was a self serving and envious jerk!! His insane jealousy of (heterosexual) Mary Austin, the love of Freddie's life, couldn't be more evident. Five stars, Mr. Hutton, for achieving \\"Ultra Tacky\\" status. Given to me as a gift, I skimmed through it, felt really bad for Fred, then gave this bog roll a proper \\"burial\\" by tossing it out with a garbage bag full of used cat litter. ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie is terrible.

And I'm sorry but there is a raped scene in this movie which ADV films make fun of in there own personilized english dubbed. I won't go into details about that scene cause what they did was sick.

But on reacquaintance I must say that the mono sound is more than a bit edgy and shallow. When reviewers say that Maria Reining is past her prime, I think it should be clarified; her voice is mature but still beautiful--she's a Marschallin well into her forties. Of course, if you love something, you love it as a whole. On the whole I still love Kleiber's conducting, which is so clear and unsentimental (insofar as that's possible amidst so much strawberries and cream), and even more I love the touching reminder of old vienna before the horrors of WW II descended and destroyed a golden illusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I was so excited to get this book.

The Carnival is static and boring - and that's being as positive as possible - no regal Royal March here, only tired lions sitting down in the dust one after the other; the Hens and Cockerals certainly don't stretch and cackle or lay an egg as the music so beautifully suggests; the kangaroos are in fact wallabies; the fossils are photos of composers (Schubert, Mozart, Beethoven) and as such are grossly insulting. And the opportunity to show excitement of the duo pianists playing is completely missed, instead showing just an open piano on a vacant stage and empty theatre seats. All in all, very lazy photography. Not a redeeming visual moment on the entire disk, I'm afraid. And the Bizet is worse!

The author is practical and surely knows his lesson but by selling a book on ultradev I would have expected more on it.

Andrew Cohen gives us a brief overview of the history of Canadian foreign policy, dispeling several myths including our supposed past of being primarily neutral peacekeepers. At the end of ww2 Canada's military was the 4th largest in the world with the capacity to develop nuclear weapons if necessary. More importantly, Cohen reveals information about the state of the current military detachment in Afghanistan which makes one wonder whether our presence there is more of a liability than an asset to coalition forces."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth The Read","review":"Thought it was amazing.

There is no meaningful or interesting dialogue between the girl and the boy.

Then once familiar, listening can be more fruitful. I managed to master a few important phrases like Hello, yes, no, I don't speak Hungarian, do you speak English, excuse me, how much, where is.. and sorry. But if I could do it again, I would have made a more concerted effort to learn my numbers (at least to 5) and as much of the CD as possible. It is only one CD, but it covers a lot of material.

Still these are remarkable, distinctive performances which should be recognized as among the finest recordings of Chopin's Nocturnes.

They play with rich tone, technical brilliance, and interpretive subtlety. Their program consists of three stylistically diverse works: Mozart's Trio in B Flat Major, K. 502; Brahms' Trio in C Major, Op. 87; and Hans Werner Henze's Kammersonate.The Mozart and Brahms works are both masterpieces and receive performances that do them justice. The Henze piece (an early work from 1948) is not on the same artistic level as the other two, but it is the work of a highly accomplished and talented professional, and it is brilliantly performed.

The water heated, began steaming, and a few tiny bubbles rose to the surface... but simply never broke into a rolling boil. We tried cooking one of the pieces of meat in the water, but it was clear that the water simply wasn't hot enough, and was never going to get hot enough. We ended up cooking our shabu on the stove.

'Die Walküre' has a lot of silent, intimate moments with almost solo instrument playing, and then you can hear a lot of 'noise' in this recording.I don't mean stage noise, but you hear a lot of audience coughing and more annoying, someone is constantly whispering the text just before the singers actually sing the lines.I can understand that it must be almost impossible for the singers to remember pages and pages of text (especially for Wotan in this opera), and maybe it's common to have a 'souffleur' in the pit in Wagner performances , but on repeated listening this really distracts.So you must be aware that this is a live recording after all, with a lot of electricity but also with some disadvantage ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dr susan Love's menopause and Hormone Book","review":"So far so good.

The hour hand has a red color on the tip that is very pronouce. The thermometer sucks big time. When you wear it, the temp increased by about 10 degrees! The instruction says you can calibrate the temp but the calibration is for setting the accuracy of the temperature and does not factor the body temp."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dont buy this watch if you want temperature functions!","review":"So disappointing. The temperature sensor is in the backing plate which if you are actually wearing the watch, would be next to your skin. Therefore, your body temp skews any temperature reading. When I called Casio to find out if there is a calibration tip to offset the body temperture reading, their suggestion was to take the watch off and let it adjust to the exterior temperature and read it then put the watch back on. That would be real convenient. Even when wearing the watch, it gave me some unknown temperature that neither corresponded to my true body temperature or the air temp. A major disappointment overall even though all of the other features worked fine if you dont mind reading around the watch hands for the digital information. You dont want this watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"very pleased with this watch","review":"I bought this watch for the thermometer and once it was calibrated for body heat it is very accurate.

The wristband broke at the hinge that connects the band to the watch. So, I can't buy new bands for it. It also has way too many functions than are necessary for me. I took this to the beach and initially found myself using the tide function a lot, but after a while I didn't use it. The moon function is also not necessary. And the thermometer isn't accurate when it's on your wrist.The worst design flaw was that the light doesn't stay on for more than about 1 second. So, at night, if you try to set the alarm or view other functions you have a lot of trouble. I wound up having to push the light, then push the mode button twice, then push the light, then push the mode button, then push the light, then get into setting the alarm (but still not set), then push the light, then change the alarm hour, then push the light, then continue changing the alarm hour, etc. You get the point.

I got over that. Next problem was that the tide did not callibrate with my actual tides - I got passed that by tweaking one of the settings a couple of hours and that works fine.Big Problem - surfed with it twice, nothing too extreme, and there's now water under the crystal.

My mother needs a new band before she can use it. After it arrived I did recheck the listing once more. Further down, in another part, it says \\"man made.\\" Does that mean real man made leather? NOT! I gave it 2 stars because the face was as expected. It arrived in a timely manner but in a broken plastic case. The piece that the watch sits on within the case was broken.

I'm not a big fan of these operas, but it's unlikely you'll ever hear them sung with more beauty or understanding.

Is Kepesh reprehensible? Of course he is, and that's precisely the point. And whether you view the book as misogynistic is BESIDES the point, like it or not. Any capable reader would be wise not to equate Kepesh's character with Roth--even if resemblances to \\"real life\\" may occur here and there. Roth could easily become more \\"politically correct\\" to woo and coax the Noble Prize bigwigs, but he doesn't, and that to me strengthens his reputation as a writer.

Without the subtlety and grace of Nabokov's \\"Lolita\\", the Dying Animal is a boring account of a boring, pathetic old man, and at the end of the novel we are left with absolutely no impression that Roth has any understanding of his central character, other than the fact that he obviously likes young breasts.

How long can one really carry on with an obsession? Apparently, forever. And though he used her for her body, it was the cause of his torment and the standard by which she measured other sexual encounters, showing the strongest aphrodisiac may simply be being desired.What I found most refreshing is that Roth isn't censored and some of the scenes and lines made me laugh out loud, which I felt was inappropriate at first but is one of the reasons I thoroughly enjoyed reading. He really has a knack for illuminating the inner workings of the human psyche--the things most people try to hide. Roth creates such perfect pieces of art!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing like the best Roth and here's a tip","review":"When you love a book, as I did \\"Portnoy's Complaint\\" and \\"The Ghost Writer\\" even more than Roth's later books, though I felt keenly attuned to \\"The Counterlife\\" too, you Remember the scenes vividly even if, as I am, you are aging and tend to be forgetful. Now, I read \\"The Dying Animal\\" only two months ago, not 25+ years ago, and I remember breasts, the cancer, the man's consciousness, but vaguely as lesser books are forgettable or become vague. Just writing this helps me clarify how to tell if you love a book and if you find it worthy: how much and how well can you conjure back, vividly. Here, not much. But with Roth, one has a large selection from which to choose. I'm a Rothophile, and do not expect genius each time out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a Fan","review":"Roth writes well and the book keeps your interest throughout.

They wash each other but careful not to touch the good parts.A third girl gets in the act but doesn't allow her bikini to be removed. I didn't think it was a very good sequence. The rest of the show is the Mardi Gras Street and Balcony scene type(I'll show you my boobs if you'll throw me your beads). The old boobs for beads program.

In order to watch this thing, I suggest you inget a fifth of Old Crow and smoke a few joints so that your mind would not have to absorb its full, horrible impact.

Rather than a birth to death chronology, the book focuses on particular subjects.

Its thematic not strictly chronological, much like Joe Ellis' book on Thomas Jefferson, \\"American Sphinx.\\" Very nicely written, and even after I have read many, many GW books, I still learned some interesting new things about him from Henriques (such as the details about GW & Sally Fairfax, and GW's death.) The one thing the author botches is any discussion on Washington as a Freemason, which was one of the most important things in his life.

Instead, we get an obvious antiwar movie. I don't care that he is against the war, that's his right and none of my business. But politics do not belong in a movie like this. I can see why people took offense. If he stayed neutral, focused on the criminals who did this despicable act and not use the media as a message, then it would have being a lot better. A particularly egregious example is the ending montage. I noticed that in one shot, De Palma actually used an image from his movie. An image from a fictional event in his movie. That one shot put doubt in my mind that Americans actually were responsible for all those casualties."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing film","review":"I was looking forward to watching this film having seen everything that's been done on the Iraq war and being a De Palma movie fan. But this film was a 'stinker'. 90% of the movie is watching home video of the characters who with all due respect for serving their country, are mostly racist,ignorant and sadistic. The worst criticism I can state about the film is that for the most part it's just boring. The 'message' of the film, that war is insane and it makes those who have to fight it insane is clear enough and even honorable. But watching that message thru one dimensional characters showing what idiots they are, while recorded by the soldier who aspires to go to film school when the war ends, is just not entertaining.The violence and sheer boredom presented are all done okay but the story just 'lays there' and no character grabbed me or created any rooting interest. I would not recommend this film to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fictional documentary on war in Iraq","review":"Brian DePalma's presentation on war on Iraq. The idea was to make the film from a soldier's point of view and it involves real life incident of group of an American soldiers who rape 15 year old Iraqi girl, kill her and her family and set them on fire to cover the evidence. Film is made from both party's point of view on the war, perpetual extension of duty for the soldiers who serve there and risk their lives every day and difficulty of ordinary Iraqis to live their lives under such circumstances. For Iraqi's even crossing security checkpoints guarded by American soldiers can be deadly in cases of emergency when they need medical help for woman giving birth. Director is not justifying either party, but he plainly tries to make a point that war is bad and it is mostly the civilians that pay the highest price. While I can hail this movie for its attempt of promoting pacifism, I found it to drag at times primarily because the actors in it were very bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ah!

The answer this book gives is that people like to have fewer choices and be told there is just One True Way to believe - and live. I found the discussions of ancient Egyptian monotheism and the different trends in Jewish belief interesting corollary to the discussion. No wonder modern fundamentalists of various persuasions condemn Western culture as 'pagan' - it's because we have choices: in what we buy, how we amuse ourselves and who we elect. The author highlights the modern political crisies which have resulted from conflicts among the three big monotheistic faiths, but stops short of suggesting that rational human beings might look elsewhere for spiritual comfort and enlightenment."},{"rating":"1","title":"War on Monotheism Still Exists Today","review":"This was written by a Jewish historian, so ANY book you read about religious wars, or religion, need to to be written by someone not biased. The Jews had a dirty hand in getting their version of monotheism in action 5,000 years ago, because they were extremely jealous of the Roman Empire and tired of getting their butts kicked. The historically too-tolerant Pagan Romans and Europeans just welcomed ANY ole' culture and race with their bizarro religions into that part of the world, and as you can see now, multiculturalism does not work. The reason why is because one culture or race will always end up dominating the others. That's why there are continents divided up by oceans, that's why we have nations with land borders... so psychopaths who believe they are the Chosen people of God can have their own living space and nukes and missiles (aimed at every European city), so we don't have to live around them.

Perhaps that's why the Chieftains' music resonates with me. I first heard of them in the late 1950's when I became aware of American folk music and it's strong Scots-Irish heritage. Today I'm a fan of many so-called American Roots acts / bands who are more than little influenced by Celtic music. The Chieftains are a way to understand the basis of much American music, great exponents of traditional Celtic music, and just plain fun to listen to. This album is almost entirely instrumental with one song that is as compact a lesson in Irish-American history as I've ever heard. I also strongly recommend the Chieftains 50th Anniversary album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Adorable","review":"This outfit is adorable on a little boy!

My grandsons aren't twins, which is why I wanted the difference in the outfits, but really, it became a moot point when they were both in their outfits. They were absolutely adorable!

I think this disc accurately portrays the truth behind both of these viewpoints. The Tchaikovsky points to the former, the nature of this concerto suits Heifetz's style down to the ground, and he really does impress in this work. However, the Brahms is a work that benefits from more measured tempi to bring out the autumnal grace of the opening or the bouncy nature of the gypsy dance in the finale. Thus, Heifetz's (very impressive) race through the work is not entirely satisfactory, and places Reiner in the difficult position of having to keep up while maintaining the integrity of the orchestral part. This is not a bad recording, but I prefer violinists of the 'Oistrakh school of thought' in this work. In general, this disc is a violinists dream, but may not entirely satisfy as a whole."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Harmony and Orchestration","review":"This album offers some excellent cuts, the best of which is \\"You Light Up My Life.\\" The harmony, the blend, and the pace of this song is really good.

Lots of interesting stuff here (such as a chart showing how men's and women's \\"looks\\" in hairstyling, makeup, and the like changed decade by decade), and the photos and illustrations, both color and in B&W, are first-rate. My only real quibble - and this is something that's basically out of the control of the authors, as this book was published to accompany a museum exhibit from some years ago - is that the book doesn't cover more modern movies. As I said, though, that's not really something the authors can go back and fix at this point, and if you keep that in mind, you'll enjoy this book.

On the whole this volume lacks action just as previous two volume had provided but unraveling of major characters aboard in Nautilus is very amuzing. Particularly that of Captain Nemo is so intriguing and mysterious still. Borrowing the 20,000 leagues under the sea setting Captain Nemo also plays grand organ and this scene well describes the turbulent mind of the captain. And Nadia's abhorence of eating meal is well shown in Episode 12.

This book is very new age, very spiritual and it looks like many people in this world find it useful, but I can only think how void of sense their lives are if this silly, childish search help them. It is pretentious and grandiloquent. Perhaps I am very rationalist and skeptical, and this book is a kind of run-of-the-mill Platonism and Hegelianism: this world is not the real Reality, our life is not the real life, but there is a better one somewhere sometime if you just stop thinking and follow... what?

For those of you who do not understand the criticisms of the book, it is not just its fictional aspect that has caused problems. For one thing, Aboriginal people are tired of having white people speak for them and the claim that this group chose a white American to transmit their message (even fictionally)is offensive to many. Please celebrate Aboriginal culture but make it the real one, the one real people live, not a white fantasy. Also the idea that these people are apparently dieing is too much like the ideas the 19th -20th governments used to ignore Aboriginal issues and steal children as 'they'll all be dead soon anyway'. Aboriginal people are a living people - not a metaphor for spiritual enlightment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Misleading Book","review":"There is much wisdom to be gained from Aboriginal culture, but the \\"wisdom\\" in this book is NOT Aboriginal, but rather made up by the author.

It is just another form of cultural imperialism dressed up in New Age language.The author has ignored the wishes of the local Aboriginal people, who have repeatedly asked her to retract her statements. She blithely continues her best-selling run, apparently without a care in the world for her subjects.I don't agree with censorship, but this would be one book that deserves to be left off the shelves.

Marlos original claims that this book was based on fact are highly offensive to Indigenous Australians. The author romanticises an ideal of the 'noble savage'. It is precisely this type of book that perpeptuates neo-colonialism. I suggest the author was suffering a 'mid life crisis', in which she attempted to use and invent a fictional notion of Indigenous culture for her own self satisfaction. Not worth reading! If you are interested in the topic, try one of Henry Reynolds book, or Richard Broomes. There are many credible sources that detail the cultures of Indigenous Australians. But Mutant Message Down Under is not one of them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trivialized human evolution.","review":"This book was cliche and corny. It reminded me of joining a cult.

I was so glad that it wasn't longer because I couldn't have taken another page. I don't understand all the reviews of \\"who cares if it is true or not\\". If a writer wants to get a message out, it can be done well without faking an experience.

On the way he met corrupt officials, shady government agents, benign monks and various enlightened natives. Obviously, he picked up a lot of New Age baloney at the same time. Plotwise, very similar to MMDU. The second book is \\"Amazon Beaming\\" and concerns a bearded photographer chasing aboriginal natives in Brazil. He loses all his possesions and treks for weeks through the jungle gaining insights and so on. By the way, the natives are telepathic. Is this all sounding familiar?

I wish that every person on this planet reads this book with an open mind and an open heart. It is about life itself and the human being in its most essential aspects. The author is telling her story in a very simple way that seems very understandable. But, we need to open more our perception to realize the very truth that is told in this true story. About the madness of the present consumator society that has forgotten the essential human values and keeps on in the worst direction of destroyng the nature, and since we- the humans are the nature,to the destroying of our own selfes. This book is also a reminder that the \\"primitive\\" people, or tribes, as the occidental \\"civilised\\" man used to name them, are the greates source of the REAL TRUE CIVILISATION. Because they live and deal with the life and the truth itself."},{"rating":"2","title":"True view?","review":"As practicing meditator I was captured when reading the book. It's not the way Marlo Morgan is writing, it's the message. Obviously she knows less about Buddhas teachings or The Way Things Are. But with every sentence and statement of the Aboriginees it's proving the message.When reading other reviews I see that there are many disturbing emotions and that people feel criticized in their way of life and thinking.But that's like allways: We all have a free will and can decide free what way we want to live (I'm not US-American, but there the constitution is one of the best documents ever written!). And nobody has the right to judge what anbody's choice is.I feel that those, who critize the book so harsh, are full of fear that their choice might be false. From here the best wishes for all.

However since the \\"death\\" of our precious child 5 weeks ago, we recently listened to the audio tape of this book and truly connected with it in a very deep and spiritual way. In many ways our journey of grief paralells Marlo's experience in the outback. We are learning to communicate in a whole new way with each other and our daughter. We have literally been \\"taken hostage\\" into a whole new land, one that at times feels hostile and depriving, but in reality is teaching us a whole new way of being and living life.

Indeed, it is a fantastic tale.However, the last line of the edition to which I listened summed up the entire book for me as far as the \\"truth or fiction\\" question is concerned. The very final words are that the author had learned to use (among other things) the \\"magic of illusion.\\" In the instant that I heard those words I realized the author had just described the nature of her writing.

In fact the author clearly states that the tribe she was with was rare within the aboriginal nation. In fact, I really don't care what nation or race she was with. To me, that was not the most important message.I liked this book because as the book suggests, I believe that humans do have the capability to be present, spiritually confident, healthy, conscious, happy and productive. I can't agree more that our societies have fallen to being more left brain minded, crowded, destructive, judgmental and selfish. I hope this book inspires readers to be more conscientious and respectful about the world we live in.Personally, I think the writing was a little too simplistic.

The author thinks not, and in her story submerges an American in an Aboriginal culture for 3 months to show the differences. The story is fascinating, and the conclusion is that the indigenous culture providing for peoples' emotional needs above physical needs, whereas our western culture is just the opposite. There was criticism when this book was published that many of the facts about the lives of the Aborigines were erroneous, but the book is fiction. I am sure the author made up a lot of the details and since it's fiction that's fine. Making a factual account of a 3 month walkabout was not the claim of the book - comparing two radically different social environments and drawing conclusions from that comparison was the intent. Very thought provoking; I highly recommend it to any socially aware reader."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take It For What It Is: Fiction.

I thought that, like A Million Little Pieces, Mutant Message Down Under may embellish a few facts or even completely fabricate characters and events, but the quality of writing and core truth of the story would more than make up for a few flourishes of falsehood. What I found instead was a tome loaded with sentences barely recognizable as English, enhanced by a \\"gravy\\" (185) of convoluted figurative language and constructed on a foundation of 17th century \\"noble savage\\" racism cemented into a grotesque argument for new age philosophies, pseudoscience, and quackery.Read more [...]"},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat unbelievable","review":"My book group read this book.

Enough reviewers have produced salient points to this effect that I submit this review only to add one more point that has been overlooked by those unfamiliar with its source.Margo Morgan quotes an aboriginal with a sort of poem or statement about clouds and coming and going that is a verbatim plagarism of a mostly obscure poem by Seung Sahn Sunim, a Korean Zen master.

However, I feel I wasted a lot of emotion believing her adventures were mostly true experiences. I had doubts numerous times about the truthfulness of experiences she described. She covers for that possibility by claiming in her Forward that the book was a \\"fictionalized\\" account to protect the tribe,it's members and their location.I give it 2 stars because it was an interesting read about living in the outback, and about spiritual beliefs even if her story has turned out to be totally untrue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cliched and Patronizing","review":"The book is really easy to read and entertaining and maybe it makes us think of how good or not good is our relationship with nature.

That Marlo Morgan managed to sell so many thousands upon thousands of copies is beyond me until I remember the 'television audience' mentality that many have in the new age today. It is a pain just thinking about what this story entails - fiction touted as fact - and damaging to many aboriginal people as well as it portrayed them and their culture as something they are not.To be sure, it is also a laughable matter, reading this book. It's kind of like mixing an image of a television soap with a science fiction fantasy.My biggest concern is the fact that our (Australia's) beloved aboriginal elder, Burnham Burnham become involved in the story, touring with Marlo Morgan.

As they represented the people of the area in which she claimed to have begun her walk across Australia she had no choice but to admit she had made the whole story up.

This did nothing for me and was a waste of my time."},{"rating":"1","title":"An arrogant white fantasy","review":"Unbelievable -- an author who has clearly never met an aboriginal person tells us that she, personally, was chosen as the single vehicle for thousands of years of wisdom by a tribe who has decided to die off (actually, aboriginal people are very much trying to survive).Some of the author's claims about aboriginal people are clearly New Age fantasies or misplaced ideas about Native Americans -- for instance, she has aboriginal people making \\"dream catchers\\" and being called by Native American sounding names -- things that are obviously erroneous to almost any Australian.On top of it, she uses very insulting language to refer to all of the aboriginal people who are not part of her \\"Real People\\" tribe (i.e., they are all lazy, corrupted \\"...\\").Just search in any search engine for \\"Mutant Message Down Under\\" to get the real deal and hear from the people Morgan is making all her money off of."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fraudulent exposé of Black Australians at its worse.","review":"This book was originally self-published as non fiction by Ms Morgan. The result was an insult to the indigenous people of Australia. I know the region of Australia and the people very well that she writes about and she does not even describe the topography acurately let alone those she says she lived with and had amazing adventures with. She is a fraud and so is this book. It should be withdrawn from sale in deference to the people it insults. Come on America have you learnt nothing by the maltreatment of your own indigenous people leave ours alone, please! I rate this book a one because of the efforts of the clever publicist, the book's content gets a full zero"},{"rating":"1","title":"Exploitative drivel","review":"Subsequently proven to be a complete pack of lies, this book is a deeply cynical, mendacious, grossly inaccurate and offensively racist account of the Australian Aboriginals.Marlo Morgan tells of an odyssey of spiritual transformation joining a group of Aboriginals (\\"real people\\") on walkabout through Australia. Despite her professed reverence for the \\"tribe\\", her book is littered with insincere and patronising platitudes that jostle for attention amidst the thinly veiled racism, describing her \\"travelling companions\\" as \\"half-cast\\", \\"half-breed\\", \\"natives\\" with feet \\"like hooves\\". Despite her alleged epiphany, Morgan retains the persona of an aloof, superior, white imperialist schoolmarm.This book has never been released in Australia. I wonder why...The unacceptable face of greedy 1990's surrogate spirituality as an offshoot of 1980's materialism."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm a Fan, not a Fanatic","review":"There is much to be said for a book that you just can&#65533;t put down&#65533;regardless if it is true or not. Mutant Message is an entertaining and captivating read that has been a great conversation piece amongst fellow readers. It&#65533;s not necessary to be Shirley MacLaine to enjoy it. My only suggestion is to come to this book with an open mind. You may find yourself exploring your own understanding of humanity's connection (or disconnection) with nature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can I give it zero stars?","review":"While reading this book, I underwent several stages of repulsion: disbelief that such an inarticulate writer could be published; disgust at the author's unwavering egotism; skepticism of the book's illusory events; and finally outrage at the fact the Marlo Morgan degraded an entire culture to benefit herself. Having read this book, I am now more stupid because of it. I am well aware this book is a complete work of fraud, but nonetheless it has planted a grossly distorted view of Aboriginal culture in my mind. My real concern is for the readers who actually believe this book is true."},{"rating":"1","title":"A comment by an Australian","review":"This book shows a paucity of understanding of Australian aboriginal customs and culture. It is a naive, personalized and vain misinterpretation of something that is far too complex for the author to ever come to terms with. As such, it is of little value, other than perhaps, providing evidence of how mixed-up, lonely Westerners in the late 20th century are becoming lost and gullible. In itself, it could well be used as the basis for humor!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great unreleased tracks!","review":"what a great disk,why in the world most of these songs didn't make it the official albums is beyond my ears,especially the unreleased track from \\"fallen angel\\",'a right to live'.other highlights include,'split image(no guitar in ear sight),just a synth driven track,great vocals from peter goalby(my second fave heep singer,you know who's best!),'high and mighty'outtake'name of the game'is another great heep heft-rocker and probably better than anything off that album.so why only 4 stars?,due to the fact that there's too many tracks from the bernie shaw era(sorry,but he's a really cheezy vocalist)and he does really sabotage the live tracks of older byron-sung classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but could have been better.","review":"Most of the examples shown of gardens look to be from large estates, rather than courtyard gardens. My Japanese garden is small and intimate, so it would have been nice to see more examples of smaller spaces.

This is a good \\"basic\\" book on the Japanese gardens, with many ideas but not a lot of specifics. Further research will probably be needed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding!","review":"I have dozens of books on Japanese gardening.

It shows you how to undertake a project like creating your own Japanese garden."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an AWESOME Reference","review":"When I first laid eyes on the workbook, I fell in love with it. It gives a step-by-step guide into turning our little tomboys into princesses. It is fun to read and all teenage girls love it. Because of the Biblical background to assist in training our young girls, this is a perfect addition to your church library."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice book for teens","review":"I liked this little book inspite of the bad reviews some people gave it. It is just the basics--it is not meant to be a course in cosmetology. Also, it DOES approach things from a Christian viewpoint--there is emphasis on being a godly young woman in spirit as well as the physical--most every other page has some kind of emphasis on biblical behavior. There is nothing old fashioned about godliness, manners, and being well-groomed. You get out of it what you put in it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tool for mother's and daughters...","review":"Firstly I think I should explain the term \\"charm\\", as southern girls we were sent to \\"charm\\" school as young ladies. In charm school we learned social graces, needle point, mine even taught penmanship. This book was actually used during my time as a young girl to educate me in the basics of beauty and social grace. Here I am, nearly two decades later, purchasing the book to use in my own home for my daughters. As Americans,even in the church, perhaps especially in the church, we have drifted so far from God's best that anything that calls us to a life of submission, grace, and feminity seems to ruffle our feathers. The ideas in this book are completely opposite of the nazi-feminist culture we live in, but they are not ungodly or harmful in anyway. I am the homeschooling mother of 8 and take great care in the reading material I choose for my children, I recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"I found it helpful","review":"I liked the materials and found it helpful in preparing lessons to teach young girls to be christian based ladies"},{"rating":"1","title":"There's nothing charming about this book!","review":"My daughters were taught from this book at a Wednesday night class at our church. After seeing how intensely non-Biblical the information being taught was, my husband pulled them out of the class! Him and I agree that our daughters need to grow in the Lord by learning who they are in God's eyes. This book only seems to focus on things that people find important, not what God shows us to be important when reading the Bible. After taking these classes, my daughters were both depressed about what this idiotic book would consider their shortcomings. Things that the Bible doesn't even mention.This book is a prescription for one of two things:1. A girl to turn into the kind of person who thinks she's perfect and as such better than everyone else.2. A girl who ends up with eating disorders and distorted self image because they can't be perfect.DUMP THIS BOOK!

The clothing and beauty tips are a scream. Some of the advice is ridiculous and offensive--for example, in the \\"How Feminine Are You?\\" Quiz, you get points off if your voice is deep and gravelly. And yes, this is really a part of the same book, it just isn't available on the Amazon preview pages. Please, if you have any love and respect for your daughters, DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK. Except maybe for laughs."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of time and money unless you are looking for a laugh","review":"This is a sadly outdated book. The character building elements can be found elsewhere without the laughably out of date tips on fashion and diet. My mother ordered this book for me several years ago, and we ended up laughing more than anything else. I have several friends who also used this book who found it as amusing as I did. It also struck me as somewhat naive. Young girls in need of guidance as they enter adulthood will need to confront many issues this book entirely ingores.

This book is no exception. It would be better if the author's next-of-kin could have chosen a ghost writer to give a more historical perspective giving it into a more \\"readable\\" appearance. As it was, there was too little but a lot of personal and almost poetic emotions filing the pages. The subject is very interesting - a decisive battle seen from the loser's point-of-view - and practically nothing was said about the details of the clash itself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another internet sensation.","review":"Justin's career was really the product of mass advertising via the internet. Although Justin does have talent (instrumental and vocal), I did not see something that truly amazed me. Take any great singer off of the street and they could take Justin's place.Some songs were catchy and they reminded me of A-Teens, but I liked A-Teens better. His genre is definitely geared towards young girls/women. The music industry will do whatever it can if they think they can make money and this is apparent while watching the movie. I noticed how Usher, who originally pushed Justin aside, went clamoring for a piece of the action when Justin became popular.His story really was not that interesting and neither was the movie. If you are a true true fan you might love the movie; otherwise, it's kind of boring.

I am not a fan of Justin Bieber's music, but this movie was very interesting and entertaining. I didn't get a 2 hr boring concert that you could watch on VH1. What I got was a very intriguing story of how this dude became so popular. It shows early footage of how he started drumming, and onto where he is now.

I sent it to an authorized repair center, got it back seemingly repaired, but then 2 months later it was dead again. My once high confidence in Casio is shot. For everyday use I've replaced it with a $14 Timex 1440 which is nowhere near as cool-looking, but has functioned reliably for over a year. I've also owned incredibly cheap no-name digital watches for use at the gym that were more durable and lasted for years. I bought this watch based on the 4 stars average review and ignored the people reporting bad experiences -- but now realize that the 8 one-star reviews vs. 25 five-star reviews found on Amazon today really point to higher chances of dissatisfaction than a \\"4 out of 5 stars\\" would seem to indicate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy: 3 Strikes and you're out!","review":"In the last 60 days I have purchased (3) G-Shock Model: DW9052-1V watches from Amazon and have had to return each one for the same reason.

After retuning all three of the G-Shock DW9052-1V I have to say it's disappointing to see such a poor quality G-Shock product. I wonder how long Amazon will keep selling this model?

My first course of action was to have the battery changed but that didn't solve the problem. I use Casio G-Shocks as my primary dive timer so having a reliable watch is important to me.

In this strange and alien place, you can walk in the wheel tracks of the first mobile explorers ever to venture onto the surface of another planet -- where every photo could contain a fossil or rock layer that holds the secrets of another planet's history. The engineering and scientific effort to achieve this is one of the greatest feats of our civilization, and surely one of the greatest thrills for anyone who has ever wondered about other worlds. Both rovers are still exploring, and new photos arrive every day. Personally, I can think of nothing more pleasant to enjoy with my morning coffee than a survey of the cold, hostile images of Mars -- free for anybody with an internet connection.

Neutron Star is another set of short stories set in this Universe, and were actually the first Niven stories I had ever read. The title story is sort of a closed room murder, a crew found crushed to paste on an invulnerable spaceship that was studying a Neutron Star, and the man hired to find out what happened. Niven is very good at using real physics in his stories about man in an inhospitable place, the Universe at large."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeps the kids guessing at Halloween!","review":"Bought this costume for Halloween since I put on weight and needed a fat guy costume for a party. Turns out that Santa is a VERY popular guy at a Halloween party, with lots of \\"little girls\\" who want to sit on Santa's knee and tell him what they want for Christmas. The costume was great because it came with everything needed - the beard, the wig, the hat, the belt and the boot covers along with the costume - and it was well made. The 3/4 length pants seemed a bit weird, but once I had the boot covers on it made sense. Handing out Trick-or-Treat candy dressed in this suit was fun as well, especially one little guy who dropped his candy bag and ran up screaming \\"Santaaaaaaa!\\" before delivering a ferocious hug to my knees. I had to think fast when he asked about what I was doing in his neighborhood and where the reindeer were, but his reaction to the costume made my night.

The fact that the author had spent a better part of her life writing technical manuals undoubtedly affected her present writing style. The result of her recent creative labors is a dry and unexciting manual from the person who, arguably, never reached the enlightenment (awakening) herself. In a way, one can see this book as a way to justify the author's failure to discover her own True Self."},{"rating":"2","title":"More great characters","review":"Callanan has again created some wonderful characters with very interesting stories to tell.

I remember learning in English 101 that in a good story, the main character goes through a change during the story, finds the meaning of life, reunites with a long lost love, etc. Not sure that happened here. At least not that I could tell. If someone can explain to me how it did happen, please do. I would only recommend this book to those who are fans of films that are critically acclaimed, but the general population doesn't like, or doesn't get."},{"rating":"1","title":"A good second book.","review":"The Author had previously written an unusal well-crafted novel, The Cloud Atlas.

I haven't been able to correct the rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Biased story, Clubland is much better","review":"I have read the Clubland, written by a Village Voice journalist, and believe it to be much more accurate. The fact that St.James is a part of this scene makes his point of view vulnarable to biased opinions, especially considering his not-so-innocent ways himself. Clubland also puts the story in a bigger picture and connects the dots much better. I'd prefer Clubland any second over this book (I have no affiliation to either book's author, publisher, etc). One important thing is that the subject of both books is (same subject) very interesting and anybody who's been in NYC or been to a club in the 80s and 90s should read one of these books (Clubland is a much better read, too).."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly shallow","review":"This book is terrible. I think whoever wrote the book jacket copy was doing James St. James a terrific favor. I wasn't even mildly amused. And for such a gruesome and terrible murder JSJ certainly doesn't seem capable of writing of it with anything apporaching intelligence, compassion, or even real understanding. JSJ struggles to keep Alig's actions as the subject when all he wants to do is focus on himself and since he's not that interesting or funny the book doesn't work on any level. And the use of different type settings is just an attempt to make the book seem more interesting or rule breaking than it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING !","review":"I think ALIG is the man to write the story of that period...St.James's insecurity,low self esteem and self_pity (all over the book--- unintentionally i bet) gets tired after a while..I was expecting much better...ok reading during lunch breaks but nothing \\"timeless\\".

The book is an easy read and will touch your emotions on both sides of the spectrum. You will see both the good and the bad of drug use.

Now that I've read it, I don't like it; I LOVE IT! James St. James captures an underground clique & lifestyle in a most fabulous way & keeps you laughing thruout.Altho I wasn't a New York \\"clubkid\\" or \\"Old School\\" myself, I lived a similar lifestyle in the LA of the early 80's, & I can attest to the authenticity of St. James' prose. He cuts thru the language & mores of the gay fringe with a scalpel's accuracy & leaves you wiping the tears of laughter from your eyes. He is also very very right about the way the media & legal system treated the murder of Angel Menendez & the publicity it awarded Michael Alig for the deed.Personally, I highly recommend \\"Disco Bloodbath\\": however if you have any issues AT ALL with the gay lifestyle or drugs DON'T READ THIS BOOK. You'll just be offended! If however, you love dish, the nightlife & general fabulousness, buy \\"Disco Bloodbath\\" today! You won't regret it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dazzling, Daring, and Devilishy Divine","review":"Some people in the aforementioned critiques have cirticized James St.James' writing style. Perhaps it is their closemindedness to unconventional writing styles that leads them to their (if I may say so myself) entirely WRONG opinions. His prose is sheer brilliance; he flames the fire of his story with licks of sassiness and savor. His writing style is local color; kids, he goes with his bad self!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hypnotic and tragic","review":"James St. James' tale of life inside the famed NYC Club Kids scene is a riveting display of youth meeting excess and the resultant inevitable tragedy. At the center is sociopath Michael, a brilliant but warped Pied Piper who leads the lost boys and girls to new highs, staggering excesses and, finally, when things are headed downhill, commits murder and deems it fodder for party anecdotes.Growing up in a completely opposite world, yet at the same time, it's frightening to see what 80's excess and greed wrought in some cases. Because of this, along with St. James' hip writing style, the book might be getting more of a pass than it deserves. Nevertheless, it's a compelling, albeit disturbing, read."},{"rating":"1","title":"A gripping but vacuous account of NYC nightlife","review":"James St. James has a lot of good stories to tell, but his immature and self-indulgent prose keeps them from ever being anything more than five-year old gossip. The sad thing is some parts of this book are very gripping; ravers will be interested to hear about superstar DJ Keoki's early years, and St. James paints a picture of a K-Hole that will make anyone who's ever been there feel ill. This is all buried, however, beneath a mountain of affectations and arbitrary type faces."},{"rating":"2","title":"do not miss this title!","review":"Having seen the movie first(and loving it!)the book by James St.James is a near revelation!Witty and insightful,this book has become my new best friend.I read this book from cover to cover the day i bought it and i have re-read it at least 10 times!With a writing style this fluid and telling,it BEGS a visit!Any book that starts off wit instructions on how to prepare an illicit drug is worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An all-too-fierce recollection of a K-HOLE massacre","review":"Having recently seen the documentary 'Party Monster', I just HAD to read \\"Disco Bloodbath.\\" Most real clubbers, including me, just dont have the education or vocabulary to write a book accurately describing their experiences. But luckily James ST James still has a mind left along with incredible experiences. I rarely laugh at anything anymore, being the critic that I am, but he retells it all with such wit, I sometimes wonder where he gets it all from. Michael Alig seems all too absurd. You wonder if he really is human. But James never demonizes anyone; he lets you do that yourself. WARNING: If you have never done a drug more than once and are deathly afraid of drag-queens, dont bother reading this, you JUST WONT GET IT; The people benefiting the most from this will be the true club kids, the queers (we just love this kind of stuff)and of course the all-knowing K-HEAD (You know who you are)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book. But Really, Get A Life.","review":"I can't say that this true crime story wasn't fresh or interesting; hell, I read it in one sitting. St. James has a clever and sardonic style of writing that grabs the reader by the throat and then he doesn't let go.But reading about the characters and their \\"lifestyle\\" only confirms my worst suspicions about the shallowness of individuals seeking fame amongst the \\"beautiful people.\\" Therefore, I was very indifferent to the angst that most of these pathetic people felt as they tried to outdo each other to Club Land stardom.In the end analysis, St. James' book is yet another in a long line of works capturing the empty, restless, phony world of social climbing. It's no different than \\"The Great Gatsby,\\" just creepier and more graphic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fast Read","review":"This book was well written and really gets you inot the life of the land of club kids.

His use of storytelling is absolutly fabulous, at times I felt like I was right there in NYC with the rest of the club kids. Prior to reading this book I knew nothing of the New York City club life St. James writes about, but his story of Michael Alig doesn't just tell of the murder of Angel Melendez, but instead tells you of their lives, and lifestyles. I was absolutly amazed, and couldn't put the story down. A must read, but may be only for the open-minded."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautifully Honest Book...","review":"I was a little sketchy the first time I picked up this book. I expected it to be verbose and boring... very non-fictiony. It was quite the opposite. The more I read, the more it seemed like fiction. The characters were full of color, never resting, always shocking. It's amazing really... his writing style. It almost seems like he's not giving the details... that it's too basic to be deep, but somewhere in between the implied and the vague he captures your attention until suddenly you realize it's brilliance. I absolutely loved this book. I finished it about 3 days ago, and I haven't stopped thinking of it since. It has a wonderful twirl of tragedy and corruption... glamor and comedy. If you feel you understand the world of drugs... read it. It's a crazy one..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Look into a Different World","review":"I had no clue about the whole New York underground club scene. This book definitely brings that to life. Oddly, despite the fact that it is both a memoir and true crime book, you will find yourself laughing frequently.

But read this book it is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad there isn't a Zero Star rating.","review":"I regret that I wasted my time reading this book. Having lived in NY during this time period, I thought the book would be an interesting read. Instead, it's a self-indulgent K-trip by a self-absorbed drug addict.

Just wait until Michael comes out with his book-then we can all hear the TRUTH!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated it","review":"I found the author was more interested in letting you know who James St. James was rather then Michael Alig.

I would highly advise anyone who is interested in reading a fabulous yet tradgic story of fame, drag, drugs, clubs and murder to buy this. James St James, has done a wonderful job telling a crazy story of his earlier years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Party Monster The title says it all","review":"Party Monster was an amazing book, and before anyone corrects me I know the acutual name of the book but it is quite long so we will just leave it at that. I first saw the movie on Netflix and fell in love with this indie cult film. Once I youtubed for the mocumentary and found out the book was real I just had to have it. The book follows the lives of Micheal Alig a crazy attention starved kid who wanted to make it to the top stopping at nothing. I read reviews before I purchased the Book, some said it was not good or that they thought it was overexaggerated, however I felt completley different. I read this book in an afternoon, not because it was short but because I took so much interest in the characters and the fact that this was a true murder story that happened right here in the USA. Point Blank if you love reading about violence, drugs, sex, and murder you will adore this book. I rated this 5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good book","review":"I enjoyed this book, and movie... its a true story.

This isn't one of those books. It does provide a look into a FEW men's thoughts; the dangerous thing is, reading this book will most likely cause the women who read it to think they now understand every man's behavior, and that is oh, so incorrect, and can cause as many or more problems as it solves.

The book is a good overview of a wonderful technique in crochet, with excellent examples of how to use the techniques with the patterns presented. Even though the book is quite wonderful, the afghans, in person, are even nicer. Lily Chin is a well known author of knit and crochet designs and teaches across the US on a regular basis. She is a very talented lady and I applaud her book as a clear presentation of good material. It's something most fiber crafters would want to own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warning on the Two Books","review":"I just want anyone who is interested in Lily Chin crochet books to be warned that the two Mosaic afghan books ARE THE SAME ONE! They slapped a new cover on the book and reissued it, without so much as a notation. So, buy one of them, but don't be fooled into buying BOTH of them. It's a good purchase, but not twice.There are some lovely books in there, but for my taste only about 1/2 or less would I make.

The film's story is set in the present, however it plays like something out of the 40s or 50s. The hammy acting and stagy dialogue only add to this effect, which according to the director was intentional, but it just doesn't work. The transfer is marginal, the picture is very fuzzy, and it's in pan & scan format, making the obviously widescreen shots (in the super 16 format) look claustrophobic."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Old-School\\" Indie","review":"This is a raw film that will take you on an intense journey.

The story is filled with psychological twists and turns, and the performances are great. The lead actor, Mark Withers, is especially good. His performance is powerful and presents a deep and complex character study. I was in tears by the end of the movie. This is one movie I definately will tell my friends to buy.

The story has the potential to be interesting but I was bored and the writing is really annoying. I had heard good things about it from a couple of people but then everyone in my book club hated it. It was actually the first and only time that we collectively decided to not finish a book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Waiting for Snow in Havana","review":"This is a breathtaking account of life in a country and during a time so many of us know so little about. Mr. Eire is a gifted, insightful, sensitive writer who has the talent to dismantle a lot of the false ideas and wrong impressions many still hold about Cubans. I will look for more by him. I had trouble taking a break from reading \\"Waiting for Snow in Havana\\" and have since purchased the book for friends. I believe this is a MUST READ for anyone who is concerned with world affairs and the fate of people getting tangled up in them. The copy I received over amazon.com was NEW and very inexpensive. THANK YOU! I am very delighted with my purchase!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful and bittersweet","review":"Having left Cuba as a young girl of 10, I lived through what he shares in the book. His story is told with sentiment and true emotion, as only one can tell it having lived through it. I hope Mr. Eire keeps on writing books such as this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I remember of Cuba","review":"While I have read a few books on Cuba, this one seemed to have great reviews, and I was disappointed as what I read is not at all what I remember of my life on the island. Even having left at age 15, a lot of what is mentioned on this book most probably had to do with a well to do family.Nothing wrong with that, except, that is not what the majority of the kids that left were. Most of us came from the so called middle class, which is why I decided to write this review."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still Angry After all These Years","review":"Overall, I was disappointed by this book. I had hoped for more insight about what life was like in Cuba before the revolution. But, because the author was only around 10 years old at the time, much of his recollections could be those of a roudy child anywhere. The author has a lot of anger about the revolution and several small indignities, which he vents repeatedly throughout the book. It was interesting to get a glimpse of what happened to the middle class in Cuba and the plight of the refugees in America after the revolution, but I would have liked to know more about that and less about how much fun it was to blow up firecrackers and throw ripe fruit at other children."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Excellent Read","review":"This is a beautiful book. I read it about 3 years ago when it first came out and it still haunts me. While it was written by one of the children evacuated from Cuba, that's really not the story. It's a story of Cuba and the people that lived there prior to and during the revolution. Funny, yet sad, heart-warming yet shocking, foreign yet hitting all too close to home. It's story-telling without peer. A great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paradise Lost","review":"Carlos Eire recalls in detail his privileged and pampered boyhood in Cuba with absolutely eccentric parents before Castro's revolution. Sometimes the writing is just overly dramatic and sometimes the tone is even whiny but by relying heavily on magical realism the author does effectively convey the extent Castro changed life in Cuba for so many - and not for the better as he promised. Eire also conveys a sense of loss - not only of boyhood and all its pleasures but of a culture, a way of life that was needlessly destroyed and replaced by something so much inferior. Many of the images in this book are sensitive and poetic and yet so many others are equally ugly and violent, perhaps reflecting the emotional and spiritual damage of an upheaval such as a revolution. In any case, Waiting for Snow in Havana gives the reader much insight into the thoughts and memories of another exile unjustly deprived of his homeland and family and any sense of connectedness and congruity with the past."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compellingly honest","review":"This book is as honest as it comes. The story is told by a mature man, but through the eyes of the boy who lived it. It's a story of happiness, adventure, sadistic cruelty, betrayal, disillusionment, love, beauty and redemption, but not necessarily in that order. It's a story that needed to be told, not for our benefit, but for Eire's. At times this book makes the reader feel like an unintentional eavesdropper to a confidential therapy session; it can be uncomfortable, yet sacred, all at the same time. The book has an angry, broken heart, but an unyielding, generous soul.I simply had to respect the depth and clarity of raw, naked and conflicted emotion that pours between the lines in this story about paradise. The innocent exuberance of youth romps through the book, daring the angry, bitter voice of maturity to deny the existence of turquoise seas, sunlit days, happiness and...love? Ah, but this is not my story to interpret, so I will leave it at that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waiting for Snow in Havana","review":"Could not finish this one.......the author rambles, going back and forth too much. I could not keep up with which country he was in....."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was really excited about this book...","review":"...because it was unique: a man writing about his experience as a boy in Cuban Revolutionary times. I have an interest in the history and culture of Cuba, and have made some great friends there....couldn't wait to read this book.The author's style is great for evoking the feel and emotion of his childhood; his anecdotes are by turns amusing and sad. The problem for me: his very regular, spontaneous breaks into anti-Fidel diatribe. I understand the sentiment, and the part it undoubtedly plays in his story...but the intermittent essays in oddly flowery language were a distraction and disappointment. I hope one day someone will tell their story in a way that doesn't read like semi-poetic propaganda."},{"rating":"1","title":"bitter book","review":"I have never read a book in which the author so liberally condemned people to hell. I found the author's mightier-than-thou heavy-handed and oppressive. This is a work of anger and hatred rather than a full picture of a country. I hope that anybody who reads this book realizes how slanted Carlos Eire's words are. I just returned from four months in Cuba, no, things aren't perfect, but it isn't the oppressive purgatory that Eire would have youo believe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crocodile Tears in Havana","review":"This is a misty-eyed memoir of an egoistical man who had a very privileged childhood. Because that idealized world was sundered, he believes he has a deeper take on suffering and displacement and he asks the reader to sympathize with his plight and along the way, to blame it all on Castro. The writing is precious, almost cloyingly so--one would expect a historian to be more careful of his language. If the Cuba he remembers is a paradise lost, then he needs to move on. Cuba has survived well enough without him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful and NOT boring!","review":"I read this book because my husband grew up in Havana, the first five years of his life. He and his family left in 1959. I wanted to understand what it must have been like for him and all Cuban people. I found it very intertaining and full of emotion. You will laugh out loud!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"Living in Miami and being bombarded daily with news of Cuba and Fidel Castro, I was reluctant to begin reading this book when it was chosen for my book club. However, once I started reading this book, I simply couldn't stop. I LOVED it! The author writes beautifully and from the heart. His recollections are hilarious and bittersweet at the same time. I highly recommend this book to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much about too little","review":"This might be a good family memoir but to subject readers to details and more details of the antics of naughty little rich boys is beyond the pale. Was this book edited? It could have been tightened up and shortened considerably. Details about Batista and Castro were sparse so as history this book fell short. As I read, I often checked to see just how much more I had to read in order to finish and be done. It was well but too much written. I would suggest that the author suffers from the same malady as his father, extreme narcissism."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow.","review":"Masterful, enchanting, tropical, historical, wistful, angry, seductive, sentimental. Everyone involved -- before and after the Cuban Revolution -- is fantastically indicted in this brutally self-effacing, intensely intriguing, intricately woven genius work of art. Eire's once-spoiled-little-rich-boy-self remarkably spares no one, not Fidel, not Batista, not his father, not his mother, not his friends, not his teachers, not himself. Perhaps the most uniquely brilliant memoir ever written. Ten stars for Carlos Eire -- an author who should be wildly famous."},{"rating":"2","title":"TeleVue","review":"I've absolutely love this eyepiece. Sharp with excellent contrast.

He really pulls several spiritual healing modalities together, easy read, different perspective.Often 'exorcism' is dealt with in a religious manner...this isn't necessarily so in this book...but rather a focus on light and darkness.Worth the time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Slow and Boring","review":"I watched this movie based on all the great reviews it got here and I was very disappointed. I just didn't find it very interesting. I though it was rather dull and boring.

As the rural police bungle various leads, one fears that the movie might be some horrible hybrid of hard-boiled slapstick. Not to worry. By the time MEMORIES OF MURDER gets to its poetically ambivalent ending, I wanted to applaud. Kudos to Song Kang-Ho (playing Sergeant Hee-bong Koo), who gives a performance that sneaks up on you. This is a very good film, and I look forward to more of Joon-ho's work in the future, notably the most profitable film in Korean history, HAN (2006).The film is unrated, but does feature the aforementioned police brutality and an arrhythmical karaoke performance."},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the worst mysteries I've seen","review":"I watched this film because it got an outstanding review on public radio's Fresh Air. The critic said it was one of the best mysteries in years. I would say it was one of the worst I've ever seen. The portrayal of the police and murder case was unrealistic and unsophisticated. The clues were simplistic and uninteresting. Worst of all, it was not entertaining. I found it hard to sit through this lackluster movie"},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything a murder mystery should be","review":"Memories of Murder is a good, concise murder mystery.

We watched it together and as both of us are women of a \\"certain age\\"--I'm almost 60 and she's almost 80--it was intensely meaningful on many levels. The setting is beautiful, the actors perfect in their roles but what brought it all together, for my mom and me,dedicated dog lovers that we are, is the white dog--her heart-breakingly sweet face and what she symbolizes.

What prompts my one star rating and subsequent return of my order is that they will not hold their rated weight. This model is supposed to hold a 25 lb. monitor; it failed miserably at attempting to hold my 23 lb. iMac. There is no tension adjustment (already as tight as it would go) and the computer just flopped forward. With a light monitor, I'm sure it would be fine, but don't expect even close to the stated 25 lb. rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"The way this works: A rigid curved upright section is monuted on a clamp base; the upright rotates 360 degrees. A flexible metal tubing section continues to a universal joint. The flexible section twists about 90 degrees in either direction. The mounting plate has slots for screws to mount the monitor.I found one of the universal joints is too tight, the other was too loose; they could probably be adjusted. The flexible section is quite stiff. Vertical adjustment is minimal and I was concerned that I would break the monitor case when I repositioned the monitor. I bought this because I have 2 positions I routinely have to change between. I've decided to return it; I purchased an Ergotron Neo-Flex NF08LD1S (Mfr.

Its not worth $20. I had to return my first arm because one of the joints was locked tight and could not be moved, even with tools i could not loosen it. There is obviously no quality control with this manufacturer, as the replacement arm needed a joint loosening with tools. The arm is supposed to be easily adjustable with the weight of the monitor.However when i loosened the joint and got it moving i found out that this monitor hangs out about 1.5' over my desk from the clamp point, as my desk is only 2.5' in depth the monitor was too close to my eyes. Also I could not get the monitor high enough to even be at eye level. I returned the arm and my monitor is back on a pile of books, but at least it's at eye level. I will look for more of a conventional arm that has an arm style more like a conventional clamp on desk light."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great deal, but order an extra set","review":"I ordered 2 dozen of these hinges and as others have mentioned it came with the necessary screws. I did find that I was short a few of the noise dampening pads that go on the door, but that wasn't a big deal for me as I just left them off the cabinets above the refrigerator. I did notice that even though the hinges were individually wrapped in tissue paper, most of them had marks or scratches that made them slightly imperfect, but since most of the hinge is hidden no one will notice this but me. My biggest complaint was that 2 of the 24 hinges were bent, luckily I thought ahead and ordered an extra set in case of something like this. To me it was the equivalent of picking out 24 hinges without inspecting them from the bin of my local home improvent store, so I wasn't too disappointed, and even ordering an extra set I still saved a fair bit of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product. Great vendor","review":"Replaced hinges on 35 kitchen cabinets. These look great in SS finish and the closing mechanism is perfect.

They can be had very inexpensively."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amerock Cabinet Hinge","review":"The hinges were exactly as described.

The decorative rails also hang upside-down, the opposite from most shelves of this type, and the resulting low rods don't prevent objects from sliding off as well as intended. We bought another wire-shelving unit made by Whitmore around the same time, a rolling cart for the laundry rm, and it is still rust-free, though frequently wet.

This is possibly the best Shakti album because the rhythm and the harmony between the players is tremendous. This album is best enjoyed on proper audiophile equipment and you would literally feel that the quartet is sitting right in front of you. If you plan on buying only one Shakti album, this is it with \\"Maya\\" a real thriller!

Since then it's a part of my soul, especially L. Shankar's violin solos. In the first Remember Shakti 24 years later, the flute's intervention captures enough attention to be a great recording, but The Believer is a dissapointment. McLauglin leaves the melodic department a little stripped of variety and it never seems to elevate to spiritual heights like the others.

I fear you either love this one, or hate it. I happen to love it. Not because it's a good movie, but because it absolutely freaked me out when I first saw it a decade and a half ago.Considering the theme of this movie, alot of what is used to make it work is far-fetched and doesn't make much sense. BUT, it's still very creepy and really keeps hold of your mind until it's over. Carpenter just uses unconventional ways to do something that has been done before, but instead of being stupid, it's quite refreshing...just still very weird. I think it adds something positive to this movie, though.Rent it if you haven't seen it, but if you liked it the first time, I think it will have aged well for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than I thought it would be","review":"I saw the 1960 version of Village of the Damned some months ago and my expectations of this remake weren't very high. But I was pleased to find out that it was actually good, actually much better than I thought it would be. Several changes have been made in the story and the characters. One big change can be found in the personality of one of the children, David. The child actors are as good in this movie as in the original. They are eerie, but maybe slightly less than in the original version, because of the screenplay possibly due to the fact that this movie is in color.This movie is not quite as good or well-written as the original version, but it's still very entertaining and a great choice of a movie to rent, or even to buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"No real or imaginative flair to be experienced here.","review":"Watch out for the frightening singing of, 'Ooshton Ousthaan Bergasun'.

Not worth the cost of a rental - rely on someone to describe it to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"A real disappointment","review":"Well Carpenter misfired with this one.

Not a really bad movie, but not a good one either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Under-rated for good reason...","review":"With 101 reviews to-date, there's not much to add, so I'll briefly explain the one-star rating: 1) Cliches abound - naturally, people pair off or stray from the others, the easier to be killed; 2) Boring - because zombies move slowly, so does the action, the biggest sin in a horror film; 3) Inconsistent - how do you kill a zombie? This film fails to answer the question; in one scene, a zombie is decapitated (the usual way to dispatch a zombie) but he promptly puts his own head back on and continues his rampage, while another zombie is tossed from a second-story window and dies immediately...huh? 4) Ridiculous - a church in an urban setting along a main road is the scene of a two-day siege by a zombie army, (led by Alice Cooper) who ring the building and stand transfixed, preventing no one from leaving...and nobody calls the authorities? I give it one star for Alice Cooper."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid","review":"I usually like to keep an open mind so i got this movie. I thought that it would be a great horror movie and i wanted to see their take on the \\"Prince of Darkness\\"....Then it happened...Nothing! The movie was about a group of scientist who looked at a container in a church over like 300 years old and then it starts to possess people one by one on the inside And then on the outside there is a group of possessed homeless people killing the people coming out of the church. I don't feel like adding any more cause its not worth it. I now hate John Carpenter's movies (with an exception of Halloween)....i mean this is worse than In the Mouth of Madness and i didn't like that either. So in conclusion if this didn't help you then i'm sorry that you're about to waste money or Megabytes (if you're a downloader at least you can delete it lol) if you're considering to get it...So yeah..."},{"rating":"1","title":"John Carpenter's worst film.","review":"I'll give Carpenter his due. Carpenter over his career has been a better director than the overrated Wes Craven whose only had in my opinion 1 good movie which was A Nightmare On Elm Street. Carpenter has made some classics such as Assault on Precinct 13 and Halloween and he has also made some good movies like The Fog and The Thing and to a point They Live which was his last good film. But Carpenter also releases crap such as Prince Of Darkness, Ghosts Of Mars and the remake of Village Of The Damned. When Carpenter is off the mark, he is really off the mark and then his work is nearly unwatchable and Price Of Darkness is no exception. This is a real snoozer from beginning to end. Definitely not recommended even for Carpenter buffs."},{"rating":"1","title":"typical distortion Christian faith of horror movies","review":"Full disclaimer i am biasd toward the church and i have learning diabilive that make my writing suck.

A team of scientists and grad students go to check. Whatever's inside has a purpose and its creepy and wants out...It's classic John carpenter right down to the synthesized soundtrack. Great storyline and well acted. It's rare to find that combination in this genre. I've watched it twice in the last few months on Netflix.It's got the old Chinese dude from Big Trouble in Little China, the young Chinese guy from Big Trouble and the blonde haired dude from Simon&Simon;, sorry I don't remember their names.

Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"As usual, this makes me want to see the original","review":"This was a good idea but it comes off a bad, made-for-TV movie. Where was John Ritter? And they made poor Mark Hamill weird. However, the strength of the movie was the little actress who played Maura. It's not easy to play a bad little girl. She does as well a job as McCormack in \\"The Bad Seed\\". Most child actors overact. However, her dialogue between her father (as a representative of the adult normal world) is very riveting (not to mention logical) and she gives her part the right amount of eerieness. My favorite line from her: \\"Things are going to change around here.\\" I want to say that to my boss.The little boy who played David is also touching. Everyone else-- a Bronx cheer!

I was disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Awesome Review?","review":"This contains four of John Carpenter's films, all which I enjoyed watching. The Thing is simply an amazing movie, and even today I'm impressed by the effects used. I also happen to love Prince of Darkness, and it is one of my favorite horror flicks. Village of the Damned is probably my least favorite out of this collection, though it's still somewhat entertaining. And who can forget They Live? The movie has some of the most memorable lines that you'll find yourself quoting again and again, despite the poor acting and the mullet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Village of the Damned","review":"Village of the Dull, The only reason worth watching this mess is Kirstie Alley Beautiful as ever and Christopher Reeve in his last Appearance before his accident(God Rest his Soul),It seems like a made for tv movie but worst."},{"rating":"2","title":"the morals issues and questions are still there","review":"this remake of the 60's sci fi classic still poses the same questions of the movie viewer as the classic. issues like conformity of innocence, fascism,communism, and the like are still there but not as much. the creep factor comes from the stated elements above. thats why the two movies the original and the remake are good sc fi b-movies they ask you thoses hard questions and not a soap opera like new battlestar galactia. i use the title the village of the damned as a metaphor for chicago because it lose a certain something like new york and l.a. america becoming grey goo of mediocrity and conformity. enough of that but carpenter is underrated to me at least because he don't turned out tendy kiddyporn horror flicks. like scream or i know what you did last summer. its real horror like full moon movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite different to Trouble in Little Chinatown","review":"Trouble in little chinatown was an old favorite of mine for years so I thought I'l give another of Carpenter's works a chance, so I went ahead a saw Prince of Darkness.Now I have some mixed feelings about this film. The plot and the ideas behind the film are quite interesting. The acting is good and the effects, though minimal, only add to the film's creepy atmosphere.But something of the film's atmosphere is put to ruin by the talk. Everyone is talking, all the time, half scientific half religious talk with the aim of trying to explain away what they are experiencing. It really lowers the quality of the film, IMHO."},{"rating":"2","title":"Village of the Damned","review":"This movie stands the test of time. I have watched it several times over the years and still enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Formatting - Beware the \\"Widescreen\\" caption","review":"This DVD displays the movie in widescreen letterbox format. What everyone fails to mention is this is not an anamorphic format, rather a letterbox format within a standard 4:3 (1.33:1) format. That means for those of you that have purchased high-end video gear you'll get a horrible picture. I am a bit surprised the picture quality is rated at 5 out of 5 by what I thought was a reputable institution. I consider resolution a key criteria for picture quality and Village of the Damned is definitely low-rez.If you don't understand most of this and are content with a 10-year-old TV, buy it; you probably won't see any of the problems I have outlined here.

Plus, it is filmed partially in my house, which is cool.Great movie, I give it two thumbs way up! That, Scream, Scream 2, Scream 3, and The Others are my five favorite scary movies, even though Freddy Crougor is great too!So you should deffinatly see this fright bite, it makes you scared of pale kids everywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage, bad acting, script and special effects.","review":"I bought this film because of the great AMAZON reviews.

It will spook you out at times."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a Waste","review":"I'll give it this: Cool opening (though some of the characters struck me immediately as insufferable), and some cool actors that are completely wasted.What is wrong with this movie is nearly everything else. The antagonists have no motivation, they are randomly violent, without need to be, they are evil, just for the sake of being evil, and the way the movie just plods along with comically stupid characters getting bumped off with pathetic special effects, it delivers on nothing. It isn't scary. The dialogue is awkward, stilted, and dull. The pacing is jittery. And the acting seems so forced it is just terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Horror for it's time","review":"John Carpenter was always good.

This movie is a remake of the superb 1960's movie, and both are based on John Wyndham's 'The Midwich Cuckoos'. Please, please do yourself a favour and read the book. If you've already seen or get to see Carpenter's movie, you'll suddenly be able to understand many points that he has left obscure or obliterated through cheap tricks and fumbling attempts to 'update' the story. And you'll appreciate Wyndham's exceptional intelligence, imagination, and uncanny ability to capture a community's time and place and its reaction to the incomprehensible."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Ultimate Movie Review! - [...] - @tss5078","review":"John Carpenter remakes yet another classic horror movie and again it just doesn't work. When you take a movie based on one that is 35 years old, coming from a book that's even older than that, and you try to adapt it to modern day life, something is going to be off. If it had been set in the time it was written, it would have made more sense, but would still have been a pretty weak story. A massive blackout impregnates the town woman with alien children who can see your thoughts and force you to do what they wish. It's not the best story to begin with. Add to that a group of actors who are passed their prime and really don't want to be doing this film and you get another s*** movie that is basically a waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Village of the Damned (1995) (Ws)","review":"Village of the Damned (1995) (Ws) is the remake of the 1960 horror classic with the same title. Carpentener's version of the story is not nearly as frightening and Christopher Reeve does an alright job in the role of the doctor. The special effects feel a bit cheap and the music could have been better. Considering that the 1960 version is a classic in the genre of horror maybe Carpentener should have realized that any attempt on his behalf would never equal that of the original. It is not a dreadful movie but still it feels boring at times and I often find myself comparing how amazing I really thought the original movie was. 2/5."},{"rating":"1","title":"it is anamorphic widescreen","review":"the person who wrote is saying it wasn't Anamorphic is wrong i just previewed my copy and it looks great"},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost Brilliant","review":"This movie nearly proved to be John Carpenter's transcendant masterpiece, but fell terribly short. The premise, concept and storyline could have been triumphant in the history of sci-horror, but it looks like Carpenter rushed through this one. Maybe it was fidgety actors (what the heck was Alice Cooper supposed to be doing, anyway?), low budget, or a series of terrible hangovers that led him from brilliant concept to underdeveloped cinema? I don't know. I'm a huge fan of John Carpenter, from Halloween to The Thing to Big Trouble in Little China. I rushed to the theater to see this one, and sat slack-jawed at the terrible acting, stupid dialogue and poor script. On the other hand, I also realized that if Carpenter or any other decent director decided to go back, rewrite this one and do it right, it could prove to be the best sci-horror film ever. Rent it before you buy it; even the hard-core Carpenter fans may be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best spooky,creepy,horror movies ever","review":"This movie is deffinatly one of the best horror that acually creep you out thats ever been made.there are plenty of moments that are deffinatly spooky and if i described them it would spoil their effectiveness.the storry is also really good in this and it adds to the creep factor if you pay attention to it.the last half of the movie especially get to you,make sure you watch this one in the dark and youll see what im saying.this dvd belongs in every horror fans collection,trust me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disturbing and interesting","review":"This movie has a disturbing message and it hooks you right in as you want to see what is going to happen.

This is a REAL horror movie. It scares you not only with the action on screen but also with anticipation of what is yet to come. You also have to actually think about what's going on to figure the movie out. I think this is why so many people don't like it.

The time display is smaller than I would prefer, but I was unwilling to pay the extra retail for the more classic G-Shock.

I took it swimming underwater in the pool, surfing in the ocean, trekking in the snow, rock-climbing, in extreme desert heat, and extreme winter chill. I must have banged it against rocks and ledges and all kinds of things hundreds of times and it never once got a scratch on it. Unfortunately by my mistake I left it in a hotel room on a recent trip so now it's time to replace it.

My first two watches never stoped running, just the rubber/plastic casing gets broken up over the years from contact with varius items I'm working on. The battery lasts 4-5 years if you dont use the light feature button much. The bands also need replacing over the years with heavy use. The three alarms I never use (high tones) because of my hearing loss. Although they claim water resistant I don't take it in the water.

The pauper heirs of 1968 intentionally encoded their ideologies in needlessly complex language. Their intent in this was to create a self-verifying ideological elite, and to limit their own accountability to those who had the intestinal fortitude and free time to decipher their blather. Nothing Chomsky says couldn't be said more simply, but then he'd lose his gnostic appeal.Of course such obfuscating misfired. Otherwise, why else would these patently insulting and patronizing booklings have arisen? I hope they sell by the millions, for they speak loudly of the failure of Chomsky, Kristeva, Derrida et al. to be comprehensible or relevant to anyone but themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very likely to ENRAGE you","review":"This book introduces Noam Chomsky's ideas in a compact, very readable way. The cartoon format isn't up to Gonick's standards, but it doesn't really detract. This title is worlds more sophisticated than the Dummys or Idiots guides you might relate it to initially. Don't be fooled.It does a fair job of covering Chomsky as a person, and his linguistic background. But the meat is the media and political criticism. Chomsky's basic ideas that there is a small ruling class in the US that control the media and just about everything else are laid out with enough support to be quite believable.The book is necessarily short, and often leaves me wanting more. Sometimes it even reads like propoganda, making seemingly outrageous claims with little support. But it references Chomsky's own works extensively, inviting you to explore more if you're sceptical."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Most Innovative RPG's Out There","review":"I was very excited about this game when i rented it a few weeks ago, and boy was I not dissappointed! Awesome gameplay, mixing both RTS and RPG elements into a near flawless blend of w00tness.That being said, there are SOME flaws to this great game. The monsters you use lack any sort of AI what-so-ever, which means guiding them through maze like levels and trying not to get them caught on walls. The time limit makes it interesting, but it feels like the developers didn't go through the game and test to see if the times were actually do-able, (ie, they're very difficult missions in some places).Though all in all, the spells make up for it. you draw out the spells on the touch screen, the more acurataly you draw them, the more powerful they are. With over 390 spell combos, its very worthwhile to test all of them out!Overall, I give this game a four star rating!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of THE worst games ever made","review":"I got this game expecting it to be interesting, the description sounded interesting enough. But playing it... ugh. It's got to be one of the worst games ever made. The process of writing the runes takes so long and all the while whatever you fighting is still moving. The character moves very slowly so even in the part where they told you to outrun the enemy, it's not possible. So you stand and fight except then you run out of magic. So you have to sit and wait for it to charge all the while waiting being smacked down by the bad guys and then when your finally charged, you have to go back to writing more runes, again while the bad guys are smacking you around. Needless to say, your not going to survive for long.This game is horrible.

I strongly recommend avoiding."},{"rating":"1","title":"This game is terrible.","review":"This game does not have a good plot. Not to mention it does not have a real world setting like Final Fantasy VII does. It's battles are timed and if you do not beat the time you have to keep playing that battle to get past it. Speaking of the battles, your technique is writing symbols on a screen. This screen is terribly hard to write on because you have to be very precise on these writing or it does not work.

It's the perfume that MJ used to wear (according to his makeup artist Karen Faye)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The New St Bernard","review":"This book has been written by long time St Bernard fanciers and conformation judges, the Gwilliams of Coatham Kennels, England. Listed in the contents are subjects not previously included or only briefly touched on in other St Bernard books. The addition of a Hereditary Disorders/Conditions chapter is a bonus, as are the sections on Weaning and Socialisation. Feeding Tables which list the St Bernards daily requirements and the function of individual vitamins and minerals (including the results of deficiency or excess of these), are comprehensive. The aged St Bernard and Temperament are also covered in this responsibly written book. An American section, State by State, ensures that this book crosses the Atlantic. This book is right up there with the best St Bernard books I own."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book on Saints","review":"I have read a few books on Saints and on various breeds. This book is outstanding for several reasons. The photos and art add a lot to the book, and are blended well with the information. The book is balanced and written well. This book is the best breed-specific book I've seen in terms of breed-standard. It provides the the complete standards divided up by USA, UK, and FCI. It also chronicles the heroic history and evolution of the Saint Bernard, and of course the legendary \\"Barry\\" is discussed. FYI this is not a training manual, but does include some helpful commands.

It won't break easily, but it's definitely not light, it's not an aesthetically pleasing kitchen adornment, but it will pound the hell out of whatever you want as long as you have the arm strength to do it.

Although it has many uses and few things to worry about breakage wise, it is a heavy object and may be difficult to lift/handle especially for people who cannot pull up 25+ lbs with one hand.Rock Solid; but women, curl up your sleeves for this one.

I left the outside alone.The inner edge of the bowl's rim was a bit sharp, so I spent a couple minutes rounding it with a Dremel grinder.I refinished the top of the rim, inner surface, and the end of the pestle by hand with 180 grit carborundum paper. This only took 20 minutes or so. I then coated the rim, exterior, and top part of the pestle with grout sealer.The result was a wonderful solid large mortar & pestle, which produces fine-ground ginger, or fresh crushed herbs, with much less effort than my 4-inch mortar. It's the weight of the pestle that does it - one only needs to let the pestle do the work.It is not finely finished as-shipped, but saving $20-40 in exchange for a few minutes hand work with sandpaper was a great deal.Even if you don't want to refinish it yourself, it's still a bargain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy, cheaply made","review":"Looks great on the web, not great at home.

Even placing it on a folded kitchen towel (or potholder or rubber mat) doesn't fully stabilize the thing.

X-Press 2 Dub might have been a more suitable name, as this is practically a dub. The uncensored vocals are cut up and triggered in a stilted, spazzy sort of way. But the beat cruises along with good inertia, and there is even a surprising little build. This dub/remix is the best track on the CD, but still is not likely to have much appeal beyond DJs and a minimalism-craving subset of clubbers.The DJ Godfather Detroit Getto-Tek Mix is really goofy.

The most interesting part of this book is the painstaking and illuminating attention Briggs pays to the tradition in which Bacon did his thinking and wrought his innovations. Briggs uncovers and deftly articulates subtle and influential 15th-16th century theories of magic and rhetoric that are fascinating and richly suggestive. I have found it to be a cogent, richly informative, and probing exploration of Bacon within the intellectual context in which he did his thinking. An invaluable read for students of rhetoric/language and the history of science."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass on this one","review":"I bought this DVD for $10 Australian dollars which would be about $US6, and I wouldn't pay anymore than that.I won't rubbish the documentary too much, but, it is pretty bad.I'm guessing they didn't have the biggest budget hence the dodgy editing, camera work and bad story telling in general (okay, maybe I am rubbishing it just a bit), but it could have been a LOT better.If you had people like Keith Morris, Jack Grisham, Jello Biafra, Duane Peters etc, you would figure they would have something interesting to say, but they seem to just bore everyone. Not that they were boring, but that this was edited really badly and had no structure. The interviewer butting every few seconds does not help either.I pressed the fast forward button for about 90% of it. Disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Punk Or Junk...","review":"The working title for this movie should have been \\"Punk twenty years ago\\". This a poor representation of a powerful, and influential music genre. Focusing NOT on the West coast punk movement; but rather on a few select figures who with the exception of Jello Biafra have very little to say. Sadly there is very little archival footage and the film manages to leave out more bands than it includes.If you are a fan of bands like... \\"X\\", D.I., The Vandals, Mike Watt, The Dils, The Eyes, Social Distortion, A.F.I., Rancid, and The Cramps, or venues like The Whiskey-A-Go Go, Fenders ballroom, The Country Club, The Golden Bear etc. Don't look for them here, because you won't find them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amusing and informative","review":"Amusing and informative, this book answers many of the questions about the origin of language ordinary readers may have. The general tone is that of a professor lecturing to a freshman audience in a linguistics course. It is witty and clever, but at times I found it too pedantic. Still, I think I got a lot out of the book, and it made me want to find out more about the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Strong Female is the Only Redeaming Quality of this Book","review":"I found this book to be a bore. The first 100 pages just confused me. This book should have started off with the a brief history of how Sherrie and Jack met. Instead you are totally thrown of course by Sherrie's vivid dreams. It just went down hill from there. I did not find this book strong in any way except for the fact that Minerva and her mother had to have been the most unconventional women. They didn't really seem to fit in with the time peroid. I could have beileved in them if they were from today's world, but back then......I don't think so. Well, I am may be the only one who didn't like this book, so give it a shot and decide for yourself.Happy reading...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!","review":"I had such high expectations of this book because of the raving reviews.

The independent Amazon seller who sold this to me was great in regards to shipping it to me at a blazing fast speed. The product, however, was just plain bad.I opened up the packaging and took out the mount. Then I set it up using the directions and equipment provided.When I mounted the monitor and placed it into position, which I have to admit was very difficult, I let it go. The stand seemed like it couldn't hold my 17\\" monitor - the monitor dropped onto my desk, as the arm failed to hold it.I have to admit, for $16, this was kind of expected. I'd pay three times this price for a mount that actually works - and will most likely end up doing so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work as stated","review":"\\"just grab your monitor and move it where you want it\\"Well, grab it very firmly with two hands and you CAN move it, but don't expect good results. It's very rigid, and doesn't move smoothly at all. And when I try to raise the monitor, it simply falls back down to the desk. I emailed them for assistance, and I must admit they were very prompt in replying. Here's the answer I got from them, which didn't work:\\"Here is a tightening procedure that we advise in your case:*You will need a 3/16 and 5/32 Allen wrench*Loosen the setscrew on the left slightly (1 turn should do it) with the 3/16 Allen wrench*Tighten or loosen the larger bolt as needed with the 5/32 Allen wrench*Re-tighten the setscrewYou should not need to turn them too far - turning too far will strip them.

The group sounds refreshed under July Heredia who has been in the group the longest. After going with the departure of Ronny Soler and other members and the death of another it seems that we would never hear from them again. The disc contains 11 songs, 10 merengues and 1 bachata. Some songs are upbeat but there are some sleepy songs too; 3 and 5, which are also included in the later album \\"Juntos De Nuevo\\" and album were Ronny Soler returns and takes the lead vocals for 5 songs.

I have loved Sousa marches since I was a kid in a marching band, but to have them connected to each other with beautifully appropriate transitions was wonderful. Now, here's a small confession. I also was going to be caring for my 3-year-old grandson in a few days, and I could picture us marching together to this music. We did, with great pleasure for both of us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stars and Stripes","review":"The Boston Pops never sounded better..All five ballet works beautifully scored and lead by Arthur Fiedler with Balanchines choreography for 'Stars and Stripes' a memorable event."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyable Arrangements by Hershy Kay","review":"In this album Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops present us with several pieces of ballet music with a distinctively American flavor, starting with Hershy Kay's transformation of music by John Philip Sousa and Louis Moreau Gottschalk into, respectively, Stars & Stripes and Cakewalk. Cakewalk is an especially enjoyable romp -- it's delightful to hear many of Gottschalk's keyboard pieces rendered for full orchestra. Beyond these two gems, which I don't know are available elsewhere in other performances, there are also excerpts from Morton Gould's interplay and the Hoedown from Copland's Rodeo, but I was especially captured by the ensemble's performance of the Galop, Waltz and Danzon from Leonard Bernstein's Fancy Free. Fun all the way around."},{"rating":"1","title":"waste of money","review":"my son wants to be an architect. i thought this book would be perfect. my son knows his shapes, he's four. this book is not challenging at all and didn't hold his attention. great cover, after that another shape book just using buildings. i have higher expectations. if your kid wants to be an architect, i recommend ROBERTO THE INSECT ARCHITECT and THE THREE LITTLE PIGS: AN ARCHITECTURAL TALE."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very handy start for an Art Office","review":"I found these forms very handy, or at least a very good start for customizing to your needs.

Swansong For You is an absolute must have, this album should not be overlooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"let the good times begin...","review":"in this recording, bel summons all the beauty of simplicity, all the tweeness of the world's greatest indie record label, all the sweetness of a belle & sebastian song, and all the atmosphere of sitting in front of a cosy living room fire with a cup of ribena. with music like this, who needs belle & sebastian. well... we do, because b&s are wonderful. but this will hold us through until their next release."},{"rating":"1","title":"B&S, without the S!","review":"So this album sounds like Belle and Sebastien, that you could have guessed from the singer's bio and the fashionably Smiths-esque cover art.I don't think it's as good. In fact, I gave it a low rating for disappointing me badly. Here's what's similar: a delicate, candylike pop vocalist and cute melodic line throughout.Here's what's missing: the loud part. Many of B&S's best tracks feature rich instrumentation (strings, horns) that builds intensity and energy as the song goes along. My favorite example is track 2 of the green album.The verdict, then, is negative. It's derivative! Go buy _Strangeways Here We Come_."},{"rating":"2","title":"Strategy explained like never before!","review":"Its a truly good textbook. It is short and precise. Its contents do not solely focus on the classic school of strategy thinking but rather the focus is put on a comparison between the classic and 3 other schools of strategic thought. The short examples from real life which are used throughout the book give a better understanding of the concepts discussed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Acoustic Verbow","review":"If you love acoustic music but are sick of the cliches, give this one a listen. \\"Letter from Florence\\", \\"Flag\\", \\"Hollow\\" - amazing songs.

The hoe does not have teeth or a sharp working edge. Rather the edge is polymer coated flimsily and as a result will not cut any unwanted vegetation. Just another piece of junkfrom China."},{"rating":"1","title":"Raged about Purchasing","review":"Nat young took credit for writing this book! It was a bunch of stories written by others who have experienced surf rage. Nat's input was minimal and useless to draw attention to a sad situation he provoked. Sorry it happened. Most avid surfers have experienced some form of rage in the water and certainly don't need to waste time reading tale after tale of violence. Beginning surfers simply need to learn surfing in uncrowded areas and know their limitations. It is unnecessary to read this book to have that understanding. Surfers that indulge in this senseless behavior however would get a morbid kick out of this book. Upon completion I did however recall the subliminal message, avoid crowded Cali and Aussie surf. Thanks Nat, but spare me a sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good representation of later Miles","review":"This is a funky and humorous collection of tape from the later part of the trumpeter's career. The video opens with a verson of Micheal Jackson's 'Human Nature', and this is clearly the high energy high light of the tape. Kenny Garret fans should definitely own this video, as his performance on flute and alto is especially impressive. Fans of 1980s jazz fusion in general should find this a treat. Miles plays very well considering he's over 60 years old. Although the video moves considerably slower after the first song, I still very much enjoyed the 9/8 groove of 'New Blues' and the thoughtful fusion ballad 'Mr. Pastorious'. In regaurd to solo space, there is not enough of Kei Akagi's keyboard playing and too much of Foley's lead bass work. The interview portions of the video are captivating and display a serious and compassionate side of perhaps the most dynamic and evolving musician who ever lived."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Miles' Better Bands","review":"I saw this band perform at Avery Fischer Hall and it was a very memorable performance. Some (like Wynton) like to dismiss Miles' work from this period, but I think some of the live work from Miles' latter period is very interesting to listen to. The improvision is there and the band members all have something to say. They fooled around w/ the song structure and certainly displayed quite a bit of chemistry. This video provides a nice document of one of Miles' better bands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Four dimensions of the Big 5","review":"The authors present their personality typology as being based on the \\"classic\\" four personality types (or temperaments).However, if you compare their \\"typology\\" with the standard definitions of the five factor model, the correlations are pretty obvious:North = ExtraversionWest = Openness to ExperienceSouth = AgreeablenessEast = Conscientiousness(Note that the Neuroticism domain is not covered).For me, this rules out the fact that you are one type, or maybe a combination of two, because Big5 says we have ALL FIVE domains present in our personality.If you ever have taken a Big5 test (like for instance the NEO-PI-R), then this book might be useful to get another set of descriptions of four of the five domains."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great climbing video","review":"One of the first climbing videos I ever watched. Cool action on gritstone, and a lot of discussion with Johnny Dawes and what motivated him to do Indian Face - at the time, probably the hardest trad route in the world. Basically a solo with the hardest moves at the top."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow that was rough","review":"Only 25 minutes and really bad. The actual climbing was pretty good and for the 80s I'm guessing it was cutting edge but watching Johnny top-rope hard climbs he once led is not that exciting, then to hear him ramble on somewhat incoherently between shots was rough.+1 Star for much of the climbing being done in spandex though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book!!","review":"Okay, so the hero forced the heroine to marry him. That's the way it was done in those days. As for the wedding night he did not force her. He used seduction and she fell for it. She was putty in his hands so we can't blame Sebastien for being a hunky, sexy warrior who used his skills effectively. As for Lara, she was lucky Sebastien didn't kill her for all the stupid stunts she pulled. There were moments when I wanted to hit her! I simply loved this tale of two people who despite terrible circumstances, fall in love. Downloaded it two months ago and have already read it twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a Romance novel?","review":"I could have really liked this book the back of the book sounded really good but the beginning part where Sebastian forces Lara to marry him against her will and force her to consumate the marriage all on the orders of his king in order to prove that the castle is under his control if Lara doesn't she will be murdered along with her brother and sister. That really ends the book for me. The author can dress it up all she wants but what it is rape. Which is not only disgusting to read its even more disgusting to find it in a romance novel where the heroine is raped by the hero. I mean are you kidding me? And this is a romance novel? The author expects me to root for Lara too live happily ever after with the man who raped her? Skip this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do you have an elderly parent? A child of any age?","review":"If you do, this book is ESSENTIAL! After watching my own mother struggle with her mother's various illnesses and lack of finances needed to cover the skyrocketing costs, I vowed not to let that happen to me. Ms. Annino's guide outlines, in an easy-to-follow manner, the steps you need to take in order to protect the ones you love from financial heartache. And let's face it, women in this country are the CFO's of their households and too often, not educated about how to protect and plan their estate (I know I wasn't!). Reading this book and implementing the simple steps that Ms. Annino suggests can save you and your loved ones tens of thousands of dollars...and that is time well spent."},{"rating":"2","title":"FINANCIAL PEACE","review":"Here, at long last, is a book that provides women a roadmap of the financial world. No matter how hectic your life might be, this book is worth the time to read. Patricia Annino's depth of expertise is demonstrated through storytelling. She makes it easy to face financial questions that are so often emotionally intimidating. Whether you are single, married, divorced or widowed, whether you are living alone or responsible for others, this book is a gem precisely because it raises the right questions and provides a menu of answers. This book stands to become a classic. Mothers will sent copies to their daughters with notes in the margin. Young single women will read the book in their 20's and go back to it again and again as their life unfolds."},{"rating":"2","title":"A comprehensive estate planning primer especially for women!","review":"During my 25 years as an estate planning and probate lawyer, I have hoped to find a book that would clearly explain, in layperson's terms, the estate planning process and its importance at various times in one's life: when facing the death of a spouse, divorce, one's parents' aging issues, leaving children with special needs, and, of course, one's own mortality. This is that book! That it is written for women, and by a woman, is just the icing on the cake! Ms. Annino demystifies estate planning and offers invaluable \\"Tips\\" and practical \\"Strategies\\" throughout the book. She empowers women to participate fully and intelligently in planning for themselves, whether as a part of a couple or not, and she translates and explains the tax and probate laws and the various \\"terms of art\\" that govern estate planning choices in a clear and concise way."},{"rating":"2","title":"See for yourself","review":"I am very impressed with this book.

Although the fidelity is not as high as more modern renditions, the balance which allows the piano to sparkle in my favorite passage in the last movement makes up for the lower fidelity.

Terrific dubbing (for once) and eccentric characters really sell the show. There's lots of love triangles, quadrangles, octoganals or whatever! Fast-paced, despite the hilarity of the show, it still manages to tug my heart strings at times and it even made me cry once.

If you are looking for a new series to start with, this is it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best mecha series ever!!!","review":"Ship's cook Akito takes the role of lead pilot as the Nadesico heads for Mars and a deadly encounter with the Jovian menace.

C'mon ADV, don't hold out on us!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a show!","review":"I don't know what it is about this show, but whatever it is, it's perfect! I read the Animerica article on it and bought the video out of curiosity. After my first viewing, I found myself thinking that it was okay, but less than stellar. But then I watched it again. And again. And again. I found myself watching the video every chance I got until I could buy the next. I watch a lot of anime, and have extremely varied tastes (I also enjoy Akira and Serial Experiments: Lain), and I feel that this is one of the best. You can't go wrong with Nadesico."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like Maus, this is A MUST READ!!!","review":"There are four books in this series and you MUST get em all!First book is about a Japanes family near end of WWII whose father was anti war and realistically oriented man and criticism of rich people who plunged nation in war.Second book is about a guy who walks through bombed Hiroshima and horror that A bomb can bring.Third book is little more cheerful since it describes urchins who fight for survival and will to live blooming in greatest poverty and inhuman condition.Fourth is conclusion and has very sad at moment, but is OPTIMISTICALLY ended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Crucial","review":"This is an important piece of literature and comic literature. It gives outsiders an important look at the circumstances for Japanese citizens during WWII. I learned a lot from this account of the days leading up to the bombs, based on Nakazawa's real struggles as a child."},{"rating":"2","title":"A &#65533;must have&#65533; for serious seabird enthusiasts.","review":"A fascinating account of the biology of the world's auks (or alcids). Full of valuable nuggets of information, much coming from years of field research by the authors. The text is rich in useful maps, line drawings and tables of facts and figures. The color plates by Ian Lewington are up to his usual very high standard and show all living species in the majority of plumage states. I found the discussion of the evolution and radiation of both extant and extinct species particularly interesting. The high price and limited treatment of field identification may put off many birdwatchers, however those who read the book will be surprised at how interesting the auks really are."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mature Artistry by Late Richter","review":"The editorial review by Leslie Gerber is missing point here, comparing Richter's 60s performance with this one. In his late years he was not interested in brilliant display of his virtuosity, even though he still possessed the ability to do so. From 90s on, his playing had become more and more inward-looking and self-effacing. That is evident in this performance of Beethoven concerto, which is filled with magical moments and rarified beauty.Chopin Etudes are not so electrifying as his earlier recordings, but again listeners attention is drawn, not to technical brilliance, but to music itself. Ovation at the end of concerto and etudes shows how much audience appreciated the late master's mature artistry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Bad, But Use With Caution","review":"There have been numerous books on the \\"Great One\\" and R.L. Taylor's is among the earliest. If the reader is to embark on a serious study of Fields, this should be the first book you read, but use it with caution. Fields was a great rancatour and if a lie would serve better than the truth, he did it. It's hard to seperate fact from fiction when dealing with Fields. No doubt he detested having his privacy intruded on, and his childhood was probably painful. Fields propped up his erratic life with hard drinking, which eventually killed him. And, so many of his tales sound like boozy comedy skits. Still, Fields life tends to read like a Dickens novel. The influence that Dickens had on the comedian is umistakeable, with film characters like short tempered \\"Mr. Muckle\\" the portly \\"Adelai Brunch Souse\\" and \\"Professor Eustice McGargle\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"From mass customization to versioning...","review":"This book is a winner! I've relied on mass customization strategies in my consulting practice for the past 5 years. These strategies allow consultants to win the speed-to-market wars while still providing high quality deliverables. Also, the chapter on \\"versioning\\" is a mind blower, and is definitely relevant to e-publishers everywhere. You can't go wrong with this contemporary business text."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stands the test of time","review":"The test of a truly good book is whether it stands the test of time. I just re-read this book and found it as relevant as the day it was published. These Harvard marketing and strategy gurus have mostly hit the nail on the head. Whether you're an entrepreneur with a business plan to pitch to KickStarter or you are the CEO of Apple, I argue that Markets of One will give you some good food for thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hair, hair, hair and a few chumps","review":"Love body hair and facial hair and watching hairy men who take their hair very seriously? Then, you'll love this movie. The trailer is the best part of the film and does a great job of highlighting the only seconds worth watching. This movie is mostly about facial and body hair. Peppered in are some of my favorite entertaining individuals with random commentary, clearly those unfocused moments do not carry this scattered film. It is not about men in the 21st century, it is not about metrosexuality, it's not about anything really except for some chumps with body hair, one without, and few random stories about them."},{"rating":"1","title":"blah","review":"they really put no effort into this. it was a cute and sort of funny at times doc but had little to no substance - no critical thinking about the topic at all. sorta boring too"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"After watching the trailer and reading the summary I expected this film to be a funny take on how men have evolved into a softer version of their former tough-guy selves. But in the end the entire movie is really focussed on body hair, male body hair to be specific. An hour and 23 minutes of body hair. So, my recommendation would be... If you are really into the male body hair debate, you will like this movie. Otherwise, it's not all that funny and collectively pretty boring."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nowhere near as entertaining as the trailer made it seem.","review":"I feel like this film's trailer misrepresents the content of the film. This film \\"stars\\" Jason Bateman and Will Arnett, but they've got very little face-time, and most of their scenes appear in the trailer itself. Morgan Spurlock has more face-time, like the trailer suggests... but only in the first 30 minutes of the film. Overall, it wasn't a terrible movie, but I do feel like it could (and should) have been compressed down to 35-45 minutes instead of clocking in at 83 minutes. There were interesting segments, but our interest in most of them tapered out after 5-10 minutes (and the segments would go on for 15-20)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The most ridiculous film ever!","review":"Worthless piece of material that cannot be call documentary because it is not! The entire film is basically a man growing his beard and participating in a contest with other bearded man. Other portion of the film is about a Indian guy having waxing and plocking eyebrows because he want to be perfect. In the film he claimed to be straight but all his grooming and behavior are not manly! A truly piece of garbage! I can believe I waisted $4.00 renting this crab! I know better for the next time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This goes from odd territory to the totally bizare","review":"I usually really like Morgan Spurlock films. This one however needs to have every copy collected up and burned to save his reputation. The characters that are examined are extremes and all too often total wierdos. Why do I want to sit and watch a man who loves his beard more than mankind tell his self righteous story for 27 min? Then you have the extreme Middle Eastern metro sexual. It just gets too odd for me. My advice is to forget you ever even heard of this piece."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive Junk","review":"I have had nothing but trouble with this chopper. The plastic insert that fits over the blades doesn't quite fit, and it can take up to five minutes to get the blades to line up so that you can put the outer plastic ring onto the silver top. Except that it doesn't quite fit either, and the thing simply won't latch without fussing, which means the blades slide out of the plastic insert while you are fumbling with the outer plastic ring. It would be great if I had three hands, but I don't, so I'm throwing this junk out and replacing it with a simple ring chopper and wooden bowl like my mother and grandmother used.A cheaper Cook's Special chopper was much, much easier to put together than this waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls to pieces in just a few uses","review":"It looks cool in the photo, but it's quite fragile in your hands. Ours broke the first week...just sort of fell apart. The blades don't line up well either. Hard to clean. Miserable design. Obviously engineered and manufactured by the bottom of the barrel. A hands down, 100% FAIL."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks great, engineered poorly","review":"I didn't realize that my girlfriend spent $40 on this thing. She thought she was buying a quality product. Worked fine for a while and, like the other reviewers, we began having problems reassemblying the unit after cleaning. Great idea, poorly executed. It is not sturdy enough for heavy duty kitchen usage, as I used it to chop veggies virtually every day. I am now searching for a professional model designed for restaurants."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I agree with the reviewer who said the plastic part doesn't line up with the blades. It is NOT easy to get this thing together. I tried using it without the plastic but that's a bad idea as everything you chop gets caught between the steel blades. I really wanted this to work but it's really more of a pain and I never use it now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easily broken","review":"I bought this for my sister last christmas, she opens it, it falls three feet onto soft carpet and half of the plastic parts cracked and later broke apart. That's pretty much all we can say about this chopper because it was broken before she was even able to use it.The price does NOT equal quality, stay away!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A mixed bag","review":"The Simon Bolivar Youth Orchestra of Venezuela is indeed \\"astonishing\\" as is the large scale classical music program of this country which helps produce these young musicians. The documentary (91 MIN) is truly inspiring and their two encores at their Bonn Beethoven Festival concert are great fun both visually and musically. All the above are worth six stars. And the performance of the Eroica is dramatic and certainly not bad given the large size of the orchestra and its youth. If I were at the concert I too would be standing applauding at its conclusion, but it is doubtful that it will demand repeated listening on DVD. The competition is too great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for first-time Czech learner","review":"The lessons go by very fast, with each phrase spoken only once. In order to learn, you must either have a super-human ear and memory, or you must listen to the CD 500 times. The CD might be a good review for someone who has already learned the language, but for the first-timer, consider the Pimsleur method instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Standard anglo beats, nothing special here. . .","review":"There is nothing in the least which is dynamic about this CD. Sounds like a cut and paste of beats with uninspired riffs overlayed, none of which reflect any real musical talent or anything which would be remotely infectious or danceable after hearing one or two songs of. Disappointed and misled. This has been sorely overrated by other reviewers. Listening to DJ Greyboy (Greybreaks vol. 1), Cut Chemist's material or the Breakestra would make this sound like silly amateur breakbeat wanna be caliber material."},{"rating":"2","title":"Civil war continues","review":"I've followed the Davion/Steiner drama for many years. This newest volume fits the bill. Loren Coleman does a good job in showing how Victor's forces don't always win and when they do, it's not always pretty. The loss of one of the BTech characters, though, seemed trite. Still, it adds a touch of realism to the BTech storyline and will (hopefully) provide some fireworks as the civil war appears to be winding down. Coleman remains a good author and provides BTech fans with a solid novel continuing the main storyline. I'm continually pleased to see the continuity between the Davion/Steiner novels over the past 5-10 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Solid Addition to the Shelves of Battletech Fans","review":"Like its sister book Patriots and Tyrants, Storms of Fate is a very solid book. As I have noticed, many Stackpole fans grieve his departure from FASA and criticize Coleman's work. I find Coleman's style much more interesting. He has a much more personal insight to his characters and, overall, I like his version of Victor Davion much better than Stackpole's. Storms of Fate begins with a bang with a terrible twist involving the assassination of a person very dear to Victor. It rises continually in action involving the politics of the Star League Council and it ends and leaves you hanging and hungering for more. The political issues in this book are masterfully created and I believe that Coleman lives up to, if not surpasses, Stackpole's legacy. Read this book. You will not be able to set it down. This is definitely worth your six bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"good sound quality","review":"Speakerphone worked great. The batteries would not hold a charge for long and buttons were hard to press."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book worth reading","review":"This is one of the best books I have ever read.The human nature and spiritual exploring the novle expresses can deeply move the readers.And the background--a science fiction world--supplies such a wonderful,broad environment to set in the very story about humans and talons.The whole story is so complex and mysterious that it makes me take an interest in it.I am very glad to learn that 'Ma'El and 'Da'An are almost the same person,both have elegant behaviour and are much more intellectual than orther Talons.The tow represent a noble spirit and possibility of friendship between humans and talons.But it doesn't come ture in the end.For me,a big fan of 'Da'An,it is a pity.By the way,the TV show is rather good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Borrow, don't buy.","review":"I'm not impressed with this one. It was supposed to give the readers (fans of E:FC) a glimpse into Boone's past, chronicle his first meeting with Augur, etc., etc. I didn't learn anything about Boone I didn't already know. The \\"first meeting\\" was trite. The book's one saving grace was the development of Kate, Boone's wife, a data wrangler of some considerable skill.So many things were glossed over, Kate's participation in the mysterious project, the \\"Octopus,\\" the arrival of the Taelons, etc. It became very frustrating. Frankly, this book read like a \\"backstory sketch\\" meant to provide other writers with a little background information in order to write more detailed books of their own. I'm sorry I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry and Lacking Value","review":"A potentially imaginative project has been cranked out with no fire, no magic. Very dry and uninspired writing ruins an otherwise fascinating Roddenberry treasure. Really disappointing.

Great job Robb!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Wait is Over!","review":"After weathering many delays Robb's book finally sees the light of day and boy, was it worth the wait. Thoughtfully written and impecably researched, this book is to be included among the best guitar reference tomes of Tom Wheeler, Richard Smith, and Nacho Banos.The biography section in entertaining and informative, but the guitar section is where this book really throws down the goods. Awesomely photographed and interspersed with interviews and info. I have seen and read just about every vintage guitar book and was delighted to view many prototype guitars and details never seen in any book. The wonderful up-close pictures of \\"Pearly Gates\\" and \\"Hot'Lanta\\" were highlights.Sections on Les Paul amps, Customs, Juniors, Specials, and 45 pages of '58-'60 Les Paul Sunbursts in all of their glory...it's all here.Do not hesitate to get this book, you will not be disappointed!Robb Lawrence has certainly raised the bar with this book and I eagerly await volume II. Bravo Robb!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Inside information.","review":"This is an excellent book with lots of interviews with Les Paul and others who were part of the development of the Les Paul guitar through the early years.

I wish that Amazon would stock the kindle version of the Churchill autobiographies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Close, but no \\"Havana Cigar\\"...","review":"If you are new to Winston Churchill, and looking for an executive summary of his unique style, this is a book for you. I had read a couple of bio's from the library. My parents had visited Chartwell and brought me a book about the house from there. So I already knew a bit about his war years.What tempted me to this book was the thought that it offered a perspective on Churchill that would be useful in our daily lives; from the summary, I was expecting almost a guide to setting up self-management systems that really work. The book started out well, but drifted a bit towards being yet another bio of Churchill and his peers in later pages.Don't be put off buying this book; by making my own 2-page summary of the \\"lines-between-the-lines\\", I got some of what I was after. However, I thought I would have just that bit more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"It's a small book but very informative. I'm not sure I would want to read it for fun. I'm using it for my thesis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"As an admirer of Churchill I was very excited by the discovery that there was a new book about him from his official biographer Martin Gilbert. However after ordering and reading the book I was very disappointed. There is absolutely no new information about Churchill in this 97-page \\"pamphlet\\". This \\"pamphlet\\" is simple the text of a lecture Martin Gilbert gave at the University of Toronto. If you have read \\"Finest Hour\\" or \\"Churchill: A Life\\" also by Martin Gilbert, there is no need to waste your money and read this abridgement."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book","review":"Please don't kill yourself and follow this book. I have 2 adoptive daughters who have Hep B. One has a Hep D co-infection and is following the Hep C treatment which is interferon. Interferon cures about 70% of Hep C patients, so you do have treatment options. Milk thistle and other herbs just don't do anything, no matter what this quack says. There is no conspiracy. Hep C like all chronic hepatitis cases has a spontaneous cure rate meaning the body will cure the virus by itself. Nothing in this book changes the spontaneous cure rate. So there is lots of anecdotal evidence of cures but these \\"cures\\" are just not caused by anything this book recommends.I know a diagnosis of Hepatitis is a scary thing. There are some great books on living with Hepatitis and managing the condition, this is not one of them. See your doctor, follow her advice, eat right, get some exercise, enjoy life, and do not buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice package, poorly reasoned","review":"This a handsomely conceived and executed volume. The problems begin when you start reading it. An astonishing number of topics are confusingly discussed and related, creating confusion where clarity would be appreciated. The author(s) also seem to have made no determination beforehand who the target audience would be, jumping from beginner-level explanations to pointlessly involved details. Techies won't find much to use here, and tyros will find themselves endlessly reading and re-reading passages trying to glean some meaning. Trust me- there are better- much better- basic manuals on PC's!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy technical and informational reading","review":"Peter Norton's Inside the PC, Eighth Edition, and holds your attention better than most other technical books. It is written in a conversational style, which is easy to understand. Norton lays out his topics logically beginning with basic hardware information and becoming increasingly more complex. He uses pictures, graphs, and tables sparingly, only when necessary. Some of the most interesting sections are his Historical Asides, Notes, Technical Notes, Tips, Standards, and his own Principles, which come from his personal experience. There is a Quick Navigator inside the front cover that tells you where in the book to find general areas of information. The book has a useful glossary and a cross-referenced index. This is a good informational book at an intermediate level."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply too much rape","review":"I had to stop reading this book (and the series) because the author simply spends too much time describing Gregor's rape campaign. Enough already, he's a bad dude ~ we get it ~ move on! I mean in the entire Malazan series (10 000 pages and counting) there is just 1 incidence of rape and it's only mentioned obliquely moreto explain a change to her character. Quite simply it's gross and very off putting. I won't waste any more of my money. Plus the books are too damn slow with too many storylines."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't take this much longer, where is Book IV?","review":"I think I already reviewed Storm of Swords, even before I was done with it. I tried the Terry Goodkind, and the Robert Jordans, but Martin has spoiled me. Charactors that are not carboard cut-outs, successes and failures of pro and ant-tagonists, everything a committed reader should demand are all here. I assume that if you are considering buynig this book, you have read the first two. If you are \\"window shopping\\" for a series-STOP! read all three. They are terrific."},{"rating":"2","title":"Be warned: here be no heroes","review":"This book, this story is what I have always wanted. a book were bad things happen to the good and the bad.

I never thought a series like this would be my kind of books--too manly or something. My husband convinced me to just give book one a try because he thought it was awesome. He was so right! It's kind of crazy, but these books really get into your head--I found that I even dreamed about the characters and events if I read A Storm of Swords too close to bed time. You'll stay up late to read, and be tired in the morning, but it will be worth every bag under your eyes!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It doesn't get any better than this!","review":"A Storm of Swords is simply amazing. There are so many plot twists, devious schemes, and mind games that it boggles the mind. GRRM keeps the reader in suspense the whole book.

If you don't like A Song of Ice and Fire, something is wrong with you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Storm of swords","review":"This is the third book in the series and I liked each one less. Everyone that is good or tries to do the right thing or act with integrity is severely punished and then killed. In real life the \\"good guy\\" winsoccasionally. There is so much sex, humiliation and cruelty in this book it gets to be tiresome. I can not recommend this series of books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Painfully good","review":"I was a bit disappointed with Martin's _A Clash of Kings_, which I found to be inferior to his incredible _A Game of Thrones_. _Storm of Swords_, though, is a masterpiece.Be prepared to feel hate, love, fear, pity, guilt, despair, and a myriad of other emotions towards these characters. Yes, you'll care about them. And be prepared to gasp in surprise when the unexpected suddenly hits the page you're on. Martin can do that with the turn of a phrase, having earlier slipped in unnociteable setups behind your back. _A Storm of Swords_ is that kind of book.It's not without its faults. Some of the POVs are dangerously dull in the first 450 pages of the book, and Martin's strataegy of ending almost every single chapter from a certain point of the book on with a huge cliffhanger can be exiting but also frustrating at the same time, since it could be 300 pages or so before you actually reach the same POV again.But those are small faults. _A Storm of Swords_ is just too good to be true."},{"rating":"2","title":"a storm of swords","review":"I liked this book, because it had a lot of unexpected twists and turns in it. Even though it's the third book in the series Martin manages to keep it entertaining and I just love how you can completely loose yourself in his imaginary world of the Seven Kingdoms.

That being said, I thought that this was Martin's best effort of the series so far. SoS was fast paced and full of the action that made the first book of the series so great. Martin did a very good job of pacing the different storylines to bring the book to a safisfying conclusion. The ending was certainly unexpected and led me to pick up the fourth novel of the series immediately. Martin has penned the third novel of what is sure to be a classic fantasy series in A Storm of Swords."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnificent!","review":"These books are the best books that I‘ve read in many, many years.

The book closely follows the the plot portrayed in the television series so I recommend it for anyone whos interest was initially captured by the HBO production.Prospective buyers should realize that the character and plot depth requires thorough and somewhat lengthy description."},{"rating":"2","title":"good book","review":"This book has so many plot twists its never dull.

However, this is a great story line with lots of twists and turns. The author continues to switch characters with every chapter, but once you get use to it, it's fine. Just wanted to warn you. Also, buy the series at one time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review of Kindle edition not of book","review":"Fie on the editors for how they handle the maps. While I was not surprised that I couldn't read the maps on my kindle, I though on my computer Kindle program I would be able to -- and I should be able to! But instead they have them in there so small and at such a low resolution that they are worthless! I can zoom on my phone but again, so such a low resolution that they become fuzzy before they become readable -- the \\"look inside\\" preview pages are much better than the maps once you have bought the kindle version. A definite downside to the kindle books -- and unnecessary given the accompanying computer and phone programs for these books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading","review":"When this book first came out Martin had to put out a letter explaining that he had to chop it down to half the characters because it would have been too big. He said to expect the rest in six months.HOGWASH! Where is the rest of it? Just like Robert Jordan and his \\"Wheel of Time\\" series, this story got away from Martin and we may never see the end."},{"rating":"1","title":"not exactly as expected","review":"I bought this book, expecting a full-size hardcover book. It was priced cheaper, but I figured priced competitively. It turned out to be a small hard-cover book, the size of paperbacks. If I would have known, I would have purchased the full size hardcover for the additional price, or I would have bought the paperback for cheaper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very deftly done","review":"When reading the books of George R.R. Martin, one gets the impression that he planned every detail, every chapter and event from the beginning - how else to explain such absolute genius in plotting and structure? I was left shaking my head many times in disbelief as Martin upped the tension even more, all the while seamlessly resolving loose ends from the first book. Also interesting is the way he uses parallel events in 'A Storm of Swords' -- weddings, trials, betrayals, to name a few. This book is, however, one of the most depressing I have ever read: 'Storm' is relentlessly brutal and almost agonizing to read in places. The reader struggles on, not knowing if his favourite character will survive another chapter. Every character, from nameless inkeeper to prominent protagonist is expendable, it seems, which actually lends the series a sense of danger not to be found in other fantasy. Quite recommended - but be forewarned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pace slows to a crawl in book 3 - needs an editor!","review":"I was thoroughly enthralled with Books 1 and 2 for all the reasons that all the positive reviewers state clearly - imaginative, rich plot, whole variety of types of characters each with their own motives,etc etc. But in Book 3 I have reached an incredible level of frustration that key areas of the plot just do not seem to be moving forward. If this is book 3 and there are theoretically going to be 7 books in total, do I have to go through another several thousand pages to reach resolution? I am an avid reader and the volume of the books is not an issue, I just do not feel like I am rewarded for my efforts here. I finally gave up mid way through Book 3 and then just read the wiki summaries online for the rest.this is one of the few books which would actually benefit from an \\"abridged\\" version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I have read all his stuff. I would highly recommend this series to those who've never read it. Excelant read."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite of the Series","review":"This book was impossible to stop reading. It is by far my favorite of the first five books. I can't wait to re-read thos novel"},{"rating":"1","title":"cheap trickery","review":"Maybe I'd have given this two stars if I hadn't seen so many reviews comparing it favourably to Tolkien's Lord of the Rings. A Song of Ice and Fire started out well, but this last instalment seems to be going nowhere except downhill. Martin knows all the tricks, but I wonder what else he knows. This doesn't come anywhere near Tolkien - it's the conjurer's cheap tricks against the litterally wonderful magic of the wizard.I'm surprised so many people give it five stars, but I guess every book gets the readers it deserves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wait a couple of years for Mr Martin to finish the story","review":"I normally never buy a newly released fantasy book because I have this strange desire of actually wanting a frickin' end to the stories I read. Seeing this third book released, I figured I was safe - oh, how wrong I was. Three thousand pages of story and very little is resolved. I recommend waiting a couple of years and then visiting your local half-price bookstore. In the meantime, go read something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"dissapointing after 2 great books","review":"I would rate the previous volumes in this series very highly, and while this one has its moments ultimately it's a dissapointment. It feels as though Martin lost his way and couldn't work out what to do with his characters so ends up killing off a large number in the last hundred or so pages, or leaving them in limbo. I don't understand why the Danerys thread was in there if she never gets to actually challenge for the throne! The whole valar morgulis thread of arys' story (which I loved) never went anywhere either. And who was the black rider with cold hands who rescued Sam? Another intriguing sub-plot (well the whole book feels like subplots) that disappears. It feels like their should be a fourth volume to explain everything properly. Much of the first half of the book is gripping, but definitely loses its way in the second half. In the end just too many characters and plots which never came together."},{"rating":"2","title":"OUTSTANDING","review":"I have been buying books from Amazon since the site opened and this is the first review I am writing.This series is outstanding. It effectively explodes all the conventions of the hackneyed, formulaic and boring Sword and Sorcery genre. Where The Lorf of the Rings is black and white, ASOIAF is all grey areas and realpoltik.Do youself a favor and buy all five books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easily Equaling Tolkien","review":"George R. R. Martin scares me. Ever time I read his books I am sure there is no possible way for a human being to have written them. They have too many subplots, but yet stay focused, too many characters, but doesn't stray. All in all, it seems to real to be true. I read the first book and thought, 'This certainly can't continue at this level.' I was right, each consecutive novel has surpassed the other, amazingly enough. My words may seem a bit strong, perhaps exaggerated, but they aren't, you must read it to be able to understand."},{"rating":"2","title":"So good","review":"Great book, left me eager to start right away on the next one in the series. Some wonderfully unexpected surprises too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the Series","review":"Wonderfully paced! I read the first two and would constantly get bored at slow parts or be frustrated because the action would go beyond what I had time to sit and read. But this book was beautiful in its pacing, kept the story going with tons of action, intrigue, politics, twists, deaths, and so on! Hard to say that anyone should forego the first two in the series but this one makes the work leading up to them quite worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Storm of Swords (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 3)","review":"i just want to say - this books ROCKS!!! never read much fantasy novels except for those by old master Tolkien, but boy, this book tops!brought me from anger to tears to satisfaction to hurt, echoing in myself each character's emotions and pain. never was i this taken and swept into the players' lives - felt like i was right there, there and then.i can't wait for book 4, 5, 6 *AAAAAAAAAAAAAAARGH* all of them!!!*valar morghullis* i see myself in Arya....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reiterating the already stated","review":"I just wanted to add that this series is awe-inspiring and shockingly realistic for the genre of fantasy. The characters are given depth and perspective through different viewpoints, leaving the reader with mixed feelings on whether they are \\"good\\" or not, and whether they should be pitied or condemned. These books have given me many sleepless nights because I was so engrossed in the Song of Ice and Fire, and when I finally had to put down the book I was kept up the rest of the night worrying about my favorite characters' fate. I have fallen in love with several characters and even though I have finished all three (and wait impatiently for the forth) I cannot seem to get the story from my mind and am drawn back to reread it again and again. These books are rewarding, exciting, and allow you to be swept away into a place that is not only magical in a literal sense, but in that it captures your soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"My mind is amazed but my heart is disappointed","review":"GRRM is a great writer but sometimes i feel like he forces huge turn arounds just because he wants to and for no major reason.

As the story continued through the next few books, many (if not most) of the main characters, or at least my favorite ones, were killed off by the author. What began as a sort of shock therapy has finally resulted in my lack of interest. Whether or not all the killing gives the story a feel of realism, the truth is that fiction is supposed to be entertainment. Martin has not been able to replace the characters with others of equal interest. It's like your sibling who has been married 4 times -- it's impossible to care as much about number 4 as you did earlier. For me, I'm done; I'm not moving on to volume four."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"This whole Song of Ice and Fire saga is definitely worth reading! I strongly recommend it if you like books you can't stop reading!"},{"rating":"2","title":"MY GOD, THE GLORY CONTINUES!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Amazing. The epic continues and the stakes are raised even higher than they were in the second book. The death of a very integral character surprised me and many at the end of the first book and only continued in the second. Try not to fall in love with anyone too much because you'll never know who is offed next. With the third you can expect armies of the undead, messy and costly battles to all of the families, and dragons in full destructive mode. The intrigues take unexpected turns, even to skeptics who beleived they had it all figured out. My only worry is that the story gets somuch deeper that I don't know if Martin can reasonably pull it all together in just two more books. As a fan of the Wheel of Time I find it refreshing that Martin can convey as much of a richly detailed back story as well as an equal amount of back-stabbing without the need to stretch it out over ten billion volumes.

When I first read the book I was a big fan. I enjoyed his characters depth and his gritty storing telling, alas I feel all of the books to date possess the same story. Several nobles who feel they should be the rightful king or queen. A noble family divided and are attempting to either escape or find there way home (this bit is especially dull.) and the mystery of the north. This storyline sofar to date has been in all three books and each book has over 1000 pages. My advice to Mr Martin - less description and recycled tales and more story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated and the author is an egomaniac!","review":"I must admit that I enjoyed reading the first 2 books in this series, but this one just started to drag. The author is full of himself to use \\"R.R.\\" in his name like Tolkien, but he doesn't come close. He is so concerned with producing 10 lb books that he can't generate the next volume within a decent time frame. It would serve us all right if he croaks before he can finish this overblown series.As a lover of LOTR, my only problem with Tolkien was that he has inspired too many authors that are unable or unwilling to finish a story line within a reasonable number of volumes or pages. Methinks guys like Martin are more concerned with hooking readers into a life-time annuity of income for themselves rather than actually concluding a story. Or perhaps he has created so many interrelated story lines that even he can't figure out how to end it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"For God's sake, finish the damn thing!!!!!","review":"I read the first two installments of this project with some enthusiasm thinking I would likely enjoy it since it was being made into a TV series and I enjoy some fantasy works. And I did enjoy them for a while. But this book goes nowhere and I am sick of the characters. I want some resolution and I understand there are at least two more books after this one. It goes on and on ad nauseum. This whole story could have been done in a couple of good books instead of dragging it out so interminably. I can't finish this book and I am sure I won't read anymore of Martin's work. I get the strong feeling his writing is more about the $$$ he can pull in from poor suckers like me, than about producing a good, readable tale. Enough is enough. I have better things to do and read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Series, but third book is awfully tragic","review":"I really enjoyed the first two books, and this one started out just as good. However, two of the main characters die at the \\"Red Wedding.\\" It was totally apalling and took the fun out of reading it. Also, I wouldn't recommend this book for younger teenagers because of the sex scenes.

But I trust HBO and they haven't let me down yet. I am OBSESSED with these books. Seriously, they have become an addiction and my husband wants to put me in rehab. I read a lot, but rarely do you come upon a book where you are so engrossed in the characters that you cannot stop thinking about them, it first happened for me with \\"The Stand\\", and I would equate this serious to that type of book (although very different writing styles). The character development is done over the course of much action and you don't really get a sense for the richness of them until the 3rd book (IMO), but they keep growing in your mind the more you read, which I love.

It seems the personality of the characters the author has made is twisted suddenly to shift a plot. I guess it's one way to make the novel longer but the characters are all bipolar.

Should I love him for his brilliant writing or hate him for making me wait another 12+ months for A Dance with Dragons to figure out is going to happen next?As a fellow writer, I am in awe of Martin's deep, alomost convoluted, plots and twists.

His latest book is fantasic. There isn't a boring chapter in it, or boring characters. Watch out for plot twists galore as well as superb characterization.

The book is massive both in scale and length, continuing the mutiiple story lines from the prior books, with each chapter focused on a particular character. As mentioned before, the author has no qualms about killing, maiming or drastically changing characters, including ones considered to be major players. I was shocked by some of the events in this volume and kept having to stop myself from going ahead to find the next chapter for a particular character to find out what had happened. Without giving anything away, this book focuses more on Jon Snow, Tyrion, Arya and Sansa, with the other major characters having less presence.

Be warned though; like the first two, this one doesn't really have an ending. Yes, he is coming out with another book(When? Who knows . . .), so beware of the cliffhanger at the end. Speaking of cliffhangers, now that George R R has seen that he can get away with one at the end of a chapter, also expect a cliffhanger at the end of every one! (Except Bran the Boring) Oh yeah, that's another thing, you can just about skip his chapters, he doesn't do a whole lot in this book except give in to his insanity. I am just being facetious of course, he does do some important stuff. Daenarys really kicks butt in this book, and a lot of really important things happen.

I liked the fact that everything didn't always turn out perfect and that bad things can happen to the good characters. Most fantasy novels make their heroes invincible and impossible to kill even though they have many weaknesses. This was a refreshing dose of reality. Not all of the characters were appealling. But i guess that is just another element of this book that makes it more realistic. However, Jon was a very interesting character to read about. He seems very charasmatic, but again he isn't perfect, he's just like everyone else. I found myself pulling for him through the whole book. However, I only gave this book four stars because some of the more grotesque and perverse scenes were focused on in a little too much detail.

The best that can be said about this chapter is that it has some very jaw dropping twists and turns. Major characters get wiped off, and other characters launch into considerable growth both in personality, as well as in position on the chessboard. However, I found myself skipping over too many pages just to get to the good stuff. The book is filled with too much filler and fluff disguised as \\"details\\".

Unlike the first two, this book is a no-yawner from cover to cover, and is much better than the \\"Feast for Crows\\" and \\"Dance with Dragons\\" combined. It's too bad that the series didn't conclude with this third very long book, while the author was still inspired for it. With pages numbering in the double digits, this should have been possible, but for the publishers and their contracts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard to put down, once you pass the midway mark","review":"Like the two before this third in the series, A Storm of Swords delivers twists and turns, action and intrigue, with a great host of believable characters that you love, hate, cheer for and die with. This installment weaves even more interesting events and changes into what I feel may yet be one of the greatest epic fantasy series I have ever read. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"There's too many reviews as it is so I'll keep it short. Basically, yes this is the best of the series so far. And the series is perhaps better than any other fantasy I've read. Such a thick and tasty plot...the only problem you might have with this book is the delicious bitterness of seeing the \\"bad guys\\" win a bit too often for comfort. The raw power of this series is staggering. The real problem with this book is the hunger for more once you get to the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"a storm of swords","review":"this is a very good book and continues the story of a game of thrones and i will getbook 4 this summer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this Series","review":"This was a good follow up to the second book; it took me a little longer amount of time to inhale this book, it was a dry start but definitely got better as the chapters slipped by. New people made it interesting during slower times as well. Onto my 4th book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Storm of Wind","review":"I loved the first 2 books but am having trouble finishing third. The plot moves at glacial slowness. In the first 2 books the long-winded descriptions were fun. But I do not need 5-10 pages every time somebody eats lunch. Most reviewers were happy with this book, but take a look at the less enthusiastic reviews of 4 & 5. If George Martin had the sense to write a Trilogy he might have had a masterpiece. As an alternative he should have kept each book to 500 pages.The HBO TV series is off to a good start. They will leave out the 'starchy filler' so I think I'll watch the TV version and skip the rest of the books."},{"rating":"2","title":"Going strong","review":"The series is still solid -- writing is believable, characters are good, and enough suspense is resolved for the read to be satisfying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great series. Full of action, deceit and plotting.","review":"This book, the third of the series, is like the others and required reading to follow a wonderful story by R. R. Martin. Once started, this work is almost impossible to put down. I am stating the next book immediately."},{"rating":"2","title":"A storm of swords","review":"Oh wow.. I've lost sleep over this book. I loved it.. and hated it.. enjoy it, as I did.

Georgie has a sickness for the trashy and the bad guys just out right murdering...um I am at a lost of words. He can't even allow an 8 year old girl to get home to her mother. Just let her get to her mother for the love of God!....Clearly he could have made more of the dire wolves and the Starks....I can see that the children of Ned Stark with their wolves could have gathered and conquered at the right time. Nope, he loves bad guys. He allows the Lasiters to escape all horror, tradegy, and loss, but the Honorable, Loyal, he just writes his death of the righteous. I hate it, and I threw the book across the room. I won't waste the rest of my time. I hope you suffer George, like the Starks......"},{"rating":"1","title":"The story of Job","review":"The fact that the story is well written only makes it worse. The main characters spend the whole book experiencing sorrow and hardship. None of the characters you come to like ever have anything good happend to them, and most of the end up dead. At least in the first two books some of the characters did well, but in this last book everyone is either dead or locked up. This makes the book tiresome. I wish I stopped at book 2, I would be a happier person now if I hadn't read this book! I spend each chapter waiting for the axe to drop on the next character. This isn't a fantasy book, its a tragedy!!! Shame on you George RR Martin!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best so far...","review":"Out of the first three books of the series, Storm of Swords is my favorite.I wont give any spoilers but there were times I wanted to cry and others I was cheering out loud. This book really is a bit of an emotional roller coaster but in a way only George R.R. Martin can do. Awesome read. Awesome series. I can't wait to start book four.Valar Morghulis."},{"rating":"2","title":"Addictive--even though the writing's awful","review":"Well, I've gotten through book V--despite the dangling modifiers, excessive description, repetitive words and phrases, and constant confusion about who's who that is endemic to each book.

For fans of epic sword and sorcery this is a must read. I put off reading the series for most of a decade and positively ran through it, and have since gone back and reread it twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frustrated","review":"Like the first two this one is well written but it's not going anywhere fast enough. Please wrap things up better Mr. Martin. It's like watching a very well crafted night time soap but you have to wait a year for the next episode. By then how can we remember the vast array of characters and and their complex inter-dealings? I wish you would conclude the Big Clash while still leaving room for a sequel. I feel like the books just end in the middle, leaving me robbed.....especially after forking over the $$ for a hard bound edition, as I did this time. Before I buy the next one I'll wait and see if things are wrapped up better ( by reading reviews) or I'll move onto other series. Had there been a more completeness to the main parts of the storie I could have easily gone 5 stars......I'm just to FRUSTRATED!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The never-ending load of crap series!","review":"Marin is a good writer as far as the first book went and then I get to the third book praying for a final and it doesn't even end. I get to the part where he slaughters all the good characters and I just threw the book away. What a waste of time and he doesn't even finish. I agree with other reviewers in go back to reading the series when he is on his 8th or 10th book when ever he bloody stops or all the characters are dead.

I cound't stand it. I put the books on my list because of recommendations here and I honestly cannot understand why anyone would like it. It was painful to read. The characters are cutouts, the plot is completely derivative. A HUGE disappointment and I cannot believe all the praise for these books is real."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated and too verbous","review":"This book could have been cut by half. Full of insignificant descriptions, overly long conversations and paragraphs that do not add to the plotline or to the richness of the imagination. i found it extremely difficult to get through this book, and usually i have no problems getting through books - i read through terry goodkind's faith of the fallen and wizards first rule in one day each. I was very excited to receive this copy of storm of swords, hearing so much about it, and the first two chapters were quite promising. we are introduced to characters, there was a ton of potential conflicts...yet somehow by chapter 5 i was snoozing and feeling quite annoyed, bored, and cheated.orson scott card, terry goodkind, fiest, jordan, tolkien...all much much better, more engaging writers!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Over hyped, under written","review":"It's almost too embarrassing to admit that I've read this ridiculous trash, it was at times juvenile fun but mostly just an overlong boring slog through an endless parade of heraldry and sigils. George RR Martin is just one of those fantasy authors who is better suited to writing for the want ads. If you disagree with this review you only prove my point."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh please end the misery.......","review":"What started out as a good thing has slipped beyond mediocrity into drivel. Martin is stretching this tale out and one wonders whether he will ever get to the point ala many of the modern fantasy writers i.e., Jordan. I reread all 3 of the books issued just to be sure I was being fair. I realize now the unkindest cut of all is coming from the author who is perpetuating a long drawn out seemingly pointless story on all who had the misfortune to hope that finally a tale worthy of being held up to LOTR was being presented to us. I enjoyed the first book and eagerly anticipated the second. I was disappointed with it and hoped for redemption with the third. My dejection was compounded by the third installation. To hades with this nonsense. DONT write another...oh please end the misery......."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too nasty for good fantasy + hilarious typo","review":"My husband has been reading this series and says that it's just too explicit (dirty) for Christian women to even read. I love fantasy, but I guess I'll stick with Robert Jordan & Terry Goodkind. Plus, he found a hilarious typo that was overlooked in proofreading! On page 495 of the paperback 2011 edition, it states, \\"Yet Ser Axell proposes we swoop down on the homes they left behind, to rape their windows and put their children to the sword.\\" I think it would be difficult to perform that act on a \\"window\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"read it slow...it'll be years to book four, yes that's right","review":"As I neared the end, I was afraid there wouldn't be enough room for the grand resolution I was hoping. Seemed Martin thought so too. He has said in an interview that this will be a five or six book series with two years between the publishing of each. This book is even better than the first two. Cast aside any notions of what you thought was going to happen at the end of Book 2. If you've come this far in the series..I don't need to say more; you know."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Fantastic storyline. The best book of the series so far. I can't wait to read the next book of this fantastic series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time, Waste of plot...","review":"Reading this series is such a waste of time. By the time I got to book 4, because I was hoping so much that the books would get better, that progress would be made. However, no progress is made in this book. It was just a waste of time. There is no REAL plot in this series. I am very surprised by the so many who like this series. It SUCKS!!!! I would rave a bit more, but I feel that this book wasted so much of my time, and I don't feel like wasting any more time with it. If the HBO series is exactly like the book series, I won't even bother watching the show. It's pointless. All the main characters die, there is no progress with kaleesi and her dragons. We don't get to see Arya's wolf again. It's all just a waste of time. With none of the characters getting anywhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Underage kids?","review":"Has anyone but me noticed that most of the female individuals in the book are either underage or being abused and disempowered? Very weird... What kind of sadistic and sexually repressed mind would write this stuff? Who are the readers that give these books five stars and actually \\"like\\" this mess? Besides the strangely negative, sadistic and perverse text, this material is soooooo repetitive and boring. No commitment to anything of substance like story or characters. With no imagination or creativity the author is jumping all over the place like a preteen with untreated ADHD and attachment issues. I can't believe this soapy-simple stuff was up for an award, ever! I recommend some therapy for potential socio-sexual issues and focus. I am certainly not touching this trash again. One would have to be a masochist to keep reading this cruel nonsense."},{"rating":"2","title":"Storm of Swords","review":"The third book of a series and follow the story line.

They just don't feel right. But after reading the first novel in this series, I have read each book at least twice. Martin's multi-layered storytelling and full, dimensioned characters make you want to see what happens to them, and the plotlines are beautfully laid out, a serpentine structure that gets better as it slowly uncoils. In addition, martin knows how to keep an audience without the feeling of making the reader tired of reading. Jordan has nothing on this guy, and he never will."},{"rating":"1","title":"Storm of swords... paperback reissue Aug 2005 missing pages","review":"When I got to page 496 of this version and started reading the next page I realized that something was missing.... the very next page was 561.

Of course, I'm referring to the way that Rob and Catelyn Stark met their ends. I found Catelyn to be completely unlikeable, but I'd gotten used to having her around. Granted, George R.R. Martin has managed to get me rooting for my 2nd least favorite character, Jamie, but I don't see any reason to continue this. Thanks for the ride, but I'm getting off before I really get sick."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sweeping Tapestry, entirely in gray, black, and brown.","review":"Oh, gods... I'm not sure how Martin has bagged such critical acclaim with these books. His stories progress at a glacial pace. This would not be so bad if these were enjoyable characters to follow. They arent. Or rather, the majority of them aren't. If he picked a single character, that might make for interesting reading (Tyrion for example). Or if the characters were effective, that would be alright. The characters are too often like pieces of flotsam tossed on rough seas. Life is like that sometimes. But it doesnt make for good storytelling.The books I'm reminded of most to compare these to are Brin's Galactic Civilization books. He also split the story among many characters. But he did it in cliff-hanger serials with scrappy characters you wanted to like. Martin's characters are an often luckless assorment of not very interesing or fun people with lives that manage to be somehow boring against grand spectacle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Afraid of silly reviewers!!","review":"First of all I love this whole series. It really is fantastic! However, I was really annoyed at the reviewer that stated we were afraid of saying this was better than TOLKIEN. You my friend need to GET A LIFE! OK! There is absolutely no reason to make that determination. Tolkien invented the genre for heaven sakes. Mr. Martin has had his influence and that of other fantasy writers and whatever else he is inspired by to help him along. So you would hope that he could add something to what has gone before him. I would agree that he has but I also feel it is a shameful waste of time to say that Tolkien is somehow less than Martin. BOO!"},{"rating":"1","title":"So disappointed","review":"I loved the first two books of the series, but just can't get myself to finish this one (about 600 pages into it). Why? Because the characters are constantly doing stupid things. Anything to get into more trouble.In the first two books, the characters always felt honest. Their choices made sense to me even when the paths they picked were the dangerous ones. But in this book, the characters simply seem reckless -- especially King Rob and his mother. They just seem to do whatever it takes to get into deeper trouble, even when that course is obviously pointless. The series started to be a problem for me with Theon. Why does he do anything? As far as I can tell, he's there to make sure some characters make stupid choices later on. When that's finished, so is Theon. Just pointless.At any rate, the first book is simply great. But I'm deeply disappointed with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who's Left to Cheer For??? (Spoilers)","review":"I haven't had any problems with the Kindle edition. I do have problems with killing off most of the more interesting and compelling characters and plot lines. Would X-Men be interesting if Wolverine was killed off immediately after Professor X was killed? Would Star Wars be watchable if Luke was killed by Darth Vader? Would Lord of the Rings be such a great story if Gandalf stayed dead and Sauron got the ring afterwards? I don't think I'll read the next book; I'm tired of inevitabilities being pushed and pushed along with new characters and twists being introduced all the while. For example, Ayra trying to get to her mom. Give me a break, how many people did she get passed along to throughout the 2nd and 3rd books?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle Edition does not have chapter breaks!!!!","review":"I own this whole series (or what there is of it so far) and I LOVE it.HOWEVER: the kindle editions of ASOS and AFFC DO NOT INCLUDE CHAPTER BREAKS! This is just plain stupid. The first two books include chapter breaks. If you forgot someone's name or wanted to reread a section it was pretty easy to skip chapters. No can do with the last two. 1200 pages of text and no way to jump ahead or back other than page by page. IT'S AWFUL.Buy the paperback."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'VE BEEN WAITING FOR THEM TO FIX MY REQUEST FOR 3 MONTHS!!","review":"I originally ordered this book, the regular sized version, and they sent me the mass production version even though they made no reference that it was the smaller sized version. They are the ONLY company that sent me the wrong one, and I bought all five books of this collection. I wrote a bad review, and they promised to send me the correct one if I removed it, and so I removed it, and it's been 3 MONTHS! I STILL havent received the book. They are all professional in their emails, but who cares when you pay for something you never receive?? I don't want your professionalism without your ethics!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A turn for the worse","review":"I decided to read the books because, my mom turned me on to the HBO Series. I really liked the series and as you know there's never enough time in a movie or tv series to give you the back story. The first two books followed the storyline mostly and provided the necessary background information to give you a fuller picture of the characters and so forth. In the third book the story has taken such a turn for the worse that now, I not only don't want to finish the book. I may not even continue watching the series. What a turn off for me. It's just like Harry Potter all over again. I put in so much time reading those books, seeing those movies and the end was awful. It made me feel like I wasted my time. I just don't want to do it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"So go down the line that you can get a few hours of the different types of the different types of the messages won't send them together yesterday that"},{"rating":"1","title":"too much porn...","review":"I read somewhere that this man is an american J.R.R.T. No, he is not. For starters, J.R.R.T. had monsters, creatures etc. I think this will be the last book by this man that I read. At first, his porn fantasy wasn't so bothering until this particular book where it became more and more adult related and a full chapter about sex is just boring and not very exciting. Especially with how horrible it is written. I hate to burst the author's bubble but it usually is \\"slopping wet\\" in that area, as he so decidingly stated.It is just boring to keep reading about family vs. family vs. family with little description about anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm done!","review":"I'm new to this series. My brother was telling me how great the tv show is but since I don't watch tv I decided to read it. I'll have to say I did enjoy the first book but my interest has waned with each chapter. Martin's prose is bland and his imagery seems limited for the fantasy genre. There are many fantasy novels that I'd love to see turned into a tv series but I see why this one has been chosen...it's little more than a soap opera dressed in armor. I struggled through this third installment hoping for a light at the end of the tunnel but, seriously, to end the book with lady stark coming back after her throat's been opened is, in Martin's words, a mummer's farce. I'm done with this series. This isn't fantasy writing; it's commercialism at it's finest."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best... Another triumph","review":"This book (and the books preceding it) are simply the best series I have ever read... and I've been reading fantasy since I was four. I can't really tell anything about the books, because part of the ultimate fun of reading these books is that you have absolutely no idea what is going to happen. The only thing that Martin does that is kind of annoying and disappointing is to kill off someone who's been around since the first chapter of the first book. This does add to the realism, though, but when your favorite character gets killed...Advice: If you buy or read the books in hardcover, DO NOT look at the inside front cover where it tells about the book. It gives some things away. Start with the first book, A Game of Thrones, or you'll be completely lost. And, budget several sleepless nights to read these.Happy reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"The fight for Westeros continues","review":"In the longest book of the series so far, the lands of Westeros are no closer to peace than when we last left them.

Book three is my favorite of the series (I'm in the middle of book five now), by far! Many loose ends are tied up, tons of action and no slow parts.

Love this series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant writing!","review":"A Storm of Swords is the third book in the series that I have read and Martin has never disappointed me ever since.

I could not put it down for most of it, especially from around half way to the end. The developments of Jon Snow, the entire remaining Stark family, the battle for Crown, Brienne, the story of the wedding at Twin towers, all of it is captivating and I didn't even mention the dragons and Dany. As GRRM says in the beginning of book 4, he's built a solid foundation from which to build on this story. That's very true...if you've liked books 1 and 2, you will find that 3 is better yet, just have patience, it's long."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can not put it down!","review":"This series has everything you could possibly want.

How this guy got 5 books out of this is beyond me. The only reason I kept going was because I had finished 2 of the books and figured the ending had to bring it all together. Nope. Just another murder and a dangling end. Just lots of war, suffering, burning, greed, heads on spikes. I skipped book 4 and never felt like I missed a thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong Cover Art....","review":"I ordered this book with the knowledge that I would be receiving the cover art that was displayed in the picture.

I so enjoyed the first one that I had hoped the second would be even longer. Then I picked up this sequel, and after much slogging, finished this one out of passion for the series, chalking it up to writer's block or distraction with other stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'll put it to you this way....","review":"I have read nearly ever fantasy saga or series on the market, from Jordan to Anthony to Goodkind, and more. And never once in my prolific reading career have I been so curious as to search, find, and read chapter summaries at work! Each of the three books in this series is captivating and enthralling. Martin has set the benchmark beyond the reach of almost the entire field of current fantasy writers today. I highly recommend the series.The best thing about Martin is the way he twists your arm painfully behind your back and, somehow, makes you enjoy it. Because there is no way you are happy with his decisions, but they move the story forward and still manage to enchant you with every chapter. Hooray for fantasy, it has finally produced a mature, adult series of novels that leaves the childishness of fairies in the dust...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stopped Reading","review":"I loved the first 2 1/2 books of the series. Character development is an important part of the book to me. I tore through the first 2 books and thought I had found another wheel of time type of series. Now it seems, anyone I was \\"rooting\\" for in the series is dead. I honestly stopped reading it. Have no intention of going back. This may be what other reviewers are calling not the usual fantasy. I personally like the standard fare it would seem. You know, where there are people in the story you have read about for a thousand or so pages actually live and overcome the obstacles put in their path.The world and politics were well played through the first 2+ books. That earned an additional star.One thing this does seem to have in common with the wheel of time is an excellent story could have been told in 3 books. This series (I understand) is supposed to be 7 in length."},{"rating":"2","title":"It just keeps getting better...","review":"It's rare when a series of books can inspire such a wide range of reactions within a single volume, but this whole series has that ability. Each book has moments of poignant tragedy and comic relief, lofty triumph and dark foreboding. We care about these caracters, and though this is true High Fantasy, the characters and politics are very realistic and true.This work is the best of the three so far, and that is high praise indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mostly enjoyed the first two, but this one is just tedious","review":"If you read the first and last chapters of each character of this book, you'll know enough without having to dredge through tedium and dreadful chauvinism. Some give credit to his knowledge of middle ages, but I only see a lack of the sociological history. And his treatment of women...I don't see much insight into women at all. It's exhausted me to the point of not caring to finish the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well written--But...","review":"I read the entire series. Well written but tedious,overlong descriptions. I skimmed much of the series looking for action and plot. It kept my interest enough to slog through all five books hoping for a satisfying conclusion. It finally ended in a shaggy dog ending. The final epilog was no different from any previous chapter. I was very disappointed; romantic that I am, I wanted a happy ending. No such luck. It seemed that another book was waiting to be published to finish thing off. I kept feeling that with good research, the books could have been redeeming by being actual historical fiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehhh wtf","review":"Ok...So I LOVED the first 2 books and I understood when certain things happened to certain people and breaking molds that other fantasy series seemed to make, aka good guy always winning...but do NOT get me so emotionally involved and cheering for someone and then have them killed. Im left with ONE...ONE person I even care to read about now and thats Jon Snow. Im tempted to just start skipping the other chapters cause Im done giving a damn about everyone else, you've left me with little girls and boys and a dwarf, and some hot girl a thousand miles away that should be its own series/book as i keep feeling it just doesnt fit anymore. Im really disappointed and dont know if ill be reading the next book or even bothering with buying the new one. This book really ruined it for me, there was a line and to me this book crossed it and now the story just got utterly boring and pointless... Thanks for ruining it for me. Enjoy your series, Ill watch the first and second seasons on HBO then im done."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a shame.","review":"G. Martin is a great storyteller. But he has some serious issues. A little sex and gore is fine in a fantasy novel, Martin takes it to a whole other twisted level. Incest, rape, blood, just twisted stuff. A complete waste of a talented storyteller. Ain't it a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kindle stopped working","review":"I would love to write a review about this book however just when I get to the climax of the book my kindle stopped working. It is not yet 2 years old and hasn't been damaged so I am really upset about this and not sure how I am going to finish the book. Also I am just about to go on holiday and really wanted to take it with me and buy many more books to read while I am away. I am devastated. Is there something wrong with my kindle or is this just how long they are programmed to last?"},{"rating":"1","title":"I haven't started listening to this book yet - because they changed the actor!! BOOOO","review":"This is a link to Random House customer service: <...>I just sent them a message PLEADING with them to re-record it. Especially with the popularity of Game of Thrones on HBO, I would think it would be a profitable decision!! Roy Dotrice should be the ONLY actor to read this series!! (Sorry to the actor on this book, but you had impossible shoes to fill. I'm sure you would do a great job on other books.)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly Depressing.","review":"I liked the first book a lot. I even liked book two to a degree. Martin has a real nack for getting you deeply attached to the characters and he does have a very complex storyline. (Almost too complex) The main reason why I've givin this book two stars is because books are supposed to be entertaining, not depressing. When you've been enthralled with a character for over 2,500 pages and just out of the blue he or she or them (Most likely all of them) continually get killed it's very depressing. I understand that this book is supposed to be real.(as in the hero's arn't unbeatable and god like) but you can't kill every... one of them.(Where's the hope?) I got to the point where I just wanted to rip the book in two and burn it. Maybe I'll buy the next one. We still have a character or 2 I like to kill and for another... and 900 some pages it should be just a hoot-n-nanny to watch another hero die."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book 3 does not reach expectation","review":"I had as many other readers great expectations regarding the development of the plot. Only I have come to realize that besides more murder and hopelessness there has been little advance in the story considering the large amount of pages!I fear the author started with a great idea that could have made a true piece of literature but that finally has become a product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I loved it.

It just gets better and better. What a great writer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"No one is safe","review":"Storm of Swords in the third entry in the Song of Ice and Fire series. Characters who played central roles in the first two volumes didn't just move to the back burner in a Storm of Swords, many of them died, which I guess is what would happen in a war. It doesn't matter if the person is good or bad, they have an equal shot at dying. That's quite a bit different than most books, but it's one of the things I like about this series. Also, more time is spent of at the Wall, which is the part of the series I enjoy the most. While I really, really enjoyed the book, I will say that the book did not so much end as stop. I know there are more books to come, but this ending was so abrupt, it seemed a bit unfinished. I read a lot of series, and I don't recall an ending this abrupt. That said, it did nothing to quash my enthusiasm for this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Storm of Swords","review":"Excellent read in the Game of Thrones Tradition. A real page turner filled with twists and turns, with lots of surprises!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, Great series","review":"This was an excellent book from start to finish. Like the previous two in the series it kept me captivated for days while I poured through the pages. Not typically one to read fantasy, I have been impressed and subsequently hooked by Martin. Only thing to prevent this from getting a full five stars is its amount of plot twists packed into one book. Almost unbelievable, however Martin has a style that can somehow pull it off when others would likely fall short. Cannot wait for the next installment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't turn into Wheel of Time","review":"many other reviewers have already eloquently and accurately described the reasons I love the books in this series( Song of Ice and Fire) . My one disappointment - I was sure this book would end the series. So, not only is there another book, there is a fifth on the horizon. I pray that we don't end up with a Jordanesque epic here. He has shown in the Wheel of Time series that more can be less ( Winter's heart was beyond disappointing).I would hate to see the spectacular storyline and characterization in these books succumb to a similar fate"},{"rating":"2","title":"As good as the first two.","review":"The only reason this set doesn't earn 5 stars from me is Martin's tendency to confuse the story with just too many families, clans and characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it...But...","review":"I love this book. I love this series! However, this book especially was VERY heavy on details. I love that I can picture every single thing in George RR Martin's head but this one is so steeped in detail I can tell you what color thread is in the clothing of every character. So be prepared to slog through a very detail oriented fun adventure ride."},{"rating":"2","title":"My fav so far!","review":"I don't know if is is that I took a break between book number 2 and 3 in the series but this book to me seemed by far the best.The book picks up immediately where the last one left off with pretty much each chapter leaving at a cliffhanger of sorts. Each one leaving me desperately wanting to find out what happens but then getting drawn into the next charter. There are some serious twist in the story, totally unexpected to me that left me shocked!With each book there is more magic as well which I really like. Oh and it is so descriptive, I can really picture the scenes in the book.Can't wait to read the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"The more I read, the more I get hooked!","review":"Another brilliant book in George R.R. Martin's hugely entertaining and successful A Song of Ice & Fire saga.I had avoided the fantasy genre for many years, after overdosing on Marion Zimmer Bradly when a teen and not wanting to repeat the experience.For me, this is on a par with Tolkien's Lord of the Ring saga or maybe even better."},{"rating":"2","title":"The crowning acheivement of the series (so far)","review":"What can be said that hasn't been said already? Even so, I feel like throwing my two cents into the pot: this is the best of the series so far (out of the four books available as of this writing). I absolutely loved it, as well as the rest of the series, but this is the crowning achievement in my opinion. The finale to this epic novel was amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Five Star Classic","review":"This really is the series to compare all other fantasy books against. Be warned that only four of the books in this series are complete because you are going to want the next one as soon as you finish this gem. I suggest buying all four volumes currently in print to save you from withdraw symptoms. Like everyone else I wish Martin wrote faster but I have to give him props on his quality. Do yourself a favor and gobble up the entire series."},{"rating":"2","title":"My review","review":"I really enjoyed this book. However, some of the lists of people who did various things was a bit boring.

Hope the new series coming to TV will be equally exciting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing book","review":"The third book is as good if not better than the first two. I've never read a book series this enthralling. I couldn't put it down. There are so many twists and surprises. This is one book that is unpredictable. I can't wait to read the next book in the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"i agree with most of the reviews here.","review":"martin's gift for character development, coupled with his keen ear for dialogue, makes for a compelling read. but, i have one question. after killing most of the \\"good guys\\" that we identified with, and after killing most of the \\"bad guys\\" who gave the book it's rotten core, who are we supposed to root for and against? i mean he's literally offed most of the interesting characters. i can't see the next book revolving around stannis baratheon or walder frey. like others, i'm sure it will be worth the wait. highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"great series, OK book","review":"seems to drag on a bit more than 1 and 2, but still brilliantly done. highly recommended, stick with it"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm hooked!","review":"Amazing! I love this whole series. you can picture everything just as the show has done on HBO series. I am Hooked!"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK enough.","review":"I absolutely loved the first book. Great characters, great concepts. That book alone carried my through a extra couple books of the misery that follows. Anyone with a scrap of decency gets mauled as the story continues. You are left with the despicable characters. Eventually it gets so bad that you start routing for the least loathsome of them just so you stop being disappointed when the newest character you try to like gets crushed by the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"My question","review":"When will this book be released in true paperback?I have the previous 2 books in paperback, and want to match them all up in my collection. Trade paperback is nice, but doesn't fit on my bookshelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating, but repetitive.","review":"\\"Storm of Swords\\", the third book in the series, is clearly not the last. While I enjoyed the book and was drawn back into the fantasy world that Martin quite expertly created....I kept wondering, did he lose a family member while writing this book?Characters, both good and evil, seemed to die at an increasingly rapid rate compared to the first two books. (So many of the characters he came to make us care for died that I actually breathed a sigh of relief when he finally killed the cardboard cutout villian, Joffrey.) The rate even increased as the book went on.However, this was the only part of the book that gave me pause. Most of the characters are well fleshed out and real, though he seems to have so many that some suffer with rather flimsy characterization. It is a large world, though, and one cannot know everyone intimately.I will continue to buy the series, however, if only to find out what happens to Danaerys and Arya!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What A Bore - I Give Up","review":"I started reading Game of Thrones on vacation. Book 1 was a good pot-boiler story - lots of pretentious writing, bodice ripping and gore. The overall plot moves at a very slow pace but there are lots of side stories and episodes t oenjoy along the way. Starting on book 2 we got more of the same.It took me til book three to realize this is not a novel, it is a soap opera on paper. It's just one story after another of screwing, getting screwed and finding new and grisly ways to kill off characters. About a third of a way through book three I gave up. If you want a soap opera with swords and magic, then this book is for you. But if you're looking for a novel with a coherent setting, an actual plot, and characters you actually can give a crap about, then keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"story line","review":"too many characters and the stories are too disjointed. You become totally disinterested in the characters because he drags the stories so much"},{"rating":"2","title":"Martin\\"s \\"Storm of Swords\\"","review":"A little slow getting started, but it got better and better all the way through. Martin is amazing in how he keeps you mezmorized with all the characters he presents and their experiences. My son is now reading it and he can't put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Epic Continues","review":"A Song of Ice and Fire continues in this book and Martin delivers! The best thing to bear in mind with this series is that you can't take anything for granted. As we saw in the first novel with the death of Ned Stark, main/favorite characters are never safe and there's no telling who might be the next to fall.I really enjoy these books and am looking forward to reading future installments."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does not disappoint","review":"This is the latest and best installment of Mr. Martins fine series. The characters are deep,multifaceted, and extremely complex. Unlike most of the dreck in this genre, you cannot predict the ending in the first 50 pages. I enjoyed all the seperate storylines and was knocked flat by the last paragraph. Is the next one out yet?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely incredible...","review":"...but it will be absolute torture waiting for book four.This book, amazingly, was actually _better_ than the preceding two. Mr. Martin is without a doubt the most enrapturing fantasy writer I've ever had the privilege to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"fantastic","review":"There is no certainity when you read Martin's series of books--A Song of Ice and Fire. You will find yourself favoring certain characters only to find them killed off. We have been conditioned to believe when we read a book or watch a movie that the main characters, be it the hero or herione or such, are immune to extreme adversity, yet our heros and heriones of Martin's books have no such immunity.Like always, Martin moves from chapter to chapter switching from the persepective of different characters. Some are good, some bad, all are shown as being human with human faults. You can't help but have favorites. My favorites have been the same since book one--Jon and Arya. I can't help but skip through chapters to see how long I will have to wait before I'll get to read more. Now I have to wait for book four.Overall, excently written."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never want it too stop","review":"So I am now on the fourth book, and wanted to talk about the third book. I think the thing I love about this series is that you never know which way things are gonna turn. EVER!!! Its like a rollercoaster ride with no track. The characters a book ago I hated, I can understand a bit better, the ones I loved are showing different sides and makes me not so fond of them. Just like us real humans we make decisions and have to live with them, good or bad. The only bad thing about this series is that I find myself glossing over stuff now, to get to certain characters and what not. My ADD not the authors fault. Well I will just have to reread them and go slower. If you want to get deeply involved with a book, say like Harry Potters characters or some of Stephen Kings yarns, well this will not disappoint. Definetly not a kids book though. Thanks"},{"rating":"1","title":"The series is slowing down","review":"Martin the champion of useless window dressing. This book starts his useless page filling in earnest. The exciting climax of this book has about four pages of copy in his next book. What a let down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Story","review":"This book is by far the best, and most exciting book in the series so far. I enjoyed reading and started the next book immediately after completion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing but frustrating","review":"This book is my favorite so far in the series, which is saying a lot because each book has been incredible. The characters are believable and complicated, and the plotline sucks you in. My only complaint is that these books have a tendency to piss me off. A lot of things happen that you just don't want to happen, and a lot of it is ridiculously cruel. I can't tell you how many times so far in the series my poor phone has been thrown across the room while I've screamed \\"F*** THIS BOOK!\\" I have never reacted so strongly to a book before, and I am not alone among my group of friends to react this way. That should tell you how well it is written. READ THESE. And when you're done, come with me so we can go punch George R.R. Martin in the nose. He went to great lengths to piss me off. I feel it's only fair. lol."},{"rating":"1","title":"The greatest? Whatever..","review":"OK.. I've read all these reviews, and I don't get it. Every one of the books in this series practically bored me to tears. Not only that, but you have trouble rooting for anyone in particular because there are so many characters trying to take the throne. Just when you start to root for a character, Martin runs off and beheads him. He's basically wasted thousands of pages to write something he could have wrote in half of that. I'm imagining this guy basically has no clue how the series is going to end up, so he's just writing a big blob of nothing.. Is there even a point to this series?!He should have made the entire series one big book, I'd have felt better. Obviously several others do not feel this way. So I suppose you have to read for yourself. He's good, but not that good."},{"rating":"1","title":"too old for this","review":"I guess I have a bad attitude about this.Like many of the characters in this series, I'm getting too old to be likely to see a resolution. I fear my heirs are going to have to stand over my grave to tell me what happened. The last time I started a series I vowed it would be the last - but I guess you can brand me an oathbreaker because I started this one. I'm guessing it's likely to be a seven course meal and that means a lot of years before this tale is said and done.Seriously, this is a well-written, gripping epic, but I can't abide the cliffhangers. I don't feel like waiting another year just to replace the current set of situations with another. I'm about ready to fly out of the Moon Door.So, I doubt that I'll buy the next one unless it's the last one. Instead, I'll see if I can manage to outlive whoever the survivor turns out to be and wait to read them all at once. Of course, given that the characters can come back from the dead and I can't..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sick writer ..DONT READ","review":"This write is so sick of mind that i think its a crime to let him live free, he should be in one of the mental asylum.DONT READ THIS BOOK."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't know what book they were reading, but","review":"This whole series has been extremely long winded, ill edited, and an attempt at either soft porn or fantasy, and coming up short on at least the fantasy aspect. The story line is good, however, it is lost in a deluge of side stories that does nothing but water down the story line. A good editor could have pulled the same story together in 1/2 the pages.

BUT DONT BUY THIS BOOK!!some editor somewhere must have told mr martin he would sell more copies if he joined the trend in making science fantasy into science fantasy soft porn. it's just too stupid. it drives the story line and the story goes nowhere. this also happened in terry goodkind's series. for all his reuse of character descriptions, as of book 9-[#10 is just out] at least jordan has resisted this trend.my real rating is ZERO stars!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype","review":"Of Martin's 3 books in this series, I've never been so disappointed. He does weave the plot together rather well, but it was predictable. He spends too much time in detail of characters he never saw fit to elaborate on until he needed some more characters because he's killed off all the other main characters. There was only 1 surprise in the book and it was the very end, and I mean very end. This book was quite easy to put down and full of disappointments for me from such a talented author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Come on, what a disappointment","review":"Why do the authors in the fantasy have this new 'cool trend' of writing huge 'epic' series filled basically with subplots and only a nebulous main theme?All the so-called 'fantasy kings'- Jordan, Terry Goodkind and now GRR Martin have disappointed me greatly. The 'epic' style is very unsatisfactory, more like a soap opera than an epic. Tolkien wrote epic and grand stories, but were they neverending, rambling creations? I had more hopes for this particular series but the author appears to be squandering it away with another Jordan-like fiasco. If you want tightly woven, well-written fantasy, don't expect to be satisfied here. Look at Pullman's provocative and beautiful His Dark Materials, or Ursula K Leguin's thoughtful trilogy. Or go back to the major figure in the genre, Tolkien, and see why these authors are worth reading. These books are more like Swords-and-sorcery Grisham then fantasy. The genre really is going downhill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too dark","review":"In the first two books it was refreshing, but it steadily got worse. Now we've reached my tolerance level. In this book I have to say there is something to disgust all of mankind in some way: Depravity, death on a large scale, death on a small scale described intensely, Necromancy, horrible treachery, likeable characters destroyed as a matter of course, CHILDREN becoming killers...I've had enough.I'll just say one more thing, once I agreed with people who said Robert Jordan was a chicken using \\"immortal\\" main characters etc. No longer. I completely and totally support that style of writing after reading this book. I'm going to get volume 10 of the Wheel of Time and LOVE EVERY PAGE OF IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Storm of Swords (A Song of Ice and Fire, Book 3)","review":"Please do not buy this book, it rambles on for 900 painful pages. The first 2 books were good even with all the players but this one hits the bottom of the barrel and then failed to give an ending. Failure of ending a book is getting to be an epidemic with today's fantasy writers.As I read the book there were good parts but just about everybody I liked gets killed. I told my wife every time I read the Storm of Swords book, the first 2 books were good, this one has to get better. It never did."},{"rating":"1","title":"Re-arranging history","review":"All g.r.r Martin has done is taken the War Of The Roses and set it in a different world. Where the Yorks are the Starks and the Lannisters are the Lancasters.The entire trio of books are abysmal not worth the paper they're printed on. The world Martin created doesn't seem real and doesn't grip you as Jordan's does. The amount of medieval intrigue is over the top and not enough magic or action to counter it. The plot gets all confusing with too many characters all over the place (who's the hero who's the baddy?).No central character, and those he concentrates on are very unlike able."},{"rating":"1","title":"Superior work","review":"My favorite aspect of Ice and Fire is the complexity of its characters. You are allowed to see the humanity of the most dastardly villan, while at the same time, even the most virtuous of characters have elements which, at best could be called weaknesses.While there is a solid core of the supernateral within the series, obvious in the opening, do not look for it within the first book, it is a captivating political story of a disintegrating kingdom with some of the best battle scenes in literature.I am EAGERLY awaiting the continuation. I will enjoy the first three again, before reading the forth. My only question is why the hard cover version of the first book was pulled by the publisher."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much hissing","review":"After reading so many positive reviews, I was very exited when I recieved this cd in the mail.

That being said, CD buyers are often wary of the sound quality of early stereo recordings remastered on CD. To them I would say that this is also one of the very best sounding CDs you will ever own of any music, recorded in digital or analog.

The preceding fame of Fritz Reiner was clearly nourished by his previous achievements.The recording per se, is vibrant and striking, but it never surpassed (at least to my mind after having carefully been compared both of them) the previous version with Reiner and the Pittsburgh Symphony.So if you really consider this is a superlative performance, it's time for you t go in search of the Pittsburgh' performance.My personal list among the most pyramidal achievements of Bartok's Concerto for Orchestra would be the following ones: Antal Dorati, Ferenc Fricsay, Koussevitzki- Boston, Leindsdorf- Boston , Kubelik- Boston Symphony and Boulez - New York Philharmonic.Music for strings, percussion and celesta has a definitive name and surname: Ferenc Fricsay and RIAS from the early fifties."},{"rating":"2","title":"I want to OWN this","review":"Why is it only available via the computer?

Her hero, James, is a wonderful combination of strength, tenderness, and wit, with an intuitive understanding of the heoine that makes him both lovable and sexy!I found the storyline and its subplots riveting from beginning to end, culminating nicely in an ending that left me smiling and ready to read more!

The storyline was quite good and I liked the way the author told James and Honoria's past. The author gave Honoria a strong personality and she carried it well through the book - she said what was on her mind and after what she had been through 8 years ago she had every right to behave as she did. Ms. Sizemore did a nice job with this book and I thank her for bringing me out of my slump of bad authors."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 and a half stars","review":"Had potential, but couldn't focus on the story.

If it had been written that way, it certainly would have been easier for the rest of us to view the book as good as the high-raters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Action/Martial Arts","review":"Long before Crouching Tiger, Hidding Dragon became a hit, Iron Monkey was already setting the stage for flying kicks, ballet-like fight choreography, and action filming. One of the best martial arts films out in the market with a storyline tied to a legendary hero in China, Iron Monkey tells the tale of a benevolent thief known as the Iron Monkey who robs from the rich to give to the poor. He meets up with Donnie Yen's constable character, a young father traveling with his son, and teams up together to fight an evil and corrupt monk. The fight scenes are inspiring, and the stars attractive and heroic. Even though English is in subtitles, you wouldn't care since the film is captivating enough. Add this to your martial arts library for authentic martial arts and good story.Putting a Best Word Forward."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie ruined by Miramax and Tarantino","review":"This is just more proof that Quentin Tarantino is a total A-hole.

I dont own iron monkey becuase you can easily rent it from any video rental store in your area. But i have seen Iron monkey over 5 times. Now that Iron Monkey is being released in North America many are going to compare this naturally to Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon. But they are different, if you want to see a crazy wire assisted kung fu flick with less plot and more action well this is the movie for you. But if you want an epic like Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon, when fighting is secondary then you might not like this one. Also this movie goes back to the roots of Kung Fu with classic fist like the Shaolin Wonder palm, and many other Shaolin and wu shu associated fights. Donnie Yen proves in this movie that Martial Arts doesnt only have to be about Jackie Chan And Jet Li, and this might be the breakout movie for Donnie Yen who is choreagraphing the fights for Wesly Snipes in blade 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too Fast","review":"If you are to see this movie, definetely see the one in chines with the english subtitiles. The movie alone had an interesting plot, awesome weaponry, and some cool fight scenes. If you liked crouching tiger hidden dragon, you wont find too much of a difference in the fighting scenes in Iron Monkey. The movie starts out with this dude, who just jumps around like a monkey(hey, go figure) and he jumps on peoples heads, etc. Now if you dont like the unrealistic fighting, dont see this movie, i by other hand, hate just regular fighting movies, i love the jumping from wall to wall.

Just because it is a Kung Fu movie does not mean it doesn't have to have a story or decent actors.The subtitles are lacking and look as if a 12 year old wrote them(I loved the subtitle \\"steaming iron\\" for when the kid got marked) and the voice overs were actually done by 12 year olds.

Many artists have attempted, much in vain, to conquer the monstrous piece. Kissin manages not only to conquer the technical aspects of the music, but also expresses great emotion and profound demeanor that contribute to the beauty of the monumental concerto. The momentous cadenza in this piece is executed with extreme fluidity and genius. The greatest pianist alive and the greatest piece of music for piano: definately 5-star by my standards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely wonderful!

I agree Argerich is marvellous, and Horowitz amazing, but this just left me in a puddle of tears. Also found first movement unusually slow, but beautiful and I liked it, and the finale was sheer magic.

Excellent peformance and selection","review":"I heard Kissin perform the piano version of the Vocalise at a concert he gave a few years ago in Toronto. I purchased this recording just for the Vocalise, as I had sveral other piano concerto, prelude recordings. However, I found all the interpretations remarkable and his version of the concerto no. 3 is probably my favorite - and this after listening to Argerich and Ashkenazy. I can think of few CD's that offer this value. My only concern may be with the quality of the recording. I don't yeat have a Kissin version of the no.2 and the peludes but I plan to get them soon. Even the (in public any way) Sergei would have smiled!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I could say more...","review":"The liner notes speak to Kissin's preference for making live recordings. In much of his repertoire, he has achieved great success in this approach. Unfortunately, this release is hampered by a milquetoast orchestral accompaniment and truly awful recording balancing. The result is a muffled, somewhat flat performance that cannot be redeemed by Kissin's playing, which is at times revelatory. In modern sound, Martha Argerich's is still the one to beat. Older recordings that hold up quite well include Ashkenazy's 60's go round, Van Cliburn's, and, for reference, the composer's own recording with the Philadelphia Orchestra under Ormandy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good performance, but where's the excitement?!?","review":"I disagree with most of the other people who have commented on this recording. I own 4 recordings of this war-horse, and I consider this to be the worst. Sure, he plays it flawlessly and it IS technically perfect...but it lacks the emotion and excitment that can be found in recordings by Ashkenazy(1963), Argerich, and Leif Ove Andsnes(sp). In fact, I enjoy the encores more than the performance of the Rach3 on this cd. Kissin is a great pianist, but I am more convinced by his performances of Prokofiev and Chopin than I am of his Rachmaninoff. If you're looking for a good performance of this concerto, check out the Reissued/remastered performance by Ashkenazy from 1963(on the London/Decca label). It also contains a very passionate, moving performance of the Rachmaninoff 2nd concerto on it. But I think the ultimate Rach3 is definately Martha Argerich's.

The medial portion of the heel is completely hollow on the newer pair and solid on the older pair. Seems like they are reducing the quality of their boots. The newer pair wasn't waterproof either."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for cold weather","review":"It was a wonderful surprise when I received my very first online purchase.

Also, mine and my wife's roles seem to be reversed from the \\"typical\\" suggested in the book: I am the one that has to talk about things and she is the one who shuts down and avoids talking - so I wasn't sure if this book would be applicable to us. After I got about half way into it however, everything started to make sense. The idea that you need to first \\"connect\\" at emotional level using non-verbal methods (e.g. a touch or a smile) before attempting a verbal discussion, never occurred to me. This technique and others discussed in the book have made it much easier for me to focus on something other than just talking - which by itself hasn't worked."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book for everyone!","review":"This was recommended to me and I have found what it says invaluable in relationship wisdom.

Even worse, the suggestions about turning conflict around by focusing on your core values is even harder to institute.

The few points - shame vs fear is pretty much covered in the first chapter. After that? Downhill. Sorry!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too bad","review":"There are plenty of worse psychology books around (Lord knows), and this one does offer some genuine insights - in particular, the fact that if a relationship is troubled, just talking about it can only make it worse. However, the book also offers its share of stupid ideas and bad advice. For example: \\"When a woman shames a man, she's wrong even if she's right. When a man stimulates a woman's fear, he's wrong even if he's right.\\" (There's more where that came from.) The book is a mix of valid information and sheer nonsense-which is average for its type. It can be useful if your relationship needs work, but there are a lot more interesting things to waste your money on."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Light Came On","review":"I have read a lot of relationship material. When I read this book, a light came on that wasn't on before. I am referring to understanding how women and men translate communication based on their primary issues which are fear or shame - put very generally. Knowing this allowed me to take another step in my personal development because I could now stop reacting to what my partner was saying and understand more fully why she was saying it. Sounds simple, but is extremely profound."},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST READ","review":"As a professional Psychotherapist I am recommending this book to all my clients.

Beethoven captured the essence, sunny warmth and beauty of spring in this piece for piano and violin, and Neikrug and Zukerman perform it with near perfection. The Kreutzer Sonata is probably better known and is also well represented here. I commend RCA for pairing these two outstanding pieces in one volume."},{"rating":"1","title":"I gave this CD away","review":"Zuckerman and Neikrug combine for a deadening, bored performance of two wonderful pieces by Beethoven. Lifeless is another word that springs to mind. This is probably the worst of any Beethoven Violin Sonata performance I've heard. As an alternative, I'll suggest the superb disc covering the same works done by Anne-Sophie Mutter and Lambert Orkis on DG, which is highly expressive, risk-taking and downright exciting. I gave this Zukerman bore away so it wouldn't clutter up my shelves."},{"rating":"2","title":"I enjoyed this book","review":"I am a big fan of the Cloud/Townsend books and pretty much buy one sight unseen, as I did this one. While for me it is not quite at the level of How People Grow it was still very helpful.For these authors, relationships with other people are key to growth. In How People Grow the author describes feeling like it was God's \\"plan B\\" to have people help him--that God really should do it directly and he was getting 2nd best. He later came to realize that people are God's \\"plan A\\". So I don't think it is a case of \\"tell lots of people about your problem\\", but rather an acknowledgement that the Body of Christ is called that for a reason: that God uses His people as vehicles for His love.Anyway, that is just one part of this book. In general I found it very useful to have all the principles of growth broken down in this way and then have applications to specific life situations in the 2nd half of the book. These authors are very practical, which I like."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helps provide directions on your way","review":"This book is wonderful. It hits on everything from depression, fear, loneliness and all the other heartaches in between. It does a great job of hitting solid points from a professional point of view and still is Christian based. They don't blame everything away on science, but instead of human feelings and tendencies. It has taken me alittle longer to read than most, but the chapters are very informative and very helpful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful or not? Depends","review":"I can understand why the previous reviewers shared very diverse opinion of the book. The supporters focused on how well the authors made use of their professional knowledge and writting skill to discuss eight godly principles on solving twelve key areas of life's problem. The opposers primarily complained that it's too shallow and did not help at all. IMHO, this book did point to the direction of help or even salvation, which is God. Those who know God well and just need a little advice or hint will find the book useful. However, it is not the solution itself and so those who want a shortcut and without a solid faith are disappointed for sure. Nevertheless, as a believer in Christ and a book lover, I am obliged to comment that it is a relatively good book of its kind. Recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive","review":"This book skims the surface. To paraphrase...Marital problems? Seek a counselor. Alcohol or drug abuse? Find a structured program. It's repetitive ... states the same things in a different way. Example: Looking for wisdom? Read: Proverbs! In a later chapter, it mentions \\"wisdom\\" again, stating ... refer to chapter on wisdom (Chapter 3). So the reader returns to Chapter 3 and reads yet again that Proverbs is about wisdom. This book offers good advice if you like advice. Personally, I prefer reads that bring the reader into a conversation-type learning process. This is a bit preachy. Don't misunderstand. It's not all bad with the best part of this book being the title!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappoining","review":"I came to this book eagarly anticipating real help from a Christian perspective or at least a bit of comforting, but was sorely disappointed. The analysis and approach are shallow. Manifested symptoms of suffering are addressed but never the root cause. Perhaps this book can help someone with a surficial problem, but anyone looking to address the root of their human suffering will leave with no further guidance. I'm surprised the authors are successful in their counselling, perhaps there are plenty of people out there with run of the mill \\"easy\\" issues who don't need something deeper. If that's you, OK try the book, otherwise forget it."},{"rating":"1","title":"God Help Us","review":"This was only ordered at my mother's request. I think there are more appropriate ways to deal with stress in your life than to put everything in the hands of God. Consider the problems people with mental disorders deal with and then try to see how they will get any better by making no effort other than to assume some faceless deity will fix everything for them. I believe helping these people, my mother included, begins when they can understand things are not out of their control and that while they may never be \\"cured\\" they certainly have more control over their seemingly out of control lives than people like the author of this trash would have them believe. I am even more infuriated that her physician suggested this book to her.

The movie would have been better if it were longer to expand on the ideas or more focused. Most of Arthur's apprenticeship could have been cut for instance.The horror wasn't particularly scary and the humor snicker worthy at best.

I definitely didn't get what I was expecting. The low budget didn't kill it, in fact it sort of made it cool in a way (the backdrops and sets are quite interesting), the acting is what did it in. That and the story. The undead seemed absurd beyond what I'm willing to tolerate and the actors made it very aware that they were acting. As far as the story goes, there really wasn't one.

The early Olivia in concert from the early 1980s was far superior. I thought Carly Simon on the Queen Mary did her songs with more life than Olivia did hers.

Why sit down to sing several upbeat country songs? Is Olivia too old to stand up? This version of 'Your the one that I want' is pathetic. All the numbers have been slowed to walking (sleeping) pace and 'Let's Get Physical' is anything but.

No, the acting's not good, and the effects are unspectacular by today's standards, but there was an attempt here to craft something of value from modest materials. Underlying a pretty standard plot are suggestions about the opposites that pull at our protagonist: night vs. day, the brunette good girl vs. the blond singer, and drunkeness vs. sobriety. Is the sun a harsh moral judgement of some kind? That may be a stretch, but what symbolism there is suggests a level of thoughtfulness and a seriousness of intent uncommon to many of these films.

But they did not detract from the overall story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad","review":"There are so many typos! I at first did not correct the typos, then started to correct them then got so frustrated because there were so many I gave up. I also did not like how the author kept going on and on about a certain subject or what a person was saying. It did not keep my interest, in fact put me to sleep. I could not get into the characters. I think it was a very poor written book. The typos and grammar need to be corrected. This is a book, there should not be so many typos.

Whether you are looking for tips on rigging or how to find and care for a guide, you will find a wealth of information in this compact book. I particularly enjoyed the first person stories of real adventures one can often experience while exploring new areas in search of fish. But then, Paul also makes it clear that the reason people fish isn't always the fish they catch, but the places they get to explore and things they get to enjoy on the way.A good read whether looking for specific info, or just enjoy fishing stories.

That model mounted flat on my kitchen wall. Unfortunately it has been discontinued, so I bought the B&D Gizmo opener as an approximate replacement. When I received it, I discovered that it requires an under-cabinet mounting location, but I don't have one available. This important fact was omitted from all of the several descriptions of the product that I had read at various websites. So my new opener is sitting on - and wasting - my precious counter space. With a modest amount of effort B&D could easily have made the base unit mountable either on the wall or under a cabinet, but they didn't.

The \\"philosophy made easy\\" books are too simplistic, but the original writings are very difficult. It's tempting to dismiss it all, particularly as philosophers are still trying to resolve problems raised by the ancient Greeks.But this book is different. Magee debates the ideas of various legends with modern day experts. After the debate the experts were allowed to revise their replies to ensure intellectual rigour.The result is fascinating. The structure forces the philosophers to express their ideas in plain English, and for the first time I understand the importance of many ideas which had rather passed me by.I am now determined to try some philosophy in its original texts. If only all philosophers could be subjected to Magee's plain English test."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ideal introduction to philosophy","review":"The book consists of interviews with noteworthy philosophers.

He used some old established methods ofmeditation, physical conditioning, and reflecting on his situation.Some of the philosophical quotes are helpful for getting through life in general. His use of auto-suggestion or self hyponosis is also a method I used most of my life starting at about 8 years of age.

I am not attracted to books about Vietnam, but after this book was recommended to me by a friend who served there in the military and later as a civilian contractor, I couldn't put it down. The book was finished in two days! For an eighteen year old, who was barely out of high school, to survive this type of experience without any prior military training makes the story almost incredible. He even confronted his case of post-traumatic stress received while earlier living in Saigon during the war. There's a movie here. I'm going to get more for friends and children of friends returning from Iraq."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bamboo Chest","review":"I can't help but wonder if Amazon has a problem with authors, publishers or friends writing glowing reviews to promote a product. Otherwise I can not imagine what prompted the multiple raves for The Bamboo Chest. The writer seems juvenile and incapable of the adventures he describes, and I was unable to know his characters beyond appearances and conversations. I gave up at 100 pages, still uncertain regarding the origin of the much referred to post traumatic stress syndrome. Living in Vietnam during the war? Or was it the tragedy that struck on the river boat? Adding insult to injury: Neither author or editor know correct language (English)usage, as evidenced by the frequent use of \\"lay\\" for \\"lie\\" as in \\"I lay on the bed.\\" Verydisappointing, especially since I will soon visit Vietnam for a month and am eager for background."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful read!","review":"Wonderful read!

Graham shows a great depth of understanding of himself and his environment, and the history of Vietnam. A very personal experience described wonderfully. I was skeptical of it being labelled as a \\"history/adventure/self-help\\" on the back of the book, but was completely won over and can see how \\"The Bamboo Chest\\" covers them all.The PTSD is perfectly written about, both the personal experience and what to do. I have a dear friend soon returning from Iraq and will be sure to buy this book for him and his wife. He'll enjoy the treasure hunt, and ambush in Laos (poignant!), and his wife will be better prepared for symptoms that might occur in the future.I work in health care and will get copies for my co-workers.

Originally presented in 70mm Super Cinerama as a roadshow, this transfer begs the question - what happened to the 6-track stereophonic soundtrack? And, where are the overture and intermission? The picture is from 65mm negative/70mm print and is fairly sharp and clear, as befits the enlarged negative, but without the stereo sound, it becomes a hollow-sounding Western wannabe spectacular. Snaps to MGM/UA for actually releasing the full 141 minute version at all, but why not include all the accoutrements of the original presentation? The film was created for huge screens, and needs the support of the full-bodied original soundtracks to do the visuals justice.

The story revolves around Jane Ward beginning as a school girl in Chicago and her early encounter with love and the objections of her parents who will not allow it. She never forgets Andre, her first love, as she eventually settles for a tidy but unexciting marriage to Steven. She just excapes what will surely be a disaster when she comes to her senses about Jimmy, the free spirited drifter husband of Agnes, her long-time friend and former roommate at Bryn Mawr. Jane witnesses life going on around her as she matures into a middle-aged lady but she always feels unable to influence events as her own children take on lives of their own. \\"I don't act at all...I just drift.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Lloyd Webber instrumentally straight up...","review":"The LSO under the direction of British conductor Anthony Inglis gives us a symphonic tour de force of Andrew Lloyd Webbers most popular theatrical scores. Inglis takes the more serious less gimmicky approach, conducting arrangements more in the vain of 20th Century Romanticism.(akin to Richard Strauss) There is little exaggerated if any electronic instruments involved adding to the pure instrumental experience. Phantom and JC Superstar are the headliners, everything else I would consider just filler, though a short suite from \\"Cats\\" is nicely fleshed out considering it's a one hit(Memory)wonder.

This film is propaganda; it is as simple as that. Regardless of what you feel on this subject, it is doubtful that this film will do more than pander to already biased views. Please excuse my arrogance (or don't, I care not) but as a biochemist, I find the moral high ground many folks take on this matter to be laughable at best.

Was a little tough to take of links but finally got what I needed off. Of course I got finger prints on the lens so I cleaned it with my shirt, I always do this with all my other watches and they look the same as the day I bought them. I then notices hundreds of tiny scratches, thought maybe I did not clean it good enough so got wipes and tried cleaning again.

The pins that hold the band on are really cheap and they broke within a few weeks. There is a little metal piece that goes between the watch face and the band. I lost this and spent a long time trying to find it in the grass. Another thing is that the pin for the band was an irregular size and I had a hard time finding a replacement. I finally had to just put the face in my pocket with no band as the entire thing had fallen apart. Now the watch face is all black and changing the battery doesn't help either.

I like the way the digital has been implemented with the analog. It looks nice enough to wear to my corporate job without it looking cheap. The luminous hands are pretty useless after about an hour or two, but the backlight works fine. I wish it would stay on a half second longer or so.I can't say that the 2 little circles serve much of a useful purpose, but style-wise it gives the watch a unique look. The stopwatch and countdown timer are useful, and I like the way you can display the 2nd timezone on the digital face. The thermometer piece is a little gimmicky. It's hard to get it calibrated right, compensating for your body temperature.All-in-all though, I like the watch and it's a nice Casio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"The watch looks better in the pictures.

I don't think you can find a more elementary introduction to the difficult, but extraordinarily powerful and elegant theory of partitions. The book covers the basics of number theory well, but it is the chapters on partitions that make this text stand out. It covers the Rogers-Ramanujan identities as well as the Jacobi triple product identity. It is rare in the mathematical community that an expert in a subject also writes a ground-level introductory text - but that's what you have here.

First, it doesn't cover 7.0 in any depth. 7.0 is shut away in an appendix in the back of the book. The rest of the book focuses on mostly 4.2 code, with some 6.5 coverage. So, right off the bat, it's out of date. Second, there's little continuity in this work. It's all over the place topic-wise. It's like the authors dug up all the neato code they'd written over the years and wrote a book about it, with no thought to actually covering the subject at hand systematically or logically. Lastly, the book is uneven. I suppose this is due to multiple authors, but it's just a guess. Whatever the case, the book jumps from being overly formal to converational on a regular basis.

None of the example code is for version 7.0 of MS SQL. Some of it won't even work on 7.0. My second problem is that many of the examples fail to tell you whether they're for Microsoft or Sybase. You end up trying code on Microsoft that will never work because it uses Sybase-specific syntax. My last problem is that the book is disjointed. I don't know if its the multiple authors or what, but the topics are all over the place. One minute they're at 30,000 feet, the next minute they're strafing the football field.

A book like this should *only* recommend ANSI outer joins -- old-style outer joins can return incorrect results. Third, the book is deceiving.

The organization of this book is very difficult to follow.Also, the code samples are obviously targeted at releases of SQL prior to 7.0. Old-style outer joins are used throughout the book -- a real no-no these days.Worse yet, the book isn't written very well. The prose is as uneven as it is obtuse.

First, the lack of SQL Server 7.0 coverage is inexcusable. Based on when the book came out, it should have *focused* on 7.0, not 4.2. Second, many of the queries do not work on 7.0. For example, there's one that queries the sysprocedures table. Sysprocedures no longer exists in 7.0 -- the query will neither compile nor run. There are several examples that rely on the implicit ordering of the GROUP BY and UNION commands. Again, that is gone in 7.0. Also, old style joins are used throughout, despite thae fact that they've been deprecated by Microsoft for years now. Worse yet, none of the new 7.0 syntax is covered at all.

Although the book is bit outdated (only goes up to Sybase 11.5), it does have a number of good examples. The book does a nice job of telling you what T-SQL statements apply to MS-SQL and Sybase-SQL.

Moreover, many of the techniques shown are archaic and have been deprecated by Microsoft, even for SQL 6.5. For example, joins are often show using the old join syntax. I wouldn't have such a problem with this if this book didn't advertise itself as a SQL 7.0 book. It's definitely not a 7.0 book and if you buy it expecting that, you'll be disappointed. Another problem with the book is its failure to adequately distinguish between Sybase and Microsoft syntax. There are some important differences, as the products have diverged more with each new release. Some of the examples show code that works on Sybase, but not on Microsoft (or vice versa), without telling the reader. The book would have been better off focusing on one or the other."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent book, but way out of date","review":"I remember SQL Server 4.2 and 6.5 well enough to know that this was a good book in its time. Problem is, 7.0 has been out for over a year and SQL 2000 is on the horizon. This book is woefully out of date. It queries system tables (in the first place, you shouldn't do that unless absolutely necessary) that don't even exist anymore (e.g., sysprocedures). It uses old-style joins throughout, despite the fact that they've been deprecated by Microsoft, Soukup&Delaney, Henderson, and many others.

I don't think so, and I don't think you will either. If you're like me, you'd come to this book expecting full coverage of the latest version of the language. Unfortunately, you won't get it -- it's not to be found between these covers. There's way too much time spent on the essoteric, and not nearly enough spent on the current version of the technology. First, they shouldn't be using old-style joins, particularly outer joins, because these can yield incorrect results. Second, they shouldn't be querying system tables directly when INFORMATION_SCHEMA views or system stored procedures will return the same info. Third, they shouldn't be delving into things like runnin bcp.exe from Transact-SQL in order to import data into the server - what a Rube Goldberg idea, especially when we have the BULK INSERT command built right into the language.

Against some of the more recent SQL Server-oriented books, it looks like it needs about a pound of wrinkle cream.A lot of things changed with 7.0 and this book hasn't kept up with those changes. Much of the sample code doesn't work with 7.0. I sense that the book was written while 7.0 was still in beta, because it's obviously targeted at 6.5. Many of the statements regarding server internals are simply no longer accurate and many of the coding techniques were outmoded even for 6.5. I'm still looking for the ultimate modern T-SQL guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sloppily thrown together and out-dated","review":"I didn't like this book. I was looking for the be-all, end-all tome on T-SQL and was sorely disappointed. There's no consistently in syntax (e.g., old vs. new join syntax), nor in coding techniques. These guy may know T-SQL, but they don't seem to be seasoned coders."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent book, but misses the mark in many respects","review":"This book was OK, but I was expecting much more, given that it was part of the Nutshell series. It doesn't cover modern T-SQL techniques very well and is poorly organized. Stuff you'd expect to be covered upfront is saved for an Appendix and stuff in the latter half of the book probably should be covered earlier. All in all, I didn't learn much from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A collection of old code snippets","review":"What this book is is a collection of old scripts. That's why, I think, most of the book targets old versions of SQL Server. Some of the code works on Sybase, some works on Microsoft, but frequently the authors don't tell you which. Moreover, much of the code doesn't work on SQL Server 7.0 and later, yet the authors fail to mention this. Version 7.0 is covered near the end of the book in an appendix. For learning modern Transact-SQL, this book is a real loser."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good resource for T-SQL information","review":"I purchased my copy back in 1999 and it is one of my favorite SQL books. I find the information very accurate and relevant to the MS SQL versions (6.5 & 7.0) printed on the cover of the book. I think it was the best SQL book for many years. Since 1999, many books for newer versions of database servers have been published.For some reason, many people who wrote bad reviews about this book were looking for MS SQL 2000 information -the cover states the versions covered in the book.There are many newer books that cover MS SQL 2000. One of my favorites is SQL Server 2000 Programming from Robert Vieira."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terribly out-dated","review":"The problem with this book is that it only covers version 6.5 and earlier in any detail. Sorry, the cover out to mention that. A single appendix does not constitute SQL 7 coverage. Worse yet, many of the techniques you take to solving complex query problems changed dramatically from 6.5 to 7.0, so a number of the solutions offered in the book either don't work at all or work very poorly. Giving when it was published, there's no excuse for this book not covering 7.0 and its way of doing things in detail. For the would-be SQL 7 transact-sql practitioner, this book is very near useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated and sloppily thrown together","review":"I didn't get much use from this book for the following reasons:+The code is quite dated. It looks like old Sybase code for the most part.+The distinction between Sybase code and Microsoft code is often blurred, making it impossible to tell which code runs on which platform.+The text is generally hard to read and disorganized. I don't think the narrative flows logically.FWIW, a far better T-SQL book is Henderson's The Guru's Guide to Transact-SQL. First and foremost, it's a great coder's book, something Klein and company could really learn from."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obsolete, out-of-date, out-moded, and outright bad","review":"I picked up this one thinking I could learn about SQL Server 2000. This book doesn't even cover SQL Server 7.0, let alone 2000. The code examples are all geared toward 4.2 and 6.5.Also, they use techniques that were deprecated even in 6.5 days. For example, old-style outer joins are all over the place.Many of the examples no longer work because so many things have changed in SQL Server since 6.5. Some don't work because they never did -- even on 4.2/6.5.Last, the depth of coverage is really erratic. One minute they're giving you the command line options for the bcp utility (what does this have to do with Transact-SQL?), the next minute they're glossing over something really important.A real loser of a book in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want an obsolete, poorly written book, buy this","review":"I was really disappointed in this book. For one thing, there's next to no SS 7.0 coverage. For another, what 7.0 coverage there is stuck away in an appendix. Who's idea was this? Another problem is that several of the queries don't work or they use old-style techniques that are now discouraged by MS. I plan to return this one to get my money back. What a waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you are a developer, this will improve your code","review":"I develop databases professionally for e-commerce websites. I use this book all the time as a reference. I learned quite a bit from the book the first time I read it, even though I had several other references. I particularly appreciated the chapter on optimizing databases for performance. My databases and stored procedures are faster because of it, and I code them faster too. You'll be satisfied with this book if you buy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not cover recent versions of the product","review":"If you want a book that focuses on Transact-SQL as it existed in Sybase/MS SQL Server 4.2, get this book. Otherwise, skip it. The techniques shown herein are obsolete and arcane. Many of the example queries no longer work on SQL Server 7.0 or 2000. Also, many of the coding practices are ill-advised. Save your money and get a more up-to-date book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mi Destino is this novella","review":"I've never been fond of novellas. Quite frankly, I thought they were dumb, cheesy, and overly melodramatic. Then i spotted this DVD in a store and I decided I thought I'd give a novella a chance. I'm glad I did. Mi Destino Eres Tu is simply amazing! I was hooked on every minute of it. Especially after the early death in the novella. While the entire series was heavily edited, it doesn't seem so until the 2nd disc. Instead tHe first disc is an edge of your seat experience and the characters are great. Lucero was great as Andrea and quite frankl;y I wish I could've seen the novella in its entirety. I wouldn't mind shelling the bucks for it too. (come on telivisa, release them complete!). THe theme song is superb and made me fall in love with the novella even before I began watching it. There are suprisingly a decent amount of special features. Overall it was a great buy and I'm truly glad to add this DVD set to my collection as one of my favorites!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful love story but no as goos as Apuesta por un amor","review":"Beautiful love story but no as goos as Apuesta por un amor.But still a very beautiful story. If you like telenovelas this is a great one. Should also try Apuesta Por Un Amor, Fuego en la sangre, Pasion de Gavilanes, And Amor Real. Great stories and English subtitled. For those of us who speak little spanish.Las grandes historias e inglés subtitularon. Para los de nosotros que hablan poco español."},{"rating":"1","title":"MIssing one DVD","review":"One DVD was missing. There is nothing worse than to miss out a part of a movie or novela.
