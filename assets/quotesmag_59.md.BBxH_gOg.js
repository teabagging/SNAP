They did not even to bother to create a really cool space battle intro or anything. Besides being bug-filled and difficult to control, the missions are not good. Plus, you can not save unless you complete all the segments of a mission....what a joke. I think it is about time that these companies talk to us trekies (trekers) to see what we want in a game. The graphics are nice to look at but that is the solo redeeming quality (Thanks to a nice 512MG PCI-e card).The concept of the game was nice, but was poorly developed from there.

It is worthless coding like this that makes the PC gaming industry suffer- not the gamers.The key thing to remember is since the gaming industry is only interested in making a quick buck that gamers must be patient on purchasing and read reviews and not patronizes games that are released for the sole purpose of profit (the big Christmas push). There are many great games out there to play and with new mention of expansions too, like Oblivion, Titan Quest, NWN2 (small bugging), Total War: Medieval II and for space Star Fleet Command III, Independence War 2: Edge of Chaos and even MS MechWarrior was great in comparison.I am so tired of wasting money on games that do not perform as promised.

The team and management developing this game have handed off another dissapointment to the startrek community."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Coding, bad design, poor marketing","review":"I was really looking forward to this game, but was very disappointed with it. First, it lagged badly, even in the opening and welcome screens. It would take me 2 minutes just to select campaign. Now, after a graphics driver update, the program doesn't run at all. Apparently, they don't support the ATI X300 or any other graphics card over 1 year old, which is pathetic. I wouldn't mind some lag now and then, knowing my computer isn't a graphics powerhouse, but not running at all is very irritating. In gameplay, the controls are awful. I assumed this was a PC game ported to XBox, when it's the other way around, so they don't take very good advantage of the keyboard. Also, their website claimed you could customize the ship, like in SFC3, but that was also a false claim."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but could be much better","review":"Pros-Good voice acting-Nice variety of missions-Huge amount of ships to pilotCons-Only 4 races: Federation, Klingon, Romulan, & Borg.

The game, despite its shortcomings, was enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another pretty face","review":"Having risked my wife's wrath (she can make Kahn look like a campfire girl)in this one, I was sevely dissapointed. While the graphics look good, that is all that is good about this game. The controls are klunky, manuvering is a joke, weapons control and effectiveness are nothing like previous games or the shows, and if you move your mouse during the game be prepared for a bout of space sickness beacause you go around and around the ship, because you have no real control over the camera.

He found one blog that the player actually threw it into the street and let a car run over it. Again, not happy. Shame on the company for doing a quick knock-off just to meet a release schedule.

Lanegan was influential on the band Queens of The Stone Age. As a solo artist, he has done work inspired by Tom Waits and Nick Cave. You might expect something like The Valentine Six or Firewater. Early on Lanegan is much like that. But once he gets to songs like \\"Methamphetamine Blues\\" and \\"One Hundred Days\\" he shows his own style and true colors. Members of The Queens, Greg Dulli, and PJ Harvey show up on this record. They are mostly in the background. This record really gets better with every listen. \\"Death Valley Blues\\" is really wonderful. It's good to see a real originator do quality work."},{"rating":"2","title":"i love ellensburg.","review":"great album.consistent all the way through. diverse yet free flowing, and great arrangement of songs and use of guest artists(esp. cris goss and pj harvey). don't forget preceeding e.p. \\"here comes that weird chill\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully Intense","review":"One of the most inventive, with the twist on a sonic inventory, recent rock album. Tom Waits is cited in many of the reviews, but this does not, to these ears, sound like a Wait's album, granted the similar vocal reach.

EVERY SONG is good. The whole album doesn't sound the same either,like in some previous albums,and the music is more sincere.He truely puts down what he feels.Theres an array of emotions to say the least. Every song is completly diverse from the one before it. Some have powerfully driven rythms, with screaming guitars . And the next song will have slow, consentrated,straight out beautiful music with perfectly synchronized vocals and heart-felt lyrics. The visions Lanegan can make you see with his words are truely amazing.There's no way to describe an album like this. You've got to heard it and review it for yourself. The more you listen to it the the better it gets. It's that good. Star tracks include Morning Glory Wine, Head, Hit the city and Strange Religion ."},{"rating":"1","title":"May be great for someone else.","review":"Like the other solo records, I tried and tried to get through it with something that really grabbed me.

I ignored the Screaming Trees as this was one of maybe 2 or 3 songs (out of hundreds) of his I don't enjoy. It took another decade to hear this and subsequently buy everything in his catalogue. If you're frequently broke as I am, go straightedge for a few days until you save $100 or so and buy everything of his. It's all gold. At least buy this, field songs and whiskey for the holy ghost. So worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unless you can't live without his voice, I'd live without this album.","review":"So I was catching up on what Greg Dulli's been up to, (his recent Twilight Singers effort \\"Powder Burns\\" is just great). Well Lanegan as many of you probably know appears quite a bit with Greg and in fact offers a nice contribution with his low gravelly voice providing a nice contrast to Dulli's vocals. As an old Screaming Trees loyalist, it was a natural jump to take a gander at Lanegan's solo projects.I listened to Bubblegum plenty of times, and while the good contributions he makes to the work of others are present in Bubblegum, there are gaping holes as well, namely the songwriting. The lyrics are fine, the production is fine, but the music is boring, weak, and completely forgettable. Thankfully forgettable. I couldn't find a single track to move me. Unless you can't live without his voice, I'd recommend living without this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent product","review":"Excellent product, excellent service and excellent value.

The author said the writer should pay close attention to the response of the readers. In writing this book, the author was not doing that.Mostly maybe half of the book was filled with quotes from other books or articles. The quotess were jotted down out of their contexts. Not only was it hard to understand this way, I felt it was intruding and intimadting.

If the most important trait to have as an artist is to \\"see\\" like an artist, then this gives you insight into what one of America's greatest saw.Anybody who has picked up my copy of the book has been fascinated, even if they aren't painters themselves. The only reason I gave this 4 stars instead of 5, was the analysis of some of Hopper's subjects. It seemed, after reading what the author wrote about the paintings, that she spent too much time in academia and not enough time painting. She attributes more complex motives to some of Hopper's compositions than he intended, I think. For instance, I suspect that the only reason he painted the dead tree in front of Libby House was that he found it artistically interesting. I don't think he was trying to show \\"past decay\\" against the present, but who knows?In the end, I highly recommend this book for anyone who loves Hopper or the realist style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Early Church Life or Tertullian's Life Experience?","review":"I did not enjoy this book entirely. I was struck while reading it that Tertullian and Luther were weighted down by excessive guilt. While Luther's manifested itself in other ways, I had the sense that Tertullian advocated and developed certain theologies based on mistakes he had as a young man - almost as if by taking some more extreme positions he could make amends for his mistakes. This is not a long read, but is not something that I would say is a great starting point for those looking to learn more about the Apostolic Fathers. I would also suggest that some of the positions Tertullian ended up taking (vestil virgins) are indicative of other problems in his theology as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Only a Few Bones\\" tells it all","review":"There are so many levels to John Colletta's \\"Only a Few Bones.\\"It can be read solely as a \\"Whodunit,\\" and will keep the reader guessing with each new theory put forth.

The book points out Arliss's dedication (he insisted on two weeks's reheasal before shooting, even if he had to pay the Cast himself), sterling character (never a hint of scandal, no marital infidelity, etc), and modesty (he had full charge of all films and often wrote or rewrote screenplays, but insisted on being billed solely as an actor).

I chose to purchase a new LCD from another manufacturer and skip the Sharp brand.From the looks of other reviewers, my TV might be the exception to quality, but that exception has cost me a lot of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noise maker","review":"One month in the wall and sounds like a expresso machine.

You couldn't tell it was broken until we tried to get it to cry and move it's arms and legs and none of the arms and legs would move. My husband took the outfit off and discovered that the one leg was completely snapped off. It wasn't worth sending it back so we decided to keep it anyway since the leg was attached as long as the clothes were kept on. Unfortunately just hours later the arm broke as well from regular use, it wasn't used roughly at all. Now it just laughs and cries which is cute, but the arms and legs only move on one side of the body.

It consistently veers off-topic and stays there for lengthy amounts of time. There are sections about the city of Bath, England, and information about Roman laxatives, but little about the story of Troy itself. Towards the beginning, there are series of pictures without any narration, and, in general, the whole thing is a muddle. It leaves out more than it includes, and never mentions Dido, Virgil, or modern archeological deductions about Hisarlik. It does tell a lot about the ancient Greeks--including an entire section on the Parthenon--and assumes that Trojans were Greek."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating & informative documentary about Troy!","review":"I thought this documentary was very informative and interesting, telling more about the story, myth, and characters involved in the story of Troy. It talks about Greek gods and mythology, and how the legend of Troy stems from Homer's story; the music was nice, sometimes dramatic, sometimes soothing. I like the voiceover: he sounded like \\"lifestyles of the rich & famous\\"!There were these clay masks interspersed to, I guess, define the characters, and I couldn't help but chuckle a bit. The shots of buildings and architecture, nature and drawings, etc. were very nice: I especially like seeing maps of where Troy was thought to be, etc. I found this DVD to be a good resource to find out more about the real history and story of Troy, in preparation for the film with Brad Pitt!Definately recommended if you are interested in the history of Troy, or if you ever watch the History or Discovery Channel!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad on so many levels","review":"This is just a bad DVD. Very little time and money went into it.The announcer sounds like he has a speach impediment. Some of theinformation given is wrong and much of it out of date. They spend10 minutes or more talking about British poets, that as far as Ican see have nothing to do with Troy. And they show the same images over and over and over (not really good images either).Avoid this clunker. Google Troy if you are interested in history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Links-KEEP THEM IN STOCK, PLEASE","review":"As a vegetarian, I have enjoyed Worthington's Super Links for years.

One day, I tried a search on Amazon, found them listed and before I could order, they were out of stock, much to my disappointment. However, Amazon was wonderful as they sent me an email to let me know they were back in stock, at which time I ordered a case. THANKS, Amazon!!!As for the product, we enjoy them broiled or grilled. They are simply the best tasting hot dog substitute on the market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super-Links are terrific","review":"Super Links are terrific vegetarian weiners. Their flavor is a little like Morning Star Farms Breakfast links - but more weiner-ish. Their texture is firm and their size is plump like Big Franks. Veja Links are good, but Super Links taste much better than Veja Links. However, Big Franks have a savory flavor unlike real weiners that I like even better than Super Links.

Namely, when we first bought it, the drawers literally started falling apart. The \\"wood\\" came apart and the drawers are continually coming out of alignment. The hardware that was used for the tracks that the drawers rest on is complete garbage. They bend easily.. and we're not talking about heavy stuff we're storing. This is light baby clothing for Pete's sakes. The European \\"turn screw bolts\\" that hold the corners of the drawer are continually coming loose and falling out, very frustrating. My husband finally resorted to gluing the drawers. I wouldn't recommend this at all. For the money, there has to be something out there that is constructed better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique and Delicious","review":"Finally - a vegetarian cookbook that is not full of the same darn stuff. Most of the veggie cookbooks I find seem to be the same, different variations of the same old stuff, definitely lacking in variety....they're full of tasty food, but they're all the same nonetheless.If you want some different foods on your plate - THIS book is AMAZING....awesome food, great variety of tastes and ingredients, some recipes are more complicated, some not so much. Its one of the best veggie cookbooks I've run across in a long time (and I'm always looking).One drawback though - the author IS way off on the volumes/relative proportions of ingredients in some of the recipes. So, use your best judgement, and alter it to work for your family/taste. I usually use recipes as a base anyway, and don't follow them to the T, so that issue doesn't bother me too much.Overall, a great cookbook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste your $$$!!!","review":"I've tried about 5 recipes from this book and all of them were dismal failures.

I am not afraid of the tee box any more","review":"I am new to the sport within the last year. I bought a used set of clubs off of Craigslist until I figured out what kind of player I was going to be. That set included an older Mizuno T-zoid Titanium driver. Every once in a while I could hit that driver between 190 and 200. Most of the time it was slice, slice, slice! The sweet spot on it was just a bit larger than a nickel. I got this driver based on a good friend's recommendation. \\"Such a great story to have the first movable weight driver\\" I thought. I immediately set the weights to correct my constant slice. Within my second bucket of balls I am ripping 85% of my drives right down the middle and FAR! I am hitting 240+ , and the sound is awesome.

The Continental Portuguese, in no way, are constantly trying to grasp onto any \\"Anglo\\" identity (USA is not the only country containing people of Portuguese descent!). It might be possible that he has met Continental-Portuguese-Americans who appear to do this; unfortunately many people have been misguided about their heritage in order to fit into their new adoptive country. To make an example, there are many Americans who claim an Irish heritage, and can pin point a vast amount of detail, when infact they descend from Italy - it is hard to accept something new when you have been taught the opposite from birth.Instead of explaining my views on this subject, I will rather say that Camoes and Edward Van Dun (two other reviewers on this page) express a very accurate point on this subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"More misconceptions.","review":"I\`m a 5th generation full blooded Portuguese of Azorean desent.

Once you mix a race with a different one that person becomes a mullato. This goes for ANY ethnic group. The Cape Verdeans have mostly black blood and are categorized as NEGRO,many Brazilians have mixed with the indigenous people of that country and are HISPANIC.

I don't know if this book is reflective of the general work that Brady Games does with their game guides, but it does a terrible job.I like having a game guide when I play sports games to look up player stats, make a substitution, etc. -- it beats having to go through several screens in real time when you're not familiar with the team.Problem is that all the STATS in the NBA2K guide book ARE blatantly INCORRECT. Many players have percentage statistics over 100%, that don't match up to the other numbers, free throws made higher than the number of attempts, etc. We're not talking about a couple of typos/errors (which should be unacceptable for what I paid for this book). We're talking whole scale errors.I did write a letter to Brady Games to bring these inaccuracies to their attention (several months ago). They never responded to my letter."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous long term strategy...","review":"The authors here claim success by taking mostly under 25 year olds and getting them to complete a marathon. I do believe this book will likely give you what you need to complete a marathon, but looking at the bigger picture it will likely not add to your long term health. Injury is so rampant in the running industry, and this book does not contain what most experts currently recommend. Especially with regards to running technique. This book recommends heal strike running, which is dangerous advice for most of the population. Read maffetone, chi running, pose method, natural running. I would say the 16 week 10% per week increase is the most valuable chart / page in the book, and if you are the type of person to think you can't finish a marathon, then it might contain some motivational reading chapters. I actually enjoyed the book but taking technique recommendations with a grain of salt."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sensible and well informed guide that will get you there !","review":"I really enjoyed training with this book, and thoroughly enjoyed running my first marathon - and I think that that combination is very much what this book is all about.I've had some training in coaching methods and this book includes all of the right straightforward advice and perspectives that you'll need to tackle this amazing challenge. There's advice on sports psychology, avoiding injuries, staying hydrated and well fed, and how to cope with 'the wall'.

This book makes me believe I really CAN train and run (and FINISH) a marathon. Not everyone will appreciate the fact that you aren't training for speed, but that's fine with me. I just want to run it (maybe walk here and there) and finish. Maybe after finishin a couple I'll want to train for speed, but for now, the writers of this book are speaking right to me.

The authors say that a heel strike is okay but forefoot striking should be avoided. Actually it's just the opposite. A heel strike puts enormous pressure on your knees and has the effect of putting on the brakes with each step.I'm Exihibit A. I was a heel striker. My knees started bothering me so much (all of the time) I thought I was going to have to give up running. But I tried barefoot running on a beach, switched to a minimalist shoe and, most importantly, changed to a forefoot strike - and my constant knee pain immediately disappeared.I was astounded (and felt like I was reading a very dated book) when I saw the authors advocating such a poor striding form."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great training partner . . .","review":"This is a great book!

I'm not sure what made me decide to do a marathon, but I did and I am sure glad I found this book. The stories in this book were very motivational. I followed the program in the book exactly. I did have a few minor set backs though. I developed heel pain, which turned out to be from ill-fitting shoes. I bought a good pair of running shoes and was fitted for specialty inserts for them. My heel pain resolved and I was back on track. I ran my marathon and finished in just over 5 hours. But the key word is \\"finished\\". It's not about the time.

Great book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Concealing A Terminal Disease","review":"I applaud and respect, Ms.Brookshire. I believe from reading her testimony, that she is a woman of God, and was highly favored during this ordeal. In this book, I learned what that phrase \\"NO WEAPON FORMED AGAINST ME SHALL PROSPER.I can't believe her then Mother-In-Law, knew of her son's medical status, and did not warn this woman, this makes the mother, her son accomplice.No wonder why they both got what they deserved.This woman is a real \\"Trooper\\". God bless you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Informative","review":"This book was very informative. It opens up your eyes to deception. Also, that we must seek God when looking for a spouse. Only He alone knows the intention and motives of people. We only know by what we see and what the person allows us to know. Pray, Pray, Pray. The scripture says, in all thy ways acknowledge Him and He shall direct your path. When we surrendered our lives to God, it meant every area including our personal lives. Let Him choose for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"With God, ALL things are possible ...","review":"Wow! I am blessed to have read Ms. Brookshire's memoir. There but for the grace of God, go I. It's only because I'm covered by the blood of Jesus that I didn't find myself in a similar situation. He protected me even when I didn't know I needed His protection. Thank you, Ms. B., for sharing your story. You are truly an inspiration and proof that all things work together for the good of them who love the Lord and are called according to His purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for All WOMAN (young &old)","review":"I ordered this books and once I started reading I really could not put it down. I have called all my girlfriends to tell them this is a must have. After reading this book your faith will never be the same. It also has many great health ideas. This was a great book. I also recommend it for teenage girls before they decide to start having sex."},{"rating":"2","title":"Riveting","review":"This book was brutally honest and forthright. It's as though LaJoyce Brookshire unzipped herself, opened up her thoughts and life, and then dumped out all the pain, anguish and private details of her life as a wife. The sacrifices she'd made for her husband for all to see. . . Riveting! She was preserved by our loving God. Her strength, courage and faith shows us just how enduring, loving and merciful He is toward us, especially when we are in dire situations. Yes, LaJoyce's life is an inspiring testimony. Despite her husband's lies, coverups, evil attempts and cruelty, God had her back! As to her words, \\"I'm God's Girl for real\\" (pg. 91.) Thanks for sharing your testimony, for it is a beacon of light in this ever darkening world. (Thanks to my eldest sister for gifting this book to me)"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Every Woman Must Read This Book\\"","review":"Every woman must read this book, young and old. I've shared this book with many of my girlfriends and family members. What an incredible story of faith and trust in God. I was personally touched by Dr. Brookshire's story. And I know that there are many others that will be touched as well. She is truly \\"God's Girl\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"True Faith","review":"This is truly a story of faith. Only god could have gotten the author through this test. I read the book in 2 days and just could not put it down. The strength and courage in the mist of betrayal reveals that women always find a way to put others before themselves. This is a story of love for god and knowing that doing the right thing will always prevail in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal!!!","review":"A story of fortitude mixed with faith! This book contains issues of relationships, faith, love, career, finances, wellness, sickness, life and death. This is a must read for all women who do too much! This book causes one to look at their life with open eyes. The message about taking control of one's health, spiritually and physically, is apparent. The other messages are weaved in to give a panoramic view of this writer's life. She overcame obstacles and was able to rise above it all. Despite her daily challenges, she was able to empower others and get the job done with faith! I could not put the book down! She is truly \\"God's Girl.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Faith Under Fire","review":"This book was awesome. I read the book in a day in a half. This book was passed to me from my Aunt. I learned a lot from ready this book. Just to wait and listen closely to what Jesus has to say. Don't jump into relationships without seeking Gods face first. From this day forward my life will never be the same. I will continue to be more observant of that gut feeling that we get, they are not always butterflies but Jesus trying to tell us something. LaJoyce Thank You So much for sharing your life with all of your readers. This is definitely what God ordained you to do. I was always taught that God allows us to go through things so that we can help others that may face similar situations and so that we can have a testimony to share with others.Be Blessed and Highly Favored"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Get This!!!!!","review":"The Santa Cruz From Turtle Beach Systems Uses The Same Crystal 4620 chipset But, has many more features and much better sound than this no good sound card.

The thick handle makes digging comfortable and the size and shape of the bowl are ideal for my Rio Reds from the yard. The serrated edge does not feel sharp to the touch or lip, but really helps.

Since I do have a Twin Cuisine paring knife and have been quite happy with it, I gave this spoon a try. It's by far one of the best looking grapefruit knives around. The handle is great for gripping, and the spoon is shaped perfectly for carving out grapefruit and scooping up the juices. I have not had trouble with grapefruit juice squirting at me. Careful with the ridges on the side of the spoon. They test the limits of lip-friendliness."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product","review":"I probably paid too much but the quality of this Henckel spoon will mean that it lasts a lifetime.

Henckels Twin Cuisine Grapefruit Spoon","review":"I purchased this grapefruit spoon because of Henckels reputation for quality knives that fit the hand so well. Although I have very large hands I found this spoon to be very awkward to use.The handle is just way too thick. It sits in my kitchen drawer unused."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great for eating.","review":"It's over-sized handle is o.k., This feature may be better for a child or someone with hand problems. I just found it unnecessary. My biggest complaint is the small serrations. While it does cut through grapefruit, it has a tendency to catch pulp in the teeth. It doesn't seam to affect its performance but it is annoying. The spoon is shallow and narrow making it difficult to get the juice. It is also overpriced in my opinion. I will continue to use it when my others are in the dishwasher but it won't be my go to grapefruit spoon.Where this spoon might be better than my others is if I needed to spoon out many grapefruit for some kind of cooking project. Here the pulp stuck on the spoon wouldn't bother me nor the shallow scoop. The larger handle would be a better fit for long duration use, much like a thick pen doesn't cramp your hand.I am not a cook though and have little need for a large pile of grapefruit innards. I prefer to eat them one scoop at a time."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fast-paced mystery","review":"I read this book in one sitting. It is the first and only time that I have ever done this.

With all three books in one cover, it makes the book very heavy and awkward to read. I'm guessing the book is about 5\\" thick and weighs several pounds.

I made a xerox, which I saved for years, until I finally made the mistake of loaning to a friend (ex, now, obviously) WHO DID NOT RETURN IT.Now this compendium of Outside's comes out, and blessed Mary mother of God, it includes the ferret-legging piece.You must buy this, flip to \\"King of the ferret-leggers,\\" and read the piece.

As it turned out, Outside's first 20 years were it's best 20 years. All the great writers are here: Tim Cahill, Edward Abbey, David Quammen, and others. Sadly, Outside magazine is now a mediocre ghost of what it used to be. It's now just a gritty boys' magazine where young, male extreme sports afficionados can get their pictures taken and have bragging rights, and where manufacturers of macho, envrionment-destroying machines can advertise; and the only time women are featured now is when they are either nude or barely dressed. Sad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a great choice","review":"This book sounded to me like the author felt sorry for herself and liked to talk about herself more than anything. Some useful information included, but overall just another case of a parent trying to make a buck from her disabled child."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Wonderful Book from Ms. Holliday","review":"I adored Ms. Holliday's writing style when I first read American Idle and I can tell you truthfully that this book has shown that her books are consistently funny, well-written and involving. I liked Kirby in the first book and was ecstatic when I found out she was getting her own story. I stayed up all night finishing it. I appreciate another reviewer's opinion about sharing it with your friends, but honestly, I'm making all my friends buy their own copy because this one is going on my keeper shelf."},{"rating":"2","title":"a highly challenging collection of early Christian thought","review":"This book is a collection of early Christian writings, gathered under chapter-topics. A Dictionary of Early Christian Beliefs is also such a topical collection, but this one is devotional in nature, and contains some highly challenging thoughts in regard to prosperity, materialism, etc. I highly recommend this book to any Christian. You will see how seriously they took Jesus' words, and be challenged to do the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pilgrim Road satisfies","review":"The Pilgrim Road offers a lot of food for thought from early Christian writers. They were promoting a new belief system, often in hostile circumstances, and their comments are enlightening for our times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Interesting Blend -- But I Hate the Marketers","review":"Not a bad first novel, incorporating a bit of a lot of different sf themes. It includes military, cyborgs, drugs, nanites, alien technology, global warming, cyberspace, love, hate, assassins, body-alteration, the end of civilization as we know it. Whew.But it is a real pain in the ass to get to the end of the book, find that NOTHING is resolved, and the \\"sequel\\" will be out in six months for another $7. This is a bad trend in publishing -- split a \\"longish\\" book into two pieces and make twice the money. In this case, however, the first half wasn't really too long and it could and should have been marketed as a single published work.So, the real rating is 4 stars for the book, and minus 2 stars for the publisher.If it looks like the publisher is going to stretch this out to 3 volumes, I won't bother with the second."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet Another Self-Solving Mystery","review":"Please, do not be fooled by all the big-name writers perched on the fence crowing about what a great book this is. In today's publishing market writers (espacially sci-fi writers) are whores. \\"You stroke mine, I'll stroke yours\\".If you're looking for a book where the hero does not have a guardian angel with near superhuman powers watching over her 24/7, this isn't it.On the surface Razorface (if Elton John were dead he'd be spinning in his grave) is a ruthless druglord-gangster-kingpin, but in truth, he's a big-hearted ol' family-type goof just looking after the 'hood - and, of course, our heroine, Jenny. The book hints at a big mystery aching to be unravelled, but Jenny doesn't actually solve any of it, she merely waits for Razorface to put his \\"peeps\\" on it and then report back (Doyle IS spinning in his grave).This has become such a common plot device (crutch for the plot-impared)it deserves its own category in literature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mediocre, politically correct, boilerplate","review":"The book is not badly written, but the plot is boilerplate formula. The biggest problem with the book is that Ms. Bear is way too eager to use the book as a platform to establish her political correctness. Her references to \\"white cracker\\" asses and \\"christian fascists\\" etc. ring so false that they ruin the story completely."},{"rating":"2","title":"When all one has is a nail...","review":"Good, solid work. I reccomend it.It took me some time to get into the swing of things, some of the dialogue, and set-up exposition dragged, to me, but once past that the puzzle was good, the background believable (if fantastic. The conclusions from premise were acceptable, if the premise was accepted) and the slow opening pace picked up well.There is very little senitmentality, though a great deal of sentiment. There is no guarantee that any of the people in the book will make it to the end, and the sense that the stakes are high, and no-one gets out alive is unmistakeable.It promises well for the rest of the trilogy, as I hate the knowledge the hero will win out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intelligent science fiction.","review":"For those open-minded enough to enjoy possibilities over optimistic political dogma, Hammered sketches an unsettling vision of the future as a background to a story of dangerous drugs, cybernetic implants, alien spacecraft, and an artificial intelligence that's neither sweetly helpful nor murderously insane.Yes, there's a smattering of French. But the complaints seem rather silly since much of what's important is translated and what isn't might well be better left to the imagination: obscenities sound so much sexier with a French accent.What matters is that the story grabbed my attention, kept me reading with great enjoyment right to the end, and that there were genuine surprises along the way (Ms Bear is not afraid to kill people). It's an excellent read and I'm very glad that the second book in the series is already available and the third will be so shortly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incredibly bad film making","review":"The movie is actually more retarded than the title which at first judgement would seem impossible.Mr. Ray Dennis Steckler (Cash Flagg) has provided a campy monster flick set in a carnival background. Without looking at Carol Brandt in leotards this film was a complete waste of time. So many dragged out scenes that don't amount to anything entail about 75% of the 100 minutes. Bad burlesque numbers and sexy costumes aren't enough to keep most people's attention, let alone a B-Movie buff as myself.The bad acting isn't even worth laughing at, because it's so dull. Some movies are so bad that they achieve a cult status such as this.Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sad","review":"It's really sad. I love Omega so much but this watch was an utter disappointment. The movement, the Omega 3313, has been hotly debated, but the virus had immediately hit mine.

Mine has 2 bolt holes in that are center to the middle of the regulator, this one has 3 bolt holes. At first I thought \\"Well, I'll just bolt the two in and leave the third alone.\\" But upon further inspection, the 2 bolt holes that I would need to use aren't evenly spaced.

We have several F-P little people playsets and like to use them with this airport.Unlike some other reviewers here, we are VERY glad that it did not come with any battery-hungry and annoying lights and sounds to irritate mommy & daddy's nerves. It's getting harder and harder to find toys these days where the only noise comes from the children themselves.The playset was easy to assemble and comes apart for storage. The only negatives I've seen are that the windsock and umbrella are easily removed (and lost), but all in all, this set gives our son quite a bit of self-play and helps him develop his imagination. Where else but here can you see a Fisher-Price sheep pilot a passenger jet?"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not the DISCOVERY airport !!!!!!!!!!!","review":"You will be very disappointed with this newer version of the beloved Little People DISCOVERY AIRPORT. The previous version had lights and sound -- the reason why we love the Little People sets! This version (Little People Airport) has none of the perks that make the children love their toy.

I am in the airline industry and thought it would be a fun addition to his other Little People sets. I was unaware that Fisher Price had discontinued the \\"Little People Discovery Airport\\" and had replaced it with a much less expensive \\"Little People Airport\\" which does not take any batteries, so therefore, makes no noise whatsoever. Unknowingly, I bought it as it looks EXACTLY like the battery operated version. I brought it home and my son was so excited upon seeing the box because he had remembered it from my friend's house. We unpacked it and set it all up. He played with it for about two minutes, he was bored with it. It doesn't do anything at all, just sits there and takes up tons of space. I'm not sure why Fisher Price would take all of the best features of a toy and take them away. It just doesn't make any sense to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, durable fun","review":"My boys are so ROUGH on toys! Toys like Hot Wheels tracks and other car sets are broken within days. But my three year old just loves this set, and it has been sat on, stepped on, and dropped and it is still in great shape! Very durable, and the cars and planes are great fun to play with. I don't think every toy needs lights and sounds to be fun...actually I'm getting rather tired of the highly computerized toys these days. I recommend the Little People sets highly!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hit Toy!","review":"I got this toy for then 16-month old son and he likes to roll the car over the bridge. It does not make any noise but I don't think it really matters. He loves to sit inside the road track and play.The helicopter is a hit, he can play with it by itself. My husband took luggage and patio umbrella out and hit them since they may be most likely in his mouth and could be swollen. The only thing is this toy is bulky to store and place on the floor so I gave 4 stars to this set instead of 5 stars but this outweighs fun provided by this toy for my son."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lots of opportunity for imaginary play","review":"My older son received this toy for Christmas (he was 25 months old at the time) and LOVED IT! We have the lights and sounds version which is completely unnecessary. Both of my boys (2-1/2 and 17 months) now sit and play with it together. They use other Little People play sets with it, or random cars, trains, trucks and boats on the little road and runway. When they want to hear the sounds, unfortunately my 2-1/2 yr old gets very frustrated. If the noise in the area is too loud, the toy will not pick up the movement of the vehicles. Radios, TVs, air conditioning or another crying/yelling child all can contribute to the problem. Also, the toy is 7 months old and I have to \\"restart\\" the sounds and lights from sleep mode by turning it upside down and switching it off and on. Annoying. It is relatively big compared to other Little People play sets, but it is the one they play with most often - followed closely by the farm and the garage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed With Fisher Price","review":"I bought the Little People Airport for my daughter one Christmas and the toy lasted for less than a year. It worked great at first and when it stopped, I thought all it needed were new batteries but that wasn't the problem. Even the Little People Discovery City stopped working.

Thank you Fisher Price, I love it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Our son's favorite toy!","review":"We bought this for our son's third birthday and he LOVES it! He also has the zoo and the train so when we have it all set up it takes up most of the floor. But he takes all his Little People to the airport on the train then they fly to the zoo.My only complaint is that the airport is pretty big and can't not be broken down with out breaking the clips so make sure you have storage for it.Other than that, it offers hours of fun play and imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"MOMMA MIA","review":"This toy is wonderful, my daughter recently turned one, and she loves the helicopter, plane and automobile.

The style is anecdotal without being \\"dumbed down\\". She gives enough personal information about the people involved that they are human for the reader--not just ancient names riddled with facts but no feeling. Further, her coverage of the world (not just Rome) lets you see a complete view of history. What really impressed me what her ability to remain unbiased in her presentation.

Unfortunately, if you don't understand the Korean language...I recommend not buying this movie because the subtitles are HORRIBLE!

But the first time it was used the wood under the right armrest just split with minimal pressure from my arm.

Finally, here's a book for people of ALL ages that looks like a book for grownups. All my questions were answered and I found out more than I thought I wanted to know. I didn't follow the 30-day plan (I'm living alone on a tight budget and have an erratic eating schedule) but the supplements worked wonders. Within two months I was feeling 90% better.

I'm looking for an alternative remedy for my child's ADD, but this book was no help. I'm returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works for supplement company","review":"Yes, we should all be concerned about all the weird ingredients in food. But why go to tremendous effort to get pure food only to add other weird stuff in the form of dozens of supplements?The book is confusing and stretched.Never warns about any side-effects from the multitude of supplements she is pushing.The author is very vague on her website about her qualifications. Apparently worked as a lab technician at a medical school. No info on any degree in anything - except that she did \\"work on an advanced degree in nutritional biochemistry.\\" Bought her parents' health food store.The author is presenting herself as an expert on every kind of nutrition on her website: children, ADHD, autism, anti-aging ...even canine nutrition.It turns out that she travels doing sales pitches for a supplement manufacturer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak at best...","review":"I really wanted to like this book. The design is good - a spiral notebook style, hard cover, compact size, but ultimately, the content is lacking. I have been dyeing my own fabric for a while now and find that this book added nothing to my skills.

Frankly, I have received better, free, low-water immersion instructions on-line at various dye selling websites."},{"rating":"1","title":"lacking","review":"I'm very disappointed with this book.

Instead, this is a mish-mash of poorly related musings: a half-baked geology lesson, a half-baked history lesson, a few stories about bad weather and hikes, but nothing that comes across as heartfelt or compelling.Worse, the second half of the books is filler -- recipes. One of the first listed is (I kid you not), Grilled Cheese: Butter the bread, put on cheese, grill! Pinder's insight into the mystery dish: it may be fattening.Not to be too cynical, but I can hear the editor's words: \\"Eric, there's not quite enough here for a book -- what can you fill it out with?...Recipes?

The shredder device itself is heavy duty, super quiet and does an excellent job. But the down side is the shredder part is so heavy it is easily knocked over because the waste basket is made from cheap plastic and weighs only 6-1/2 lbs. While the shredder weighs about 20 lbs. The first shredder was poorly packed and the basket was in pieces from the shredder banging around in the box and breaking the basket into little pieces. I suggest keeping the casters of an that should help steady the shredder on the basket.

I would give this story a mark of ten out of ten for being so interesting and capturing my imagination.

The best way to put it is that I got it, I get it, it just doesn't make any real sense.It's sort of a hybrid between a Buddhist version of the Exorcist, a Samurai movie, and a slasher film.

This video conveys all that, it may not appeal to the younger crowd, but it it is representative of the way things used to be and the true meaning of skating.

My coffee maker is designed for an in-line filter. Installation was a snap. I have not noticed any scale buildup on the coffee maker, but then our water is from Lake Michigan and has few dissolved solids.I have not run into the quality control problems that other buyers mention. The quality control issue does concern me, but I do not know how wide spread it is.I think that from my experience, if you are looking to remove all volatile organics, small particulates, and specific water-borne contaminants, there are much better filters on the market. However those filters also have a case, wall mount brackets and are more expensive initially.

It's a single cartridge under sink unit. I was surprised to find the water tastes great. I don't know why the Watts would not work. The Watts cartridge is much heavier than the GE.

While the new filter came with nice brass fittings (with the tread already wrapped in teflon tape!), I decided to use my existing quick-release fittings, which allowed me to swap out the filter in less than a minute. So far, it has been a month, and the water tastes great. The 20,000-gallon life span of this filter was a major factor in my decision. I have well water, and this gives me peace of mind, knowing that my water is getting properly filtered. One thing you may want to do: read the instructions. The manufacturer recommends flushing the filter for a few minutes when you first connect it to the supply line to make sure there is no residual charcoal dust coming out of it. This is normal with most water filters and in spite of having forgotten to do that, I did not experience any problems."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good so far","review":"It was relatively easy to install although I had to adjust the brass fittings on the output twice due to a small amount of water leakage.

In the past couple of weeks we have noticed whitish flakes in our glasses after ice cubes had melted. We verified this by melting cubes in clean glasses. Same result. I contacted Watts and they said to disconnect filter and compare water before it enters the filter to water coming out of the filter. We are on a city water line and have not noticed this in our tap water.So, just a few months after installation of what I thought would last a long time, we have to deal with the filter all over again. I wish I had paid more attention to previous reviews regarding this same issue. Thought it was just an isolated problem. Plus, I'm not sure how much of the white flakes we have ingested before noticing the problem!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Watts 5 Yr Inline Ice Maker Filter","review":"I could not locate the filter I needed locally.

The water from this filter looks and tastes good. No noticeable drop in water pressure. This filter does not come with any way to mount it, so we bought a piece of plastic pipe support strap at the home improvement store and used two screws to mount it under a cabinet. We already had a 1/4\\" supply line for the water, so a second one was all that was needed to place the filter inline. If they had included the strap and 2 screws which only cost a few cents together, we would have rated this 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tastes only slightly better than tap water","review":"I gave it two stars for trying. I don't care how many years or gallons this filter provides, the water tastes only slightly better than San Diego's public water supply (tap water).

Yes, it says 5 years, but we never expected that and usually replaced it every year. We follow the instructions for running water through it and are used to the shot of black water (from the charcoal) that comes out first. This year, after running more water through it than ever before, we continued to have small particles in the water. These were not air bubbles as they continued to swirl in the water glass. I made a special rig to hook it up directly to an outside hose bib (so we didn't have to use the 'bucket brigade' and ran water through it continuously for 20 minutes. We continued to have the particles.We removed the filter and connected our city water directly to the refrigerator and the particles were gone. We won't be buying this filter again. Amazon was very nice about the return and we will continue to purchase through them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work","review":"I installed this filter 3 weeks ago into my water line that feeds the ice maker. I previously had a different brand filter that had been working but was getting old and needed to be replaced. After flushing this filter for the recommended amount of time, I let it make some ice. I discarded the first few batches before testing the ice. It is more cloudy and has more white floaties than it did with the old filter.

The problem with this album is that the other 16 tracks that aren't the singles are average, at best. Maybe its just me but listening to T.I. talk hard like a gangster and a thug life after watching him skate around in his movie ATL just isn't cutting it for me. Its actually pretty laughable. If you haven't seen ATL this album will probably be alright for you, but if you have its just a joke. ATL seriously ruined it for me. I cant listen to this guy say anything slightly hard anymore or i just end up laughing. It wasn't just T.I. skating around that ruined this album. The non-single tracks really aren't very good. If you want to buy a cd for two good songs go for it, if not i suggest hitting up the tivo for the music videos.

Touchdown was straight, but a collaboration with eminem, i'd thought it would have been hotter. Big thangs poppin was alright, but not even close to his best 1st single.

I honestly was hooked more or less till the end. I even thought about buying it. And I will once it's 5 bucks or so.But His rapping skills need to improve. Sure, He definitely has the swagger down and He's got the money. But that doesn't necessarily make You a Rapper. You need to be able to write Your OWN songs. And they should be more than radio fluff.Sure He isn't a rapper without hits. But that's not saying much. 50 (Ew), Lil Wayne (Fugly/No-talent), Fabolous (Meh), Souljah Boy (UGH!!!!) and Paul Wall (Meh) all write some or all of their material.

First, the hissing noise had to be solved by Watts sending me a bypass for the system. Thirty days later, the system quit. I paid someone to test my water pressure. I had Watts to send me a replacement shut off valve. Finally, I paid $18 to have it shipped back to Watts to be repaired and was told that I needed to replace all of the filters and the membraine because something in my water or the water pressure had clogged up the filters (it had only been in use 60 days). I am now waiting for the system to be mailed back to me so that I can put it in the trash. I will never buy a Watts product again in my life. $235 down the drain! (no pun intended)"},{"rating":"2","title":"good water, but beware of water drippage","review":"The quality of the water is excellent... I probably drink more water than ever before.However, if you don't like noises, the system can make a bit of noise when it's first installed. Meanwhile, right now, as I am using this system, occasionally water will drip onto the side. So, you better hope and pray it will stop quickly soon after it happens. Otherwise, you will discover flooding around the sink and perhaps dripping to the floor. If you are not an observant user, this system could drive you nuts occasionally."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's leaking!!!","review":"in the top of 4th filter it's leaking!!!

There was a very long delay in shipping and I'd felt the order had been lost but before all hope had evaporated the boxes arrived and I got into the swing of installing everything. Give or take an hour or two, for someone as plumbing challenged as I am, everything was up and producing water. Following the manufacturers advice two tanks were run through before we started using the water and I have to say it works wonderfully and tastes absolutely great. It produces more than enough for our family of six for cooking and drinking and is very well built. Very pleased and will order another for my new house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazingly loud hissing sound","review":"I was using a 5-stage Genesis V system from Havapure for years. It was quiet, and produced good water. I just moved and bought this system. It has an \\"air gap facuet\\" which means that it hisses when it's filtering. It sounds like a mini garden hose, and lasts for about 20 minutes for each glass of water. It's beyond irritating to have in the house. It was professionally installed, but it's going back to Amazon *tomorrow*. I can't believe people listen to this after each drink of water. I wish I could give it 0 stars..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much noise!","review":"We were very excited to install and use the filter system for our well water. The installation went fine, the storage tank does take up space underneath the sink area. But the noise, we were not expecting. After the initial fill up and subsequent refills to settle the charcoal dust, we were ready to go. Each time the tank needs to refill you hear the trickle of water down the drain, 4 gallons of water is processed to make 1 gallon of filtered water. Plus a hissing noise similiar to a pressure cooker until it refills. We called Watts, and while they were very friendly, the rep. agreed \\"Yes, it is noisy.\\" No solution was offered. We decided the cons outweighed the pros and uninstalled the system and sent it back. Had we known about the noise and the amount of waste water, we would not have purchased."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Water Filtration","review":"I recently purchased and installed this filtration system to work through our refrigerator ice maker and chilled water dispenser. It installed easily and with a couple of extra parts was working to produce crystal clear ice cubes and very good water."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good filter for the money","review":"I installed the WP5-50 system about two months ago and would like to share the following with people who are considering buying the product: 1) the water quality is really excellent as seen in a test meter, 2) it does make some noises when making water but not that bad if you are far enough away from the system, 3) the instructions are not very clear as they include information not for this model as well and it lacks an overall picture of the system installation in my opinion, Watts makes a great RO filter heavy duty easy to change filters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaking plastic fitting/connector","review":"I was happily using my system for about 8-9 months until the little plastic quick connect fitting that goes on the red line (installed it following the manual) leaked inside my cabinet and because of openings around the water and drain pipes water made its way to the concrete floor and under the laminate floor. Now I have to replace $1700 worth of laminate because the store doesn't carry the same laminate from 4 years ago and I can't find an exact match. Cheap $1 connector> $1700 in just materials to fix, not including my own labor to remove old and install new laminate. Had I known this connector can leak so badly, enough to get under 1/4 of the living room floor overnight, I would have avoided it at all costs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great filter","review":"Purchased it to supply water to refrigerator and overall very happy. We also us it for the coffee pot to prevent scale build-up (keurig is very susceptible to plugging due to high TDS). TDS went from 180ppm to 15ppm and the water tastes great. Have never run low on water, even during parties.A few things to remember about this system (and RO in general) before you purchase it:- The system includes filters and storage tank which takes up quiet a lot of room under the sink- All RO systems will have a waste water stream which has to be hooked to the drain, or recycled to the hot water lines- This kit includes plumbing parts which may work for 90% of the installations but we had to add some parts to complete the installation- If you are using it with a refrigerator plan on purchasing a booster pump with this kit. Without the booster ice cubes will be small and water will just trickle out of the water dispenser."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great","review":"There are a lot of people who complain about the hissing noise - but this is part of how a RO system works - and frankly it is quieter than the older system I had.As mentioned - I owned an older Watts RO system (I bought it about 8 years ago at my former residence) and this newer model is definitely an upgrade. The water flow is much higher; the water quality excellent, the assembly much easier, and the overall system was better built/designed. I did have one quick connect hose fitting that leaked and I eventually had to pull it out, re-cut the end, and re-install -- but other than that it was pretty easy to set up. One reminder - make sure you install the clean water line to the RO water faucet before you put in the filter / tank as getting to it at the end of assembly is a bit of a pain.We liked our old system so much, my wife made it a priority to install one in our new home - even before curtains!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommend!!!","review":"This is a great product. It was very easy to install. This thing makes very good tasteing water. Before I was buying lots of bottled water for drinking and making coffee because the water in town really sucks.

Using the author's \\"Fax Attack\\" method, I was able to buy a new Nissan Sentra GXE for $300 *below* invoice (and the one I wanted is in short supply right now). Mr. Bragg tells you what to look for and look out for during every step of the shopping/buying process. You'll discover that even if you get a great price on a new car, you can lose money on add-ons, trade-ins and financing; he tells you exactly how to not \\"leave money on the table.\\" To top it off, the book is easy to read. He doesn't bog you down with endless stories of fictional salesmen; but it's easy to read and understand.

You aren't just learning how to negotiate the price of a car, or just good negotiation skills - you are really learning the auto sales business and techniques, as well as reinventing the way in which to purchase a new car. Following Mr. Bragg's advice (especially the \\"Fax Attack\\" method) you really do become the cat instead of the mouse. You do NOT need to walk into a dealership and negotiate price. Use the Fax Attack method and just wait for dealers to call with quotes; field the lowest offers, and start them on a bidding war against each other!

I used his unique \\"FAX attack\\" approach to find the dealer who was ready to sell me a car at my price without wasting time with sales games.

It is also nice to learn about all the other wrestlers through Piper's account of his interaction with them.Chapter 12 is particularly interesting since Piper takes head-on what he calls \\"the sickness\\": the overwhelming bearing on the life of wrestlers that wrestling has, mainly because of the promoters manipulations and the lifestyle according to him.It is definatly worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"Im a big Wrestling fan and this is one of the best books ever written by a wrestler I read it in a day and half I highly recommend this book to all wrestling fans"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot Rod can write","review":"A wrestler you loved to hate and a man you couldn't not love and respect.

Piper speaks with true sincerity about the job and co-workers/family that saved him from living on the street, although it seems he ended up living an even more extreme life in the wrestling world.Piper waxes philosophical on the business of wrestling, but throws in enough raunchy/violent stories from the road keep the reader's interest peaked.

He didn't talk much about his time in WCW, and there were other topics that he didn't spend much time on. Fans of '80s wrestling should really enjoy this book.

Simplemente no se compara a Tego Calderon o Don Omar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated and one-sided","review":"Research into the tradition of women deacons--known in Christendom since Phoebe the deacon (Romans 16:1--has generally focussed on the question of whether they were sacramentally ordained. Both before and after Martimort's study, written in response to a earlier work published by Roger Gryson, scholars have determined that women deacons were actually ordained and are still ordained in some Orthodox Churches. Despite excellent work by Kalsbach (1926), Meyer (1938), Gryson (1972), Fitzgerald (1999) and Zagano (2000), the 2002 International Theological Commission study document on the diaconate depends primarily on Martimort's perspective. A comparison between Gryson and Martimort will find they use the same materials, interpreting them differently. Martimort's book is valuable only in the sense of tracing the history of modern attempts to discredit the ordained women of history."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Art Reference Source","review":"This book provides great pictures and detailed definitions of art terms, making it easy to connect art terms to artists and genres."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoping for Better","review":"Well unlike the other reviwers I didn't like this book too much. I found the first book a little more interesting. This book should be renamed to the Pennington Series, because that is mostly what this book focuses on is the Pennington characters. I just don't find this series interesting at all, and I prefer the University series. I wonder how much longer this series will go on, hopefully not too much longer. The Elizabeth and Max storyline bored me to tears. I could care less about Sarah and Nick. Vanessa is the only character in my opinion who is slightly interesting. By the way Sarah and Nick's storyline is a lot like the one that dealt with Elizabeth and her decision about whether or not to lose you know what (if you read the storylines in the last couple of University books you will know what I'm referring too). Plus Sarah annoys me. I don't know if I will bother to buy the other books in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"a most unfortunate turn of events","review":"This series is simply a hybrid of old SVH/SVU, and a reworking of an earlier trilogy (from SVH) when Liz and Jess stay at some castle, and Liz has a little romance. Remember? Where is SVU? Are we being punished because sales were low? I don't want to read only about Liz, and forget about Chloe and all the new developments that were built up right at the end. I am not interested in this London business. It would be much more interesting if Liz were at the University of London rather than the basement of some ridiculous castle. I won't be buying any more Sweet Valley anything until Sweet Valley University comes back. And I am not the only one. Check out bn's page. Its fine if Elizabeth stays a series for those who care, but SVU needs to come back"},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read","review":"I thought that this book was pretty good although it wasn't about sweet valley it was about Liz who is from sweet valley so in a way it is still connected with the other sweet valley books, its just showing liz as needing time to live her life away from all she suffered in sweet valley and get a different perspective on her life and what she wants from it, no longer having to be there for Jessica she is now able to live her life even if its not the way she would have wanted it to be, but hey she's in London and deciding to make the best out of a bad situation I think that took guts. I think this series is a great addition to the sweet valley books once again Francine Pascal has done it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!","review":"This book is amazing! Sweet Valley was getting boring, and London is definitely the best place for a change of scenery! Plus its very interesting hearing about Sarah and Nick, James and Vanessa, Max, Elizabeth, and Lavinia."},{"rating":"2","title":"sounds like a good series","review":"I was kind of surprised when Elizabeth actually left for London. Since the other times she wanted to leave Sweet Valley her family always stopped her. I thought it was kind if neat that she ends up being a maid. I can't wait until book 4 of this series.

While this isn't X-rated (due to lack of full genitalia and penetration shots), it's also lacking in what one has come to expect from a Gabriella Hall movie: Actual sex. The movie does more teasing than satisfying, and isn't highly recommended. She's done other movies, which a quick search on Cinemax's website could turn up, which you might be better off renting, which are more likely to deliver what anyone wanting a Gabriella Hall movie wants."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete and utter rubbish","review":"This novel was a total disappointment, it consisted of little more than the anti-Semitic rants of an embittered old man. There was no plot and the story just rambled on without reaching an exiting conclusion. I feel that the author needs to seek a new career path as his literary skills are severely lacking.

The most off the wall questions like \\"Who's the artist of this Disney cartoon character\\" and who was in Superbowl 22...most ridiculous questions that even an african american history MAJOR doesn't know (see other review) because its not important. Good questions included hospital names and notable accomplishments. The game function is you have 4 colored pieces to advance forward. That's it other than the fact you get to move your opponents pieces backwards. THATS IT. Terrible game functions, and mostly poor questions. I'd give it 2 stars.

By the day after Christmas, there was a rip in the crotch, the knees were worn, and one of the stars fell off the top. He only wore this in the house for a few hours!The top does not button up, like the picture shows. It is one long velcro strip that fastens the shirt together. The stars are hot glued on. The pants are not sewn together well at all, and the fabric is very hard feeling.For the price, this costume could be made better. I would not suggest purchasing this one, unless you only intend to wear it once, because it will fall apart!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"It was a little tricky finding the correct sizing, the measurments didn't seem to match up however I just picked whatever since the elastic waist sounded strechy. My son loved this when he opened it Christmas morning, he insisted on wearing it all day. I tryed to fluff it in the dryer to get out the stiffness and the two metal stars fell off, but I love the velcro closure and all the other badges/patches that made it seem realistic to a 5yr old. It was a great price compared to other sites that sell similar items for more(and they didn't have the hat too)and the shipping was cheap and fast. I hope it will last for a hand-me-down to the other kids.EDIT: 10/2010 Several years later and this dress up items is still a hit!

I had bought 2 of these costumes for 2 my nephews since they love playing soldiers. Within the first 5 minutes of wearing it, the inseam ripped on one of the pants and all he did was walk around the house in it. The second pair lasted a day before the same thing happened.

This book is basically a complete reference of drills for every position that have been used at the nations premire basketball camp - five star. When Trajon Langdon started out as a freshman at duke this book recieved a lot of attention because Trajon, being from Alaska, did not have great exposure to a wide variety of basketball camps.

Plus talking in literal terms about one's feelings while playing music seems like it is sometimes simply hard to do for some of these musicians. So some of the stated insights seem obvious. (e.g. one has to subsume one's ego when playing in an orchestra).The sections where we see music (of a wide, appealing variety) played are well-photographed and absorbing.Certainly worth seeing, even if one could wish for more."},{"rating":"2","title":"When we play we are IN the art","review":"I come away from this film realizing to what extent the musician is in the work of art that is being created on the spot, with each performance. Music is a miracle, and live performance of great music really is sublime. And it's all done by people who, like me, enjoy being an audience. Watching these musicians enjoy the superb performance of Vivaldi's \\"Four Seasons\\" by the accordionist is a high point in this for me. Seeing the DePue brothers play bluegrass, watching the trombonist play with the salsa band, enjoying the violinist with the children at their school, made viewing this film special and important.

Lovejoy's Church","review":"I teach religion and for me this is an excellent reminder of how we mix the holy and the profane (not by using curse words, but by mixing religious teachings with our own non-religious feelings and ideas). The interactive figure and quotes from the series are great and, often, thought-provoking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rev. Lovejoy Playset","review":"The actual playset is very sturdy and has many extras. I particularly like the train hat and set that comes with the Rev. I do have one complaint, however.

The roller coaster ride of emotions is heartbreaking, but at times quite humorous. Although best known and loved for his Lt. Columbo TV character, this is Falk's best movie screen role. A real weeper. Pass the tissues, please!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fabric is way to cheap.","review":"Nice flag, but the material it is made of is very weak. Definitely not for outdoor use.

Its really an insult to use this material in such a nice flag."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whew","review":"This was the kind of vacation I always wanted to take. Cressida meets Draco on a Greek island & woo-hoo! Seriously, I liked this book. It was a typical Harlequin & pretty well written. In fact, I have read other Sara Craven Harlequins and I think this one is her best. I didn't find Cressy weak, as some other reviewers did; just confused."},{"rating":"1","title":"weak heroine","review":"The heroine throughout the entire book is a complete doormat. She never stands up for herself.

This book was painful to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappointment for this longtime fan","review":"Apparently I'm the only one who feels this way, but this album is a bore. I appreciate the concept, I guess, but this thing is going right into the box. The title track has a little bit going on, but it's downhill fast after that.Hiatt has made some amazing music over most of my lifetime, but this isn't it...the rhythms are pedestrian, and frankly, I was so stupefied by the music that I can't focus on the lyrics. When I want to hear this genius, I'll put on anything from the mid-90's through Tiki Bar and be a lot more satisfied. Sorry, but if you like Perfectly Good Guitar or even Cry Love, you're going to find this one tedious."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty disappointing","review":"I'm a huge John Hiatt fan, but this is not one of his better efforts.

This is not good, this is great music!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Anything But A Disaster","review":"John Hiatt's latest release, Master Of Disaster, finds him in a more soulful mood, but still serving up good old Memphis boogie. The songs have a deep introspection and much of the Mr. Hiatt's trademark bite. The title track is a look at addiction in a musician's life. \\"Thunderbird\\" is a folsky tribute to his car of the title name, \\"Wintertime Blues\\" is a fun, full-tilt boogie shuffle about the ills of cold weather and \\"Back On The Corner\\" is a blues lament with a great, grainy vocal. The standout track on the album is the superb \\"Cold River\\". The song is built over a soft and pretty acoustic guitar and the song tells the tale of travel through the Midwest. John Hiatt continues to fly under the radar, but do yourself a favor and check out this album and the man's catalog. He is a great songwriter and you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"another round of applause","review":"Simple sweet poetry as always. Hiatt has never failed to take me away with him. Beautiful sound, that familiar crackly voice and stories that make me wish I could be there.

Listen, his mid-career stuff i.e. \\"Bring the Family\\", \\"Stolen Moments\\" etc. is phenomenal; but he has not lost one bit of touch or creativity with his last couple discs. While \\"Beneath This Gruff Exterior\\" was a top shelf punch in the chops from John, \\"Master\\" is a laid back and beautifully written piece of work. I'm a HUGE Hiatt fan, and arguabally each of his discs have one or two clunkers- this disc is no exception to that rule. But you also have a few could-be classics- The title track, \\"Howlin' down the Cumberland\\", \\"Find you at Last\\".... and a couple that are just hysterical- \\"Wintertime Blues\\" and \\"Back on the corner\\". LOVED IT."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of his best - backup band is incredible","review":"John Hiatt with the North Mississippi Allstars as the backup....yup, it's as good as it sounds. Great album, very \\"Hiatt\\". Similar to Walk On, with a bit more of a 'produced' feel to it. That's what makes this great though, it's definitive Hiatt with just a twist of newness to make it a fresh album.I have to disagree with the reviewer who said that the storytelling isn't as good as in previous albums. They are more abstract than what I'm used to hearing, but that allows me fit in my own interperetation of the songs, which I love.

I don't understand...this makes me want to ONLY buy through ITUNES in the future.

It sounds like he put more work into this than his last several albums, which have lacked the depth or polish of Bring the Family or Slow Turning. The only complaint I have is that there are several songs where Hiatt seems to be straining to hit some of the higher notes. His gravely voice is usually perfect for his songs, but on a few of these songs, it reminds one of Leon Russell with his familiar straining to hit the high notes. But the album definitely grows on you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Aspern? Not Waterloo?","review":"I am a little bit surprised, I thought that British author can be interested only at Waterloo.

There are plenty of bad chord choices in this book that don't come anywhere near fitting the melody. Furthermore, with \\"over 625 songs\\", omitted are such essential jazz standards as \\"Stardust\\", \\"I Got Rhythm\\", \\"Blue Bossa\\"... instead you get tunes like \\"Frosty the Snow Man\\" and pop tunes by Carole Bayer Sager. I gave up referring to this book a long time ago. I don't doubt that there are other mistakes I haven't come across. About as useful as a dictionary with misspelled words."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good introduction to jazz","review":"As an intermediate piano student eager to learn about jazz chord voicings, this book has proven valuable and has expanded my knowledge of music and ability to play with others. The book has also introduced me to jazz interpretations of standards, popular songs and Broadway tunes. I've been able to take it with me and use it to accompany vocalists where there is no set agenda and always find plenty to play.

All the adults around when she opened it thought it was adorable, especially when he turned his head and said \\"Hello Baby\\". But my daughter is totally scared of it. We thought she'd warm up to him as she got older. She's had him for over 8 months, and she still cries whenever we turn him on. She'll touch him and even take him out of the toy box, as long as he is turned off. But as far as dolls go, he is too hard to be cuddly to her. The music is so loud and ear-piercing, and the velcro holding his tummy closed is always coming apart. She learned to crawl fine, without watching Pooh as an example.

Chronicling Mussolini's invasion requires a great deal of patience and judiciousness, since the cast of characters is large and the main plot breaks down into numerous sub-plots. Moreover, giving an objective account of what happened is not easy, since many observers who write about this murky period have axes to grind. Burgwyn, however, does not base his work mainly on secondary sources. Digging in official archives, he has fashioned a concise and clear narrative out of refractory material.

Morris' work posed such a serious threat to the myth of Israel's existence that when it first came out he was black listed.

In Morris' first book on this topic, he found the alleged Jewish 'purity of arms' was a myth. Morris, using Israeli Defense Force (IDF) records, confirmed that a massacre occurred at Deir Yassin, which included rapes and mutilations. The ethnic cleansing of Lydda, ordered by Ben Gurion, is documented, as is the Lydda Death march, which resulted in up to 350 civilian dead. If a Palestinian village did not surrender immediately, the IDF would execute some POW's and civilians, but would allow some survivors to escape, so that they could spread the word of IDF war crimes.

But no amount of appreciation of Richard Bruton's incredible acting or Sir John Gielgud's perfect directing can salvage this DVD. I have a large collection of early cinema on DVD (and am used to blotchy film & lousy sound) but the quality of this is so poor as to make enjoyment impossible. Forget any nonsense you have heard about \\"theater in the raw\\" or \\"Hamlet stripped to the bare bones\\". This is unwatchable as the picture is so bad. The best you can do with this is turn the screen off & just listen to the dialogue. It will give you an inkling of the brilliance of Burton \\"live\\". For a great DVD version of Hamlet, look for the BBC Shakespeare Hamlet series with Sir Derek Jacobi as Hamlet. Expensive but worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stale, flat, and unprofitable","review":"I thought this was a very poor Hamlet. Polonious was the best performance in it. Claudius was passable. Gertrude was dreadfully dull. The staging was utterly unimaginative. Up front, I do not like Burton in much of anything, except for Who's Afraid of Virginia Woolfe. I think he's an egotistical, self-serving actor, and this performance is a prime example of that. His performance all facade and showy vocals, with no heart whatsoever. He's only minimally aware of the other actors performing with him. I even perfer Mel Gibson's honest if failed attempt to this showboating. The best Hamlets I've seen are Kevin Kline's uneven but brilliant performance and the classic Olivier. Buy one of those."},{"rating":"1","title":"Burton disappointing","review":"I had heard that Richard Burton offered the definitive Hamlet in this production. I was, however, disappointed.I found Burton to be far too intense in the opening scenes. Here, Hamlet is supposed to be melancholic, but Burton shouts the words \\"seems, madam? Nay, it is\\" almost angrily, despite the dialogue's obvious suggestion of Hamlet's brooding mood. Perhaps this angry and overly intense interpretation is rooted in the intensity of the 60s, but overall, I found it to be flawed and ignorant of Hamlet's character. The rest of Burton's performance is equally abrasive.Furthermore, I found the performances of the rest of the cast to be generally uninspired and unengaging.There are, however, some exceptional elements to the production. Gielgud's stage direction and his treatment of the ghost come to mind, but, despite this, I cannot recommend this production because of Burton's performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mesmerizing","review":"35 years ago I was very fortunate to see this masterful piece of work during its limited theatrical release.

But the buyer should be aware that this is live performance caught on film, and done on a shoestring. Thank goodness we have this record of what was a seminal production at all, so look past the technical quality and listen to the language.

But a must for any student of theatre and/ or lover of Shakespeare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two classics--\\"Hamlet\\" & Burton","review":"There are many fine productions of Hamlet available today, but you won't find a better performance than Richard Burton's in this 1964 legendary production directed by John Gielgud.Besides the excellent performance of Burton, you get to see a live production on stage with an audience, and the immediacy of the moment.If you're fimiliar with Mel Gibson's Hamlet and Kenneth Branagh's Hamlet, you certainly should give yourself the opportunity to view Burton's Hamlet and see a different kind of raw, brave performance.Don't miss it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not fit a 2010 Acura MDX!!","review":"I have ordered two air filters for my 2010 Acura MDX through Amazon.

While the Sony DAV-X1 is compact in size, it does a surprisingly poor surround-sound imitation on all audio sources with the exception of DVD. Audio output from all other sources sounds flat and is sorely missing the rich, full texture that you expect from a quality audio system.

To use this system to listen to music is very satisfactory but when we hunker-down to watch a movie, the sound quality, for speech specifically, is just horrible. My young kids are reading well-above grade level because every movie we watch can only be enjoyed with sub-titles on. If you blast the sound on a movie to try to capture the spoken word, then you will be blasted out of the room by the movie's music and sound effects. Conversely, if you turn the sound down to preserve your hearing, you cannot follow the dialogue.

So far, my only complaint. It is easy to set up and the simple design looks good on my gigantic Sony Wega T.V. I don't have my T.V. running through this system because my Wega has built-in Tru-Surround speakers, but something tells me that the optimum sound will be for a DVD. The sound for a CD is a little weak, and will probably be the same for the T.V.

BIG MISTAKE! The sound was not a big improvement over the TV speakers, wouldn't read any dvds (kept saying no disc), no radio reception, hard to control with cable remote, and when I'd gotten disgusted enough to get rid of it, couldn't even use the darn speakers elsewhere because of proprietary connectors.The Sony \\"customer service\\" person, in goodness knows what country, was of no help, and wanted my credit card number to initiate a repair order, since the product was a couple of months out of warranty.

I also read its less expensive than the BOSE 123, but more reliable and better quality. So far I have had the same experience. BUT I don't really want my TV viewing to be overpowered all the time with a big woofer sound - so its good for me. The surround sound may not be as good as the five speaker things - but much fewer wires, speakers and fuss. My only issue is I cannot figure how to plug my HD cable box three wires into the sound system. SO, I have the video going directly to the tv and the sound only going through the SOny.

I ended up returning it a couple days after receipt. The pros are: better picture quality while watching DVD's (via HDMI) and booming sound at times during DVD playback (explosions etc). But in the end I couldn't justify the cost because: faux surround sound wasn't impressive at all; not excited about having yet another box in the entertainment cabinet, another remote, and more wires.So I would recommend trying this if you get it from a vendor with a liberal return policy allowing you to give it a good try.

A very expensive one this time.Of particular note is Chapter 5: Coherent and Differential Detection. Authors were busy copying and pasting covariance matrix entries but they forgot to check whether their equations for channel coefficients make sense. They dont.In general, no attempt was made to provide insight. Self-advertisement, major errors, confused descriptions, pigeon English rule the land here. I wonder whether van Nee set up the organization of the book, and Prasad filled in the blanks, since the second author appears to be producing (I would not call that writing) too many books in a short time period.

I rinse it every time I use it, but it stains very easily so now I can't tell from the outside how much coffee is left. Also, the little white valve thingy at the bottom of the tank is warped or something now. Jiggling and pressing it back into place works only temporarily. I now have to keep a small cup wedged under the spout while brewing or I get coffee all over the countertop.

Just this week, after 5 years of daily use, the handle to the pot broke-- but it's still usable. We're going to replace our brewer with the exact same make.

Unbelieveably easy to clean & convenient to use. I discovered a trick to getting the coffee to come out hotter: First, run a batch of water through the machine. That gets everything hot before the coffee brews. Also, have hot water sitting in your coffee cup while brewing.UPDATE 9-23-12: TERRIBLE CUSTOMER SERVICE. The coffeemaker started pausing when I would turn it on. Then it completely stopped pumping the water. So it worked for one year. I don't know who's making them now, but the quality isn't there any more (like so many products today). I contacted Hamilton Beach & they \\"offered\\" to sell me another one at a small discount & with their ridiculous shipping costs added, it would cost MORE than a store's price.

A film of two people who embrace one another completely within the wrappings of Eros, and the human spirit unfettered and whole. A great educational film for those abhor nakedness, and, settle for the old one speed, in and out sex, tinged with anger or disconnection. For stunted personalities, this is a film in need of a rating, or negative descriptive word. Either form of labeling, in toto, equals unclean and damaging to the morally innocent.

I have a hard time believinganyone talks like that while having sex, in Argentina or any where else forthat matter. There is pretty much wall to wall nudity but the film is justnot very erotic.

While they looked pretty on the wheels, an issue arose yesterday when he went to put air in the tires. He couldn't get the valve stem caps off of any of the wheels, even with pliers. Since he has afraid he would damage the tire pressure indicators, he brought it straight to the dealership. They groaned when he told them what the issue was and had him take a seat and told him it would be a while. Apparently they are seeing this issue quite often. The valve stem covers had fused to the valve stems, and were impossible to remove by unscrewing.The mechanics at the dealership had to remove all four tires, cut the valve stems, unmount the tires, replace the valve stems, remount and rebalance the tires. The total charge for this on a car which is still under warranty (BMW will not honor this repair under the warranty) was $201.47.

My husband and I are the only owners of Bimmers in our complex so there should be no reason anyone here would want to take these valve stem covers.

He has given us a portal into the minds of today's mathematics professors and intellectuals. The opinions he expresses in this book are exactly that of every professor I met in the course of my education. So why two stars? Because Klein makes absolutely no attempt to convince you that he and the hordes of Kantians are correct. He takes Plato, Kant and Hume's ideas as unchallenged absolutes. The problem is: Plato, Kant and Hume are wrong. As a result, every claim against certainty Klein puts forward is wrong. The ideas are wrong, but they are the mainstream views in Mathematics.

His only evidence is to show pictures of Portuguese people and then compare them to pictures of Mellungians, hoping to show that similarities in facial features will prove his thesis.

The best writing about Pynchon has generally been starkly elucidatory in nature - these boys take Pynchon's already dizzyingly intricate web and dissolve it to a stupefying fog.

My church was The True Church, The Only Way, and I left it when I no longer believed that but I still had the fears of the consequences if I was wrong. Reading this book showed me that every church is The True Church. What a relief that everyone is so conceited, that my church is just a textbook cult. Now I can just focus on following God truly.

I must admit, when playing an RPG style battle, Liger is a strong ZOID to use. I built my Liger Zero, but somewhere I messed up and Liger DIDN'T mobilize! PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO WHAT PIECES YOU DETACH! AND USE A SMALL PAIR OF SCISSORS, LIKE THE SIZE OF FINGERNAIL CUTTERS OR \\"NOSE HAIR\\" SCISSORS! Also, the \\"Leg Stabilizers\\" are very important,attach them to their respected side! One more thing, the rubber pegs pop out of place from time-to-time, so it's quite annoying when mobilized, Liger falls down! Like he's an infant learning to crawl!

I enjoy the television show and decieded to buy this one myself. Fans of the strike laser claw will be disappointed because the walking feature does not allow the mobilitiy that the Liger has in the show.

Even the examples confuse rather than enlighten. The background information and the basic explanations are missing.I bought this book solely because it was a required text for a introduction to cataloging class.

They are NEVER sold on the market to consumers. A full libretto like this one is rented for anywhere between $15 and $60 per book, so the value is significantly higher. I paid about $22 total, with the shipping. What a deal. It has the script to Annie, plus all of the songs and sheet music.Not only was I impressed with the price, but also the seller's quick and thorough response to my question. He even included pictures to illustrate his point.

Rather noticeable is the difference in the harp playing (comparing \\"Bliss\\" with \\"Celestial Winds I\\", for instance).

The musicians seem to be just going through the motions to lay down the tracks.

The espresso has ZERO crema on it, and this results in a bitter, untasty shot of espresso. I tried absolutely everything -- fine grounds, coarse grounds... everything. The espresso flows too fast. Perhaps I bought a lemon, but I would steer clear of this machine.I have since returned my Hamilton Beach, and I bought a Delonghi Treviso, an infinitely better machine. If you are interested in a high-quality, pump espresso machine in this price range, buy the Delonghi."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not an everyday machine","review":"I make espresso everyday and this machine can't take it. Functionally, it was alright, but after about 6-8 months it just wore out. If you want a cheap machine to make espresso a few times a month, this might be a good option. Otherwise, forget it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother!","review":"I have been sooooooo frustrated with this machine....it is so hard to manuever that I end up with a big mess and I got burned the first time I used it...it may take practice, but the problem I find is that the espresso comes out like tea, even with the pods....I wish I had not thrown the box away so I could return it. The water resevoir is awkwardly difficult to remove and the frother is too short and in an odd position (that's how I got burned)....don't bother buying this."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Starbucks addict loves this machine","review":"I got tired of spending $$ at coffee houses and waiting in line so decided to make my own. Looked at several brands and prices. But decided I wanted something decent with little $. Easy to use and clean, made a great latte the first time! Frothing is great. Taste quality is NOT disappointing, I love this machine! NOTE: doesn't come with any cups or milk pitcher. Bought a stainless steel pitcher and 3oz. measured shot glass at Target (7.99/1.99) that work perfectly. Enjoy this machine :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed","review":"I was looking at higher priced machines when I stumbled on this machine. The specs looked great, so I bought it to replace my pump Delonghi which broke down.I have been unable to get ANY crema on my espresso with this Hamilton Beach machine. I have been adjusting the amount of coffee, the grind, the brew time, different coffee brands and nothing....NO CREMA. Just a flat cup of espresso. (My DeLonghi always produced crema)The frother works ok (good pressure), no problems there. Construction is acceptable, a good looking machine and decent pricing.Unfortunately, it's going back........still looking for a decent machine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk","review":"This machine is junk. From almost day one, the frother was tempramental - depending on its mood, it fluxuated from high steam to almost no pressure whatsoever, sometimes within the same cup of espresso. Four months after we purchased this machine, the machine completely died."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bad movies","review":"They Saved Hitler's Brain could be the worst movie of all time, it certainly challenges Plan Nine From Outer Space for the title. The Frozen Dead is much better actually pretty scary.

Anyone paying more than $10 is being duped."},{"rating":"2","title":"^_^","review":"I found the translation of this volume to be superb and the art smattered throughout was a nice touch. Also, the final part of the book, a musing on how two literary great could be related, was facinating."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't give a very good summary of colors for quick reading","review":"The use of this book is not for unexperienced aura readers and is not created for quick explinations of colors that you see in the aura. It is long and drawn out and does not cover the many different kinds of colors you may see in someones auras."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"I found this book to be a waste of time. I also read Life Colors, which is similar but better written and more uselful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"I've read many books on aura. This book just contain very limited information on aura. The intensity and the different shades of a color is not even mentioned. I'm thinking about throwing it away."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Georgian romances ever","review":"I've probably read this book a dozen times. I love the strength of the character and how she handily solves everyone's problems which mostly include matchmaking and frightening off mean grabby moneylenders. She's no prissy! I don't know who's on the cover of this edition, but it can't be the Grand Sophy. She's much more elegant and bold. The edition I first read as a teenager has proud Sophy riding a beautiful horse."},{"rating":"2","title":"First and most beloved","review":"A neighbor put this book (in paperback) into my hands in the summer of 1972 as I was preparing to move overseas with my family. Thus began a wonderful, lifelong relationship with Georgette Heyer's marvelous characters. I have read and re-read this paperback, which I still own, so many times that it is held together with a rubber band. I don't read any other romance novels - I am a sci fi/history buff - and the few other \\"regency\\" novels I've read by other authors are inferior, poorly written, fluffy drivel compared with GH's work. But this is superb. Read it and laugh along with the brilliant Sophia Stanton-Lacy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"5 years after world war 2","review":"I had read a number of georgette heyer's works and found them mildly anti-semetic. The Grand Sophie, on the other hand is very anti-semitic. I find it more disturbing because it was written 5 years after World War 2. I can't see into heyer's mind, but...."},{"rating":"1","title":"An ugly run of antisemiticism ruins this lark.","review":"Much as it grieves me, I can't recommend this book for the insulting description of the Jewish moneylenders which is the big ugly elephant in the room. It is simply a racist chapter in an otherwise delightful book."},{"rating":"2","title":"4.5 Stars for a Grand Read","review":"I picked \\"The Grand Sophy\\" as my introduction to GH, and it's a WOW! Such a satisfying read, chock full of memorable characters, humour and a great detailed glimpse into the society, fashions and speech of the Regency period. I understand the author was the undisputed expert of this era and it really shows.Sophy is such a likeable manipulator, especially when scheming against her adversary, Charles Rivenhall. Many laughs at the predicaments and unexpected outcomes she finds herself in.Excellent detail on the carriages, horses and especially the manners of that time. I feel like I was whisked away in a time machine and stole a little glimpse into the chaos that follows The Grand Sophy. It was truly a delightful journey and am looking forward to delving into the other works by this incredible author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely not my favorite","review":"I have loved most of the other books that I have read by Heyer. However, there are a few that leave me with a bad taste in my mouth. It annoys me that so much of my favorite authors turn out to be racists. I used to excuse this by saying that the writer was a product of his or her time etc. Still, whether or not someone is a product of his or her time still doesn't make them any less racist or prejudices any less wrong. Also, I understand that cousin love was common and marriages in the family were acceptable but it still makes me dry heave. I will continue to read Heyer but I will make sure to stay away from her books about incest!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Grand Sophy is truly marvelous.","review":"The Grand Sophy is my favorite Georgette Heyer book. Sophy is a young lady of courage and determination. Once you've read it, you will be a Georgette Heyer fan forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Grand Sophy","review":"This book slanders Jews. It is okay aside from that but the tainted portrayal alters one's impression of the author."},{"rating":"1","title":"the absolute worst Georgette Heyer book","review":"I LOVE Georgette Heyer and I heard this was many people's favorite. After I read it, I can say, \\"Not mine!\\" The main character is SO annoying that I winced through most of the book. The whole anti-semitic scene is just terrible and ridiculous even from a merely literary perspective. If you want a good Heyer read, pick up _Cotillion_ or just about anything else."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great author, Fun book.","review":"Georgette Heyer's books are older, but they are just as fun to read as any more contemporary historical romance. The characters are fun, and I learned a lot of new words that aren't used much in more current historicals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Georgette Heyer at her best","review":"I read this book in my teens and loved it and was happy ito purchase it for my kindle fire HD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grand Sophy","review":"This book is a lot of fun beginning with the parrott and the monkey.

Grand Sophy was a real good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOL","review":"I was actually laughing out loud while reading this. It wasgreat fun and very much like the regency romances I started to read a very long time ago. I had never read a Georgette Heyer before. I thought they were old-fashioned and stuffy, but my mind has been changed and I will in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Heyer!","review":"This is my favorite Heyer book. I am not sure if it should be called a Regency Romance because it was an amazingly funny read! Sophia Stanton-Lacy, the Grand Sophy, is my favorite Heyer heroine. She makes a grand entrance when she arrives in London and instantly sets about fixing other people's business (think Austin's Emma with a larger personality who never apologizes for what she does!).As always there is such great historical detail in the book, and I love that Sophy broke every single socially acceptable rule and didn't apologize once for it!A quick and amazing read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"True to the period - and not PC","review":"I heartily agree with the reviewers who enjoyed the main characcters, the multiple plot devices, and the author's deft touch. And the author is remarkably true to the period - complete with a Jewish character who invokes the anti-semitism that existed. Shakespeare did the same in the Merchant of Venice, so this is a 'honorable' tradition - but extremely offensive all the same to a more tolerant modern sensibility. So fair warning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well written, but have a few qualms about ending - spoiler alert","review":"Yes, this book by Heyer is well written and I do prefer it above other books of hers that I have read. The characters were well developed, good banter between them, nice plot, etc. All in all, a very good read that I had a hard time putting down. I will spare you the long, eloquent review and get down to the reason why I gave it a four star rating:SPOILER ALERT1. The two main characters are forever chafing at each other, so it's hard to believe they've fallen into love at the end.2. I know it's trivial, and it didn't seem to bother most of the other reviewers, but it bothered me that the two main characters that fall in love at the end of the novel are first cousins. Not second-cousins-twice-removed-step-sister, etc., but FIRST cousins. I had a hard time finding romance in in-breeding and, even halfway through the novel, still held out hope that the author would introduce a new love interest other than Sophy's cousin. Yuck."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read!!!","review":"I read the Parchment from cover to cover not wanting to put it down. The book is fantastic. It takes historical novels to heights which few authors can reach."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Aamazon","review":"Iam a complete novice to the internet and I want to comment that Amazon made my first online purchase painless,easy and fun.Amazon has a very easy to navigate website.I made my first purchase and was Amazed how quickly I received my product.I had so much confidence in using this site that I went on to purchase almost all of my Christmas list through Amazon and for the first Cristmas ever had most of my presents wrapped and ready in the beginning of December instead of buying and wrapping all my gifts on Christmas Eve so I had so much extra time to enjoy all the events of the season stress free.I would recomend Amazon to everyone to use.Thanks Amazon and to everyone at Amazon and reading this review have the best Holiday season ever!"},{"rating":"1","title":"the low down on the warshark\\\\wardick","review":"i dont like this zoid for one good reson i cant deck it out no extra guns no nothing look out [other online store] i be salein this thing soon"},{"rating":"1","title":"this zoids is bad","review":"well i think this zoids should be able to swim better tahn it does it aslo walks really slow and i really dont like it at all"},{"rating":"1","title":"WarShark........","review":"I think this zoid is alright easy to build but not alot of fun.

This is one of the coolest zoids ever. U wont regret buying war shark."},{"rating":"2","title":"war shark mania","review":"I think that the war shark is the best zoid. It is by far the most durable. The war shark is piloted by the Fuma team of the backdraft group and is also used by the champ team.These are the parts that can move...1. the tail. it can be moved machanicaly or you can move it by your self. 2. the mouth. the mouth opens phsically. when opened it reveals a gun. and...3. the cockpit. it just opens thats all. Overall id have to say this is the most durable of all the zoids"},{"rating":"2","title":"Take out any land zoid with this incredible unit!","review":"If you are a Zoids enthusiast like me, you'll know the War Shark is a backdraft unit judging by its colors. However, if you decide to make Zoids a GAME, then your War Shark is a nice addition to your Zoid team. This is one of my favorites, and is a bit short on the building time, took me about 15 minutes. But he makes the 1st in my new team: The Solid Team. This one has foam, which keeps it afloat, and absorbs any water that gets inside it. The downside is, this one is not capable of upgrades. It is good for physical attack, and is good at surprising the enemy because the cannon is in its mouth. Get this Zoid, or your team will lose matches to come!"},{"rating":"2","title":"SWEET ZOID","review":"This zoid is awsome. I ordered this zoid from here it took me 45 mn to build. This zoid is used by the Fuma team accoiated with the Back Draft group. It has a missle launcher and 2 two big guns on his back. It also has a gun in its mouth. It can go in the water and swim I dont know if I want to put in though because I want it to stay in good condition. I hoped this review helped any one."},{"rating":"2","title":"War Shark","review":"When I bought my war shark it was because I collect zoids and I could afford it. But then I watched the episode where a war shark took down two Iron Kong mk2s. This thing is way more powerful than I thought it was. In battles having this on your team is like an ace in the deck. Also I like it because it's really funny to watch it move. This one is well worth it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gaplus/Galaga 3","review":"The title says it all. If you're an arcade completist like me, this disc contains one of the few home versions of Gaplus/Galaga 3. As far as I can I tell it is the original arcade version.

When I found out it was going to be on DVD I had to see it again. It was even better! I am a huge fan of Steve Guttenberg and I love him as the sexy motorcycle riding Lobo. In the beginning of the movie he is looking really rough, but boy does how look hot with the long blonde hair. This movie is just pure 80's romantic fun!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Ordinary people - extraordinary situation","review":"This is a favorite for me and my wife. Though not as slick and witty as Hanks and Ryan (who we love), this movie has a chemistry and simplicity that makes it unforgettable. Set in Charleston the story has believable and approachable characters that let you suspend your disbelief just long enough.... A real Romantic Comedy. Lets get it back in PRINT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"This has the potential to be a really great movie. There are some funny scenes and the general message about not judging on the basis of appearances is good. However, I only give it two stars due to a gross \\"sex education\\" scene somewhere towards the middle of the film. The characters hopping in the sack together was another reason. So, I ended up donating my copy as I have young children and don't want that kind of stuff in my home. Too bad, though...if they'd just take out the trash, it would be a fun flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read the book instead!","review":"This rather forgettable movie was based on a very hilarious book by a lovely woman named Sarah Bird. The book is called The Boyfriend School, and if you have the time, save yourself and read it instead of watching the movie. I've done both, and would unquestionably recommend the book instead. The movie was originally titled Don't Tell Her It's Me, an odd choice even given the inherent plot reference. I guess if I'd seen the movie only, I might have found it entertaining, but the book was SO wonderful, the movie was just a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really dumb movie...","review":"I think Jami Gertz elevates most movies she's in, this one is a complete dud. You have to be in a really specific frame of mind to enjoy this one. Like comatose. Or on medication.

But the Norton edition pulls everything together that you could possibly want to know as you are reading the book. Both editions are included, the 1890 version that was published as a serial, and the 1891 version that was printed in novel form. The 1890 version is much more potent, and clearly more controversial than that of 1891, which has many chapters added to soften the overall effect of the book. Profuse footnotes illuminate Wilde's sources, which range from the pedestrian to the fantastic. Finally, the book concludes with some contemporary responses to the story, Wilde's rebuttals of them, and modern criticism. After the book's end, the criticism pulls readers into making long leaps of inference and symbolic interpretation. The Norton Critical Edition of The Picture of Dorian Gray transforms reading the book from entertainment to an almost religious experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Story reader fun..","review":"My five year old really enjoys the story reader even though I still need to help him push the books into place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pheromone","review":"this product does not smell very good.

I have twice now tried to start reading this book and got about 15 pages in before canning it. It is painfully slow, repetitive, and mostly obvious. The narrative style just doesn't work for this type of book. And as new faculty, the last thing we need is to trudge through a dull text. I would recommend chapters 10-12 of 'Tomorrow's Professor' by Reis, or the latter half of 'What They Didn't Teach You in Graduate School', both of which are done in an easy-read manner with more practical hints."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nihil Nimus? NIMIS!","review":"Is it possible to take seriously a book with a typographical error in its title? \\"Nihil nimus\\" is not Latin; it's just nonsense. The phrase is \\"nihil nimis.\\"Dr. Boyce recommends not wasting too much time on editing and proofreading. Alas, it seems that he has taken his own advice: the phrase shows up multiple times throughout the book, but is never once printed correctly."},{"rating":"1","title":"too much","review":"This book makes fairly simple information far more complex than it needs to be. The writing is much too wordy and repetitive. I think there are kernals of wisdom in the writing, but they are too difficult to glean. There are many books with the same material that are much easier to read. If you simply want advice, this is not the book to buy. If you want details about the author's research mixed with a great deal of psycho babble (e.g. he advises not procrastinating and starting early, but for some reason calls it \\"actively waiting\\") buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fire the proofreaders?","review":"Although I have not yet read the text, the egregious misspelling of the Latin title, which evidently escaped both the author and everyone who proofread the text prior to publication, is not a good advertisement--at least not for anyone who knows even elementary Latin. The correct spelling of the title should be \\"Nihil NimIs\\". If I do in fact decide to read the book (I am hardly a \\"new\\" faculty member), perhaps I'll be inclined to write a more favorable review of its contents.

It has good accuracey and hits hard. However, when i got it, the bi-pod was broken. The red dot sight that comes with it is not adjustable, and can not be seen in daylight. After a few uses, the bb's started to fall out of the barrel when it was tilted down( not even all the way down). I thought i could fix it so i opened it up. I discovered that all of the metal berrels were rusted completely out. Who knows how long it had been sitting in a factory.

Micrometer, dial test indicator, sine bar); marking out; basic bench fitting; drilling techniques & machines; centre lathe & turning techniques; milling machines & milling techniques; grinding machines & processes.The text is clear with multiple labelled drawings to describe steps if needed.

Will Polly be next?This book isn't Mel's ultimate book in the series but it is a fabulous page turner and well worth the time.If you like to laugh with your heroine and care about her at the same time I highly suggest you start at the beginning of the series and add each book in turn! Her writing is brisk, believable and oh so Canadian!"},{"rating":"2","title":"first person view of the turn of immigrant experience","review":"I looked at this book as a supplement for an Honors Seminar examining the idea of \\"happiness.\\" As part of our course, we examined cultural notions of happiness, specifically, \\"the American Dream.\\" This book provided an easy to read narrative illuminating the idea of the \\"dream\\" from outside the borders.

But on the more recent packaging, you can see that it says, \\"New, bolder taste!\\" And what kind of chip do they consider to have a \\"bolder\\" taste? One that's more oily. The chips now have oil added (look at the ingredient list!), and it only takes 18 small chips to give you 3 grams of dietary fat. I've signaled my dissatisfaction with this (I now consider the labeling to be deceptive, because the chips are as fatty as many fried snacks) by no longer buying the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cardboard Chips","review":"These taste like cardboard.

Finally, after a few weeks, I purchased my copy in January of '92. It was worth the wait!!! A perfect blend of John William's stirring score, with additional pop and classical pieces underscoring various sequences. A great addition, not only to the the legendary canon of John Williams, but more specifically to the great work he contributed to three of Oliver Stone's finest films-BORN ON THE FOURTH OF JULY, and NIXON, being the other two. I look forward to another Stone/Williams collaboration in the future. Highly recommended, wherever you can find it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Archer's best but still a suspenseful enough read","review":"Sequentially, this book seems to follow Kane and Abel and The Prodigal Daughter. However, it is more a thriller rather than drama as in the other two books. The President is now in danger of being assassinated and things must be done fast. The narrative is pacy and never tedious. Archer's gift of plot and fluent writing keep us turning the pages once again."},{"rating":"2","title":"SHALL WE TELL THE PRESIDENT","review":"Excellent reading, so close to non-fiction, as the book is well researched and could be true, except for the lady president of the USA (this could happen in real life). I have now become a Jeffrey Archer fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"What Goes On in The Senate and The FBI","review":"While Jeffrey Archer's previous 2 books, \\"Kane & Abel,\\" and \\"The Prodigal Daughter,\\" are are romance, politics, business, and a blend of history, with creativity, \\"Shall We Tell the President,\\" is a blend of politics and law enforcement on a level that most of us probably haven't considered is possible.I thoroughly enjoyed reading this book, because Mr. Archer, being a master at his craft, created so many word pictures that you become part of the story.Watching Senate hearings, as a result of reading this book, I have more questions in mind.There are many surprizes, especially in the last 50 pages. And there are some speeches in this story that provide the readers with a great deal to think about, in terms of homeland security.It's a fast read -- not too heavy, yet this book will stretch your mind, as a good book should."},{"rating":"2","title":"As a sequel no... on its own OH YEAH","review":"Originally this book was written with Sen. Edward Kennedy being the President, it was written in 1977 when the possibility was still there. Later Archer reworked the book to fit an existing character. I have yet to find the book as written with Kennedy as the President. This is a short little read (compared to the long novels of K&A and the Prodigal Daughter) that is well worth it. Taken on its own it is a great spy novel. FBI Agent Mark Andrews has just six days to locate a would-be assassin, and he's feeling the heat. Shall We Tell the President is a fast passed book that leaves the reader wanting more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting look into FBI","review":"Shall We... was an interesting example of how distrustful even people in our nation's top law enforcement agency should be of their counterparts and coworkers. While the plot thickened and twisted throughout the book, I would have liked more FBI interaction with the Executive Office, Secret Service, etc. The last couple of chapters quicken the pace of the book as everyone gets involved to save the country's first female president."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too much overlap among books in the series ...","review":"I would recommend Kane and Abel, The Prodigal Daughter and Shall We Tell the President, but make sure to read them in order (I didn't). My only complaint is that there is so much overlap and retelling in the three novels. Other authors manage to do a better job of making each book stand on its own while make the linkages. I felt like I was hearing the same incident described so many times. I found Shall We Tell the President to be the weakest of the three ... and very different from the other two. All of that said, I still enjoyed each of the books."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Timely-even though an earlier Arch- read with realistic characters","review":"Good Archer read with character development and normally a timely plot.

Archer has no concept of American politics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!!","review":"great book from Start to finish!!It was in great condition and also shipped fast!What i like about this writer, he writes in such a manner that makes you not want to put this book down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A SOLID THRILLER...","review":"This is an updated version of one of the author's earlier novels. First published in the nineteen seventies, the book caused some of controversy in its time, because the premise of the book revolved around an assasination plot against a newly sworn in President Edward Kennedy. In this updated version, the newly sworn in president is a woman, Florentyna Kane.When FBI Agent Mark Andrews finds himself to be the last man standing, he suddenly is made the point man for a very real plot to assassinate the president in less than a week's time. The problem is that the trail leads to Capitol Hill. Can Agent Brown discover who the mastermind is in time to thwart the plot?The author weaves a suspenseful, interesting story that will hold the attention of the reader. There are enough twists and turns to keep the reader engaged. Those who like cloak and dagger thrillers will most definitely enjoy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you could only get started","review":"When I first looked at this book, I thought \`Finally, a knitting books that I can actually understand and love.'

I returned it immediately, and was happy to find that the Remington was available from Amazon.com.I'm completely sold on this hair dryer. The motor is quiet and drying time is short. The only problem is that it felt slightly heavy at first. But after using it a few times, I suppose I got used to it because now that's not an issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic product!","review":"Some reviewers thought this dryer was heavy; I found it to be lightweight but powerful. I use the diffuser and was hoping to purchase an old-fashioned one that didn't have \\"fingers\\"; however, this diffuser works better than some others (with fingers) I've used.

The dark brown and pink buttons give it a retro 70's Brady Bunch look! Yes, this dryer does dry hair faster, and leaves the hair cuticle smooth and shiny. I wish the ionization could be turned off, because for some people this might tend to make their hair flat, yet smooth and shiny. I think if you're blow drying to added extra body and fullness, try a blow dryer without the ionization. The ionization is used primarily for creating a silkier and smoother hair, not adding body (IMO and from experience). Enjoy it, pink accoutrements and all!

After recently purchasing and using a Conair product that was worthless, I decided to bite the bullet and buy another dryer. Going on Amazon to search for users' favorites, this Remington model was given a high rating and was in my price range. After receiving it and using it once, all I can say is that the reviewers were spot on. This is a great dryer! Dries fast, high setting gives proper amount of heat to hold a curl with a roller brush and my hair looks so shiny afterwards. Cord is long enough, it's fairly lightweight and not too noisy. I like it so much, I may buy another one just in case they discontinue this model.

Even today, she's 2 now and will ride rides at amusement parks, chucky cheese, but is still scared to death of the coaster. I also think part of it is because it's very loud when it runs. I'm not talking about the music, the coaster itself is loud and then it runs fast. On the other hand, it's very durable. I myself took a couple of spins around on it and it did great. Very fast to put together or take apart."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed. What a dull toy","review":"You need to push a button near the bar in front in order to play the music.

It was so \\"thrilling\\" that he fell asleep on it twice. Other children in the neighborhood (from 7 months to 2 years) have ridden it and also not liked it at all.

They have only been used about 6 weeks and they do not work well. The buckets are not outdoors but in an insulated garage type building. Water freezes on the top and the cords get stiff and rigid in the cold weather. They are not easy to wash because the cord hangs out the bottom side and gets in the way if you want to wash the buckets in a sink. The flat sided bucket would be best if you need to place the bucket against a wall or fencing but I cannot recommend this item and would not purchase again myself.

As a steel guitarist, I was most interested in \\"Steel Chords\\". Incorporating a pedal steel into a small chamber orchestra playing modern music is an interesting premise, and Matson proceeds cautiously. The pedal steel part is rather tame, suggesting that Matson doesn't fully understand the potential of the instrument.Steel guitarist Doug Livingston performs the part flawlessly, and the entire ensemble embraces Matson's score lovingly, though. This is fine listening for a late afternoon, and it relaxes the senses in spite of the dissonance we have come to expect from modern music.My only complaint is that the steel guitar could have been louder in the mix. \\"Steel Chords\\" is the only modern classical piece I know of that features the pedal steel.

There is an emphasis on a few of the rural industries of China and how they work; be it farming, fishin,g or silk farming. These snapshots are quite interesting.

The book is divided into two parts. In the first part, the narrator follows a character named Christian from the time he leaves the City of Destruction and his family, accepting the path Chirst lays out for him, and watches Christian progress through his earthly journey until he reaches Heaven. Many of the elements encountered in the Christian faith are personified as characters that Christian encounters. The second half of the book tells the account of Christian's wife's and children's journey toward Heaven. The margins of the book are filled with scripture references that go along with the story.

The other players were Ed Bickert (guitar), Jerry Fuller (drums) and Don Thompson (acoustic bass). Smooth and heavenly renditions of Antonio Carlos Jobim's \\"Wave\\" and Luis Bonfa's \\"Manha De Carnival\\" are particularly nice. This reissue was held up momentarily by the legalities of adding the final bonus track. Other live recordings from Desmond's post-Brubeck solo days are said to exist.

But this CD reissue has given me a completely different impression. He sounds great with a lot more energy that I failed to catch in the LPs.But what on earth happened to Take Five? Vulnerable Desmond is back. His sax sounds \\"off microphone\\" as compared to other tunes whose Paul's solos are captured much more clearly \\"on microphone.\\" Since five evenings worth of their performances were recorded, much better take of Take Five should have been included in the LPs and this CD.

It must be horribly painful to have such a amoral parent, but in the context of a horrible war one can imagine how difficult it must have been.I do not see this as Holocust literature as some have said, but more about a daughter trying to understand how she could have been given birth by such an evil person. I think it is an important piece of work. Thank you Helga Schneider it really made an impact on me."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most important type of history","review":"I was deeply moved by this book, which is both a personal/existential journey and a disturbing account of genocide, it's underpinnings and relationship to psychopathy. An interesting companion book is \\"Defying Hitler: A Memoir\\" by Sebastian Haffner -- which explores what lead up to the rise of Hitler."},{"rating":"1","title":"A read in one sitting book.","review":"This slim memoir tells the story of Helga, a woman, who as a child was abandoned during WWII by her mother. Since her mother left her, her brother and their father to join the Nazi party, Helga has had questions she needs answered. After a brief meeting in the \`70s, Helga is visiting her now ninety year old mother again, in order for some closure. The story goes back and forth from the present conversation with her mother to flashbacks from the war. The story is an emotional rollercoaster. It's the sort of book that needs to be read all in one sitting to get the full effect. Not the best piece of Holocaust literature I've read, but you still take something away with you."},{"rating":"1","title":"control springs","review":"Before you purchase these springs check the measurments.

For example, Diamond's article on the origins of Tay-Sachs lays out the historical circumstances that led to the development of the disease (there is a similar article that describes the probable cause for high levels of salt retention in African-Americans). Also, Small's article on menstuation and its role in female health is an important article that makes the reader reconsider some of our own social norms. I should also point out that much of this volume deals with primatology and its correlation to human behavior. Many of these articles are quite informative and, again, force the reader to reconsider notions of \\"humanity.\\"The only negative is that those with a decent background in anthropology will probably be bored with some of the early articles, which act as a review of evolutionary basics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great album, plain and simple.","review":"All I have to say that there is not a single song on this CD I did not enjoy.

And I don't totally agree with Bad Religion like I used to, but, I gotta hand it to them, they definitely churned out another great album and I love the songs. \\"Beyond Electric Dreams\\", \\"Los Angeles is Burning\\", \\"Sinister Rouge\\", \\"God's Love\\" are all great. I say, you don't have to support the band view on the current issues and whatnot, but show the love for the band and their musical talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh...where is the Bad Religion I used to know??!","review":"This album is very pop. Some of the songs have music that resembles the new Green day album (yes that is an insult to BR). There are a good five songs on this disc but altogether the BR sound and spirit seems to have died years ago unfortunately. This seems to be the trend now...look at Pennywise!Even Greg's lyrics have been dumbed done. His vocab used to be incredible and was one of the things I always enjoyed in a BR album ...now it seems to have been dilluted.Have I mentioned there is a rap part in one of the songs? Yeah...pretty weird...If you want a good, more passionate Bad religion album get: SUFFER (one of the best punk albums of all time), the 80-85 discography, GENERATOR, AGAINST THE GRAIN, NO CONTROL, STRANGER THAN FICTION, or GRAY RACE."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST B.R.

Anything afterward is crap and should be ignored. It is sad to see a band I was once a fan of descend to such embarrassing lows. Avoid this at all costs. Reading all of these good reviews leads me to believe that most of these people wouldn't know a good punk record if it came up and kicked them in face. Here's a hint, this ain't a good one.If you're just now thinking about trying BR, get \\"How Could Hell Be Any Worse,\\" \\"Suffer,\\" and \\"No Control.\\" \\"Suffer\\" is the best.

There is definitely a blend of styles on this one, going from the punkier and simpler styles of suffer, no control, and against the grain and the complex and lighter sounds from the process of belief and a recipe for hate. Greg gaffin is sounding better than ever and there are plenty of tight harmonies (both vocally and instrumentally) and lots of catchy choruses with the familiar \\"aaaaaah's\\" in the background. Lyrically, they also improved greatly, turning this album into more of an outlet for socio-political commentary than anything they've done before, going from religion to war to the government and back again throughout. Some memorable songs are \\"all there is\\", \\"Los Angeles is burning\\", and \\"sinister rouge\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Keeping True Punk Alive","review":"The first time i heard this album, I was very skeptical about what i was gonna expect from hearing that first track, only to be swept away on how it lead to the next song, \\"Sinister Rouge\\", I knew that from this point there wasn't going to be a song that would dissapoint me or make me ask myself what the hell is this. Bad Religion knows exactly what punkers want and thats to keep making music that we all remember from back in the Suffer, Generator days. I give this one 5 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome as Usual, but a little too political","review":"First off let me say I have been a Huge Bad Religion Fan since the No Control days. They are without a doubt my all time favorite band. This album is really good but the political overtones get a little old. If I wanted to hear that I'd listen to some new NOFX. The songs themselves are fast and aggressive in classic BR fashion with Los Angeles is burning and Social Suicide being my favorites. So why the 4 star rating, seems like every other song is about the government, which I guess is what punk essentially about, but seems like it's over done on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so good....","review":"Well.... the album feels like a rush job. it's too political and the songs don't really do a lot to me. Every one is boring and shallow, EXCEPT \\"Beyond electric Dreams\\", if BR had cranked up more songs like this, it could have been something. Oh well, it has been 10 years since their last great album STRANGER THAN FICTION. Everything after that just isn't that good with the possible exception of The process of Belief.

But this one ruined that again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Book...Inspiring!","review":"I LOVE this book because I agree with the author that it is very important to listen to what children have to say, especially about how they feel concerning 9/11. These children are our future leaders! This book is like getting 2 books in 1...it has a time outline of the 9/11 events and an \\"overview\\" of the 9/11 situation AND the children's work.

Now, not only can I transfer files across faster, but the access is actually fast enough to work off of live. My only complaint is the complaint that every else has... it doesn't stay in the ExpressCard slot securely.

This book has given me much of the logic that I inherently believed about Capitalism. You know how you already know something, but you don't have the argument down to answer the questions that people like to use to trip you up? This book provides you the foundation about Capitalism to answer it's critics. Having the facts to backup my beliefs, the book inspired me to start my blog, [...], where I defend Capitalism daily.Although Capitalism doesn't seem to have it's defenders on the political front, Robert unabashedly defends it in his book.

One example is the ValuJet crash of 1996, when he blamed the airline systematic disregard for safety, when it has been determined the cause was not the airline's fault but a freight company that label some cargo wrong which should have been on the plane. The biggest revision of history, is the Triangle Fire that caused 146 sweatshop workers to die, and he pins the blame on the workers, it that if they took less pay, the company could have spend more on safety. In Robert Murphy world the big companies will always do right, they won't pollute, they will pay workers a fair wage, so the companies need no regulation from government rules.

One thing I've learned is that books of instruction from people who are career coaches, as opposed to thoroughbred athletes, are simply the best. Bob Cluck, now a scout for the Montreal Expos and owner of the San Diego School of Baseball, has assembled a book that is superbly adapted to the needs of youth coaches and players. The content is in the public domain and it is correct. I particularly admire his advice on throwing the curveball. Baseball isn't rocket science; some authors make it appear to be so.

It contains many many tips from how to figure out your stance to how to repair your snowboard.

Unfortunatly, I spent a lot of time grounded, it didn't snow much in NJ or the Poconos, and I only got to go riding twice. Still, the improvement from reading this book was great.

However I cannot recommend this translation to any one. Any translation is only as uplifting as the consciousness of the translator, and Rodwell translates in the most negative terms.

Of her work, The Hunter's series is the best of the best. She has created a world of characters (werewolves, vampires, and witches!)that are not only well rounded but fascinating too. This is a book you can easily loose yourself in. I had to read it in one sitting. I couldn't put it down!Hunters: The Beginning contains the first two novels of this series. Declan and Tori's tale begins the series and introduces us to the world of The Hunters. Eli and Sarel's story is next and in it we get to re-visit Declan and Tori and meet new characters for the continuing series.These novels are steamy hot and super sexy but if you took out the sex scenes (and who would want to do that?) the stories stand alone. These romances are both tender and erotic. I loved it and I hope you do as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Free SF Reader","review":"Ok, this is porn.

I thought it was pretty good, even if the characters were a little under-developed. Hey - what do you expect from a novella? So I figured I'd start the series. This was awful. I couldn't finish it. There's a moderate thread of story between a whole lot of sex of all kinds - mild domination, anal, I gave it up when it looked like we were headed for a three-way.

Ok, I'm not a prude, and I like a book that has hot scenes on it, but usually I prefer my books to have a story and sex on it, but always leaning on a story that keeps you interested in the book. In this book I got the impression that the story wasn't important as soon as they were having sex. As I said, I like a book with a story and sex, not sex as a story.Sorry, but after reading the first story and beginning the second one, I couldn't keep reading because the second story on the book hinted to be exactly as the first one: all sex with some second or third thought to an idea of a story that should keep all the sex tied up. I mean, that had to have all the story tied up. This book felt very much as a porn movie: after some time it all seems the same. Not a keeper for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read.","review":"I've gotten to the point where reading the sex is no longer necessary to me, I sometimes gloss over it.

If you've beaten all the Resident Evils and have a lot of patience to wait for the loads, this may be a fun diversion but don't expect it to \\"wow\\" you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good.","review":"Found the book quite helpful in finding the Greek word as it exists in the original text and tracing the word back to the original form whether it be a verb or noun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mounce's Analytical Lexicon","review":"This provides all the information you need to parse words in Greek translation assignments.

This lexicon lists every form found in the New Testament in alphabetical order and gives you the lexical form of the word just in case you haven't memorized it. The layout is amazingly simple to use.

Some of the components that reportedly had troubles I've had awful experiences with trying to pair with any number of other devices in the past, and felt the VKB probably wasn't really the problem. After purchase, I was able to pair my VKB to both my smart phone and Tablet PC quickly and without any issues at all. As mentioned in another review here, it's important to enter your pin number on the pairing device first, (PC, PDA, phone, etc.), with the enter key, and then enter it into the VKB next followed by the VKB's enter key. -Very nice item, construction and design quality seems very good, will definitely turn heads."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting story, excellent characters","review":"This story about two friends who literally bleed the life out of another acquaintance for the location of a family fortune kept me very interested and guessing until the end. Accusations, fabrications and confessions fly between the characters while the audience is told in flashback what truly happened between four so-called friends one night in Pateman's wood. Patrick Stewart's character has the unhappy duty of finding out who double-crossed him and killed his son. The trouble is that he has multiple suspects but only one bullet.I wanted to see this film because I am a fan of both Patrick Stewart and Marc Warren, the latter of whom gives a stand-out performance as Vic, the brains of the operation. Warren's portrayal alone is one reason to see this movie. I hope to see more from this talented actor in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too bad it's only on VHS","review":"I didn't see the beginning of this film on cable, but loved what I saw of it. I must have seen more than half. It's worth viewing if you are a fan of any of the actors in it. Yes, it is wordy but i think it fits the characters and the story. Usually when i watch a film i can figure out the 3-4 possibilities of how the character will respond or what direction the film will go. This flick was very unpredictable. I think that in itself makes it worth watching. Have fun."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic Smif N Wessun","review":"For any Boot Camp fan and Smif N Wessun Fan this is a must have for your collection.

Okay, it has a great premise, but that's IT. Seriously, there's hardly ANY character development, and the details aren't very, well, detailed. Okay, I'm only 15, but I've read enough books to know what's good, and what's CRAPPY. When I first read the summary of this book, I thought it would be great. But no, it was not.

I just \\"knew\\" it was going to be great. What a sore disappointment! This book has none of the subleties of \\"Elizabeth\\", little of Miles' artistic prose, and none of the characters drawn so tightly they hum... It seemed like an earlier work of an author who went on to become great, which is perhaps what this is. As historical fiction goes, I've probably read worse, and for those seeking a non-challenging, historical romance they would probably like it well enough. But if you're looking for a \\"Mists of Avalon\\" quality retelling of Tristan and Isolde, you'll want to look elsewhere. So sad... <sniff!>"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"This is the first Rosalind Miles book I have read, and I am not moved to read another.

I actually got it from my local library and man, am I glad I did. This book is horrible. It is so incredibly predictable and unromantic, I had to force myself to finish it. I kept thinking, maybe it'll get better, maybe it'll get better. Nope, didn't get better. I was very disappointed in its two-dimensional characters and the narrative in general. Its written in a very amateur-ish way, giving little insight and even less story.The entire book is about sex, which isn't necessary a bad thing, its just done in a very cliche way. I think the words \\"full bosom\\" were on every single page. This wasn't a medieval legend, it was a very, very bad romance novel.Please steer clear."},{"rating":"1","title":"still waiting","review":"I ordered this book some time ago- I'm still waiting!

So far, I am very dissatisfied!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Isolde review","review":"I have never before had the displeasure to read a work by an author who uses free association adjectives which are disconcerted and unrelated to the noun: i.e. absurdly inappropriate. The book is flat and uninteresting, a poor excuse for a novel about legendary characters. The story deviates from Morte De Arthur considerably and does not meet the reality test of, Is this story believable? Its not. On describing the battle to the death with Marhaus, the author confides Tristan is sexually aroused by the thought of battle to the death. How believable is that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Moronic","review":"Okay, this story throws in a bunch of Goddess/feminist/mother-rite stuff, but the main female character is nothing more than a stupid girl. To sum up the entire series, she does not care about the land she is ruler of at all. She abandons the land practically and I really can't blame some of the characters for trying to overthrow her. The only way Miles can make any of her female characters seem powerful is to make the men weakminded and half retarded. Tristan is a pansy who happens to be good with a sword. And while Tristan and Isolde is supposed to be set in the dark ages, Miles makes Isolde disgustingly wealthy as far as jewels go. She also makes all Christians look like vindictive zealots. Not to mention that although she is so obsessed with the mother rite and plus she is a princess/queen, she will not stand up to her husband. Don't waste your money on this book about a selfish, stupid young woman who is in love with an equally stupid guy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done","review":"This is the first of the Roslind Miles Tristan and Isolde trilogy. I have read other versions of this legend, and Miles' version is one of the best. She takes her time with the story and attends to the details that enrich it. I am more than ready to read the rest of this trilogy.I especially like the maps and glossary that are included with the novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the read","review":"I bought this book thinking it'd keep me busy for a week or so and it turns out I finished it in 2 days - I just didn't want to put it down!

She brings both excitment and romance into her writing, and she's not too slow nor to fast, she's exactly perfect. Isolde is a great charactor but I have to give the best charactor award to Tristian, he's really somthing, then the mother is a snoby, whinning, attenion w**** but she is described really well.

This is definatly a book not worth missing."},{"rating":"1","title":"If forced to choose between this book & a visit to the gynecologist -- head for the stirrups.","review":"Here's the thing -- I wanted to learn the story of Isolde and that is why I picked up this book in the first place. I have read one other Miles book (I, Elizabeth) and that wasn't very impressive but I thought I'd give Isolde a try. It was painful! Miles chronically uses flamboyant and overstated language which just feels silly. Her characters are very poorly developed. Also, the author has a strange habit of often not setting up scenes which is resultingly jolting -- leaves the reader thinking, 'Wait! Where the heck did that come from?' After reading this book, I couldn't decide if I was more annoyed with the author for writing like this or with her editors for publishing such weak, unskilled writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the Intellectual","review":"This is a good book for fantasy or romance readers. Have you ever seen The Ten Commandments with Charlton Heston? This novel has lots of interactions reminiscent of that movie...muscular, sweaty single dimensional men grabbing women by the shoulders and booming dialogue into their faces....beautiful, single-dimensional women melting in their arms...

My daughter literally lost one of the ships just opening the game.The game is not cheaply made, and, as stated above, the configuration is altered. That's okay. You do have to keep track of your guesses on a separate sheet of paper, which limits where you can play the game. For example, it may be hard to use in a moving car.Overall, I like the game.

It felt like it existed for the sake of those making it, not for the audience. So much of the plot advanced illogically. I can tolerate violence in movies.

There is a great deal of potential to this film but it apparently was not in the hands of the right director/writer to achieve what it should have been. The idea of a crazed clown was amusing but there is such little character development and a total lack of emotional depth that I did not care what happened to the character. The arc of the story is poorly handled and contrived. The contrast of Spain's history under Franco and the plot had no impact or correlation.

Every character in this movie sucks and is so unlikable I started to not like myself even. For 1/3 of the movie the fat loser clown runs around naked in the woods, so enjoy tasting your own vomit. The movie starts out promising then gets progressively worse until you're too deep in to just shut it off, but trust me... shut if off at your first inclining (you won't regret it).It has an option of watch in an English dubbed version, and has English subtitles so that's nice at least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Assylum","review":"Slow, predictable, boring.

I was not only reliving the author's life but I was remembering a great number of things from my past that I had completely forgotten about. Even though it may not have been the exact same setting it still triggered past events that have been lying dormant in my head for a very long time.

They have wrapped that gift with songs and arrangements that alternately imitate Christina Aguilera, Mariah Carey, Kelly Clarkson and, when multitracked, like Beyonce with her Destiny's Child girls. Only on \\"Better Off Alone\\" do we get something resembling Katharine being herself. If you like all those other artists you will probably enjoy this.She sounds great throughout the CD and the sound quality is excellent but they are trying to shove her into an urban soul pop pigeonhole that is already filled with others doing the same thing.

You deserve better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great contemporary Top 40 album","review":"If you enjoy the current flavor of Top 40/pop music then you will enjoy every song on this album.A blend of groovy dance numbers, catchy mid-tempo ballads, and touching power ballads, there is something for everybody.There is no reinventing the wheel here but the overall vibe is that of a fun time at a backyard summer BBQ. I love summer and I love BBQ, and I love this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a Wonderful Debut!!","review":"I have to admit that I loved Kat last year and really wanted her to win. However, listening to her wonderful debut cd, I'm kinda glad that she didn't. I think coming in 2nd gave her a little more freedom to make the kind of record that she wanted to make and hence brought out her true talent and personality. Her voice is so pure and raw that I just keep repeating such songs as \\"Home\\" and \\"Over It\\"...although her voice is phenomenal on all 12 tracks and really displays her vocal range on such faster hits like \\"Open Toes\\" & \\"Not Ur Girl\\". My favorites include: Home, Over It, Love Story, & Neglected - but all of them are catchy!

Be warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad workmanship.","review":"Item received on time in a damaged box. The hole punch was not damaged in transit but the workmanship is very bad. Quality control is non existent. Everything is hard to adjust and it doesn't cut clean holes. The way it was packaged I got the impression it had been returned once before which is what I should have done. The only reason I didn't is because I needed the 11/32\\" holes which is hard to find in a 3-hole punch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disgusting pile of junk","review":"Bought this 3-hole punch because of the difficult-to-find 11/32 hole size.Frankly, I should have paid attention to the other reviewers opinion!This contraption is a pile of trash.

It was a series from the mid-70s that I never got hooked on until later and, to be fully appreciated, it must be savoured from the beginning, particularly after Marv Wolfman takes over scripting early on. It is one long storyline with little or no superheroic elements and, therefore, never got the attention it deserved, much like as happened also to Master of Kung Fu, and now seems to get attention mainly for introducing the character of Blade (a nice character but my personal favourite is Hannibal King, who does not appear until the final issue of this volume). Gene Colan's pencils have never been put to better use than in the moody stories of Wolfman and the black and white format of the Marvels Essentials is finally not a drawback to enjoying the series. Tomb of Dracula is well served by this kind of treatment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprise Ending","review":"Well I skipped reading Downstairs, Upstairs, because I knew that I wouldn't miss much, and I was right. Basically Vanessa finally takes action, but I still can't bring myself to completly like the character. Sarah is completly boring, and I also don't like this character. The Max and Liz storyline was interesting to a degree, and I was a little surprised what Liz did, although I think that the author kind of cheated the readers by doing this. I find the Liz and Max storyline unbelievable. How many women get a chance to meet an earl and fall in love with him? I hope that the SVU series comes back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deborah Harry in the buff, little other appeal","review":"This book is in a certain demand because a young, mousy-brown-haired Debbie Harry-later to be the singer for the rock group Blondie-is shown in her skyclad, young (24-25) splendor. Other than that, it's simply a book on female nude art-photography modeling of which many appeared in the 1965-1980 timeframe.Harry, bluntly, is no Bardot or Monroe in 'figure impact'-she's pretty boyish,in all honesty. But in Europe and other non-US rock markets, she's as big a star as Mick Jagger or Prince, so this book does have a certain value especially in those markets.There are a lot of how-to texts on posing nude female models out there and this one has no particular advantage over current titles. If it's classic nudes you want to study, viewing the work of true masters like Bunny Yeager (particularly with Bettie Page) or Bert Stern (nude essayist of Monroe) will probably be more useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning!!!!

I want reality, and being a man who has some experience in this area, I know this is not.

They do provide an overseas phone number that they charge per/min. to use to contact them. Basically you get the shaft from this game producer - they have decided to make it impossible to get Tech help without paying more than you did for the game...sigh.And ofcourse retailers in the USA all have a lovely return policy on opened goods because they think we are pirating stuff.

Hopefully it's not going to remain a pile of junk, because the online demo and the small parts of the game I've been able to play seemed really fun.

After the first night of gaming, two ships became cracked while adding boosters and since then, two more ships have broken booster slots (and that's AFTER we became more cautious about when using them).

The basic game play is simple and summarized on a small card for every player, which is great for novices.Based on months of playing, a word of caution: be gentle with adding boosters to the ship - the little plastic pieces that hold the boosters can break if you are too rough. This is my only gripe, really.Otherwise: I love it and recommend it to every board game fanatic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pop goes the Tin Man!","review":"A sepia tornado hurls Dorothy's house out at you.

The book even creeks as Dorothy renders aid to the Tin Man. 11 pop-outs (6 of them are hidden in the side flaps) makes the reader part of the movie while turning the moving pages and lifting the flaps to discover all the familiar things we've grown to love. Just imagine melting the Wicked Witch at your will with only your fingertips. And if that's not enough, pop the CD out of it's pocket and into your player and listen to Judy Garland sing \\"Somewhere Over The Rainbow\\".

I was very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Idea, Pathetic Execution","review":"I thought this was a great idea, since my son loves books and pointing to things in them. However it is a flimsily made piece of junk that never works. It comes with 3 books and it only ever senses one of them. And by sensing I mean it tell you the title when you open the reader, but it never actually does anything beyond that. Otherwise it doesn't do anything except give you a huge spiel about what a great toy it is when you press the buttons while it is closed. It also constantly says \\"The batteries are low and need to be replaced\\" even with brand new fresh batteries (3 different sets). Despite the battery message the unit is happy to give the spiel about how great it is endlessly without ever reading a book. Don't waste your money on this. If your child likes interactive books try and find the cloth books by Softplay that have something for them to do on every page and play sounds when a button is pushed. They work reliably and my son loves them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Idea, Bad Product","review":"I purchased this (and all the extra books) for my daughters 1st birthday.

The books fell out easily and the reading unit itself would come apart at the \\"hinge\\". We tried changing the batteries and that didn't help, so after lots of frustration we went back to the store and exchanged it. It worked better at first, but now we are having the same problems we had before. I gave up. My daughter is almost 3 now and still loves books.

First time we used it was in the car so I thought that the bouncing was the problem. NOPE. At home I tried to use it by myself.

But for the student paying the bill, it's just another over-priced, poorly-edited excuse for generating classroom revenue. The topical outline seems to be undecided, and the depth wanders from thin to bottomless. Be prepared to hunt the entire collage for specific references. The accompanying 34 page pamphlet (disguised as a lab manual) provides deliberate overly-simplified confusion, and is often completely ignorant of the textbook. The eActivities on the CD are helpful, like other Cisco instructional aids. But I am surprised that Cisco would permit their brand name on the package. The printed material is constantly aggravating. If you have to buy it (and you know you do) get it as cheap as possible. Good luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very cheap product - not durable","review":"I used this product for about a month and it came apart. I reassembled it, but then the fuse blew.

The author maps his arguments in an outline format, in the hope of capturing his audience. Though, this outline format is way of organizing ideas within different topics, it lacks the extensive explanation and cross-referrences a reader needs. Real-life examples are out of the question, since the author neither give them nor explain them fully. In addition, to the lack of explanations, the author speaks as if he has intelligence. It is clearly obvious that he knows nothing about keeping his audience awake.

Sometimes his left hand climbs and descends in wonderful counterpoint against the melody-playing right hand, while at other times the left hand plays the melody and the right hand goes up an octave to play ripples and rolls above the tune.Fats' style is eminently suited to the piano roll medium, with its potential for \\"third hand\\" embellishments and its rhythmic steadfastness.

At a women writer's retreat in the Pacific Northwest, she unhappily finds herself sharing a cabin with Noel, and accomplished psychologist and writer whose expertise lies in sexual behavior and intimacy issues. The constant push-pull dynamics of two women, both scarred by love and a lifetime of overcoming obstacles, builds the type of sexual tension that grabs you by the heart and won't let go.I read the book in one day, although I wanted it to never end.

There was a lot to the story that Conn was forced to edit out of the movie to shorten the running time.

Claire's struggle to decide what exactly it is she wants in her life is interesting. Noel's reluctance to get involved with a \\"straight\\" woman is understandable.

For example, there is only a 1/4 page on dehydrating food, it tells you nothing other than you can buy nice dehydrators and to follow their instructions.

If you can find this book on clearence somewhere and not pay more than a couple bucks It would be worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too impractical, get a Boy Scout handbook instead","review":"Although it contains some common-sense information on food storage, much of this book is far too impractical for the average survivalist. For example, the article on making bread in case of an emergency explains the recipe for making bread but fails to explain HOW to mix those ingredients during a power failure. Kneading bread is work intensive and few modern urban dwellers have even a basic knowledge of the process. Most of the other recipes require some type of appliance to either mix or cook which eliminates most of them during a power outage like when you're living in a tent. A better buy for your money would be the Boy Scouts Handbook."},{"rating":"2","title":"some good stuff","review":"This book will give you a good place to start from.

There were things I did not even think about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the read, but not all-inclusive.","review":"There are many wonderful tips and ideas in this book. From common-sense logic, to in-depth reasoning, the author does well with providing a large amount of information and allowing an easy transition into the reader's needs. It is worth the read, as anyone should be able to find value in the information, but if you are looking to live off the grid or find everything you could ever need to know, this book is only a part of the collection you want. That's not a bad thing. The opposite, in fact. The subjects covered are covered well, and subjects outside the purview of this book are left alone.I would recommend this book, and enjoyed reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"If your looking for something basic then this will cover just about everything you can think of, but it's not a long term survival or self-sufficiency guide. The knowledge is well written and easy to put into practical use. If your looking for a guide on how to survive a Katrina type situation then this is it. I would recommend further reading beyond this single book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Food Storage Book","review":"Great book for anyone just starting longterm food storage, complete with charts you can fill out to get you started.

If you are totally new to the idea and have no clue how to organize yourself...this is your book. If you are already in to prepping, this isn't much help.

While it has a breadth of information useful for planning, what I really missed is a very detailed list of shelf-life for various foods.

If you are truly planning for an emergency, you'll need more than just this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have!!","review":"Absolutely love this book, It's going into my storage due to the amount of recipies it actually contains with dehydrated, storage food.

I can alter addresses as people move around and I can keep secret details secure with a password.

Johnson is a masterful series of 25 solo, duo, quartet, septet and octet tracks in chronological order from 1929 to 1949 with the high audio standard of ASV recordings. The collection begins with Johnson on piano and Edddie Dougherty on drums performing Carolina Shout. On other ensemble tracks Johnson is joined by musicians including Bessie Smith, Cootie Williams, Ethel Waters, Pee Wee Russell, Red Allen, Fats Waller, Dickey Wells, J.C. Higginbotham, Sid Calett, Vic Dickenson, Ben Webster, Sidney Bechet and others. The sound is very fine and one would need to purchase quite a number of hard to find recordings to gather all these tracks. All in all, the greatest overview of Johnson's solo and small group work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good buy for the Palm","review":"I got the version of this keyboard that you can use for your Palm m100 series, and I was very unhappy with it.

One dude complained his car kept turning over lol ...uh...yeah its a rally game, if you cant drive it will turn over! The weight-speed-centrifugal force-physics was also very advanced.

Bottom line: Great game, hard to put down the controller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good game at all","review":"This is not a good driving game at all. It's graphics are so bad. It's controls are hard to use. It's so hard to turn in every car even the one with best turning. It's not as good as Driver. That's a good driving game. Driver isn't a racing game, but it's so much better than Rally Cross. At least in Driver you have good graphics and easy to use controls. If you disagree than buy it.

The game pages are very basic and repetitious (e.g., the same picture is uncovered over and over; games repeat themselves which kids might quickly find boring).Even on our PC we found the game to run fairly slow.

While it is up to you as to whether this is a valid idea, the book itself is quite good.In essence, it is a book of uplifting and inspirational quotations and if you meditate or contemplate on the random page that you turn to, much like the author suggests, I found it to be a motivational and sometimes peaceful or comforting tome. There are many passages randomly placed on the pages in this book and if it fails to help you in some way, then the fault may lie in the expectations of the reader and not the book itself.I highly recommend this book for its wonderful content and its unfailing way of inspiring me even when I'm not feeling particularly good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eloquent Nonsense","review":"In the beginning of this book the author gives this advice,\\"Hold a problem in your mind and open this book to any page and there will be your answer.\\"Talk about nonsense.She goes on to say,\\"How To Use This GuideYou have a problem or need guidance to help you make a decision. Picture it clearly in your mind; meditate on it so that the mind gradually subsides into stillness.

The country album snuck in under the radar but if you listen to it you will become addicted to the songs and effort and quality of the performance of the material. I highly recommend it to anyone remotely interested in Elvis.

As a student that always needed to get things through the brain more than once for it to stick, I can thoroughly recommend this book. It is well written, handles the mathematical treatments with enough detail to be easy to follow (but it does assume a fairly strong undergraduate mathematical background).

Sadly, the robe is so thin as to be see-through and the sleeves look nothing like those displayed in the image, clinging to my arms and wrists as though they were a second-skin. Apparently this item was designed for anorexic twelve year-olds, because the whole thing was nearly skin-tight and hung to about knee-height on my 5' 10\\" frame. Good for a child (provided that child doesn't stand in front of a light, revealing everything they're wearing underneath) but not for an adult.Additionally: I realize this is just nitpicking, but the packaging said it was part of their \\"Biblical Times\\" line.

With the exception of one thin woman, they were too small. The packaging says that these will fit men with up to a 44\\" chest. My brother found it too tight to move comfortably, and he's only a 38. The fabric stretches a good deal, so you could squeeze a larger man into the costume, but he will look more like an overstuffed sausage than a medieval monk.

A rich, beautiful lesbian lives a scandalous life filled with excitement, traveling around the world, meeting lots of famous people, and making love to dozens of willing female partners. Imagine a Howard Stern sex epic with a sumptuous budget and a Merchant Ivoery feel!Kay Summerscale does a very professional job as a biographer. Unfortunately, the story is not that exciting. Yes, Joe Carstairs was a rich lesbian, and a rebel, but she was not in any sense a \\"fun\\" person. She was apparently some kind of borderline schizophrenic. All she could do to act \\"manly\\" was to throw screaming tantrums, smoke, spit and swear. Not an attractive personality. The whole thing with carrying the little doll around for 60 years comes across as sick, not funny or charming.Read the book for the sumptuous settings and try to imagine someone glamorous, like Gloria Holden (from the lesbian classic DRACULA'S DAUGHTER)having the same adventures, but in a fun way."},{"rating":"2","title":"good for the price","review":"I bought this bag for my dad for father's day.

In most cases it has proven to work for Mr. Benson, on this project...It's alright...A FEW Stand Out Tracks like: \\"C-Smooth\\", The #62 Billboard Charting Single \\"Standing Together\\", \\"Poquito Spanish, Poquito Funk\\". Listeners of New Wave Jazz will love it! Die-Hard Jazz Fans will NOT be moved, The one's who got into him during the early Warner Brothers Records years will be stuck in the middle.

Track 4, \\"C-Groove\\" was the only cut I had heard before I purchased the cd, but track 1,5, and 7 are by far my favorites, then comes track 9, 2, 3, 8,...well, the entire cd is great.

Even if you weren't a fan of the genre, you would be after reading this. It is an excellent psychological mystery even though it has very little of the breath-taking action characteristic of most mysteries. It pulls you into the plot gradually until you finally can't put it down. It all starts with a mysterious photo of what appears to be a man attempting to shoot another man that is found by our detective, James Flint, in one of his library books. From here we are taken on a journey to exonorate an innocent man and to identify a killer."},{"rating":"2","title":"it was good, but just the same old thing","review":"this was a good, easy to read and fun, but it was pretty much like the rest of the series: main character has a problem, goes to good magician, then ends up in a full fledged adventure. it would be nice if one of the characters figured out wait to do without the good magician. over all, the plot was ok, considering the fact that it is the same old stuff, but i have gotten used to that. the only thing that i didn't like about this novel, was that it was getting kind of ridiculus with all the trips to ida's moon. i kept on loosing track of where the characters were, where they came from, and what they were trying to accomplish. the ending was good, but predictable. and it was a happy ending, and i like those."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I've read all of the prior Xanth novels and enjoyed them all, but the latest, Faun and Games, was definitely a disappiontment. Completely overrun with puns, I lost most of the storyline because of the jokes that became tiresome after the first few chapters. I barely got through the novel. I love the Xanth series, but Faun and Games is by far the worst of them all. A journey on the world of Ptero, where everything that has and ever will be resides, was a great idea, but I found this novel to be boring. I hope that the next installment of the Xanth series will be a little more readable, and the puns and adult conspiracy junk will be brought down a notch."},{"rating":"1","title":"Committed Xanth-heads only!","review":"This book sucks. Sorry but that's the way it is. Anthony continues to pen his fascination with young females' anatomy and tries to squeeze increasingly lame puns into a once-intriguing world. The characters have no depth and I was unable to find myself caring about any of them as I did for Bink, Trent, and the other original cast.

I gotta say, here was a setting with a fair amount of potential. Exploring Ptero had so much possibility. A world of might-bes. Unfortunately, the author seems to have just exploited it as a means to including as many of his readers Xanthine suggestions as he could, designing a loose plot around this catalogue. Please try harder Piers I know you can do better."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best Xanth books yet!!!","review":"This book was so magical.

Is this good or bad? After 20 books, a new setting is most welcome, and Ptero, the land of might-bes, approprietly fills the requirements. Forrest Faun and the well known Night Mare, Imbrium, travel to Ptero, then Pyramid, the Torus, and almost to Cone. It just so happens that ALL of these are moons orbiting Princess Ida's head. After a while it does get a bit repetative, and you begin to agree with Forrest Faun, \\"We have to go to ANOTHER moon?\\" Aside from Anthony's parade of moons, the book is wonderful, exciting and provides a new perspective of the Faun and Nymph society."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice idea, poor execution","review":"The instructions for each of the initial poses are very poor - for someone who has never done yoga it is more confusing than helpful.

The authors do a fairly good round-up of how men have been consistently portrayed as bumbling idiots in advertising, and how that isn't really flying that well with male consumers. (Wow, what a surprise!) Things are indeed changing. However, they drop the ball when they attempt to come up with the hip definition of the \\"new male,\\" what they call the ubersexual. They spend only a paltry few pages on what they believe this new trend actually is, and clearly show they are out to lunch on the topic. Advice for the authors: talk to real men who don't work on Madison Avenue, and stop relying on yesterday's market surveys. Is this why advertisers still don't get it when it comes to men ages 18-34? Yes."},{"rating":"1","title":"The lack of insight is startling","review":"I worked with two of the authors at their former ad agency, Euro RSCG.

And what purpose does it have? This book, just like the whole idea of creating new words to define men such as \\"meterosexual\\" and \\"ubersexual\\", is pointless and a lame attempt for somebody to get money and coin a silly name that won't do much of anything to how men look at themselves in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"Future of Men looks bleak, indeed.","review":"This has to be the most disappointing book of its type. The authors seem to miss the point on men (18-34) all together & make some rather conflated claims. A year later & still no real sign of the Ubersexual, he doesn't exist, and much like Ms Salzman's study of the youth market - it seems she is well out of her reach here, not understanding in a sound & solid way what changes are actually occurring in the world today.Further to this, as someone working in the interactive media realms, and advertising in a much more effective way to a key demographic the authors think they are defining - I agree with the Spotlight reviewer - if you are buying this as an aid, you & your agency are in trouble, if you are buying it to see the confabulated claims of \\"so-called\\" Populizer (sic - see her website) of Buzzwords and how traditional Madison Avenue misses the mark, unless you are buying it used at $1.13 - you're getting ripped off."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid Like the Plague","review":"Self-serving, badly written tome by a blowhard idiot.

For one thing, the one liner choruses can really get on your nerves sometimes, and a few of the lyrics weren't as good as I thought they would be.On the good sight, the aggression and melody in the songs are really nice and makes me happy.

The three 'interviewees' consistently called the band \\"The Arctic Monkeys\\" when we all know there's no \\"The\\" in front of their name and no original songs were even played. I'm sure this is because Arctic Monkeys would never agree to have their songs or reputation harmed by such nonsense.

Looking at other reviews here, I can understand some of the frustration with the film transfers...but come on people...there are THREE transfers here! How many deluxe DVDs even give you two? And aside from the untranslated or subtitled interview, the extras are fine, especially the interview with FX man Cleve Hall.If you've never seen this, it's worth the extra loot (now that it's out of print) as few slasher films ever reached this level of mayhem, especially the finale that still manages to shock and raise goosebumps.

It's a great bag to sling over your shoulder and forget. The inside pocket was big enough to hold several books, pamphlets, brochures, and fruit. We were also able to fit two rolled up jackets inside when the weather got warm enough to where it wasn't necessary to wear them. We also took it on a bike ride and it was perfect for that. Didn't feel over encumbered or out of balance.The bag is very comfortable and while it does lack a rigid or padded back piece I really never noticed that it wasn't there. You really can't beat the price and what you get is worth every penny.The only problem with the bag is that the velcro patch on the cell phone holder is coming up a little bit after multiple uses. Going to use a thread and needle to fix it up no problem though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but dirty","review":"The bags is as advertised. Not bad at all, however as people mentioned it smells like tires. I figured it couldn't be that bad... I was wrong.

I don't like backpacks so I liked the idea of this one strap sack. I am thankful I purchased three different bags for my trip because this was cheaply made. I guess you get what you pay for, but for about $15-20 more I bought a bag from ebags.com made by Fui that was $100 nicer than this bag. It is basically one pocket. The little zipper pocket on the face is small and useless - made carry a little bit of money in it and make it obvious to everyone behind you that you have money in it.

I ordered this book and found it had very good information on where to find jobs, how to write a resume, and how to answer possible interview questions. I would say the resume part was the most useful so far, as few resume books have examples of teacher resumes. From the examples provided I was able to construct a more condensed resume from the three-page one I previously had.However, the jury is out in so far as whether I will be able to obtain employment in the field even with this advice. The reason I did not give this book five stars is that there was not a whole lot of information for those people who are changing careers in mid-life.

This book was the least helpful in my teaching job search. Yes, it talks about where to look for jobs, but I knew that already! Yes, it gives you sample resumes and cover letters, so what?

Jaunty and upbeat with a great fuzz drenched solo in the bridge. The rest of this is a let down. Gram has been sanctified since his early death, but there's nothing to really justify his reputation. The tunes are usually the same tempo, crawling along at a snail's pace.Further, Parsons' vocals are very weak compared with country greats like George Jones. Lastly, the Burritos are responsible for a great range of ills since their debut i.e. influencing such insipid acts as the Eagles to Wilco.The concept of the Burritos was defenitely interesting as mentioned earlier- hallucinatory country music. Junior Brown's \\"Sugarfoot Rag\\" fills that need.The Burritos are hippy country, something for those who can't take their Merle Travis or Roy Acuff straight."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flying Burrito Bros 69 - 71","review":"A time capsule - Some of it is average - not up to Eagles standards, but there are some real gems here as well, which compete strongly with Eagles etc. Not quite as formed as Poco, but from the same general melting pot of musical development.If youre interested in the development of Americana from that period - it's a must - a real ingredient."},{"rating":"1","title":"Like a Mustache on the Mona Lisa","review":"Don't get me wrong -- I love the FBB and \\"The Gilded Palace of Sin\\" is probably my favorite album of all time, but the sound on this compilation is absolutely horrid. I can only hope that the hack who was in charge of the remastering has a trial pending --if so, I'll gladly be a witness for the prosecution. Granted, these songs were never lushly produced in the first place (and that's always been part of their weird, otherwordly charm), but the sound on this release has been so artlessly altered that the feel of the original recordings is simply no longer present. On speakers it's not quite as noticable, but on headphones it's a nauseating nightmare. Do yourself a favor and stick with your original vinyl copies of these tunes and avoid this disgusting, mutant beast like the plague.

As for myself, I only played the recording once and quickly discarded it. His playing is the most flat and mechanical I have ever heard. If you want intellectual and contrapuntal power tinged with eccentric romanticism, listen to Gould. If you want a melodic performance, more typical of classical music, listen to Schiff. If you want someone who is elegant and exceedingly politely, listen to Perahia. If you want a more spritely recording, try Angela Hewitt... etc...If you're new to Bach and classical music, I would recommend either Perahia or Hewitt. If you're feeling gutsy, try Gould. He is my favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid !","review":"This record is plainly irritating. Martins probably has some talent as the record company let him record this massive set of Bach keyboard works, but it does not show on this compilation. His indistinct and strange phrazing playing makes me nervous. I don't get what he is trying to do. I'd advice you to go with other performers, such as Janda (straightforward), Gould (wow! ), Schiff (elegance), Richter (conformant) or Jarrett (laidback)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?

It seems that women read more empathically, are better able to identify with characters' feelings, and are more able to experience rage at the injustices inherent in a fictional work; males, on the other hand, seem to desire books that contain violence, explicit sexism, and patriarchal systems of networks which exclude women from power structures.

And part of the reason I chose this model was because it takes video, but if I take a 2 minute video with a new battery, it drains the battery to the point that I can't take another picture. I am sending it in to be repaired, but the service tech from India said that if there is \\"any evidence of damage\\" my warranty is void. I told him that the battery cover is cracked from constantly opening and closing it, but that the camera has never been dropped and lives in a camera case. When I asked if I should be concerned that they might void the warranty because of the cracked battery door he only repeated the threat about damage evidence. Now I'm paranoid that they won't uphold the warranty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blurry Pictures, bad battery management","review":"This is probably the worst camera I have had or seen. The picture quality is horrible, most of picture I shot would have the blurriness indicator (red palm); it wasnt just the picture would be blur, but i would be all dark.

The only problem I've had has been with cleaning my more intricate jewelry. I don't fault the product for this, I'm just writing it in my review to let other consumers know that if they're looking for a product to clean very detailed stuff, they might have better luck with a cleaner that allows them to fully immerse their pieces.

Not only does she weave an amazing tale that keeps you guessing and caring until the last page, but she also does it in language that is lyrical and a pleasure to read. I find that the first few pages, I'm scratching my head and wondering what is going on. However, in no time, I'm swept up in another story that has more twists, turns and surprises than the best detective novel. At the end of this book, I slowed my reading to a crawl and was openly crying by the last sentence. So far, I've read three of her books and have purchased all the rest. I look forward to even more books from her in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic choice for a bookclub!","review":"This novel has definately made my list of new favorites. A fantastic piece of writing, the author's got a uncanny ability to evoke emotion like few I have ever read. If you have ever been deep in the throws of love, or had your heart broken, Ms. O'Farrell's writing will touch you deeply. This is not a happy story, but it is a superb one and ultimately redeeming on many levels. Books this good are rare, you will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"haunting","review":"what a sad book, it was nearly impossible to read about Alice grieving for John.

Maggie O'Farrell is an incredible writer who is able to capture human emotion in a magnificent and poignant manner. What I really liked about this book is the way in which O'Farrell dealt with complex issues without over dramatizing them. The book packs a soft punch of wisdom regarding love, betrayal, grief and forgiveness"},{"rating":"2","title":"Depressing","review":"After you'd gone, is not a book to read if you are looking for a feel good book. I really enjoyed the way that the author wrote this book. Even though she skipped from character to character it was very easy to follow. This book is a tear jerker. The only thing I did not truly care for in the book was the ending. I think the ending should have had more to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Would highly recommend this British Fiction","review":"This was a wonderful book. I am thankful that I took notes throughout because the story lines switch back & forth from past to present so keep that in mind. The notes were helpful to me but may not be necessary for the more experienced reader.It was a beautiful story of love, family secrets, and secrets revealed. I thought the characters were developed well.The book included a side story that Dr. Coleman had custody of daughter Melanie & his wife lived with his best friend. Didn't think this had anything to do with the story however. The ending could have been developed a bit more. I felt it left me hanging somehow. Other than that, I thoroughly enjoyed the book & look forward to future books by this talented author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it","review":"I use this headset for skype and to listen to music from my laptop.

I played this one back around the time when I first got a Playstation. The good thing about it is the fact that four characters fight at once, regardless of whether or not you have four human players. The CPU controls the other 3 characters. If you're fortunate enough to have a multitap then you're in for some real fun. I played this game with 3 of my friends and enjoyed it a lot.I recommend this if you're in for some classic co-op superhero fighting. Also I recommend this ONLY if you have more than one person to play with you. It gets boring to quickly if you have to play it alone. I wish I would have bought this game when I had the chance but now I can't find it anywhere. Oh well..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uneven sound","review":"During the first seven minutes of the video the amplitude of the sound was VERY uneven making enjoyment of the film hard to achieve.The story itself is timely and much needed in today's society and we would have enjoyed it much better if the sound was consistant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story . . . same as the book/talk","review":"I read the book and listened to the audio file of the talk by the same title. This is a wonderful story of accepting and reaching out to those who are different, and how God has a plan for EVERYONE.What I did not realize was that this video is the same as the talk I heard through Focus on the Family. As it came on film, I thought it was an actual movie. In the book there are pictures of the cast that was involved in the filming, so I thought it was a movie recounting what was told in the talk/book. This is NOT the case. The movie is actually Mike Adkins on a stage telling exactly the same thing that is on the audio version, but you see him and his body language.Again, truly a great and inspiring story, but I probably wouldn't have bought the movie if I realized it was the same as what I already had listened to."},{"rating":"1","title":"confusing for the total beginner","review":"I would not recommend this book for beginners as the instructions are not the clearest. I crocheted as a child (my mother taught me)and decided to pick it up again recently. The photographs are rather pleasant, but again the instructions are not structured well. Especially in the \\"stitch library\\", I had to follow my instincts and do the work, then re-read the instructions and finally realized what she meant. A good book, but I can't see an average beginner who had never crocheted before starting off well with this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"SOOOOO not worth the money","review":"I have made 3 different projects in this book and have yet to be able to even get halfway through any of them without running into this book's biggest problem. The instructions (...)! They are worse than any I have ever come across. The author put at least one stitch in ever project that isn't explained in the book and at least one stitch that isn't explained until later in the book. Also, the pictures in the book look okay until you try to use them to make sure you have the stitch right (the one that you just had to improvise) and then the pictures are so blurry its impossible to tell what the final product is supposed to look like. The few good things about this book are that it does have cute projects (in theory...grr) and it goes over tuscan crochet and broomstick lace. Really, it be worth it to buy seperate books on those subjects than waste your money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconsistent","review":"This book has been in my library for many years. Every once in awhile, I take it out and try a new project; thinking that since my crochet skills have improved over the years, maybe this time I'll actually be able to complete one of the cute projects.But with each project I invariably hit a wall somewhere in the instructions.Thanks to many of the reviews here, I've finally realized that the problem is not me.It's a shame because when the instructions are good, they are very good. For instance, the instructions about how to crochet using a chart were clear and excellent.The inconsistencies in the quality of instruction are scattered through out the entire book, and I have never been able to complete any of the projects correctly.They wind up having wonky ad lib areas or they were never finished at all.This time, I will not be putting this book back on the shelf in my library.I'm replacing it with \\"The Complete Photo Guide to Crochet.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Good basic crochet book","review":"I had seen this book at my local library and decided to buy when I found it a inexpensive used version.

I worked at the Wichita Eagle during much of the time that David writes about. I found his book to be interesting and challenging. I don't pretend to be half the intellect that David is, so I feel out of my element here. David's take on depression, emphasis on career and self-absorption are on target for the most part. The book quotes many philsophers who I've never studied, but David consistently puts the thoughts and works of others in the proper context. In fact, he did it so well that my appetite has been whetted.

The more genuine but less likely possibility is that he remains hopeless at book's end.

Plus, \\"Modern World\\" rocks out a lot more than \\"All Mod Cons\\" (which is also a great album). True, at the time, this LP wasn't too well received- it was recorded and released only MONTHS after their debut. It was thought to suffer from \\"second album shortage\\"- a common problem among late 70s punk bands. (The same was said for the follow ups of the Damned, the Dead Boys and Slaughter & the Dogs- all great albums today.)

It's the exact same as the Decade version. The liner notes are filled with 1,500 words of hot air, where Cronin forgets that Gary Richrath was a member of the band and wrote half of REO's hits. He also forgot how to spell the name of the band's original lead singer (Terry Luttrell) and original bass player (Gregg Philbin.)

Unfortunately at the time I got it, 6 mos ago, most reviewers called the other ones sluggish either with music or movies. I used to play semi professional bass, so I think I might know a thing or two. I have 16x16 living room with a HDMI of HtPC. I am overall satisfied with this because it works as advertized with both music and movies. THe bass response is good - you hear it well (after the initialy tunning and placement trials). My only hope was I could \\"feel\\" the bass a little -- this does not do it justice to \\"feel\\" the frequency. I guess you would need one of those 1000W BIC boxes. I did not want an unbalanced system so chose this for my existing system.

If these are more expensive, then I would suggest getting the 8x40 instead.Replacing these after a year of use, primarily at national parks observing geographical features and wildlife, I was disappointed the optics misaligned as I wanted these to last at least 5 years at this price.

They are about mid way between you typical compact binocs and standard full size but this turns out to be a huge plus. They are much easier to carry and handle that full size binoculars but they are far superior to any of the compact units I have used. The overall feel is one of a very high quality optical instrument and one look through the lens will support that.

One of the leads also did the same test and wants the Nikon too.It is a little heavy and you have to be very steady with the 10 power. (That is why I did not buy the 12 power.) I am very happy with my Nikon 10x50 binoculars. I am also impressed with the 25 year warranty.

For me, I immediately thought of either Nikon or Cannon. When searching I pulled up this pair and ordered them for my husband. They are really sweet. We both love them. The view is go great.

Installation was very simple and straight forward. The receiver is well constructed, made out of fairly heavy duty plastic with a good 5ft usb cable. The suction cup mount is functional but could be better. I use this GPS receiver with my Hp laptop running Windows 7 64 bit. It works great with Google Earth in either live mode or offline (cached) mode. If I want an arrow pointer and the ability to zoom in below 1000 feet while navigating in Google Earth, I use a free program called Goops along with Google Earth.I purchased this item from Amazon and was very satisfied with the prompt shipping and the tracking status that was available to me.If you want a good affordable usb gps receiver unit for your laptop, I recommend the GlobalSat BU-353, and also recomend purchasing it from Amazon.com."},{"rating":"1","title":"2nd one bad as the first","review":"After 1st one failed within 4 hours of use and it was out of the 30 day warranty, I decided to purchase another because when it worked, I liked the way it worked.

It generally works near a window in airplanes and can always find quickly enough satellites for a fix on the dashboard of my car.One bug, however, really annoys me. When the unit loses a signal, for example in tunnels, it immediately positions you at 0 lattitude and 0 longitude in the middle of the Atlantic. I use the unit with Microsoft's French Autoroute and its US brother, Streets and Routes, and often find myself in the middle of the Atlantic! The Earthmate does not have this bug."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better receiver","review":"I put this on a Dell Latitude using Windows 7 without any problems.

I pre-ordered this book sight unseen. I thought I had made just about every ocean-related craft out there, and then this wonderful book came along.It's too bad that Amazon has still not posted a photo of the book cover. The entire book is whimisical and brightly illustrated and full of pinks, greens, yellows, etc. The crafts themselves include a necklace made from a paper plate, tiaras, sparkly mermaid paper dolls, seahorse pencil toppers, and others. Most of the crafts are made of paper or cardboard, but I think craft foam could also be used instead. The book even has 200 shine mermad sticks \\"to add extra shimmer to everything you make.\\"At $6.95, I think this book is priced EXTREMELY low considering the content. It is worth so much more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mermaid Activity Book","review":"This is a really neat book of mermaid and ocean-related crafts. I purchased this for my 5-year old daughter who loves mermaids. I think she will enjoy all the craft projects in the book, but I do not think she will be able to do any of them without significant assistance from me. There are many crafts that say to draw something (like a mermaid, fish, seahorse, etc) and cut it out. However, there are not really instructions for how to draw the pictures. I think this would be a fun book for younger children who have someone to help them with each project, and a great book for older children to work on more independently."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darling book","review":"My daughters and I have made several projects out of this book and they are super cute.

It is quick and does what you expect from it. Version 7 even makes it as powerful as the most commonly used features in PhotoShop. The Anniversary Edition makes you save a lot of money because it is packed with the best filter I have ever used \\"Alien Skin Eye Candy\\" and it is packed with the powerful media browser \\"Jasc Media Center\\" which allows you to browse all kind of Graphics and media files and print albums out of them.

For me, PSP is a must have on every PC."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good graphics program","review":"I own a website and Paint Shop Pro is a great way to create the graphics that go on my site. There are hundreds of effects I can use to make each graphic unique. I haven't worked with it much on editting photographs, but I've heard it's effective in that as well.For those of you who aren't familiar with Paint Shop Pro, think of it as a MS Paint program with dozens of other features. That being said, it can get pretty complicated, especially for someone who has never worked with a graphics program before. To help things, check on buying Paint Shop Pro for Dummies. (Yes, such a book does exist.)Paint Shop Pro costs quite a bit of money, so think carefully about how you're going to use it. It'll be a waste of money if you rarely make graphics or edit pictures. If you plan on using it only occasionally, such as once every 5 months, I suggest finding a different program. It can get confusing with the various tools, so think about how easily you get frustrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"A bit dissapointed...","review":"Perhaps it's the fact that I owned Adobe Photoshop 7 before I bought this software, but I noticed nothing unique about it.

However, both programs have their limitations, so I do occasionally switch back and forth between the two. I love to make banners in PSP. It's a piece of cake, especially after you figure out how to make your own tubes. Plus, PSP 7 comes with animation shop that alows you to make your own web animations. I have used Adobe Photoshop Deluxe as well (which they replaced with Photoshop Elements), but for making graphics and animations, PSP is far better. However, I do prefer Adobe Photoshop Deluxe (NOT Elements) for photo editing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Paint Shop Pro--Possibly the best graphics editor!","review":"I rated Paint Shop Pro a 4, because it is vaguely hard to learn. I began by going to jasc.com (i think it was) and downloading the 30 day trial version. I then went to other websites featuring animated tutorials and learned how to create various backgrounds (for use on webpages), image effects, and etc. My friend and I used PSP to create logos for shirts, which we may one day decide to sell. It's really a great program to make anything from webpage dividers to t-shirt logos and anything in between! I know i said it was semi-hard to learn, but thats for advanced website backgrounds. All in all its a fairly simple program to use and i HIGHLY reccomend it.Hope this helped someone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional!","review":"It is a wonderful product and very user friendly.

This continuity software showcased those genes, which enabled its earlier versions win numerous awards. Apart from being easy-to-deploy and use, it has excellent stability. Its enhanced features ensured that it is highly productive. Web-designers would appreciate the inclusion of JavaScript rollovers, and several other web-imaging tools in this '7.0 Pro' version.However, versatile image-editors should note that this 'Paint Shop' does not have the advanced premium features, which are evident in both 'Adobe Photoshop' and 'Corel Photo-Paint' programs. Still, its value-for-money did exceed those of 'Photoshop' and 'Photo-Paint'."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY IT","review":"I would not give this a single star; I downloaded this a while ago and the only useful thing it did was replace colors, and it wasn't until after a month I finally figured out how to draw (and I'm not the worst at computers). When I tried to uninstall the thing, I found out that it messes with file extensions; meaning that normal files like jpegs no longer worked. The proper way to associate with files, by the way, is through remote addresses, meaning it should not open using the program, but the program should instead open the file. This is something even the inventors of MS Paint knew, and Paint is considered the worst (actually I like Paint, but that's besides the point).Don't misunderstand, JASC is normally a good thing to have on your computer, but the fact that it associated itself was annoying as anything."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a user-friendly piece of software","review":"This product is very awkward to use.

The interface is so clunky that I went quickly looking for something easier to use. Just trying to do something simple, like draw a button with some text on it, is very frustrating (I gave up after two hours). Trying to make a gif transparent is also baffling at times, meaning sometimes it works -- and sometimes it doesn't. And the 3rd party tutorials out there are of little help, at least the ones that I've seen.PSP does pack some powerful features, however. And some of these are surprisingly easy to use, e.g., the Enhance Photo options. Rotating images is a snap to use too.If you have a good PSP teacher standing by, this would be a great program to buy.

The crust was sure flakey but it had slight porky undertones to it that didn't compliment that fruit filling of the final pie. The recipes are accurate but do assume the cook has some pre-existing baking skills. A novice pie maker or baker might have a little difficulty but probably not much. Other than the one little problem with the crust recipe I've been very happy with the outcome of the rest of the pie recipes I've made from this cookbook. It's a delightful and delicious addition to the category of pie cookbooks."},{"rating":"1","title":"very poor DVD","review":"Just got this Dvd out of the box for a 2nd look after a few months and know why I put it away, This DVD is simply bad!! quality poor crappy video, looks like a 3rd generation video The audio is poor also with its supposed 4.1,How they get away with releasing such rubbish beats me how an Artist of Rogers standing can give this the go ahead, he must never have had a look at this result it's an insultI get fed up of buying inferior DVD quality its not just this one, the situation is pathetic anything goes, stick it on a DVD and everyone thinks the quality will be just wonderful, There just is no apparent Quality measurements of late in the production of so many DVDS, We should return all these discs and complain to the producers, God help us.

Or look for a VHS copy of the whole concert or the 2-CD-set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't get fooled again","review":"The concert was clearly excellent, with Daltrey enjoying himself, but this DVD is a very poor record of it. The sound is simply the worst that I have ever heard on a sell through DVD. It sounded so bad that at first I thought my DVD player was faulty, but it sounded equally terrible in two other machines. At times the soundtrack is plainly out of sync with the visuals. Given the long string of technical credits at the end it is all the more surprising that something this bad got pressed up and sold. Worth having as a curiosity to sit alongside the bootlegs, but only if the price is as low as the quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spirit 4 stars, video and audio quality 1 star","review":"This is incredibly bad in terms of video and audio quality.

A whole lot of \\"Wow, real hip techno-futuristic high tech low lifes and gadgets\\", but not much story.

There will be a special-collector (or anyway you want to call it) version with a bonus disc. But it's still hard to say what will be found on that one. Some say it will include seven tracks from the 1977 Madison Square Garden show. Others that there will be three different bonus discs from different shows (that wouldn't surprise me-the Kiss fanatics will have to purchase three of those box sets to get the whole thing, hey, it's Kiss and they know how to make you spend your money). But if the tracks are really unedited, the two-discs version will have way enough to satisfy even the most dedicated Kiss fan. Can't wait to get my hands on that monster.

Yes i have all the bootleg versions too,but having this on dvd form is great. The bonus concerts are awesome. Ilove them all and have been waiting for years for this to be released.

What a stage show! and that is why it is such a shame the footage doesn't look and sound better on this set. It's pretty low grade and it should not be the case. If they only had the forthought back then to record these shows better. It's hard to believe the members of Kiss did not realize how important good quality footage would be now! These guys spent so much money on fantastic stage shows and then they forgot to record the shows with top quality cameras? If these shows had been professionally done they would have sold 100 times over this release. I'm glad I have it but, it should have been so much better!For Kiss fans this is a must buy, but be prepared for some disappointment in quality.

The Goddess-Pagan genre needs new books like this one, they helps us to lighten our spirits.This book leads us down a path of laughter and joy. At the same time, why not name Goddesses of various modern realities? Perfectly logical; we need them.A few of my favorite Divine Ladies from her book are: \\"Auntie Gravity, An Antic Cronish Goddess,\\" \\"Roadesia; Goddess of Freeways, Country Roads, and City Streets,\\" (a particularly useful Goddess), and let us not forget \\"Fixorrhea; Goddess of Duct Tape,\\" (I'm smiling, just typing in her name!)Next book you buy, don't miss this one.

I think every parent should read it. The first step of attending really makes you think about how many demands you are putting on your child.

My daughter would thank me when I would pay attention to what she was doing, even if I just said, \\"That is a really bright blue crayon you are using.\\"Even if your child is not strong-willed, the strategies in here are great.

It is so important to focus on the positive."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book should've been a bestseller","review":"I didn't like the cover, and I wasn't crazy about the title, but inside is a delightful novel, easy and fun to read from the beginning, credible and substantial. There's a bit of a gimmick to move the story (isn't there always?) but Robinson takes us into the depths of Lakota culture (even though his narrator claims not to be Indian). The voice is smooth and original, the dialogue is realistic and funny. I had great empathy for the main character. This book really has no weaknesses. I'd give it five stars except I can't rate it with Gatsby or All the King's Men. Nevertheless, I can almost guarantee that Thunder Dreamer won't disappoint you. It makes me sick to see it ignored and out of print. It's so much better than a thousand novels I've tried (and largely abandoned) in the last two years."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a read!","review":"I have never been shooshed so much while reading a book - I was chuckling at Handler's wit every other page!

It does, but only if you set the nozzles to center-fire, which feels like a hose. If you want to use the outer water jets, they only work in non-massage mode. The biggest problem with this series is that the shower head isn't on a pivot ball like 99% of the other shower heads in the world. It *LOOKS* like a pivot through the packaging, which is extremely deceptive. Why Waterpik couldn't spend the extra dollar to make this a functioning positional head is beyond me. As it stands, wherever the shower head points when you screw it on to your pipes is where it will ALWAYS point."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bargain Priced Volumes","review":"The \\"Essential\\" series from Marvel is a very cost effective way to go back to the beginnings of some of your favorite characters. Of course, most comic fans would prefer color, instead of the black and white version of these volumes, but their is simply not a better priced option available.DC Comics has issued several of its most cherished characters in color formats, and Marvel would be wise to follow suit. However, there is much more content in the Marvel \\"Essentials\\" and that's what makes them special."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away!","review":"This is easily the worst recording of any Sondheim musical. Most of the brilliant songs from the stage show are cut and replaced by awful underscore by someone else.

Personally I regret byuing it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this version","review":"Sadly, this CD fails to live up to expectations. A film of an enormously sucessful Broadway and West End musical must have sounded like a good idea at the time, but as this CD testifies, it was not well executed. Many of the songs have been cut, and those that remain are poorly orchestrated. The highlight of the disc, and the reason for two stars is the instumental 'Chase' and playoff at the end, as well the signature number 'Comedy Tonight!', which are nice to listen to.While the performances are not bad, neither are they particularly good, which means that the recording lacks the particular feeling of farce that is necessary for the show to work as a recording.If you want a recording, then get either the OBC or the recent Broadway revival cast: both of which are superior in almost every respect."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining","review":"I'm not a Broadway purist. I enjoy this CD more than the (recent) Broadway Cast album. Yes, many of the original songs are missing, but some of the missing songs just weren't that good--I've reached the point where I skip several when playing the CD. I enjoy the instrumental parts of the movie soundtrack and, for the songs which are left, I find the orchestrations better as well as the singing voices of the cast. I can't say how it compares to the original Broadway Cast album since, when I ordered that, I just got a second copy of the more recent one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Full of adventure!","review":"The Mutiny on Board HMS Bounty is about a captain named William Bligh, his crew, and their journey.

They work themselves through storms, sicknesses, and islands full of ambushing natives. Bligh and his loyal crew make it back to England five months after being cast off the Bounty.

Great prints this time, as good as Restless Gun. Stories are typical westerns and not as mature as Restless Gun. The quality of prints making these very enjoyable to watch. I think one of the best of this age out there. A release this old unfortunately has not the demand to put out a season by season. Being this is about a fourth of the shows a complete series would be about $240. I am a fan of these westerns of the 50's and 60's. The \\"best of\\" works great for me as long as there is a least 40 shows. But I would have liked to have all of the Restless Gun shows. Riverboat, 6 would have been enough.

Each lesson also includes the option of more in-depth questions for personal reflection or group discussion. Study helps, instruction for group leaders, and some Biblical background information are included.

You get a character and make them fight through rounds and become stronger (my build-up character is ssj Chibi Goku), and the more you use an attack, the more effective it becomes. Please not that the Japanese version will not work on PS2! No, not even with a converter. The coolest part is this is the 1st game that you can play as a ssj4 (Goku).

Eric Heatherly, sings, plays lead guitar and wrote 10 of the 11 tracks on the album. Although all the tracks could be hits, my favorites are Why Don'tcha and the title track, Swimming in Champagne. Why Don'tcha features Eric's rocking vocals and guitar licks. This song has catchy lyrics and keeps your toes tapping. Swimming in Champagne shows Heatherly's softer side and this ballad will be a favorite with the female genre.

Booklet has the longest list of acknowledgements I have ever seen. The hair stylist is listed in the same type size as the musicians. <smile>Wish they would do more like \\"Flowers on the Wall!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I'm sorry when i buy a book called Venoms Wraith i expect Venom to be the main villan not some lame shape shifting guy. Venom was barely in it. Venom fans i recommend The venom Factor"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully done....","review":"I liked this book very much. The loss of the fifth star is fault by WAY too many policemen/women in this book. True, the men in blue were necessary to save the hostages, but I really didn't think precints are that large. It literally gave me a headache keeping their names straight, with a few exceptions. I really enjoy the concentration between the Spider-Man/NYPD relationship as being rocky. As for the villain, it's a nice change for Venom to become the antagonist instead of the half-protagonist he was in Duane's novels. Good book, overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too slow moving plot","review":"Despite the fact that it's called Venom's Wrath, this story moves along too slowly to keep the reader interested. That plus the fact that the final Venom/Spider-Man battle is so under-welming and more attention is placed on the NYPD cops then on Spider-Man, makes this more of a book where Spider-Man has an extended cameo apperance, rather then being the focus of the story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sending it back.","review":"This is a nice vacuum. I bought it because of the dirt devil name, but I bought it for cleaning my house which is 90% carpet. The attachment for carpet cleaning (called turbo floor cleaner) is terrible. I have a longer fiber carpet but this attachment grabs hold of the carpet on a forward push and literally is useless for carpet that I and probably many others have. I really needed this to work on my rugs too so I'm discouraged at having to send it back. Hope people see this and it helps in your decision. Very nice vacuum - bad idea for some carpets."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give a negative number-- I would!","review":"I had to get a vacuum cleaner when my husband and I moved into a new apartment, and we got this one because I love having a canister, it was 160 at Best Buy when I got it. I took it home and there was no suction AT ALL! We went to a different store and got a full, huge vacuum, for 50 bucks, and that thing works magic! Let me tell you this is a horrible vacuum, I keep it for picking up kitty litter, but if you want that deep clean that you need in a carpet, especially with animals. It is no where close to being worth your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to use, great on laminate floors","review":"Bought this as a second vacuum. Wanted it to handle our laminate floors, which it has done beautifully! Adjustable power is a nice feature. Light and easy to handle. Very easy to clean. Only complaint is that the attachment for throw-rug (and presumably carpet) does a so-so job, thus the four (rather than five) star rating. Overall, I do highly recommend the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"This vacuum is Awesome!!!","review":"This vacuum is absolutely great! It does a great job on bare floors, I don't know about carpets, we don't have any in our home. It is so easy and convenient to use our house stays cleaner because it's no longer a chore to wrestle with the vacuum. The wand is great and reaches anywhere and you really don't even need the attachments because it has such great suction. Very good around corners and under tables and beds. We have a Rottweiler, a doberman, and a dachshund, and there is no longer any hairballs or tracked in dirt of any kind in our home. It is most definitely worth the money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst vacuum I ever had","review":"This vacuum is totally useless if used on carperts.The vacuum driven brush,produces very low strength so in result it takes forever for this vacuum to pick up some small crumbs or dirts from the carpet.Fairly decent on the bare floor.If anyone wants to use this vacuum mainly for vacuuming the carpets bad choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"DIsappointing performance","review":"I have had my Dirt Devil Vision vacuum only one month and already need to change the filter. At $20 per filter, this could be a very expensive vacuum to maintain. I don't have an exceptionally dirty house, and have mostly hardwood floors, so having to replace the filter was a shock. When the filter clogs, the vacuum overheats and shuts down....right in the middle of whatever you are doing. I would never buy another Dirt Devil product after this poor performance."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great little vacuum","review":"Good vacuum, good suction. Extending wand and switch on the handle is a great innovation.

I think it's the plug connection from the pipe to the canister that make's the engine turn on and off. Don't buy this piece of crap..."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor \\"Vision\\"","review":"I was really disappointed with this vacuum, I found it to have poor suction especially when it came to our thick carpeted areas. It did do well on the floors though. We replaced our 12yr old vacuum that worked fantastic until it finally died! I don't think I will be purchasing another Dirt Devil vacuum again. I certainly don't recommend this product to anyone who has thick carpets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than a broom","review":"The coolest feature of this vacuum is the retractable cord. You can have the cord all the way out press that little button and it will come whipping into the vacuum. That is cool. We have had this little vacuum for 2 years now. We only have one room with carpet. It does fine on the tile and hardwood surfaces.... but so does my broom. When you try it on carpet it is almost worthless. We have resorted to using the smallest attachment and getting on our hands and knees to vacuum the rug and carpet. As I said we have little of both otherwise this would not be a very good option. I would not recommend this vacuum to anybody. Not only does it not work well but when you are vacuuming for an extended periods of time it overheats and you have to wait for it to cool off. If you are vacuuming carpet I think you need a belt driven turning brush to lift the carpet hairs and pull the stuff out. This one does not do that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was great when it worked.","review":"I've had this just over a year. It worked great when it worked. Took it out of the closet today, plugged it in, and nothing, no power. I've taken care of it and cleaned it every time I used it. I'd like to think $129 gets you a vacuum that lasts more than a year. Obviously, Dirt Devil disagrees."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing","review":"This product was dissapointing.

This does NOT pick up cat hair on carpet at all. Plus, the carpet \\"turbo nozzle\\" attachment broke while it was under warranty, and I was told the part \\"doesn't exist anymore\\". They did not replace it."},{"rating":"1","title":"warranty void","review":"Although this vacuum works ok....after using it for less than a year, the power head broke. I called Dirt Devil. They proceeded to tell me that, although it was technically under the 2 year warranty, they could not replace my part based on the fact that it wasn't a \\"manufacturer defect\\". This is their way of saying, \\"we pretty much don't stand behind our products.\\" They can't stand up to any sort of wear or they would stand behind replacing parts that break within the first year of use. So, I ended up having to pay for the replacement attachment myself. I am highly disappointed in the quality of the product and the customer service of the company!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"NOTHING BUT THE BEST","review":"THIS VACUUM IS THE BEST I HAVE EVER BOUGHT FOR THE MONEY. THE 12 AMP MOTOR IS POWERFUL, THE HANDLE GRIP IS COMFORTABLE WITH THE CONTROLS ON THE HANDLE AND EASY TO USE. THE ATTACHMENT DEVICE IS CUMBERSOME BUT WHO CARES IT WORKS GREAT!! I HAD 2 DIFFERENT ORECKS FOR 20 YEARS AND THIS BEATS IT BY FAR."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wow","review":"I can't believe this horrible vacuum has so many 5 star reviews. This vacuum is a piece of junk. We have had it for over a year now, but never use it, because the first week of use the rug attachment locked up and continuously locked up after every second use. We have long haired cats, so we do have a little extra hair to vacuum up, however it should not cause a brand new vacuum cleaner to lock up every second time it was used. It also doesn't even get down to the carpet dirt. It barely get the dirt that is sitting on top of the carpet! This vacuum is made with flimsy plastic pieces and was the biggest disappointment we have ever purchased!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Only good on non-carpeted floors","review":"This vacuum has plenty of suction but it's beater brush is not designed to pick up dog hair and suck it up, it tends to get tangled in the brush and I have to cut it out. Hair also gets clogged in the hardwood floor attachment and then I have to manually pull it out. I bought it because the reviews I read on it were good. I am so dissapointed in this machine. If you have no animals or carpet it would probably be fine for you, otherwise don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed, does not work on carpet or rugs.","review":"I read the other reviews and I see now that either a good number of these reviewers make their living as paid shills for the manufacturer or else their deluded somehow.This vacuum comes with a 'suction-powered' beater bar. I WILL NOT WORK ON CARPET or RUGS. Isn't this the purpose of a vacuum cleaner? On bare floors it seemed to work ok, but was absolutely useless on anything else.I know now that I cannot trust the reviews of any product online, but I appreciate Amazon's super easy return policy.It's the only reason I continue to shop here.Back to the research..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Reaches all the corners!","review":"I have a cat that sheds ridiculous amounts of fur near and around my computer, so this is the perfect vacuum for the job. I can reach areas that are impossible to get to with a stand up vacuum. The suction is great, the size is perfectly compact for a small apt, and I love the color. I totally recommend this vacuum to people with smaller places/apts, wood floors and pets. My only problem with the model is that it is bagless....I don't like dealing with the canister...but that is more of a preference."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Suction Horrible Cord","review":"The vacuum boasts an automatic cord retraction. I received this vacuum and plugged it in and was pleasantly surprised with the suction. Then i hit the cord retraction button only to find that it didn't retract. So now I was stuck with 20 feet of cord that wouldn't go back into the system. I contacted amazon and returned this product for the same vacuum, only to find that this cord didn't retract either. Overall I am very disappointed with this vacuum and have contacted dirt devil to find out why neither of these vacuums cords automatically retracted. The funny part about the whole thing is that the instructions tell you to hold the cord to avoid it from whipping back at you."},{"rating":"1","title":"WON'T LAST THREE MONTHS","review":"I bought the vacuum and and was initially quite please with the ease of use, cleaning, power button on handle, carrying handle, etc. Until the thing quit on me. I followed the re-set instructions and it worked again, but then it quit again. I kept on following the re-set instrutions (which require you to unplug the vacuum and let it sit for 1/2 hour, in reality often over 1 hour, totally interrupting my plans) but it kept needing to be re-set after vacuuming for 5 minutes or so, and then it quit completely. When you're having family over in 10 minutes, and your vacuum says \\"I need to rest for an hour\\", then it's time to get different vacuum. Don't waste your money on this tired machine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dirt Devil vac","review":"we purchased the vacuum based on previous reviews found online from other people who also purchased it.

A vacuum with great suction power and you can control it very easily. Easy to handle, easy to clean... great price. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for carpets!","review":"This vacuum is wonderful for hardwood and tile floors, BUT NOT FOR CARPETS!!! I don't even have a high pile carpet, and it gets bogged down and does not move easily. I don't like the bagless cleaner because there is more dust flying into the air when you empty the canister than when you just detach the bag and throw it away. The attachments do not stay attached to the cleaner and easily fall off. The floor nozzle is wonderful because it rotates easily to get into the hardest corners. I am sorry I spent the money for this cleaner and will be buying another for my carpets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scratches wood floor","review":"Not too happy with mine.

A lot of vac for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Had high hopes but died second time I used it","review":"I had done a good bit of research on bagless vacuums. I was reluctant to \\"invest\\" in a Dyson or Oreck and this model seemed to get overall good reviews. I was pleased with it the first time I used it. It got the job done, was fairly lightweight and easy to store and attractive as far as vacuums go. Upon plugging it in for the second use, I powered it on and it died. I called DirtDevil Customer service to see if they had any suggestions and was told to either return it to the merchant or they could send it out for repair. Given the short time I've had it, back to Amazon it goes. I'm now considering if the more expensive models may be worth the price..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vacuumm cleaner","review":"Worst vacuum cleaner I have ever seen.

It does as good of a job as your 4 year old's pretend vacuum would do! Even on bare floors, I find myself having to go over each area twice in order to pick up everything.The WORST thing is, if you have a home bigger than 1000 sq ft, you'll probably have to vacuum it in 2 sessions, as this vacuum has a 'convenient' automatic shut off when it gets too hot. I consider myself lucky it I can vacuum half of our 2000 sq ft home before it shuts off!All in all, I will suffer thru this poor investment until I atleast feel I've gotten my money's worth, and I won't even bother trying to resell it used!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap build quality","review":"This unit did a good job cleaning and the filter stayed relatively clean, but the overall build quality is not quite there. For instance, the power chord is supposed to recoil when pushing the handle or the button under the handle, it never worked. The release for the dirt container feels fairly flimsy. Ultimately I returned it because the power chord did not recoil and this defect is unacceptable for a unit that had literally just come out of the box. So an ok unit if you are looking for something moderately priced with decent performance but mediocre at best build quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Chinese Product","review":"I ave had this for less than a year.

Not only because of the small size, but the smaller container for debris. I was correct. I have deep pile carpet in my living room. I tried it in the living room. After 5 minutes, I had to empty it. Not even 1/8th of the floor was done. I have 2 German Shepherds, a breed that sheds very heavily, all year long. This item isn't made for stength. It's made for people who have very low pile carpets or bare floors, with pets that don't shed. I returned this. It isn't worth the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"This model is junk!!","review":"The first Dirt Devil 082700 Vision Turbo Canister Vacuum we received was defective.

I have a dog so there is a lot of pet hair and now 6 months later it won't pick up any hair, dirt etc. I'm very disappointed!

Powerful, lightweight and small, which I love. For me it's important that it's bagless and so easy to empty. The accessories allow you to clean out all the corners and little spaces effectively.

Got this one for hard floors, getting pet hair off upholsterer and couple of area rugs. It worked great for those uses. I especially like the variable suction and the on/off/control switch on the handle. However, I soon discovered that the holder for the accessories, just a plastic clip on the wand, was inadequate, and soon one of the brushes dropped off and disappeared. The filter didn't last that long, and replacements cost around $25.00. Within the last month or two, the vacuum has started overheating and shutting itself off after less than 10 minutes, and this is on the floors. Then it died and was successfully put by the curb... Of course for $129.99 in 2008 with the way small appliances are being built these days the expectation was that this vacuum cleaner will work at least 4-5 years. I was wrong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid and well-designed","review":"I have had this vacuum cleaner for about a month now, and I'm very happy with the purchase. I don't really like to clean, but I like having a clean home and this little vacuum helps me get the job done quickly.It's small enough to fit in the corner of my apartment, but has impressive power and the power slider on the handle is great for adjusting as you vacuum. I have two cats and the floor attachment is great for my wood floors, and the upholstery attachment gets the fur off my couch very well.It's a well thought out piece of equipment, with clips for the attachments, handles just where I want them, and the retracting cord is nice (and also quite long). The telescoping handle easily reaches all the way under the bed, and the hose seems very sturdy. Actually, the whole thing seems very solidly built.In my opinion, it's more than worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great canister vac","review":"The Dirt Devil Vision Turbo moves smoothly over both carpet and pergo flooring (though the turbo head is much better for carpeting), is convenient to store, has a long cord that easily extends and retracts from the base of the vacuum, and is easy to empty.

I received the replacement and as I use it I am quite pleased with it; seems to be a good little vacuum for our wood floors. I have no pets, so I don't know how it would handle pet hair. Only thing I don't like is the harwood floor brush, it has like a piece of felt and rollers on it, instead I would like brizzles, short and soft(like I had in a vacuum in Europe). I do use the black roller brush for area rugs if I don't want to get my upright out and it does the job. The european brands are so expensive here, so I bought the Dirt Devil; it has good power,and it does the job."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible company","review":"This is my first negative review on Amazon.

The company refused to pay saying it was the users fault for the handle braking, without even contacting me.I went to their website to email them, but its one of those contact forms where the copy of the text is not forwarded. They gave me a standard response saying take it to an authorized dealer even though I said that I did in my original text. The email didn't respond directly to anything I had written. There was no name on the reply, so if I went back and sent another message to them I would have to start the process all over again.I am in the process of filing complaint with the state and other agencies.

The suction is so weak that it won't pick up cat litter and cannot get pet hair out of a carpet. The canister is so small and the suction so weak, that I have to empty it 3 times just to clean my 900 sq foot house. Emptying the canister is a disgusting job. I have to pick pet hair out of the filter with my fingers and out of the various parts where it gets stuck. I also have to pick out hair that gets stuck in the nozzle. The supposedly more powerful main attachment was unusable within a month because hair got wrapped around the spinning brush and even pulling the hair out wouldn't make it work. I hate this cleaner so much and I am so disappointed to have spent a penny on it.

I vacuum twice a week, no pets and only 2 people in the house. I've had it for about a year now and I hate using it. I bought it because of the bagless idea(thinking I would save money in the long run not buying bags), but boy was I wrong. Due to the design, the filter gets dirty and clogged after 2 uses and impossible to get cleaned. Therefore, you are buying new filters every other time you use it. And they are not cheap. The bagless canister is also very small, so while vacuuming a 2,000 square foot house, I'm emptying it 3 or 4 times. Big pain. The suction is great the first time you replace the filter but within minutes it's aweful. I really wish I could get me money back. Please don't waste you money.

It is difficult to clean a house when the unit refuses to operate 90% of the time.

HOWEVER everything else in terms of unit assignments appears to check out. He was in C/2/503rd 173rd AB and with Army River Boats and he was attatched to Charlie Rangers.

It is a wonder John survived his first tour. The value of the book is the first hand account of an ordinary American boy turned warrior in three totally different venues: airborne infantry, brown water swabbie, and airborne ranger.

After a time in the \\"brown water navy,\\" our hero joins up with the Airborne Rangers and spends a third year in theatre fighting the war like the enemy, guerrilla style.

Time would be better spent on the web reading a good faq.

The book has some great information and nice ideas, but in reality there are problems with many of the recipes either in the instructions or in the actual outcome. For example, the tomato sorbet tasted like ketchup sorbet. While the verjus sorbet was delicious, it melted very quickly and was thus hard to serve. Also, the crowd I served the verjus sorbet with poached peaches to agreed that the dish was too acidic and needed other elements to balance it out. Another example of a problematic recipe is the striped bass with artichoke ravioli recipe. In this recipe it seems that there were editorial errors and lack of direction. It also seemed unnecessarily laborious for the result. In all, you need to be prepared to labor without too many expectations because you can't be sure what the final outcome will be."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the read, even if you don't cook from it","review":"This is a big, beautiful book full of lots of great tips for the serious cook. Many of the recipes are pretty elaborate, but, as the author admits, can be simplified.

(For proof, try to get a reservation.) A major reason for this is the passion and dedication of chef Thomas Keller. Mr. Keller has shared his views on food, his recipes and methods, and his inspirations in this well-written and beautifully-photographed book. I brought my copy to the family Christmas gathering, and it was passed from hand to hand for days. My sister called me later to tell me \\"if you love me you will buy me one.\\" That sort of says it all."},{"rating":"2","title":"VISUALLY CAPTIVATING","review":"This is the most extraordinary cook book I have ever laid my hands on.

I mean really, who has time to spend hours making stock for one recipe, that you don't have use for the next day or a good freezer to store it in? I live in NYC and certainly don't have the space to do the food in this book. I am sure that the food at Thomas Keller's restaurant is wonderful but they are trained chefs and do this every day.

When you need a solid recipe or technique, this is where you turn. Need to know how to make a langostine stock? Need a good pasta recipe? Whatever it is, this is the ultimate reference. While the book doesn't have everything, it is a must for chefs. I've never really seen any of the dishes replicated necessarily, but the fundamentals and concepts are gold.Home cooks can benefit from reading this book and understanding techniques and philosophy. One shouldn't really even expect to make the dishes in here exactly as they are, but it is the premiere resource for any cook that wants to know how to cook better and understand what good food is.

I was very disappointed, though.The author seemed comfortable talking about talking about the broad topic, rather like a bibliographer, but when it came to a central vision, a personal spark, there seemed to be nothing.While it might appear to some to be sophisticated and academic, it is neither."},{"rating":"1","title":"Theory of nothing","review":"At least Ken has the minimal iota of wisdom to state at the outset that his theory of evrything is not the final theory of everything, but is actually a borrowed theory of spiral dynamics.He makes a flimsy attempt to integrate every human activity, but is quite unable to get to the core of 'everytning'. It is obvious from his writing that he has no actual experience of what he refers to as 'spirit'. Despite all this, his attempt should encourage others to take a shot at 'everything', by first finding out what all he has missed."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was so disappointed","review":"I've been a fan of the sweet valley series for years. And was looking forward to the fact that Elizabeth had finally broken out on her own. But once again no matter what she follows her heart and it leads back to her twin sister Jessica. I think that for once Pascal and John should put away the fact that twins always come back to each other sometimes twins need to stay apart and this one was no different.If you like the fact that Jessica and Elizabeth make up once again then you'll love the book but if you get tired of it like i have then you'll understand why this book was so disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inconsistent with early SVU books *Boo*","review":"I am upset because what happens between Elizabeth and Max in this book goes totally against the early SVU books.

If you are only interested in having a few Armstrong CDs i would say this would be a good one for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointment","review":"First, let me say that this is not a commentary on Louis Armstrong or his music. It is a commentary on the selection of music on this 2-CD set and how the title, \\"The Essential Louis Armstrong,\\" is misleading. I expected to hear a good collection from throughout his career. Most of the recordings (except the last few tracks on the 2nd CD) are from early in his career when the recording quality is poor, so anyone with a decent ear and a decent audio system really cannot get the best of Louis Armstrong.

The first 6 tracks are spoilt by a loud audience, yelling and applauding through out the session. I am a fan of both Rimington and Robinson, but Rimington seemed to be really off key and the rest of the band sounded like a typical \\"out of tune\\" New Orleans band. Tracks 7 to 10 were a little better, without audience, but still sounding like the bandsmen were out of tune with each other. Track 11 was much better, sounding like a real New Orleans band should do, I will not be keeping this CD.Alan Carrick"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best","review":"As has been said, if you've seen the movie, no other soundtrack will do.

It has worked so far. She says it's exactly like the movie. I don't find the singing to be the best ever, but I am not as into the storyline as she is. For a huge fan of the original MGM motion picture, this is the perfect soundtrack--it is taken straight from the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"He's the Man!","review":"There's been a lot of controversy about the movie and the soundtrack over the years but I still prefer this version of the music over the Broadway shows. I've seen Man of La Mancha on stage many times and enjoyed it but still find the movie version to be outstanding. I've had the DVD of the movie for a few years and was very happy to see that the movie soundtrack is finally available on CD. To each his own but I'll forget the critics and simply continue to enjoy this version of the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not the collector's edition","review":"When I purchased this product I believed it was a fancier version that is available in New Zealand, but the materials in this one (made in China) are not special or fine: the pieces are modestly painted/stained wood, and the board doesn't seem especially durable without a cover. The quality of the product is acceptable, not poor, but differs from other versions only in that it is very large, and in this case I do not believe the higher price is justified.The game itself is a classic strategy experience for two players and is highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"2 yr old loves it!","review":"I wanted to get a dvd about winter and this was \\"the one\\".

When I saw this book in our local bookstore, naturally I had to buy it. Alas, the writing style is sophomoric, the author references Poe's most well known works in the most obvious manner possible, and he also has an annoying penchant for capitalizing the epithet \\"Goddamn\\"...even when it's used in the middle of a sentence! I grew up in Chicago and I've spent a fair bit of time in the near Wisconsin suburbs as well, so I know there actually are intelligent people who live there, but you'd never know it from reading this book.

The identity of \\"The Raven\\" was so obvious that for a while I hoped the author was trying to make it seem that obvious only to throw in a last-second twist.

Rather than treating its alleged topic, modern soldering, it attempts to be an everything book for technicians.In soldering, your first indication that you've made a good solder joint is the visual inspection. With a book on this topic, I'd expect at least some pictures of good and bad solder joint examples, and photos of the various types of joints and packages the technician may encounter. But, the few graphics are limited to schematics of audio amplifiers and also to primitive line drawings of a few chip packages.I definitely do not recommend this book for soldering, and there are excellent books on fundamental electronics that are so much better than what's presented here. The publisher should have limited the book's scope and required a better presentation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very misleading picture.","review":"The kit comes completely disassembled with the parts.

Jamey Aebersold's website even goes so far as to say that they are transcriptions of \\"Unrecorded\\" Bird solos. I finally realized that they actually can all be found on Dizzy Gillespie recordings, but the soloist is not Charlie Parker but Sonny Stitt. While they do sound similar, I think it's going way too far to put Stitt solos in a book of Bird transcriptions, and I'm surprised this error hasn't been caught in the 20 years or so that this book has been in print.

It is a great tool for planning not only your route but for details along the way. It gives you names and locations of all sorts of points of interest like historical sites and museums as well as restaurants and hotels with addresses, phone numbers and average cost...Everything!

The author tries to claim that Patrick is not Catholic because he is a protestant who wants to claim Patrick as one of his own, but is totally ficticious. He tries to state that Saint Patrick did not use the shamrock to explain the trinity, was not Catholic, and is not a saint. These revolts against the Catholic Church did not begin until after 200 years after Patrick died. All Churches back then were Catholic and it is sad that they broke off when the Church needed reforming not a split.God Bless and Always in Christ J.M.J.,Joy Marie Murphy"},{"rating":"1","title":"Can anyone say Bias?","review":"This book had at least two or three relevant points. Unfortunately the author was so busy making the same mistakes he was criticizing others for that it was for me, a book that was difficult to force myself to read. If it had not been assigned for a class, I wouldn't have finished the first chapter. As it was, the one or two points that the author eventually got around to making (in about the 9th or 10th chapter) were interesting, but failed to support the sieve-like logic of the rest of the text. This is a good example of why editing is important, and how this company gets a big fat FAIL from me. They should pay more attention to quality, content, and the logical context of arguments presented, rather than someone claiming to have something relevant to say about these sort of debates. The only reason this book got one star from me is because selecting none was not an option."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not such a great deal","review":"I received this comforter set today.

I went with Amazon because of the free shipping. So, clearly I was disappointed when it arrived with NO sheet set. My son is THRILLED with his new comforter though so I won't be sending it back.

YEN \\"David\\"'s question: Yes, the set includes the adapter. The one included is actually made of metal, not plastic like the $20 Canon LA-DC58F Conversion Lens Adapter, the lenses include also two sets of metal adapter rings I'm guessing the 54 mm is for the A610 and the 52 mm are to fit the filters to the lenses.The adapter comes in a carton box, but the lenses come in little vinyl bags, they're not only cute but also give protection.I haven't got the chance to take a lot of pictures with the filters, but I'm very pleased with the zoom and macro, of course is only 0.5 x and 2.0x, but that's all an amateur like me needs so far."},{"rating":"2","title":"Item as described and at a fraction of what Canon charges","review":"I bought these lenses to go with my Powershot A630. I was a little hesitant to order anything not made or recommended by Canon, but after receiving these I might consider other off brand items. First off these lenses, and the corresponding adaptor, are made of metal, the Canon adaptor is made of plastic and appears cheaply made.Right away I attached the 2x magnifier and took a few sample pictures....also took exact same pictures with only the camera zoom. What a difference the 2x lense made. The center of the images were nice and clear with only slight fringing on the outer edges...which I think could have been due to several factors, not only the lense.These might not be perfect lenses for pros but let's face it, most pros don't use P&S; cameras opting instead for DSLRs! For the rest of us, these make a great alternative to the high priced lenses made by Canon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good deal at the price.","review":"The product is very solid.

The problem is that the magnetic catch only works for the inswing. Raccoons can grab and pull the door open, if they're clever enough. It took my local raccoon 3 days to figure it out, and now it might as well be a normal cat door. The only way to seal them out with this item is to lock it down completely, which you can of course do with a regular cat door.Also, the door needs a hole cut an inch more than should be necessary due to inefficient screw and mechanism placement. Wouldn't be a problem, but I was using an existing hole made for a more efficient door, and had to modify the housing and the screw holes to get it to fit (which the designers of this item could and should have done)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Publisher cares little about book","review":"Pages 241 to 272 were missing from my copy.

Anthrax just can't put out a bad album no matter how hard they might try. It was difficult for me to comprehend why Electra would let these guys go,but we all do stupid things every now and then.

This album actually was not used, it had no scratched on it at all and it even came with Anthrax logo stickers. But anyways this album itself is excellent. It is great to see Anthrax evolve and grow with new singer, John Bush without selling out. It is still up for grabs as for who is the better singer Bush or Belladonna. This album is not Anthrax's best but I would suggest that if you ever see it at a record store buy it right then and there because you might never be able to find it after that. Best songs are: Crush, Catharsis, and Born Again Idiot."},{"rating":"1","title":"what the hell is this garbage?","review":"This is utterly awful....riffs so thin and pathetic they make Bush look like Overkill, this album wallows in uncreative swill. The guitarist sounds like he just picked up his instrument a week before, and the fact of the matter is, any band having to hire a guy to guest to play guitar solos (Dimebag Darell) is utterly pathetic. The songwriting is nonexistent, if at best poor...only about 1 song is impressive, Catharsis...the others should be pissed on!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One original though please","review":"This album was terrible.

I am a huge fan of Anthrax, but I like their thrash style moreso than the heavier grunge like sound on this album. Persistence of Time and WCFYA are probably my favorite 2 albums of theirs. It is definitely a heavy riff album with catchy drums and bass. This album is good, but not as much as I was hoping it to be. I can't wait for Iced Earth's new album to come out!! That should blow most other albums, metal or not out of the water."},{"rating":"2","title":"best metal album of the last 3 years","review":"Anthrax is really a different band.

I still can't figure out how Metallica has always been more popular. Anthrax, with John Bush on vocals, is in my opinion what metal is all about. Anthrax never falls into that cookie cutter thrash riffing, or lyrics about some science-fiction fantasy that you can't relate to. No, Anthrax have been and will always be a bunch of regular guys, putting out some of the best sounding, never taking themselves too serious, metal out there. I find Metallica more one-dimentional than Anthrax. Volume 8, in my opinion, along with Stomp 442 (I know many may disagree), are Anthrax and metals finest moments...Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Never used to like it.","review":"At first I didn't like Vol 8 but after several listens it got better. It's mostly hit and miss throughout. It's a lot better than Stomp 442, in my opinion. It's heavier and has more variety. Crush! is an excellent opening track, 3 following tracks are also great. It isn't anywhere near their best but it;s mostly solid and a step up from Stomp 442. Not that it was a bad album but oo many songs sounded the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bar None - Anthrax's best","review":"From the opener to the Killer track 'Stealing From a Thief' this is the best of all Anthrax cd's. This could have been huge if they had proper airplay and were taken seriously at the time. Much better than Stomp442 and a bit better than 'White Noise'.

I used it briefly and thought it was great so I bought my own. The hardware and sound quality is good, but I'm giving it only two stars because Plantronics blew it on the over the ear headsets and general design flaws. The over the ear attachments are horrible. They should be of Jabra quality, the kind you can wear all day long. Instead they are cheap flimsy plastic that are not strong enough to keep on your ear or support the microphone. Switching to the over the head attachment is not much better as it grips a little too hard, causing it to be noticeable right away and painful over time.The headset lifter is also large for what it does and it \\"glues\\" onto your phone. I was surprised that was how it was designed. Poor execution in my opinion.For ~$240 I expect this product to have great quality and excellent design.

I have always used corded headsets and the freedom from the wireless is very helpful. There are only a couple of weaknesses that I see with it and those are, the over the head unit does not lengthen enough, and if there could be a way to put calls on hold that would be very helpful. Overall though I would recommend this headset if you are looking for a wireless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Favorite Item in my office","review":"I've been buying these for years. This is my favorite item in my office - bar none. I'm spoiled now and hate having to hold a phone to my head. I can initiate a call and walk anywhere in our center without having to touch a thing. I'll place a call and then head to the kitchen to make myself an espresso while the conversation warms up. I'd pay for this even if I couldn't expense it. They're now part of our startup budget.

Volume level is low (even though it is cranked up all the way).Comfort-wise you have the option to use a hook-around-the-ear system or the headband (which is what I end up using).I only use this headset when I am stuck on a call but need to walk away from my desk (nature breaks, etc).It does have excellent range, allowing me to go a few hundred feet away from the base unit in my building.The lifter mechanism is just goofy and doesn't interface that well with the Cisco phones we have.I'm hoping the dual-ear headset works better for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plantronics headset","review":"Exactly as promised.... best thing I've ever ordered.

I have a colleague in my office that has the same headset. I'm not disappointed. It is very functional with good sound quality. This is my first headset. If you're never had one before, I would highly recommend getting one. I love having my hands free and the ability to go to another office/copy room while still on the phone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Serious Issues With Audio Cutting Out","review":"We have about six people in our department with this headset and lifter bundle. A couple of them have no issues, however the majority of us have constant problems with audio cutting out. It doesn't seem to matter how much of a charge is on the headset or how close we are to the base, the audio will just cut out at random times. This device is totally unusable to me because of these problems, even after trying two different units, ordering a third brand new, and trying a new phone as well. I've had very good luck with Plantronics before, however this product is unusably bad."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm pleased","review":"I had purchased two of these head sets and they were exactly what I wanted. (In fact, I just ordered a third one for a new hire.)I run a busy surgical practice, and with the advent of electronic medical records, my medical assistants now carry their lap tops around with them. One of my MA's suggested that we try headsets so they wouldn't have to return to their desks to catch the phone. (a jewel, right?)I jumped on that the very same day and it has worked better that I dreamed. We are more efficient and my people are not chained to their desks. Win- win. :)JudyPractice Manager"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great upgrade. No complaints at all.","review":"My old Plantronics headset needed to be replaced and I went with this one. It is much more sturdy, with the headset resting very comfortably in the charging unit. My old one would 'float' once in a while and not charge when I thought it was, which meant I couldn't use it the next day until it charged for a while. Not so with this unit.I had a behind the head band I use which for me is very comfortable and I can quickly take the headset off and it rests on my shoulders. Sound quality is excellent. I have not had any complaints on the other end either.Highly recommend this product for anyone needing versatility and walking around from the base unit. I can easily get files from across the room or do other things while talking without missing a beat."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great set","review":"I have been using this product for years and highly recommend it.

But,for something costing around $250, I expected better.The headset base station has to be 4\\" away from my phone to avoid feedback with the speakerphone. Since that is about the length of the wires connecting the two devices, options for placement on the desktop become limited. The adjustment buttons are on the back and underside of the base station - not an easy place to get at, especially if you care about seeing the state of the device's charge.The handset lifter is a joke, lacking the power to return the handset to the off position if the phone is tilted up to a position where I can read its notification window. It also has to be affixed to the phone unit in a way that covers the speaker on most models, which obviates use.Finally, the provided earploops are junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Sound Quality","review":"I purchased this unit for work and was very disappointed with the sound quality. I had several people who I would talk to that complained that there was a buzzing noise.

It felt like parting from an old, close friend. The city of Hull, the river Humber, and the people, scarred, lonely and tired, deeply tired of the simple, but exausting effort of daily living.The changing of times, the confusion we like to call progress, and the many, so many lost souls, crushed to splinters and dust by the wheels of the new era. I'll miss Leo Rivers, the imperfect man with a strong code of duty and morals, trying to understand and make sense, as much for himself as for his clients.

The lyrics are rough and unclear as well. I understand this is often typical of metal, but in this case it is poorly executed. Also, the remake of cars is just that. There is absolutely nothing new or inspired in it. I can't understand why it was remade. It's the exact same song as the original. Anyways, I would not recommend this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great.","review":"Wow. This is Fear Factory's best album yet. It starts slowly with Shock, but Shock soon becomes a heavy track. Then 'Due to the graphic nature of this programme, listner discretion is advised' Edgecrusher springs into action with deafening guitar riffs and one of Cristian's funky basslines. Smasher/Devourer is next, with an agressive style all the way through, Police state 2000 follows in similar style, but with a bit more tune. Descent is next, quite tuneful, not as heavy as the rest but still a good listen, followed by the deafening Hi-Tech Hate in which the drumming is wild. Next is Freedom Or Fire, a powerful metal song with good riffs, followed by the excellent title track, Obsolete. Next is the tuneful Ressurection, marking the end of the machines. The only thing that spoils the album is the trash-track Timlessness, which really belongs on a Westlife album.Other than Tmelessness, though, a great album.

You have your classic Fear Factory(\\"Shock\\", \\"Smasher/Devourer\\"), some rap-metal(\\"Edgecrusher\\"), radio stuff(\\"Descent\\"), and a masterpiece(\\"Resurrection\\"). However, Fear Factory's Obsolete just lacks something that Demanufacture had. It could be the speed. It could be the use of synths. It could be the double bass drumming. That's okay, though. Unfortunately, Obsolete can't match its follow-up, either. Digimortal, their 'sellout' album, has unbelievable double bass, melodic singing, and an interesting flirtation with hip-hop. Although the guitar and bass riffs are very simple and the lyrics and rapping childish, it's still beter than Obsolete. Obsolete just is missing SOMETHING between those two extremes. All in all, great album, and the concept story behind it is hauntingly mesmerizing. It just misses where Demanufacture and Digimortal don't."},{"rating":"2","title":"very different..but","review":"Fear Factory lives up to their name here,,,all of the hardcores are loving this 1 ,but they are afraid of \\"CARS\\".....!

It's an epic told by metal/industrial emotionally fueled music pounding out more adrenaline than a heroin addict. A very human album, very pure and intesifying machine gun poundind like beats. Every single master piece on this album is extremely transcendant and causes a new view on certain things. Fear Factory are maters of getting they're point across, highlty recomended.

The first time I heard was on MTV Beach Brawl. (kinda ironic since I despise MTV for not playing metal) I went and got the album. I must say that this is one of the best albums I ever heard. Metallica USED to be my favorite band, but I think you know who is now! Ever since I got it, I got Demanufacture, and started to realize that the best Metal is the kind you don't see on MTV.

Thought they were really good for what sounded like a industrial death metal band. Then Obsolete came out and they put tempo in their music and became one of my favorite bands.PROS: Great metal music and the vocals have so much range that you get many emotions while listening. Their cover of Cars is great. Resurrection is possibly the best song followed by Desent but the CD is good from the beginning. Shock is a great opening song.CONS: noneJust get it if you're a metal head.

OBSOLETE was my first foray into the \\"harder\\" scene, and it would be an understatement to say I was impressed. This album is a collection of finely tuned, powerful songs of anger and agression. At first, I was annoyed at how Burton Bell changes his voice in the middle of a song. But after listening to it more, the contrasting styles put an original spin on it and set the band out from other cliched metal bands of our time. This is a must buy! After listening to it, I am convinced I have to get all the rest of FF's CDs! Truly, an amazing album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Some people have no idea","review":"OK. This CD is not as good as Demanufacture, but anyone who says this band has no talent, has no clue. Not only is the song writing great, but Dino is one of the fastest guitarists out there, and Raymond can play double kicks that are second only to the likes of Gene Hogland from Strapping Young Lad. I can't believe people actually think that Limp Bizkit has more talent then Fear Factory. Nookie? Come on. Talk about immature lyrics. Fear Factory is a quality metal band.

Also, this cd seems to have a Terminator theme to it,all about machines taking over. Why??? This is so overdone. How many times has this theme been done before??

Even though Burton's vocals get on my nerves and the cramped guitar quality was the same type that annoyed me so much on Metallica's \\"...And Justice for All\\", the riffs are fairly catchy and the drums rule.

To tell the truth i didnt really like digimortal that much (even though it was still good)Dino's amazingly fast guitars, Burton's deep and awesome voice, Christian's low and heavy bass, and Raymonds drumming sounds like a machine gun goin off in an open field make the album one the best metal albums to date. The album goes from a thrashy cool beggining (Shock, EdgeCrusher), to the very good, emotional \\"Descent\\", and then back to kik-*ss metal (Freedom of Fire,Soulwound,Messiah) My favorite song on this is 0-0(Where Evil Dwells) This song is VERY thrashy, loud, and makes you want to beat the (...) out of everyone and everthing in site!

It is so very aggressive, but there are also moments that show that the guys in Fear Factory want to be respected as being great songwriters.The ninth track, \\"Resurection\\" shows that they have the ability to write some really great, powerful music. Burton C.Bell's vocals are unbelievable...man, they go from growling to almost gothic singing, great. Dino Cazares' guitar playing is heavy as hell. Christian Wolbers' bass is excellent...and Raymond Hererra's drumming...can be summed up in word word...UNBELIEVABLE.Listen to \\"Hi Tech Hate\\" or \\"Securitron\\" and you will witness tha power of FEAR FACTORY. I met Burton Bell and Dino and they were really cool guys, buy this cd. The new one, Digimortal is really good, but just not as powerful as this cd. This is the best metal cd I've ever heard.

Songs like Edgecrusher, Smasher/Devourer, and Shock just show you how awesome they still are. Yeah, Bell's clean lyrics might upset other people but just ignore them. They are only brief and to the poin anyway. But what I noticed about this album is that Bell is really screming, unlike their past albums, it sounds like he's more like trying to make his screams sound deeper.

Fredrik Thorendal's guitar skills will also blow dino out of the water, but i guess this ones for all the cool teenyboppers out there who reckon theyre hot stuff by listening to this crud. This band will be long forgotten once all the hype is over and all you sheep find another bandwagon to jump on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Elton John is better than this drivel","review":"This album is mindless. It has no focus, no point, and most importantly no talent. The lead singer is capable of carrying a tune, but rarely does. Screaming the ENTIRE time does not make for very engaging listening. Also, the music itself is incredibly repetitive. Half the songs sound just like the one before. Yes this album is very heavy, but no it is not good just for that reason. I could make a heavy metal album by screeching away on a guitar even though I have no talent at it, but it wouldn't be a good album. This cd is devoid of any solos, due to the fact that they're probably incapable of it. My point in all this is, AVOID THIS ALBUM. The only reason anyone's even heard of these guys is cause of the Korn Family Values tour. Oh yeah and maybe because of the bland Cars remake that's on the credit card commercials......"},{"rating":"1","title":"OH MY GOD","review":"This album gets one star for cars. that's IT. when i first heard that song...i instantly knew i had found the perfect industrial band. heavy riffs, but very melodic. in cars, the sound of the guitar is JUST how i like it, and the dude's voice is absolutely perfect. i LOVE that song. but noooo...when i pick up this album, all i hear is a bunch of friggin screaming, a barrage of drums and a solid wall of guitar. it SUCKS. it sounds exactly like slipknot. down with fear factory. down with slipknot. GO SYSTEM OF A DOWN!"},{"rating":"2","title":"cool beans","review":"wow, this album is absolutely one of the best in my collection. all the songs on this album are good. although i do have my favorites like shock, decent and ressurection. the songs kinda move you if you listen real carefully to the lyrics. i gaurentee anybody that likes the metal type music will like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"not exatcly the heaviest......","review":"an awesome cd. great metal and all. but as far as heavy goes....Cannibal Corpse blasts them away.

The drummer really shows his stuff on this one, and the singer really shows his diverse singing styles, from such things as CARS and DECENT to O-O and other HEAD THRASHERS. A+++++ Recommended highly to those who like the hard-hitting, fast drum, growling guitar, supremo band stuff!"},{"rating":"2","title":"who likes this???? I DO!!!!","review":"FF is a unique band; they are poised on a razor's edge between death metal (which i absolutely hate) and industrial (which i absolutely love). The result is an unlikely and amazing hybrid that i think succeeds on every level, from the bone-crushing \\"shock\\" to the beautiful and ethereal \\"timelessness\\". Definitely their best and most varied album and much better than anything by crowd-pleasers such as korn and bizkit-FF can actually play more than just one type of song!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"alternitive rock has now been made OBSELETE","review":"\\"Obselete\\" is a very good,heavy metal album to have. Fear Factory has written very tight songs with catchy riffs without being commercial whatsoever. I don't believe that this album is better than its predecessor \\"Demanufacture.\\" However, it is still the best album I have heard all year. I do believe that Fear Factory is the best metal band to come out in the '90's.STAND OUT TRACKS \\"Shock\\",\\"Edgecrusher\\",and \\"Resurection\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Heavy and Rough (The Way It SHOULD Be!)","review":"Not the best album ever (gotta give that one to AC/DC's Back in Black, but that's a whole different story), but definitely heads and shoulders above most of the schlock shoved down our collective throats now. This album is excellently heavy, the riffs kick some serious a**, the rhythm parts are awesome, and Burton's vocals have improved drastically. Listen to his asinine vocals from Soul of a New Mahichine (ugh), and on this album. Demanufacture was better then SoaNM, but Burton is no longer just shredding his vocal chords, and has matured as a singer. There's some type of story to the liner notes, but I haven't bothered to read it yet, but the music doesn't suffer b/c of this. (That's a good sign.) All in all, one of the best metal albums to come out since Pantera's Vulgar Display of Power (possibly the DEFINITIVE hardcore metal album of all time), and worthy of the extended playing time it's been getting on my CD player as of late."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute sell out","review":"Fear Factory used to rule.

So when i heard that they got back together i was like YESSSSSSSSSSSSSSS! BUt this is an earlier release, and their older stuff is very good. I like their newer stuff too. Digimortal is ver good but i like this on better. It seems harder and faster. My personal favorite song on here is Edgecrusher cause it has really good music and words. I also like Hi-Tech Hate. THey are all very good though. Every song has a very good beat and the whole album has very good lyrics. THe vocals are very good. I love Burtons voice, he can scream and sing soft. Its a very good cd and you wont be dissapointed if you buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Obsolete > You","review":"This is THE album to own, regardless of what kind of music you prefer. For example, I'm a big Pixies fan. But even my favorite Pixies album-- Surfer Rosa-- simply cannot compare.I'm not a music specialist, so I won't use too many fancy words or even get into too much detail. But one thing is for sure: Burton's demanding vocals-- from the screams to the most beautiful melodies-- are not to be doubted. Get this album by whatever means you must.Before I heard 'Descent', I didn't like music nearly this hard-- but I was drawn in. And so you should be. Do yourself a favor and get this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Greatest Watch Ever.","review":"This gift set come with 3 bands, brown, pink and black.

It doesn't actually come with two MCAT tests. You must do the tests online through AAMC and follow along in the book. One is free and the other costs $35 through AAMC. Also, AAMC offers explanations for all their answers already on the practice test, so this is kind of overkill..."},{"rating":"1","title":"explanations pedestrian, but at least available","review":"silver bullet offers solutions for the lowest common denominator. very basic explanations, often verbose yet incomplete. the extraneous practice questions are not very challenging. this book should *only* be used as an appendage to the more substantial princeton/kaplan reviews. i suggest you buy this book only if you are in dire need of solutions for aamc tests 1 or 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"MAGNIFICENT LISTENING OF THE LORD'S WORD...","review":"Nicol Smith-Spongberg's CD is absolutely amazing.

I deal with difficult people. I applied the clear techniques provided with an offender described for years as \\"a real nasty guy....\\" by previous probation officers. The technique worked immediately, the man expressed appreciation saying \\"You are the first person in your department who ever understood me...I'll do exactly what you told me to do.\\" I could relate scores of other times these techniques have helped over the years. Rick & Rick's set of tapes is also extremely helpful. You won't be sorry you learned this stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Liberate Yourself from Jerks.","review":"This book has an excellent premise: the only way to deal with difficult people is to change the way you respond to them. Think about it. Do any of us ever do what we want to do all the time? Of course not. How many New Year's resolutions have we broken? Well, if we can't control our own behavior for our own good, how can we control someone else's especially when that person's obnoxious ways satisfies some perverse need? Some books on interpersonal conflict recommend that the reader resort to planning biting comebacks or simply ignoring the offending party. Rick and Rick offer more positive and healthier solutions (such as being more empathetic without being a punching bag) that if implemented will help the reader stay sane when under attack and eventually learn to stay above the fray."},{"rating":"2","title":"What motivates jerks","review":"I bought this book to learn how to deal with Jerks, in general. Turns out, Jerks are just misunderstood. This book teaches you how to understand them. Sometimes the book teaches you how to just make it through a jerk's tirade with minimal damage. Sometimes it tells you how to beat jerks at their own game. It would be great if this book were taught in grade school to let bullies, jerks, and twerps know that we're on to them and we know their games.This book is more helpful in personal relationships. It is easier to use these tactics when the jerk you're dealing with doesn't have community or institutional support.To be more effective in taking jerks down at work, you need to have community support. One person against the biggest bully at work isn't likely to be effective since corporate culture actively encourages jerks. One person's \\"proactive, aggressive go-getter\\" is another person's bully. I wish the book had more tips on how to build community around taking down a jerk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Negative Title: Extremely Positive, Empowering Book!","review":"More than any other book, this book has empowered me to understand and work effectively with people of all different personal behavioral/communication styles. Based on the DISC (though the authors change the names of the four poles slightly), it is a well written book that helps people who are having difficulty working or getting along with others understand their own needs and personal style as well as giving solid tips and examples of how to work effectively with those \\"difficult\\" people.I have heartily recommended this book to other leaders that I have worked with over the years with very positive results! The book will make you a better leader, employee, spouse or friend!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Dealing with People Your Can't Stand","review":"This book is very insightful in dealing with different types of people who generally add challenges to your life.

But I made a horrible mistake and bought the audio version.The authors skimped on the production and instead of getting an actor, they decided to present the book themselves. They have a tag-team approach which they're obviously having fun with, but as they're flipping back and forth word by word and finishing each other's sentences, it is incredibly distracting. One of the authors has a great impersonation of a weasely person you can't stand. Unfortunately, that's his real voice and the nasal delivery completely discredits the content of his words.I can say the book is OK, but don't buy the audio version!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"We buy books like this to help us learn techniques to deal with those people \\"that you can't stand\\" but if you have your eyes open at all, we can all be \\"those people\\" when we are having a bad day.Really informative and glad I bought and read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Book arrived speedily and in perfect condition!","review":"Everything was fine with the shipping of the book.

The authors have focused their descriptions on the most common problem behaviors. The most striking thing you will see in the book is your own behavior.

Though his translations are incredibly luminous, he clearly admits their limits:\\"...Rilke's elaborate and thoroughgoing labor on sound cannot be conveyed. In English his poems sound colorless.

AIMR later dropped it and returned to White and Sondhi for the year 2000. Personally, I agree.This should be a fairly good financial analysis book, but because of its uncommunicative wording, it is not appealing indeed. Agree with a reader from England, it is dull.If the authors add their comments and pour some additional opinion and insights, this book will be much better.It appears that the book lost its good image (since 1973?) because most of its current readers have read the White & Sondhi's book.

You can reuse the storage jar after you have finished all of the thermometers as a bonus.Be careful, these are not meant to be cooked with the roast like standard reuseable themometers. These are plunged in and removed from time to time to check the heat. If you leave it in during the entire cooking process you could get very inaccurate results and possibly ruin the roast!

Reading about the relationship between Jack and Arabella reminded me of watching a fish helplessly flounder at the end of a line until it dies. The heroine is manipulated and controlled, never has any real power or personality, yet at the end the hero is felled by love for her. The book again pointed out to me the problem in this genre--formula, formula, formula. Where are the books that are entertaining and yet representative of the really great relationships that do exist in this world? Where are the interesting female characters who actually have a brain and might not want to fall in love with a weird control freak, no matter if he is a duke with an interesting white streak in his hair? Get the book out of the library if you want to give it a shot. Don't spend the $6.99."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great beginning","review":"I've read most of her novels and loved most of them.

There was no real substance to their relationship or, for that matter, to them. Jack was not loveable in the least. I couldn't see what Arabella saw in him. And when they do find his sister in the French prison, I was really hoping for a happy ending to that situation, but was sadly disappointed there as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really enjoyed this book","review":"I've read other books by Feather and really was disappointed, not this time. I loved Arabella and Jack. I loved the hint of danger in Jack and Arabella's good sense. She carefully planned her actions and didn't engage in the usual historical romance virginal silliness. No wacky friends or over the top villians. The book could have used more suspense or more tension. Don't skip this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sweet Romance","review":"Almost a Brideby: Jane FeatherReviewer: Pamela Ackerson (author of Home of the Braves trilogy)A Sweet RomanceThis story is right up to par along with the rest of Ms. Feather's novels. A feisty heroine, Arabella, and a revengeful hero named Jack clash and play witty games with each other. Kick your feet up and enjoy, from the very first pages with him winning an estate and all it's contents to the last page where ... (no I am not going to spoil the ending) ... you smile in satisfaction, Almost a Bride is one of the better historical romances available on the shelf. It is a delightful story immersing the reader into each scene, a romance to keep you turning the pages until the very end. Definitely a book to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME","review":"Loved, loved this book! I generally have loved all the books by Jane Feather that I've read - this one was one of the best. The hero was yummy, and heroine had so much charm, backbone, and gumption. The two of them had so much chemistry they fairly sizzled. I did feel that the part of the story where they go to France veered away from the general direction of the story, but all in all a very satisfying read. Had elements of \\"The Scarlet Pimpernel\\" in it, which was great. Loved it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and practical","review":"This collection is an interesting look at democratic education.

He found it hard to keep his balance and kept falling off. One time he almost hit his head on the side of the pool. I think it needs to be made more stabilized so it doesn't tip as easily as it does. I took it away and am bringing it back to toys r us as I feel a child could really get hurt if they lose balance and are near the side of the pool. What is worse is the instructions say to stay in a water depth the depth of your child which means the shallow end which means more turning and more chance of falling off and hitting the side. I think it is very unsafe!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome toy for any age","review":"My 4 year old brother just recieved this toy yesterday and he LOVES it.

Both her and her older sister have a blast on it. I originally saw the Wave Cruiser in the pool of one of my customers, so I asked him about it. He said his kids loved it, so I bought it. I was surprised at how fast it moved, especially for an inflatable pool toy. It's surprisingly durable, I bought it years ago, and they still have it and use it.

The issue here is the Kindle version; there are so many typos as to almost ruin the experience of reading the book. Really stupid stuff, too, in addition to the errant lack of a space between two words. Things like saying \\"Popside\\" as opposed to \\"Popsicle\\", \\"geyser\\" instead of \\"geezer\\", et cetera. If it only happened a couple of times it would be annoying but somewhat forgivable, but 18% into the book (by Kindle's reckoning), I've counted more than twenty errors. Come on, Amazon. You charge $13.99 for this Kindle edition-fourteen bucks-for something that has more errors in it than a dyslexic sixth grader would commit. This is inexcusable. Fix the problem, and refund the purchase price to those of us that you have duped with your shoddy editing."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Hiasasen's better strories","review":"All of this author's books are somewhat similar, but I laughed harder at this one than any other's - maybe because I've done some bass fishing myself.

Very happy with purchase and will buy again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Read other Hiaasen books instead","review":"Professional bass fishing is ripe for satire, and based on \\"Strip Tease\\", I thought Hiaasen would be just the man for the job. Instead, he's served up an undercooked stew filled with offhand references to gruesome death. By aiming at fanatical fishermen and sleazy TV evangelists, Hiaasen misses both. Reading this is like playing a game of \\"Marco Polo\\" in a very big pool: laughs are there, but just out of reach, and what sounds promising usually gets you a noseful of chlorinated water. If you like character more than caricature, skip this book"},{"rating":"1","title":"overrated","review":"Amusing, but unrealistic if you know anything at all about bass tournaments.

Buy it, Read it, Have a GOOD TIME!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The funniest book I've ever read!","review":"This is the best book Carl Hiaasen has written to date (and I've read them all)! This book is about pro bass tournaments, which is definitely not an interest of mine, but the plot nonetheless drags you in fast. Rather sane at first, by half way through the book you learn the plot and the characters are absolutely wacko and hilarious. I was sitting in court one day no less, reading this book (killing time), and laughed so hard I nearly got thrown in jail!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, exciting and different.","review":"I was given this book by a friend because she knew I was a bass fisherman and avid outdoorsman. The book is about murder and corruption, but interestingly enough, is staged around the pro fishing circuit. Obviously there is a lot of money in television distribution and what shows are hot and what show are not--so the scenario is not as way out as it might sound. This book is lively and very fun to read. It is not hard to believe and it can be extra fun for someone who is into bass fishing because the author obviously knows the sport well. I handed it to a friend one weekend and he loved it, too! I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of his best","review":"You'll either love Carl Hiaasen's books or you'll loathe them. His usual themes are at play here (defending the ecosystem, corporate land deals, corrupt politicians), as well as well-worn characters like Skink and Jim Tile. This, Hiaasen's 2nd book, is set apart by the sheer outrageousness of the plot...corruption and murder in the bass fishing industry!? This one makes Sick Puppy or Stormy Weather look like Grisham novels.If you've never read Hiaasen, this is a good place to start. If you're already a fan you should've read this one already. Be warned, though...this may be the most gruesome one of the bunch. One of the baddies spends half the book with a decaying severed dog's head clamped to his arm. And, while most of Hiaasen's books carry a serious moral message, it's never fed to us in such a shocking manner. No spoonful of sugar here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carl makes me happy","review":"Carl Hiassen's books always make me laugh out loud. I love all of his books and highly recommend them all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carl's finest -- and that is high praise indeed","review":"This is just about the best book in Carl Hiaasen's impressive canon. While I still have a lot of respect for some of his later works -- Sick Puppy, Strip Tease and Skinny Dip being at the top of this list -- this book is superior in that it tells a very compelling mystery story that does not take a back seat to his trademark loony humor. There is also a sharper tone of ecological outrage in this book than in others, even though that is obviously a theme that runs through all of his work. Finally, this probably is the funniest appearance by Skink that I've read -- his climactic encounter with the televangeslist had me laughing so hard I was embarrassed by what people near me must have thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"wacky characters, wacky scenario, funny","review":"Carl Hiasson has done it again. what a fun ride through his Florida that he loves. Is he Skink, himself?

It was confusing to see the word \\"burn\\" when it was supposed to be \\"bum\\". Is this a Kindle transposition problem?

Kalb is ridiculous.","review":"Anyone who puts the brutish, relatively poorly skilled Shaq at the top of the list is missing more than half of his brains. Kalb, a stat geek, makes the cardinal sin of doing what should never be done: comparing players of different eras. It cannot be done. Example, he compares Bird vs. Erving based on a 1981 playoff matchup. At the time, Bird was approaching his prime, while Erving was already well past his. That's the kind of slippery thinking that is found throughout this book.In the end, this is just one guy's subjective take, certain to anger scores of NBA fans and basketball historians."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this a joke???","review":"You can draw any of this names out of a hat and make an argument as to who should be number 1. (take your pick)Magic, Bird, Jordan, Kareem, Russell, Wilt, Oscar. Anyone that even considers shaq as a top ten or even top twenty doesn't know NBA basketball. All this writer saw was that every other book out there had Jordan at number 1 and he felt he needed to grabs someones attention by doing something different. Stats dont say a thing about any of the players I just mentioned, this guys were extra special because they had character, they were winners, they signified what was good about the league. I take the Admiral or Dream in their prime over Shaq anyday. Dont believe the hype, shaq is one of the best ever, but never make the mistake of putting him at number 1. This book should be banned."},{"rating":"1","title":"He's wrong","review":"Decent read...except he's wrong. How he could list Shaq as the #1 player of all time is beyond comprehension. I could understand the argument for Chamberlain, but MJ's teams were far more dominant, due to his airness exclusively. But his forecast includes Shaq winning at least 3 more titles. One gets the feeling he ranked the players like this to create controversey...but that doesn't make him right."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"The book lacks objectivity. The chapter on Jordan strives to justify putting him down the list at #3 by citing his absence from the game while arguments for putting Shaq at #1 focus only on the pros and mentions none of the cons.Don't get me wrong, I'd have a hard time being objective myself but stats are only cited when they support the point of view of the author.The book does nothing to \\"set the record straight\\".

The neighbor's dogs, as loud as they are, do not trigger the device. My dog, when he barks, triggers the device, 1 out of every 3-4 times. When he did trigger it, there was an immediate change in his demeanor... I don't think he liked it. But because it was so infrequent, no dog learns anything.

IT WORKED! We kept the Bark Free on the audible setting so we could be sure that it was going off, set up a video camera and headed out. After the first bark, the Bark Free went off and she gave it a look like, \\"WTF?\\" and stopped barking. That pretty much did it. She still gets anxious, but at least there's no more barking and whining. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Does the job!","review":"I had a neighbor that would put their dog outside.

I tracked this item daily in anticipation to use it. Finally the day came and I immediately tested it, on the far end of the house so as not to annoy family or my dog. Ok so the audible tone works (OUCH), and even the \\"inaudible\\" is somewhat audible. Now I couldn't wait to install and test. Of course I pointed it towards their yard and plugged in.

When UPS came the smaller dog barked, and I had to explain to the poor UPS woman why that shrill, horrible noise was going off... she gave me an odd look, probably because the dog was STILL BARKING.On top of that, only about 1/4 of the time did the unit actually react to my dog barking, and he was 4\\" away from it! I put it on the floor on the other side of a fence in my house, and he stood at the fence and it only went off once in a rare while.

I have 2 German Shepherds. About 8 months old. It seemed they had gotten used to it. I tried to change it to audible to see if that would help once they seemed to ignore it. I will have to say that one of the dogs still stays away from it but, The other dog doesn't care at all. So I am on the fence to whether or not this product was worth buying. I wish the unit had more options (maybe louder or different tones) to choose from. More options may have helped in my situation. The dog that ignores it is a VERY stubborn dog but now what do I do?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I did quite a bit of research before spending money on this, it was more expensive before, I think... everyone criticized me and I insisted it would work. We have two dogs, an older (7) cocker spaniel and a super hyper mixed-breed (4). When one of them starts barking the other just gets super excited and barks as well, it hurts our ears so bad! It's the elevator, street noises, motorcycles, anything'll get them going. Well - Lentek Bark Free - I tried the ultrasonic option and nothing happened. I tried the audible option (risking hearing loss, as I live in an apartment) - nothing happened. Simply, nothing happened. Its as if they 'didn't get it'. It was so frustrating.... will keep trying with other resources, though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"This product is a total waste of money..I tried it both ways ultrasonic and audible..It didnt affect my dogs what so ever i tried it right next to them and farther away they still bark..All that happened was my ears were left ringing when i tired it audible..Do not buy and look for a different brand if u are going to buy ultraonic..."},{"rating":"2","title":"stopped barking","review":"Stopped my lab from waking us up every morning between 6:00 and 6:30.

Unfortunately, it has no particular effect on my dogs. They glance at it and keep on barking, and sometimes my Pomeranian even walks up to the device and intentionally barks at it, in time with the chirps, both audible and inaudible (depending on setting - I've tried both).

I did it manually and they just stood there and barked AT it. I think they were laughing at it. The only way this would get them to stop barking is if I threw it at them (which I would never do).Don't waste your money or time.Also, the item was ultimately defective. I would plug it in and it would not stay \\"on\\". The power cord/jack was screwed up."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solved Two Problems","review":"I bought this after reading the reviews,hoping it would stop my pup from barking while I'm gone. I wasn't even aware he was barking until a neighbor complained. I was leary, but decided to spend the extra cost because you can plug this one into a electrical outlet, which means no batteries ( yay!!! ). I came home from shopping Saturday and went straight to my neighbor to see if he had been barking. She told me there was not a sound to be heard. But the plus to this is it even worked on my annoying 8 year old cat that thinks he needs to howl at night, waking me several times throughout the night. I have been dealing with this problem for years and only wish I had thought to get one of these years ago. So any of you cat owners who have one of those loud verbal cats this is your answer. Now, when he does talk, it is very low so he won't set this off."},{"rating":"2","title":"You too can be Bark Free","review":"I bought this product for my miniture duchshund. He barks so much when I take him to my mother's the neighbors always comment. I did not think it worked until I got it home and my husband was doing some remodeling in our home. Both our dogs started barking so I plugged the Bark Free in. The duchshund went after our Chesepeake because he would not stop barking. I started saying \\"no bark\\" and they stopped and the Bark Free stopped. My dogs have gotten the idea. I had to tell the dogs to stop barking the first couple of times I used the Bark Free until the dogs got the idea. It works great for me!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bark Free helps!","review":"I have had one of these for about three years now. It has helped! The dog figures out to bark a little quieter so she doesn't set it off. I now put it on audible because the neighbor won't do anything about his dog barking so when his dog barks and sets it off he hears the sound of the Bark Free and he doesn't like it, so he has actualy been trying to keep it somewhat quiet. That works for me! It doesn't stop them completely but it has made a significant difference here..."},{"rating":"2","title":"yahoo it works.....","review":"freak'n little yappy SOB shuts-up now!the owners look puzzled...why ain't he yapp'n like normal.I just smile... =)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just doesn't work!","review":"What can I say, the product doesn't even slow down the dog parking. Tried multiple settings from low to high sensitivity; even tried the audio which irritated the neighbors enough to call the cops. Either the dog is deaf or the product is a bust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bark Free - Almost there","review":"I bought the Bark Free on the advice of a friend who said it worked well with her dog. I got it for my terrier as I moved into a new apartment and didn't want to disturb my neighbors. Based on the reviews posted here I turned on the audible tone so I could hear what set off the device. Being a rather loud sneezer, I realized my sneezes set off the device quite a bit. Also when I was doing the dishes the pots clanging would set off the device. My dog was aware of the sound and it would limit his barking to maybe 2 barks but then he bark again and his barking was a little less, but he was still barking. In the end I decided to return the item as it was too sensitive and a lot of things set it off, making the association with the barking and the sound of the device probably hard to tell to my dog. It did condition me to be more aware of my sneezing...but I can't really control how many times I sneeze...and it's not called the sneeze free human training device."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for my annoying neighbor dogs","review":"Well, I'm writing this review after having purchased this about 5 months ago. I wanted to give it a good chance. The neighbors dogs continue to bark with great frequency, despite this being placed a mere 10 feet from where the dogs reside. Eventually I plan on hacking the thing apart, taking the sound out and piping it to a stereo with some high powered tweeters, to see if that will do any good, but I haven't gotten around to it. Frankly, I doubt anything that doesn't produce a pain response from being loud enough will do the job."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for playful pups","review":"I have 4 dogs, two older rescue and two sibling miniature pinschers, just turned a year old and full of play. One barks when he is playing, when he is waiting on his food, you get the idea. It works on the other dogs, but not him. I am afraid he is going to desensitize them because he barks right through both the silent and audible tones. It is sensitive enough to work in a large area of the house, around corners of rooms, also. Since it works on 3 of the 4 dogs, I would recommend it, but know it doesn't work on all of them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work","review":"I bought this product to help keep one of my dogs from barking, because once she does, she sets off the others and it is only a matter of time until you can hear them from the driveway, in a car. However, it didn't work. My dogs continue to bark and have only stopped due to learning patience not because of this anti barker. My advice, work with you dog in order to get them to accept being in a crate instead of buying something this useless."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bark Starter","review":"I bought this product with high hopes that it would stop my girlfriend's maltipoo from barking. He has an extremely high pitched annoying bark. My hopes were dashed when her dog actually went over to the bark machine and barked directly at it. I wish I could put one of those shock collars on him but my girlfriend would never go for that. I guess I should try to contact the Dog Whisperer. I'm desperate and he's actually barking as I write this review. Anyways, the product was extremely disappointing.

It didn't stop my dog from barking 100%, but it helped by about 50%, so that was something at least... but then less than 2 months after I got it, it stopped working. Completely dead. It wasn't exposed to water or incliment weather, I read the other reviews about that, so I brought it inside anytime there was even a heavy dew forecasted, and it was installed under a roof when it was outdoors.

SO I had to use size 5 instead of 4 to mail my items. I have same size of items I shipped all the time and I had to use lots of size 5. that cost me some money and waste of envelopes Yellow material is very cheap and tears out easy when trying to pack.Same thing with number 1i do not know how amazon allows these people to sell their stuff when you are not getting what you paid for.

If you have a point-and-shoot or DSLR with a couple of small lenses it's probably perfect. But if you have even one long lens there's no way to partition this bag to get them both to fit.I gave the bag 4 stars based on build quality and the fact that it is a really nice bag for the price. It has lots of pockets and places to stash memory cards, film, filters, and all kinds of stuff. A bit more padding on the strap would have given it 5 stars easy. This would also make a nice bag for a camcorder or even your lunch.Anyway, I gave the bag to my neighbor. We both have Nikon D70's, but his telephoto is physically much shorter than mine, so it should be perfect for him.Currently I'm using a Lowepro backpack case which holds everything I have, including a tripod and Nikon flash.
