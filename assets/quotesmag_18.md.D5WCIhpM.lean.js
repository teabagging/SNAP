I saw one reviewer describe the fact that it sounds like entire frequency ranges may be missing from the mastering. I agree, it sounds terrible, like something went wrong with the remastering process.This band deserves a real remaster job with some fullness and without the tinny digitalized sound quality. No wonder we're getting so many great songs for so little. I read that Essential H & O is just Ultimate H & O repackaged and Ultimate was plagued with the same poor 'remastering'. These three releases are all probably sourced from the same hack remaster job.I'm surprised this isn't mentioned in more reviews.

The voice of Darryl Hall is only rivaled by Boy George as a white boy with soul. On this compilation, his vocals are superb along with the melodies and harmonies on these hit tunes. \\"I Can't Go For That (No Can Do)\\" still stands tall as a classic and seamless merging of pop and r&b, as does \\"Sara Smiles\\". Even though the guys' music was simple at first listen, the lyrics spoke volumes about the thought and care put into each of the songs. Rediscovering the pure joy and excitement of these songs make me want to relive my childhood all over again..well on second thought, I'd rather not. But \\"One on One\\" and \\"Private Eyes\\" are songs that possibly could even make it in today's diverse musical environment. These guys rock !!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pure chewing satisfaction","review":"\\"Wait for Me\\" and \\"It's a Laugh\\" are okay. \\"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'\\" is a bad song with too many apostrophes in the title.But every song after that is perfect.

Being the fact that it had 18 tracks and a eye catching price tag, I figured it'd be a great deal for the both of us. I guess I was wrong. The cd doesn't contain Hall and Oates' biggest hit, She's Gone. This is my dad's favorite song, and the fact that it's on the essential Hall and Oates, but not this one, is a scam so you'll buy the essential hits, the more expensive of the two, and not this. What a disappointment, it's not like all 18 tracks on here are very good. There's some that are pretty bad, like track 3 for instance.

Compare the sound of the songs on this disc to that of some of the un-remastered albums they have on cd.The CD focuses on the RCA years, so unfortunately, you won't find a remastered version of She's Gone (can you get a remastered version of this somewhere else?). It does have a version of Adult Education, which I remember hearing when it was in regular rotation on the radio back in the eighties, that I don't think was available on CD before. Other than that, everything else is available elsewhere.If you are a fan, I'd recommend buying this just for the remastered sound quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm addicted to this cake.","review":"I love how light and delicate this cake is, delicious flavor, too.

After that, I never laid my fingers on this book again. It's been sitting collecting dust on my shelf for over 2 years. I want to sell it, but man, lots of people are selling it for under 2 bucks. I spent over ... and didn't get anything in return. Believe it or not, it's so heavy that you wouldn't want to carry arround.

It won't tell you anything useful in any way, shape, or form. It's coverage of the Java language is useless. It has no explation as to how parts of Java interact with the other parts of Java. The examples are idiotic and have no real application to anything, including academic exercises. Instead of focusing on how to extend the JApplet interface, the authors have chosen to extend the JFrame interface which will only run if you decide to use Java as an application (like MSWord) instead of an internet Applet. This tends to leave out large portions of what would be called useful information. In general if you value your brain, avoid this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could use better typesetting for accessibility.","review":"I don't think I need glasses I regularly print documents at 75% and keep my monitor resolution at 1280 by 1024(20-inch).

It is written as if objects were an after thought, has very strange explanations, and poor quality, overly simple examples.The \\"Common Programming Errors\\", \\"Good Programming Practice\\" and \\"Tips\\" are silly, trivial and clutter what little logic the chapters have to offer. The authors teaching philosophy seems to be: Throw in every programming tip anyone ever thought of. This is just another cookie-cutter book with a new cover. At 61.00 USD, this clone is a real rip off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Java programming book","review":"Despite all the negative reviews I purchased this book and so far I don't regret it. It is a very practical book about Java and was able to put to use what I read at my job. I like the fact that it compares Java with C++ so that It gives you an idea about which tool is best suited to do a task. By reading the whole book you will know undoubtedly become a serious Java programmer.

Thought this book might be good, but hang on... price of a book doesn't say everything.If you like pondering for half hour why a particular line did something, then go ahead and use this book, its poorly organized otherwise. In my opinion, I just didn't like this book all too much, and would rather care less about their examples, even though they are simple examples. What they don't explain is how to think like a programmer, just what certain commands in Java does.People with programming experience in other languages (esp. C, C++), you'll have no problem using this book, but otherwise don't bother, you can do better... unless of course your instructor told you that this book is required for the course too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Have these guys programmed in real world???","review":"This book hardly teaches you anything about real- world Java programming.

However, if anyone expects to be proficient in Java after reading this book, you will be disappointed. Java is composed of many different and sometimes complicated topics. This book attempts to give you an overview of all of them. In some cases, the details you need to write your own code are lacking.

I would not recommend this book to someone with no programming experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Book on Java Programming I've Ever Found!","review":"I learned how to program procedural languages during the 1980s and tripped and fumbled over learning object oriented programming in the 1990s (for me, programming is a hobby, not my vocation). My library is filled with books on how to program Java but no book ever took into consideration how to systematically teach the intricacies of Java in a formalized way. Until now. This book is the best book on learning Java that I've seen to date. It's a textbook, and anybody who's gone to high school or college should be familiar with how textbooks work. There are copious examples, sample problems (with answers), clear definitions, well organized passages and much more that you'll need to learn Java.

Its amazing how low some peoples standards are."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really bad! These guys need to learn how to write.","review":"The most confusing programming book I have ever read. I am used to insightful, clear explainations like those typically found O'Reilly's Java books. This book doesn't even come close. The book give the reader the false sense that Java is just another procedural language like C or RPG. This is not surprising; books written for a procedural language and adapted to a new language often maintain the mind set of the old language. These authors clearly do not understand how to think in object-oriented terms and the sure don't know how to teach it."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to sell your book.","review":"As with all the Deitel books, there seems to be an extraordinary number of glowing 5-star stating that book is the greatest book ever written mixed in with lots of horrible reviews.

I'm using it for an online college class and it's awful. The exercises are poorly written an often need further clarification. Many of the exercises put at emphasis on math in such a way you need to be a mathmetician instead of a programmer to figure them out. As a reference book it would be O.K. but it's not good for classes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely great book","review":"I really liked the way you have organized each chapter -brief introduction; very clear explanations; easy to understand examples; explanation of the codes in the examples and more importantly the concluding section containing the summary and other details.

The book serves my students very well, introducing basic principles, reinforcing them with real code, pointing out common errors and performance related issues. There are some minor errors in the book, but any user with fundamental knowledge in Java will be able to easily circumvent any problems encountered. I consistently get favorable feedback from the students on the usefulness of the book. The most frequent complaint that I receive is related to the durability of the book - it does have a tendancy to fall apart - which is a manufacturing issue rather than a content issue. OVERALL A DAMNED GOOD BOOK."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for a fundamental understanding of Java/OOP","review":"I was looking for a book that gave a clear and concise explanation of Java and Object Oriented Programming, and that's exactly what I got! Unlike many other books, the examples are complete Java programs, which makes them easy to follow. As I read the book, I was pleasantly surprised to find that it was not a struggle to understand the concepts. Recently, I did not buy an Apache Web Server book on amazon.com because of the negative reviews. I've now decided I have to make a trip to the bookstore this weekend in order to make up my own mind. I highly recommend this book to anyone interested in obtaining a good solid foundation in Java and not just tips and tricks!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners. Pretty comprehensive, but poorly written","review":"The authors are constantly trying to explain multiple things at once (which they do poorly), and when they have a point to make they repeat themselves 3-4 times with various types of text. In each section, they try to give general programming tips, java programming tips (redundant to the section), explain the material of the section, explain the details of a Java program and make a feeble attempt to explain the details of a new concept brought out in the Java program (which you will need to know for the next 10 programs but which wont be explained for 4 chapters). They explain these things all at the same time. The material is poorly organized (the book is organized as if they are using the same template and applying it to Java) and the explanations are weak."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great way to learn","review":"The material is presented in a manner that makes it very motivating for the \\"student\\".

This is a good book if you know nothing about Java or programming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book gets you up to speed fast","review":"If you are looking for a book that gets you up and running with Java really fast, this is it. While the book could be tighter in many places, remember that publishing for a fast moving technology is a tradeoff. You either come up with a very good book that is awfully late or a mediocre book that is a rush job. I would give the authors 75 points out of a possible 100.I like the book because it teaches through examples. Most of the book is filled with examples and their annotations. In some ways this bottom-up approach is more preferable to initial learning than the top-down approach of theory first and then examples.This is a good book for beginners and intermediate level programmers. I do hope that the book was less expensive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average book, way too expensive!","review":"This Java How to program is an average book, compare to many other Java books. However, this book is about the twice the price of the other Java books. Why?I would rate the book a 3 stars. However, when you consider the $68 tag, I think it only deserves a 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good \\"beginner's\\" Java Textbook","review":"There have been a lot of negative reviews on this book. Two things to keep in mind, though, is that this is a beginning programming book, and was written as a college-level textbook. That's why I liked it so much. Other Java books I tried were too technical and assumes you already have a programming background. This book gives general and Java-specific programming advice with lots of exercises. It's organized in a manner that eases you into the concept of programming rather than grouping all related Java topics together, so it may seem to lack organization. But it has a good pace and helps build a solid programming foundation without being lightweight, unlike other cursory beginning java books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Java Made Inaccessible","review":"This book has some strengths, but it takes a inordinate amount of time to find them. There is no glossary, and the student has no idea which applet or abstract windowing toolkit to import or why. I find little connection between the exercises and the text examples. What we need is a concise introduction, one that gets to the point. This is not that book."},{"rating":"1","title":"UGLY!","review":"This book is comparable to the author's web site. Their web site's home page is gaudy and has a terrible user interface. Its a great example of what NOT to do. This book is of the same quality. If you want to \\"learn\\" to write software like that, then this book is for you. You'll find the same clueless approach throughout this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"5 stars ???????????","review":"These 4 and 5 star reviews have got to be fake. No serious programmer could give the poorly written explanations and silly tips in this book even an average rating."},{"rating":"1","title":"repetitive and unclear","review":"This book is very unclear and repetitive. They attempt to cover the same topics that are available for free on the sun web site, except they fail miserably. Not only will you not learn how to program by reading this book, you will gain no apprecation for object-oriented programming either."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the BEST Java books, learn how to Java with this book","review":"I have read many Java books, I own most of them. This book covers the basics and introduces the advanced topics very well.Buy this book if you want to learn to think Java and program Object-Oriented."},{"rating":"1","title":"Incomprehensible OO discussion!","review":"The books explanations of object-oriented programming lacks focus, mixes 3 or 4 metaphors and used terms that serve only to confuse the reader. Reading the OO explanations is like reading a psychology test book: A simple concept is made to seem complicated and scientific by using verbose explanations filled with excessive long-winded terminology. In addition, the book is downright boring and poorly organized. I can't believe anyone could objectively rate this book better than 3 unless they are rating it in a vacuum."},{"rating":"1","title":"New event model - WHAT??","review":"These authors can't even get their own back cover promo correct: New event model? The \\"new\\" event model was new 2 years ago in JDK 1.1. \\"New Abstract Windows Toolkit\\"? There is no 'new AWT'. What they appear to be referring to is called Swing (and AWT stands for Abstract Windowing Toolkit). The book's content is filled with misinformation and poorly worded explanations. These authors do not understand Java; they obfuscate concepts with simple-minded verbose explanations. How could anyone consider this a \\"classic\\"? Maybe classically bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsound for CS1 courses","review":"I have taught CS1 with this book in its C, C++ and Java incantations. The examples and ogainization are all quite similar. People either love the book or hate it. For myself, I think waiting 6 chapters to cover object oriented issues, like how to write a class, is a serious error. Students tend to get \\"Procedural Brain damage\\" when object oriented programming is not introduced ealier.The book is not a good reference and becomes shelf-ware after a first read. CS1 topic coverageis OK, but not great. Too much AWT and not enough data structures.If you are looking for a good CS1 book, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still bad","review":"Many bad reviews of the 2nd edition were from experienced programmers who understand Java and object-oriented programming. Nothing has changed in this edition - Programmers new to Java and OO will not get a thorough understanding of Java or OO with this hodgepodge. The book's code is poorly written and explanations are hard to follow. You'll learn more bad habits than good from this thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"A rich price for a poor textbook","review":"I am sorry to say that I was required to spend $68 this title. It gives examples without explaining all the terms and concepts involved, and it mixes together discussions of applets and stand-alone programs in a way I found confusing and illogical. Even the course instructor had a low opinion of the book and did not use it much in classroom teaching."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it!","review":"I bought this book because it is required for a Java class. This book should be only 1/3 of its current thickness. The book must be written in a way that one Deitel wrote a paragraph once, the other Deitel wrote it a second time, then the two wrote the same thing together one more time. The whole book just repeats itself over and over again starting from the introduction. It will be a miracle that anyone can survive reading this book without being bore to death.DO NOT BUY THIS BOOK! Ask your professor to change to another book! You will thank me for this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Java How To Program","review":"there is too much confusing and disorganized information in this book. It might be a reference book for well experienced java programmers but definitely it is not a book for an introduction to Programming class."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book for beginners","review":"I have about 30 books on java. This one is the best. A lot of examples and explanations are simple and complete."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book doesn't rock - it is a rock","review":"I have to disagree with the previous reviewer. Java is easy - this book makes it difficult. Java is the most well-designed computer language there is. This book's sophomoric approach to Java makes learning Java difficult. All the one-star reviews are there for several reasons: The author's don't fully comprehend Java or OO. Their writing style is horrid. The excessive number of tips, cautions, icons, and etc. clutter an already laborious, boring, and confusing format. You can't write a book for C, adapt it to C++ and then to Java and expect readers to comprehend a new programming paradigm. In short, this book suffers from procedural brain damage and they want their readers to have it too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the time or money","review":"The authors don't use standard Java terminology. As an example, their explanation of reference passing is very confusing. They say things like variables are passed \\"call-by-value\\". This is just one of the many C-like terms they use which demonstrate they don't understand object-oriented programming. Reading this book is like reading grossly over commented code. Not only do they clutter valuable information with minutia, their explanations are sophomoric. The book's explanations of object-oriented programming lacks focus: One discussion can mix 3 or 4 metaphors which only serves to confuse readers. Concepts are made to seem complicated with verbose explanations and excessive terminology. In addition, the book is downright boring and poorly organized. If you want a book someone will have to explain to you - this is it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Java How to program","review":"I bought this book because it was recommended. Well I will tell you now don't bother with it. It is hard to understand, and throws everything to your face.If you are a beginner try Ivor Horton's Beginning Java2. Dietel and Dietel please do us all a favour, don't publish another Java book just for the sake of doing so."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book teaches programming ? in Java ?","review":"I guess you can find a needle in a haystack too. Have these guys ever taken a writing class? Read a book on how to present information clearly? You could write a book on what NOT to do for each of these topics using this book as an example."},{"rating":"2","title":"In-depth approach to Java","review":"A good book. Rich on the content and clear on the subject.It is a very good book for the Java serious beginners.Many topics that were not clear to me before reading this excellent book; now it is very well understood.The author has taken so much time and effort to spoon feed us which not many have that patience today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the best beginning Java Book","review":"I am new to java programming. I started on learning the language several times with different books. And I have a fairly comprehensive computer book shelf at home. Deitel & Deitel is simply the very best java teaching book I have encoutered. However there is allways room to be better, hence 4 stars ;)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Systematic and Logical","review":"This book guides the reader through in a systematic and logical way. I find it rather easy to grasp concepts from this book than from most other computer books. Very good for self-study! However, to learn more in-depth details about Java, a more advanced book should be used."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth it if you are new to Java","review":"In their efforts to parallel their \\"C++-how to program\\", the Deitels have only made their \\"Java -how to program\\" very confusing for a beginner -Java, unlike C++ is a purely object oriented language, hence it doesn't make sense to see real object oriented programming start in chapter 8 -while the reader is supposed to take whatever is presented in first 7 chapters at face value.The Deitels spend way too many pages explaining every concept and that accounts for the sheer girth of the book and a lot of it is redundant.This is a ok book if you want to see a lot of sample code or if you want to try the exercises but definitely not the book if you are a beginner.I would recommend \\"Thinking in Java\\" by Bruce Eckel if you are new to Java and then a look at this book to look at the huge sample code and try out some of the challenging exercises."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for beginners. (Really beginners)","review":"I do not recommend this book unless you are really, really new to programming. It expends too much space explaining basic things and too litle space explaining what is truly Java and OOP. There are explanations that come too late in the text and for instance you understand some things in chapter 4 that should be explained in chapter 1."},{"rating":"2","title":"Heaven and Hell!","review":"This is a Bible--For a hands-on programmer. Save you tons of time to learn things. I just studied this book for 2 weeks and learnt all I want and made a online auction site by myself with JDBC and JAVA SERVLET. (Of course I have experiences in Java before and love it.) But for those begginers it could be a nightmare, since they can not get any sense from tons of examples. You could see that who rated this book low is actually READING that book not USING that book. So my opinion is: Hey, guys, get your feet wet, not only read but play with those examples, compile them, run them! I bet you would feel excellant when you go through most of the NEAT, HELPFUL, CLASSICAL examples in this book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened here?","review":"I was hoping that it wasn't just me. I've started this book 4 times now and just can seem to make any sense of it.

My book club selected this book last month. Something we all regreted. We're wondering if something got lost in the translation from Spanish to English. The biggest flaw with this book: no plot."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time and money","review":"I agree with the other one star. There is next to nothing here worthwhile. What is of value could have been written on a page or two.Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Garbage","review":"This book is loaded with extraneous stuff but has very little on actually marketing a tax business. In fact he talks about almost anything but that.It could be written as how to start a business and I would give it a 3but as far as tax businesses go you are going to get zero as fsr as creative marketing ideas. The book is dated as well. Needs an update...Dont waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Service","review":"The book was supposed to be shipped within 1 to 2 days, but instead was postmarked 1 week after. I ordered several books at the same time from different vendors and this book was the last to arrive over 1 week after the others. The quality of the book also was low in that the pages were bent and the cover had corners that were bent as well. I would never buy from this vendor again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent read, informative and entertaining","review":"This is a very well written book that examines the topic of tax consulting from several interesting angles. Interviews with accomplished practitioners give the reader valuable insights into this profession. I would highly recommend this book to anyone with an interest in the field of taxation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dated information","review":"I did not discover the magic formula for having a successful tax practice from reading this book. The book is not a wealth of information."},{"rating":"2","title":"Almost made me start LLC for tax preparation","review":"I think this was a very helpful book to assist in making the decision on whether to get into tax prep, working for oneself. There were personal success stories that helped, although they seemed limited because they showed mainly the good side of the issue.It's clear that for those working in tax preparation, it would be far more financially rewarding to start one's own tax consultancy. While there's always tax prep work available, tax strategy is considered higher-end and more lucrative if one can break into it. Or it may be best to set up a consultancy that does both, and if the author is correct, that's by far the most common model.The information and advice in this book seemed correct and reasonable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay but.......","review":"The unit itself is nice and I love the thin form factor. The sound is pretty good for a unit this size.BUT (that's a big but) it is not made to work with the newest Nano. You can use the cable and it works fine, but the dock and charger don't work."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't question Altec Lansing's ability to manufacture great products!","review":"I purchased this unit in Hong Kong over a year ago. I was extremely happy with its crisp sound quality. I would always bring this to the beach or even transfer it to the kitchen when I'm making a large meal. My only problem I've had with it is the button to unlock the dock. I don't know if other people have had issues with it...perhaps it was due to bringing it to the beach all the time. Other than that, I love this speaker, and it continues to be the portable speaker I bring everywhere. I have recently upgraded to the Moondance Glow for use as an alarm clock. That's great too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW!","review":"I own two of these systems, I have one at home in my bedroom and another in my office on my desk. Small footprint fits very well on desks and shelves. The sound is wonderful, has a battery that will work for hours away from power source sounds great. I am satisfied at every level with this item. Recommend highly to all music lovers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not too fantastic, but okay","review":"I bought 3 of these when I bought ipods for my sisters and my daughter. They were supposed to be compatible with the new ipod chrommatics that just came out. I wanted the girls to have something they could dock in their rooms and play music. Well, the system does allow them to play the music, but I hesitate to truly call this a real speaker system. The volume is very low. And to make matters worse, Apple has upgraded the ipod nanos so that this system does not charge the ipod while it is on the docking base. Terrible!!! The docking base is also very very small. Again, volume is not impressive. I'd probably not buy this again; something a little more powerful with better volume and sound would be preferrable. But, the girls seem relatively pleased with it. But they dont use it often. The volume is just really unimpressive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor sound quality","review":"I purchased a Lansing inMotion from Sharper Image three years ago and am very happy with it.

I sit it on my bar in my kitchen/living room area. Great sound and gets pretty loud.

Want to sample the big band era? Or the dreamy, sentimental sound of '50s ballads? This is a great CD set to take you to those times and feelings. And it also includes some fine stuff from the '60s too--slow and romantic but with a nice little groove and a smooth beat behind Kitty's always tasteful vocals. I have had personal experience with the lady herself and I can tell you that no one appreciates her fans more or is more giving, generous and gracious to them. Thankfully, she is still with us. This set will take you out of the rush and stress of the moment and have you doing a little \\"meditation\\" in a pop mood, and maybe singing along, too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kitty Kalley","review":"I have this cd.It is of all recording companies she worked for. The liner notes were a more than mean when she talks about Jimmy Dorsey. I beleive the Harry James and the Jimmy Dorsey arrangement are what carried her vocal efforts. On her biggest hit Little things Mean A lot she starts to say heart and changes it to hand. Why didn't they correct that before the record was released."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Kitty Kallen","review":"A persuasive band singer, Kitty Kallen never got the sustained record label support she needed to maintain a longterm solo career. She also was a wife and mother and put her family first, so that figured in too. Here's a collection which proves that with a band or solo she is a delightful vocalist with a lovely, pert voice; distinctive style; and starpower! As a person, Kitty has always been well-liked in show business; she's down-to-earth, very bright and has charm to spare. This collection finally gives her the recognition she has long deserved and you will love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great singer","review":"I can't blame people for thinking Kitty Kallen gave up singing for a family. It explains the lapse between years in her career. Actually Kitten stopped simply because she lost her voice. After a short comeback in the 60's Kitty had to quit because of developing blood clots in her throat. Poor Kitty not only did it happen to her once but twice.If fate hadn't done her in, she would have developed into a fantastic singer but the little available is good enough. Unfortunately half of the songs in this cd are outdated. Despite this there are enough gems to make one realize that Kitty had an unique sweet voice. My favorite \\"I'm beginning to see the light\\" is a classic. After hearing the song, it's an automatic reaction of mine to press rewind. Her version of \\"My Coloring Book\\" was before Streisand's and I know I'm being risky saying this but Kallen's version is better.Amazon has released another cd with \\"Honky Tonk Angel/If I gave my heart to you\\", all I can say is keep them coming."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable collection","review":"This is a wonderful collection by a terribly underrated singer from the big band era. My only complaints lie in Sony's compilation of the material. It would have been far preferable had the songs been in chronological order. Instead they bounce around from the forties to the sixties and back again. Also, given the short duration of the two CD's, I can imagine that all the tracks would have fit on one CD. Finally, there seems to be some minor distortion to the track \\"When They Ask About You\\" with the Jimmy Dorsey orchestra. This may be a result of the original source, as I don't have a copy of this song on any Jimmy Dorsey CD with which to compare.These minor quibbles aside, I still really enjoy this CD. Kitty has a wonderful voice, and it's too bad we don't hear more about her, along with other singers of the era, such as Peggy Lee and Doris Day."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"This book is just fine but purchasing it online I was unable to seee that it was not bible stories but stories of which only Catholic children that have already been practicing the Catholic faith fully, daily and completely could relate."},{"rating":"2","title":"Priceless!","review":"We use this book as a bedtime read aloud.

If the cleat hits a subfloor screw, it will jam. That makes sense but the problem is it bends the plate, causing it to jam more frequently whenever it hits some resistance, e.g., a floor joist knot, hardened subfloor glue, and sometimes no reason at all.This nailer is a solid built tool, but the design makes it the most frustrating and unusable tool I have ever owned (and I have lots of tools).

Most nails set properly with two hits of the hefty Porta-Nailer hammer. There are two issues:1. The bamboo/metric face-plate isn't standard on any of the Porta-Nailer kits, so you have to purchase it separately ($40-45).2. The face-nailer shoe is useless on solid vertical bamboo - it splits the flooring no matter which direction you position the nail. However, it was easy to pre-drill holes for the nails and nail them manually close to walls (where the nailer doesn't fit), setting them with the Porta-Nailer nailset (also an extra purchase @ $15).Overall, a great, well-designed tool; comfortable and easy to use."},{"rating":"1","title":"There's a reason it's cheap","review":"I had the opportunity to use both this tool and the Bostitch manual floor nailer during a recent job. Both tools were new, both were solidly constructed and of good quality. The Bostich proved far superior to the Porta Nailer due primarily to the ratcheting feature on the Porta Nailer. This does not fuction well and is a poor design. The Porta nailer would leave cleats half driven or fail to relase the cleat from the nailer after the cleat was fully driven. On the Porta Nailer side of the job we spent alot of time on our knees with a nail set trying to set cleats. We were forced to pull up a few planks becasue the cleats could not be set or removed. Eventually it was faster to just use the Bostich than waste man hours with the Porta Nailer.

It was 1960, in America we were dreaming of Camelot, and in sunny Italy a new prosperity was making life easier for most people. Those were, indeed, happier days. I look at this film with tremendous nostalgia. Everything in it is just about perfect. Rock reveals his gift for comedy in a very natural, spontaneous way. Gina is absolutely stunning: a perfect beauty, an ideal woman. The locations used for the film, at Santa Margherita Ligure and Portofino, are breathtaking. A film I always go back to.

Through a series of stories, Samson exposes the reader to the challenge, frustration and thrill of pursuing permit with a fly rod, the elite fraternity of hardcore permit flyfishermen and the development of today's successful techniques and fly patterns.

While this disc contains a few \\"pop\\" pieces such as Blueberry Hill (I had always thought that Fats Domino was the first to record it), even these are performed with a western flair. In contrast, many of the other Gene Autry collections include a number of tracks apparently intended to showcase the breadth of his style rather than focusing on the heart of his repertoire--cowboy songs. If this is your first Gene Autry disc, you'll probably want more. I suggest volume 3 of Songs of the West (also available from amazon.com), which is a nice mix of songs by Gene and early recordings by Roy Rogers with the Sons of the Pioneers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gene Autry CD","review":"Pretty good shipping speed, fair padding.

Could use some minor changes.","review":"I picked the \\"Sand\\" color, because I didn't want the ShelfLinks to stand out the way the Black ones do, and they look great! I have been having problems with water in my basement and purchased these as a way to not only get my belongings off the ground, but the 2x4's that make up the shelves. I'm confident I did so with this product after a few minor adjustments. This product is designed to allow the 2x4 to pass completely through the openings, but in my case I wanted to use them on the ground and leave a half inch between the ground and the 2x4, so I drilled a few more holes for better support and it worked well. Great product at a great price!

The links allow you to make the shelves as big or as small as you desire. The only additional cost is buying the wood, but we were able to buy 16 2x4s for $1.90 each at Lowe's.

So, we purchased the 6-pack to make an 8-foot (full face cord) log rack. The brackets are VERY sturdy and the log rack was simple to put together -- used two links for the 4-foot side rails, and slid two underneath the two 2x4's in the middle for extra support. Side rails were a little wobbly, so used the remaining two links at the top of the 4-foot side rails for added strength. Since the log rack will be used to store wood in the garage during the winter, I wanted to be able to easily disassemble it this spring -- the only thing that has screws is a 2x4 across the back (attached to the back two side rails) to brace it against the wall. I'm extremely pleased (and ended up stacking much more than a face cord!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Used for a firewood stand","review":"I bought these instead of forking out 200.00 for a steel firewood bin. Unless you have a keen mind for 3D, it will be hard to explain my problem. I had anticipated a 12 foot firewood bin, with the support 2X4s on end so that the grain of the wood on the base would support the firewood. These aren't designed to allow for that... they are designed for the 2x4s to be flat, which will warp and break unless they are flat on the ground, which defeats the whole purpose of trying to get the wood up off of the ground. I ended up having to cut two of the brackets in half and screw them to the uprights to get them to work. They may be fine for a garage storage shelf, but there are better products out there for an outdoor firewood bin that will be subjected to the weather."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious double-pack","review":"I've always found Rodney Dangerfield to be very funny.

It's just too easy, pulling segments from her 'Low Impact' and 'Stress Reduction' videos, which are low-intensity routines. But you won't be bored--the change of style, scenery, and music makes it fun and interesting. The moves are very easy to catch on to, even in the dancy 'Lean Routine' segment. Horrifying 80's fashion and scary electric blue leotards, but your eyes will soon adjust. Overall an easy workout for advanced exercisers, probably great for beginners."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for people that don't like to exercise","review":"This is a really fun workout video. It has a lot of variety and takes several times to get the steps down, but it's not so complicated that you feel like you'll never catch on. I'm 16, and I think it's cool to step back in time for 50 minutes and see the \\"old school\\" outfits and watch Jane Fonda's perky crew. If you don't take yourself too seriously, you'll have fun with this one. I wouldn't recommend it for the advanced exerciser. It's not so easy that I feel like I didn't do anything (I always need a shower afterwards), but it's not super challenging, either. It would be good for people that are easily injured or are just starting out.

Her nutritional info at the end is solid although not currently \\"in vogue\\". This video was made at a time when fitness participants were encouraged to look like they were enjoying the workout- what a breath of fresh air! Personally, I don't get off on working out with the 'testosterone ladies'.. you know the ones, who believe the more miserable they appear, the better the workout must be!I also wish there was a DVD of this- plan to keep it in the collection as long as the video tape holds out!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great variety, steady continuous exercise","review":"I enjoyed the variety of routines in this video, and the clever transitions.

The segments switch from one year to the next with a whole different look and attitude. It would be worth watching just to giggle at the clothes and hairstyles of Jane's exercise crew.

Powerful as well as poetic, she captures my attention every time I put on this DVD. Supported by a great band, with unknown names to me, she offers the audience a program with a lot of choices.

I write \\"take on\\" his life because no biography is definitive or without bias, and using interview segments is naturally going to produce an even larger measure of subjectivity than an ordinary biography.I am really thankful to have had a chance to read this book (on my new Kindle HD, no less) :).

Too think I was worried that the collars would be too sensitive! I have trimmed the hair on the poms' necks, nothing makes these collars work on the small dogs; they can bark at will.

It took us about 2 hours to put the bench to put the bench together, then another 3 weeks to organize our garage around it. The shelf links we used to make a shelf to hold our gardening stuff. It was a good project for my husband and I, and we were both pleased with our creation.

The leg clamps and storage hooks that come with it are a nice bonus. I subtracted one star because the screws that came with it were a little too short to get a good bite into the wood. I ended up using 1.5 inch wood screws to assemble it and it's rock solid. I made mine 6' by 3' with a shelf on the bottom and used the shelf links to build a hutch with a pegboard back wall.

The product is sturdy, yet light weight. It is easily assembled with hand tools but a drill driver makes the job much faster. I bought previous kits with 16 inch shelf brackets and loved them.

I first went to Home Depot to buy my lumber which came out to be around 65 dollars. This is the exact same price of this kit without the lumber. So in the end I would have spent double. Rather than paying for plastic (which I'm sure would have been good ones) I bought 4*4's for the legs, 2*4's for the frame and 2*6's for the bench top and shelving below. It is so sturdy and probably ways around 90-100 lbs. You want a good sturdy bench. You don't want to use a piece of plywood like you have seen in these pictures beacause you are going to be pounding hammering, sawing etc. I know mine will last forever as long as i take care of.

It is perfectly designed for making a workbench of any dimensions necessary rather than other products which are made for a specifc size. The instructions are poorly written and a bit confusing to follow but studying them carefully before beginning should allow anyone to use them. Everything is included, including the screws for assembly, right out of the box. I managed to build it in one afternoon by myself, requiring assistance at only one point when I had to lift the assembly from its side on to its feet.

I chose to just have one top and one bottom shelf. The possibilities are endless as far as size is concerned. As far as the assembly this was not overly difficult and anyone with the skills of handling a drill driver will be O.K.. Definitely do not attempt this without a drill driver you will be sorry. One of the problems that I encountered was not even mentioned in the manual that came with this set. If you use a drill without a clutch on it the screws will rip all the way through the plastic legs. I did not figure this out until this happened to me three or four times. It seemed like you were tightening the screws just right but in reality the were not. Thus the reason not a perfect 5 stars on this one.

Yes, you can build one entirely of lumber and hardware from your local home improvement center, but the 2X4 Basics system is like a LEGO system for adults! The legs are NOT plastic -- they are industrial resin and very rigid. Using only a variable speed jigsaw, I made the straight cuts necessary to construct this kit. The kit is VERY forgiving (my cuts were not perfectly straight by any means). I used six 2X4s (96 in long) and two flat plywood sheets (2' X 4' and 3/4\\" thick) as the lumber -- everything else is in the kit.

This means it can be set up on a wooden table, avoiding the (sometimes) nasty campsite grills. (Don't get me wrong, I don't mind a little grease or charcoal ash on the grill...that'll cook off. I just don't like the cigarette butts, beer cans and other trash some folks leave in there).The grill works great and I would have given it five stars but, due to the necessary design of the grill, fats don't drip in the coals, so meats taste more like they've been broiled in an oven than cooked on a charcoal grill.This grill will be going with us on all ou trips in the future.Follow-up - We eventually sold the grill on ebay.

I also cooked three steaks on the grill, and the steaks tasted ok (not great),but they turned gray and they grill did not sear the outside. The directions included with the grill are confusing. In the cookbook there is a note which says never to add briquettes after you have started the grill, and then a page or two later a recipe says to add briquettes if the fire has burned down some.

The plastic base is no longer available in favor of a SS base. Since my grill was a gift I did not have a sales receipt. I contacted Cobb's customer service and after a few exchanges was told I was out of luck for any relief. My presumption is that the plastic base was discontinued in favor of the SS mesh base. Their has to be a reason Cobb made this change. I feel that cobb should have absorbed some of the replacement cost for their seemingly original defective design.

First, the book is horribly written, simple-minded small business \\"tips\\" haphazardly mixed in with embarrassingly trite power-of-positive-thinking \\"insights.\\" Want to stop being depressed? Simply chant \\"I am happy\\" over and over again. In reading the book, you come to realize that one would need a roster of nearly retarded clients to have a successful practice. Basically, the book just pounds one point over and over again: Find out what your clients want, and then help them get it. There, I saved you 25 bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your time!!","review":"Nothing new.

It is these kind of people that give qualified coaches a bad name - I think it is such an irresponsible statement to make."},{"rating":"1","title":"No easy transition to NLP in your coaching...","review":"There is no way this can be considered a \\"Handbook\\". It does not begin to compare with O'Neil's Executive Coaching with Backbone and Heart or Auerbach's Personal and Executive Coaching.If you're hoping to discover a way to integrate NLP methods into coaching, you're going to need a lot more than this book. I'm not sure exactly what audience I could recommend this to. There are lots of other coaching titles out there that are readable and enjoyable as well as informative. If you're not already well versed in NLP this one's certainly going to be neither."},{"rating":"2","title":"How this book helped me.","review":"This book is easy to read and absorb. It may not suit the most academic of readers but for someone looking for a practical way to gain an insight into Life Coaching it is perfect. It gave me a good grounding in the key principles I need to master and a plan to develop my learning. It contains very practical advice about setting up your practice and developing a client base which many other books do not cover. I consider it to be amongst the best books on Life Coaching."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent DVD's","review":"My 4 year old and especially my 6 year old love Reading Rainbow.

In looking online I found this one at a fraction of an OEM replacement and now I know why. The last couple of months I noticed that it was getting harder to open the tailgate and this evening this cheap piece of junk broke. I'd understand this if the rod connected to the tailgate latch was difficult to move, but after it broke I grabbed it with a pair of pliers and it very easily unlatched, leading me to the conclusion that this handle is just cheap. My advice, just spend the money and buy an OEM replacement part, not this knock-off, otherwise you'll be wasting money and supporting a sub-par manufacturer."},{"rating":"1","title":"CRAP","review":"Not worth the box it came in!!

Often dismissed as entertainment for children, Bruchac shows in great depth the many layers of importance and wisdom that these stories have. He also provides an expert analysis of the role of story and story-teller -- their functions and realities. If you are interested in traditional Native literature and stories, or just in story-telling in general, this is a must-read book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The BEST Latin textbook","review":"I have taught seventh and eighth graders from this textbook for over 12 years and this book has wonderful stories. It's emphasis is mainly on vocabulary and grammar. The Building the Meaning sections enforce grammar and it has declension and verb conjugation charts in the back, which are very helpful. The stories of Cornelius, Aurelia, Marcus, Cornelia, Sextus, Eucleides, Titus, Syrus, Geta, and many others are very interesting and make translating enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weak on grammar, Strong on cheese","review":"This book follows an illogical sequence of introducing grammar and requires many teacher supplements. Vocabulary is obscure (many uncommon words that are not useful in teaching derivatives to students) and limited to specific story lines. The lessons are \\"watered down,\\" weak on exercises and explanations. Teaching sixth and seventh graders as well as high schoolers with this text, I find that they think the stories are very silly. Rather than adapted texts of history and mythology, the boring adventures of the Cornelii do not inspire children to learn and to love it. Students taught by this method end up weak on grammar and thinking the text is goofy.

Unfortunately, apart a few passages, the story is completely unplausible and uses statistical concepts just as a dressing. A complete disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Untapped Brilliance","review":"Improbable is one of the best cross-genre books I have read. It lives up to the publishers accolades of being a page turner, but it goes far beyond that as a brilliant debut novel. As an \\"old\\" math major who chose theory over application in the time of early computer growth and \\"women not majoring is such subjects\\", I was excited to rediscover the part of my brain and self that loves the improbable. Adam Fawer enlightens his readers with unfamiliar subjects while unfolding a plot that memorizes his audience. This is truly a book that will have an extensive reader base as it crosses lines of numerous novel types. Many may think from the jacket that it is not a book that they would read...Do yourself a favor and break out of your mold or you will miss one of the best novels on the market to date. I impatiently await the next book from this new talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I really enjoyed this entire book from beginning to end. Kept me wanting more and kept me up very late into the night. Great mix of action and science. Very good character development that allows you to really get to know the main character. Dare I say that you liking this book is very 'Probable.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"The only thing Improbable about this book...","review":"...is that it got published at all!!! He thinks he can just slap one cliche on top of another to create a best-selling thriller? This is a transparently amateur effort with no redeeming value. Judging by the guy's diction, he could barely get a 600 on the SAT verbal. This is a total travesty. Trust me. I am a fellow Wharton undergrad alum and would like nothing more but to see another Wharton alum succeed in an endeavor that is not purely driven by profit motives."},{"rating":"2","title":"As Good As Reading Gets...","review":"Many times I have been told by people, \\"You won't be able to put this down!\\" Reading between 50 and 60 books per year for the last 10 years, I have never found this to be true....until now. I could not stop reading Improbable until I finished. Well, ok...I did stop to eat lunch.Combine John Nash (A Beautiful Mind), Sydney Bristow (Alias), a mad scientist and his corrupt financier, and the crime organizations of several different countries with Statistics and Quantum Physics; throw in a little Jungian Psychology and give this combination to a brilliant new author and you have Improbable. This is the best novel to come along in a long time and very possibly the best debut novel EVER!Take it from someone who recommends books to people for a living...You should NOT miss this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just another fish in the bowl...","review":"May contain some spoilers...(Beware if you have not yet read Da Vinci Code, Improbable)I must admit this book is really catchy. It is a perfect travel book. Easy to read, understand and like an action movie, but this is not a nobel prize book. No characters feel real. You read about 270 pages and you can't empathize with anyone in the book. All big brother scenes, people with special powers, chase; all of them are full of cliches.The lecturing parts, which tries to give scientific information are unrealistic. Dan Brown, Grange, and now this guy. All take ordinary human beings, give them some extraordinary specialty(grand daughter of Jesus, werewolf, or God like psychic) thinking we will be thrilled .It is a waste of time if you want to read a book with substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nothing IMPROBABLE about success","review":"As a bookseller, I had the chance to read IMPROBABLE prior to its official publication and loved it. It's a sure-fire hit with those who enjoy Ludlum, Clancy, le Carre, etc., with a side of Crichton and Cook.Fawer's fast-paced, action-packed plot has some great surprises, and the scientific info is easy for the layperson to understand without being overly dumbed-down. The lottery examples are especially fun and will give many readers an \\"aha\\" moment.I'll be recommending IMPROBABLE to thriller fans, as well as public transit commuters and vacationers looking for an absorbing read to drown out the hustle and bustle around them. Great for the train, plane, bus, beach, and living room.Fawer should be building a loyal fan base with this excellent debut effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique Story ... solid characters","review":"Improbable is a very good title for this novel since the story itself definitely falls into the category of improbable, if not impossible.David Caine is a master of numbers, one of a set of identical twins. His brother is, to put it in common usage, off his rocker. However, when Caine is forced into an experiment that involves a drug, he begins to see the mathematical possibilities of the present and future. In so doing, he begins to realize that his brother has seen these possibilities and that is a part of his ramblings.However, as various groups compete for control of this experimental drug and for David Caine himself, he is faced with great danger in his own personal life.A very good read, with many unexpected twists and turns."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice looking, but wasn't accurate","review":"This is a really nice looking outdoor thermometer, but when I hung it up it didn't show the right temperature--it said it was 110 outside--and it was March in northern Illinois. Thinking it might have been where I hung it--on my aluminum siding in the afternoon sun--I took it down and left it a neutral spot seeing if it would give the right temperature. It didn't--this time it said it was around 85 and it was around 45 outside. It's possible that this one just wasn't calibrated right, so it gave the wrong temperature. But not wanting to have the same problem with a new one I just returned it. I wasn't happy to send it back as it looked great where I wanted to put it, but it wouldn't do me any good if it wouldn't give me the right temperature."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretty But Not Accurate","review":"The thermometer looks great, but has never had an accurate temperature.

I thoroughly enjoyed both so I assumed that Love Me Tender would be a keeper as well. Boy was I wrong! The plot is beyond lame, the male lead is oily and weak. Come to think of it, the female lead is pathetic too. The sex scenes are trashy and boring, not steamy and engaging. Sandra Hill is normally great but this is the worst display of her talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time!","review":"This was my first Sandra Hill book and I cannot believe that I was told how good her books are!

So many people had told me how great an author she was and they were right! This book makes you laugh all the way through (not a good idea when everyone in your house is sleeping<g>).

BAD","review":"I know you take a chance buying online without actually seeing the book, but generally I've had good luck. But here's my exception. If you're one of those folks who like Robin Williams or Jim Carrey on a manic roll, go ahead and order Sandra Hill, if you're not, then don't waste your money. Stick to Susan Anderson, Dara Joy, early Kathleen Woodiwiss, Linda Howard and the incomparable Judith McNaught."},{"rating":"1","title":"Exciting but disappointing","review":"It started out good then it was disappointing.I was expecting major fireworks,there was some not alot.I've read Sandra books and found it to be more exciting and couldn't put it down.Don't get mme wrong I loved Elvis Prestley but he's gone,JMHO.Hopefully the author would learn from this not to write this again in the future.When I saw the title it looked interesting and read it,it turned me off.Sorry for being so critic but at least am being honest about the book.I hope that she'll be writing more adventureous and romantic soon and looking forward to her new books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Boring","review":"Sandra Hill of course is one of my favorite authors, so you could imagine my distain when I read this particular book.

This book did a nice job of easing one's understanding into COM. I think this a great book whether you are a project manager just trying to get a clue, an experienced programmer trying something different, or a newbie.

It has the repetition the little ones love...and when they figure out what happens each time, it's fun to watch them try to catch the balls and penguin before they get to the end! Other than a toddler trying to pull themselves up on the tower, it's sturdy and easy for them to manipulate. Great toy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My Son Loves this Toy","review":"I can't quite figure out why but my son absolutely loves this toy. There really isn't much too it. I think it would be much better if they had more balls or characters that roll down the spiral tower and multiple characters that fit in the tube. My sons favorite part of this toy is the frog.

They did get frustrated sometimes b/c the balls and penguin don't go down the shoot, just the ramp. The singing frog was a big hit though. It was a pretty quiet and non-annoying toy in general. Unfortunately, it broke a few months after we got it and the company does not offer replacement parts.

When it arrived I found the product to be cheap in construction, the spiral separates easily. The paint on the penquins wore off within a month of gentle play. This toy is particularly stimulating. My daughter found it more entertaining to blow into the vented bottom section of the frog. It sounds like a harmonic when she does this. With the exception of the frog (being used in a way not intended) she has paid little attention over the past 4 months. I will be taking this dust collector to the donation center."},{"rating":"1","title":"flimsy","review":"Ramp breaks apart easily.

The plastic controling the frog's \\"return,\\" at least on our unit, gave out and now he can't enjoy the toy as he did. Perhaps our unit was defective, but I have nothing to compare it with. Ordinary use should not render this feature unusable in such a short time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Value-for-money toy!","review":"I have given this toy 5 stars because I can honestly not find anything negative to say about it.

I've had two children grow up with this toy and it was a favorite of both. It is durable. It is easy for them to use from 9+ mos on, yet captures their attention for many many months. It has multiple play options (my son used the frog as a horn to blow through, my daughter tried all the different balls in the house to see which ones fit down the ramps). This toy will be one of the very few I hang on to for future young guests and my own grandchildren, it's that good."},{"rating":"1","title":"The frog gets stuck","review":"The child's favorite thing to do was to put the frog down the tube but it kept getting stuck. Too bad as the rest of it is really a nice teaching tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Toy","review":"I bought the 1st play tower for my grandson Henry and he loved it. He played with it almost everyday he was here(2-4 times a week)for well over a year. When his baby sister Matilda developed an interest and they both gave it a workout, the button mechanism began to wear, so I purchased another. Now there is double the fun because we have two sets of balls, penguins, and frogs. Matilda plays with it for a considerable amount of time for a 15 month old (as did Henry at her age). Great toy, I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun!","review":"We bought this for our daughter last fall when she was 15 months. She adores it - has had no problem pushing the button for the frog (makes a buzzing sound as it goes down the tube) and loves watching the duck & balls roll down the ramp.. We purchased this toy through Consructive Playthings for a preschool fundraiser & it looks slightly different. The bird is a yellow duck & the colors are different, but it's the same toy made by the same company. Anyway, the only issue we have had with it is that our daughter discovered she can take the ramp apart. It's easy to put back together, but I fear that she is going to break it tugging on it one of these days. And I DO wish there was an additinal animal/object to go down the tube other than the frog. If the frog is ever lost, half of the toy is useless!We ask her to \\"get the frog\\", she will find the toy, retrieve the frog & play it like a kazoo. It's fun for all of us! Overall, it is an excellent toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ball tower toy","review":"I read great reviews of this toy, but was disappointed with it.

The yellow button is hard for him to push to release the frog so he is unable to fully play with the toy by himself. Both children have discovered that if they pull on the slide it will come apart. It has been very hard to keep it together. I got tired of putting it back together after about a week, so I put the toy up for awhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, but could be stronger.","review":"I do like this toy. No Batteries which is great and fun activities which my one year old is really enjoying. However it is made of fairly brittle plastic and he has managed to crack the main tube for the frog to go down. It isn't so bad that I feel I must take it away but has made me keep a more watchful eye on him. He also has managed to take several sections of the spiral apart, initially by leaning on them too heavily and once he realised it came apart pulling it deliberately. Only the frog goes down the inner tube and it makes a small sound...nothing too noisy - that is until my little guy puts it in his mouth and breathes through it when it gets louder and more annoying. My little guy finds this toy immense fun, but it could be improved."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than expected","review":"The concept of this toy is great, however the parts don't work too well. The frog, which is the only item that fits down the tube, often gets stuck in the tube. You need to put it in at a precise angle and push to make sure it doesn't get stuck. The balls and the penguin are fun to watch roll down the spiral, but they don't always make it down to their \\"spot\\". They sometimes get stuck after they exit the spiral.These problems don't seem to bother by 1 year-old, but they bother me.One good feature is the release button for the tube, it's great for learning cause and effect, because you have to push it to get the frog out."},{"rating":"1","title":"somewhat disappointed","review":"perhaps i had too many expectations for this toy. my 19 month old grandson was not particularly interested. 2-3 minutes of play and he moved on. it does not seem to offer too many thinking experiences or varied activities. would probably not buy it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"the jean is perfect, this is my favorite brand","review":"the jean is perfect, this is my favorite brand, waist size and excellent long talk all right, wearing magnificent product, great jean, black color bought 16 regular and left me very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Revised Review (Since Amazon.com staff are so PC)","review":"Don't buy it.

Bucketboss went from a tough rubber bottom to a stitched material with a piece of plastic sewed between the layers for support. Well, after exactly 2 days of normal use the front of the bag collapsed from the weight of my tools which my last tool bag carried and continues to carry no problem for 5 + years.If you lay it on a flat surface it just falls over.

Wow, what a show!Then, out of now where comes Sample And Hold. At the time, I was a beginning computer geek and this song totally blew me away. While obvious that some of the other band members just didn't get it and had no idea how to relate to the music, Neil and Nils really nail it in this futuristic view of a cyber world that was soon to come.

It's hard to figure how none of the reviewer's of this DVD had anything really bad to say about the sound on it. The lack of sound makes this a total \\"THUMBS DOWN\\" DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC!!!!!!! Neil Young Live! in Berlin","review":"Great! Wonderful!! \\"Neil Young Live! in Berlin\\" contains the BEST version of \\"Like A Hurricane\\" Neil has ever performed. This song alone is worth the cost, but, the whole concert is Great!

As with age the records bit the dust. Cracked, broken and just wore out.

This book covers it all in an easy to read and informative manner."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a people scent","review":"I don't like this fragrance.

This one is legendary for its longevity - and it lives up to that reputation. Will last all day. The opening is quite harsh, but it settles down quite nicely. I find this similar to Givinchy Play Intense (tar, vanilla, coffee notes), but I think this one is slightly better due to its superior longevity. Some people think it has a burnt (chocolate, tar, rubber, etc...) scent, but I think that is a common complaint of all colognes of this class, and I find it just has that burnt sensation for the 1st 30 min or so. This cologne is not really for everyone - it's one of those \\"love it or hate it\\" scents - but I have received many compliments while wearing it.Gouramand scents are generally not my favorite, but if you like this style, this is certainly a good choice. Best to wear in the cooler months, as it is too heavy for summertime use. Just be careful - a little goes a long way!"},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY OLD","review":"For a quality fragrance this must be very old the only thing I get out of it is TAR that is is so to all a warning that you might get an aweful smelling fragrance if you get an old one but it is luck of the draw."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't buy!!!","review":"This stuff is amazing!!!

I recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Unfortunate Disappointment","review":"This scent has received much critical acclaim and is known for being unique.Unfortunately I got seduced by all the positive reviews and bought this scent without either smelling it or wearing it personally. My excuse is that there are no decent frag. vendors within an hours drive from me so I decided to purchase Angel Men through Amazon.I received the item quickly and it is a nice looking bottle. However, I find the scent repulsive and too deep. To me it smells like the inside of a smoker's car, perhaps even a bit skunky! I've tried it twice, and each time I end up wiping it off with a steaming hot facecloth!Different colognes react differently to people's chemistry though. Perhaps you would like A*Men as so many others do-more power to them-but dont repeat my mistake and make sure to try it yourself before you buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff...","review":"I've always loved this cologne and enjoy the fact that it's not the run-of-the-mill-everybody-wears-it type thing like cool water or anything in the calvin klein line. Smells great and get's lots of compliments. The womens' version (Angel) is mind blowing. Side note: you can buy this refill as a stand alone, you don't have to have the little case things for it. Save yourself the money...cologne is for making you smell a little better, not for decorating."},{"rating":"2","title":"lighter than expected","review":"Having several other medallion type of key chains made of Pewter, I expected this to be heaver than it is. It looks great, however, it feels very cheap and very light, more like a tin medallion rather than pewter.All my other medallion key chains have the same kind of ring to hold the Large Key ring to the Smaller hole in the medallion, this has a piece of metal bent to hold the larger key ring to the medallion. I replaced that with a smaller ring to be sure the clip didn't fall off and lose the keys.Since it is the only USC key ring I could find, this fits the bill."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unless they are for Halloween...","review":"I bought these for my eight year old son.

I expected cheap sunglasses that would last me a few months. I've had Aviators from target or walmart before, that cost about $5 more than this.These glasses are more of something you'd put in a film to showcase than to use for every day eye protection. The yellow band at the top puts the glasses much further away from your eyes than most glasses. The wrap-around-your-ear frame is a terrible design. It feels cheap and flimsy, and that's because it is.While I never expected much with these glasses, I expected more than something you could find at a dollar store. My advice to you is to pass on this specific model (The ones pictured) and buy a different pair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful !!!","review":"Tried them on & they were VERY PAINFUL to the earlobe...DO NOT purchase this item!!!

The earhooks take some time to get used to, but once you do, they secure the glasses well to your face. I am not afraid that these will fly off when I'm driving with the windows down.From far away, they do not look like $10 glasses.

For the price, I certainly did not expect Air Force quality (I'm an Air Force vet), but I did expect a serviceable item. On both pairs ordered, the nose pieces arrived misaligned. The flexible earpieces are so small that I doubt my four year old granddaughter could wear them comfortably around her ear.

The garbage can lift is already broken and my grandson has only had it for an hour. It's very poor quality overall.

My suggestsion, look elsewhere for a better brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great, but...","review":"We got this from Costco at well under half the price listed here, and it's lasted well over a year. But for some reason, Tonka's latest trucks are designed to make it VERY hard to fit the action figure into the driver's seat. We have this problem on the ambulance, the helicopter... and especially on the garbage truck. The door just doesn't open wide enough to allow an easy fit, and as an adult it takes me a lot of work to get the driver to sit down in the seat. My 3 year old son? Forget it, no way he can fit the driver in there.If only the door stopper wasn't there and the door opened a bit wider, it'd be SO much easier to use with the action figure."},{"rating":"1","title":"breaks easily, horrible customer service","review":"Besides breaking easily, the screws have an odd shaped head that prevents you from putting it back together easily and they're customer service is horrible.

It also goes into the history of Florida, explaining why the pioneers were attracted to Florida, their struggle, and how, at the pinnacle of their success, their lives were changed forever.I enjoyed reading the history of Florida and I was also gripped and amazed by the stories of those who survived the hurricane. It is scary to think that such destruction and horror can occur anywhere near the coast. Yet even though approximately 2,400 people died, this hurricane and the lives destroyed by it was practically forgotten. This hurricane was the deadliest in the history of Florida, yet no one has heard about it. At least this book tales the stories of those who survived and now, hopefully, they won't be forgotten again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"I purchased this item for my dad and we all tried it out.

It is a disappointment (understatement). The singers are mediocre (with two exceptions) and the orchestra is uninspired --no doubt fatigued by the unnecessary length of this VERY ORDINARY opera. Other sounds intrude: the never-ending applause and RUMBLINGS (one hears the sounds of the singers plodding the stage -- on my sound system it reminds me of a storm brewing in the distance or the commencement of an earthquake!) One female singer on this CD (she shall remain nameless) wobbles, hollers, and shrieks thru her high notes; she seems \\"lost\\" and unsure of her voice.

It looks pretty coming out of the box, but the construction is relatively flimsy (plastic in several key high-impact areas like the lever-hinge mount and the corkscrew-turner) and the design tolerances are really loose (the gears don't mesh very smoothly). Also, the supplied plastic is completely useless because the corkscrew won't fit in it, much less actually stand upright in it.If you want the cheapest possible rabbit-action corkscrew, this is the item for you.

The foil cutter began falling apart almost immediately, and this weekend a part fell out the opener, rendering it inoperable. It lasted eight months.We'll look for a similar style to replace this one, but one made more durably."},{"rating":"1","title":"don,t waste your money","review":"This is a bad product.

It is very poor quality and I would not recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"MIU Connoisseur CorkscrewThis was actually a replacement for the same item, the original lasting only about 10 uses before it fell completely apart. The signs are that this one won't be any better. After the second use a little plastic cap came loose and fell out, so at this point I just packed it back in the box and put it away. Sadly this just reinforces my belief that if it's \\"made in China\\" it's a piece of junk."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as depicted","review":"I ordered this wine opener as a Christmas gift for my parents. I have a similar one, and enjoy how easy it is to use. The MIU opener, though, was flimsy and poorly made. The components were loose and wobbly, and it did not work properly. It also did not appear precisely as shown in the picture, as the metal handles were pointed at the end rather than round. Obviously, that should not affect the function or quality, but it makes me wonder whether the seller is shipping a different product. I'm returning the wine opener and will order a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Quality","review":"Didn't last long before it started to fall apart.

Both broke.","review":"I really liked this wine opener, until it stopped pulling corks. Which was about 10 days in to the first one I ordered. I managed to return it and get a replacement w/o charge via Amazon's return policy. The second one lasted a little longer, in fact, just outside of the Amazon 30-day return period. I had hoped to return it too, but times up. This is a very nice looking and nice feeling opener. But, both just stopped pulling corks when still virtually new. They would screw in, but not pull the cork out of the bottle.Extremely disappointed. I have a Rabbit opener for about 3 years and it still works. I liked the MIU as it has a longer lever arm and needs less effort to screw in and pull the cork, while it still works, that is.Advice: Don't buy it. If you do, keep the boxes and return it quickly when it stops working."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke After Twenty Uses","review":"Heavy, awkward to handle and broke after twenty uses.

My parents have a corkscrew that has the same design but obviously by a better manufacturer. Tonight I decided to try to open a bottle of wine with it for the first time and it was AWFUL!! I am going to go back to the old cheap corkscrew I use on camping trips. I had to seriously struggle to get the screw into AND out of the cork. I'm 27 and very active but it was a workout trying to use this thing. I shouldn't have had to struggle nearly as much as I did. I tried another cork right after, and it was just as hard. Granted it was used... however the seller said it was like new. From what I can tell it is just seriously cheap design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Breaks too easily","review":"This would be a decent product if it didn't break after so little use. I'll bet I didn't even open 20 bottles of wine before it broke. The company, MIU FRANCE, doesn't even respond to emails. It can't be returned to Amazon since I bought it awhile ago, although I never used it much until recently.Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Thrill","review":"The product worked fine for about 3 months but eventually became less reliable then finally the opener came off the track. There is no way to reset it that I know of, no instructions for how to repair yourself or repair options.

The packaging claims that this corkscrew does not work on synthetic corks, but I had no trouble with it on the rubber corks found in Yellow Tail bottles, and that was on my first try. Of course, I've only used it a few times so far, so I can't say whether long term use on synthetic corks would degrade its performance--perhaps damage the nonstick coating on the worm? But certainly it seems to work for now. The stand is nice, too: in addition to holding the wine opener device itself, it has a depression that holds the foil cutter and a notch underneath that stores one of the spare worms. It would be nice if it could store both of the spare worms, but that's not a terribly large flaw."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fooled by the French","review":"I chose this wine opener based on the fact that it is sold by a French (who know their wine) company and the fact that it is similar to a very popular design, i.e. the Rabbit. I was also hoping that the metal used to make it would be more robust than the plastic used in similar devices. Stated simply, this opener does not work; that is, unless you consider pushing a cork INTO the bottle to be the same as opening a bottle. In the short time I had it, the \\"opener\\" was 0 for 2 in opening bottles with artificial or composite corks and 2 for 4 in opening bottles with natural corks. The cork that broke the camel's back was a decent Bordeaux I am currently enjoying that features a lovely nautral cork floating inside the bottle. On the positive side, it looks good, it feels good in the hand (like it should work), and the foil cutter does work well. Too bad it doesn't pull corks out of bottles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fell apart in less than 1 year","review":"This looks nice. It comes with an attractive holder and initially worked very well. However, in less than one year it became difficult to remove the spent cork and ultimately totally fell apart.

It is now so easy to open any bottle with this new one."},{"rating":"2","title":"easiest corkscrew ever","review":"I've struggled with several other lever type corkscrews, and forget the bartender's friend (no friend of mine)! This corkscrew works well and is easy to use. I've had mine for a year and still haven't needed to use the spare screw. I'm buying another one for our wine club so I can no longer fight the myriad of corkscrews we have that I just can't make work (it's me, but why not get the product that works well for those of us who are mechanically challenged....)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Works, so far","review":"I bought this as a inexpensive replacement for a worn-out screwpull. The first one worked OK until it literally started to fall apart - first a plastic stopper, followed by a shaft, etc. Amazon was first class at replacing the unit, shipping me a new one as a replacement and taking the old one back. The second one has been working without any problems to date. Thus, I imagine that the first one was simply an outlier.What was disappointing about this unit is the foil cutter, which doesn't work nearly as well as that of the Screwpull (MIU elected to save some money by not using sharpend wheels like the screwpull foil cutter does)."},{"rating":"1","title":"great at first","review":"this worked great for a few months.

Don't buy this and in particular don't give it as a gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worked well until it broke","review":"I threw this item out over a year ago, after it broke. The part that broke was a linear gear made of a very cheap cast metal.Now I am looking for something better...."},{"rating":"2","title":"My New Best Friend!","review":"A toast to my new wine opener! It opens wine bottles in seconds. Just lever the arm in one direction to remove the cork from the bottle and reverse the arm in the opposite direction to release the cork from the worm screw. I'd definitely recommend this product to others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for use with Synthetic Corks!!","review":"Many wines now use synthetic corks. I recieved the opener and found written on the box \\"Due to the non-stick coating on the worm screw, CORKSCREW is not designed for use with synthetic corks. This is too limiting for me. I wish this was noted in the description."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's junk!","review":"The claim of \\"all metal gears\\" is true, but unfortunately, the corkscrew works against a plastic housing which cannot withstand the stress. The plastic plugs that hold the mechanism in the handle assembly popped out after opening about 10 bottles of wine. It is now useless. Also, the little rivet pins that hold the foil cutter on its holder popped out just before the opener self-destructed. That was easily put back together and continued to work fine, but why buy something that needs to be put back together to use?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not durable - avoid","review":"Purchased 2 of these, one for me, one as a gift in Dec. 2007. Initially worked great, but both broke within 6 months after what I'd consider light to moderate use (one to three bottles opened per week). Pick a different one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I purchased this product on May 3, 2008 after having my last cork pull for 8 years. I was expecting this product to last at least a year or two but; to my disappointment it only lasted about 8 weeks. The pull never tracked correctly and finally broke. I have learned that not all cork pulls are alike. Hopefully, I will have better luck with the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't Last","review":"Worked fine for two months, but broke well before its \\"good for 20,000 pulls\\" claim.

The display stand is fantastic and the label peeler fits right in the bottom of the stand.Although the manufacturer states it is not to be used with synthetic corks, so far this is the only cork I've used it with and it worked beautifully every time.Update: Its now 3 years later and I am still using this opener on a fairly regular basis. Never had a cork it couldn't open, and just about all open effortlessly (I had a dry cork once that was an issue, but would have been hard to open with any device). I would re-rate this a 5 now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"timely delivery, strong product","review":"The product arrived slightly earlier than expected.

On the other hand it broke after only a few years of light use. So this is a pretty replacement.

It feels heavy and the initial thought is that it's well made.

Her styles are attractive and do not look dated even in 2001.I just completed \\"Jessica\\" for my daughter-in-law and she absolutely loves her sweater. Now my son wants a sweater as well. The best compliment for me is that people say that the sweater looks professionally made, not like many other homemade items which have the \\"fireside touch\\" (you know, nice, but who would really want to be seen wearing them?)!One drawback is that only Jo Sharp yarns are used. By using the weight and the yardage, any yarn store can help you select comparable yarns. But I would be reluctant to do that. Her soft New Zealand wool is far superior to US wool.

There is no family that cannot benefit from this story, and this guidance, for even those lucky enough to have never lost contact with a father or son are affected by that sad reality somewhere in their family history. Good job, Mr Bryan! And thanks"},{"rating":"2","title":"This has been the most important book I have read in 13 year","review":"This book has been the most difficult and important book I have read in 13 years..since my son was born. I am the mother of a son whose father walked out on both of us...I really don't know if he ever thinks about his son. This book makes me think he does and if he is experiencing the pain that the book describes absent dads as feeling...I really feel bad for him. He has missed out on all the joy, pain and love of raising his child."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good in theory, bad in practice","review":"When I read the reviews of this book, I got interested and purchased the book. The book was a disappointment. It may be a good academic book and relate to the CMM, but it does not provide any guidelines as to how to deal with the details of what you encounter in projects in real life. I wonder if these techniques have really been applied in real life. There is much discussion of methods, but little on what it takes to use the methods. The book does not handle the many issues that arise when you try to manage a lot of work, with few staff, and not enough time. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Business case for an iterative process","review":"Well-researched, well-thought, and well-written book provides a compelling business case for an iterative software development process. Rather than focus on the mechanics of the Unified Process, as one might expect, the author presents justification for transitioning from a traditional software engineering approach to an iterative approach.Conventional software engineering is first presented, along with its drawbacks. The changing software landscape is examined, and future success factors are identified. The factors are then tied into the new process.Thorough coverage of many different angles, including an excellent section on metrics, estimation models (and the evolution of COCOMO), team development, culture changes, etc.Great read."},{"rating":"1","title":"To little how in the text","review":"The author actually has some ideas about software project management. His ideas seem feasible and applicable for practice. But it's difficult for us to understand as how to solve the problems other than only to know the concepts. Even though the author had some discussions, it's not enough for understanding. He show us the structures of the artifacts with too little explaination. It may be better if the author can provide some case studies."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very educated, convincing and realistic perspective","review":"The resources on the line to deliver the software development product know what needs to be done. The chronic challenge is getting senior management to understand how they must support the \\"doers\\" in order for the organization as a whole to be successful.This is the kind of book that can be shared with senior management in our endless efforts to help them understand why it is so key that they champion the best practices.This book will not be easily dated. As our organization becomes more mature, the content and perspective put forth by Walker will continue to support us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take a sentimental Journey","review":"This is a fantastic box set from one of the premier rock bands of the late 1970's and 1980's. From top to bottom, this set gives a wide choice of selections from the early days through the stadium live versions from the \\"Captured\\" album to the sentimental radio hits from \\"Escape\\" and beyond.So why do I rate \\"Time^3\\" four stars instead of five? Well, I would have rather had the studio versions released in this box set rather than the live versions. The trend of putting live versions and b-sides on multi-dic sets dilutes what would be an otherwise superior compilation.Not to fret though. This set is a perfect companion for those who already have the studio versions from Journey's \\"Greatest Hits\\" CD. That is four CD's with just about everything a fan could want."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT!","review":"I have to admit that I'm not too crazy about some of the earlier material that appears on Disc 1, but besides that this boxed set is incredible. Journey is very underrated nowadays, but if you sit back and just LISTEN to these discs, you may feel differently.The set includes some unreleased tracks, 2 of which were unfinished tracks for the \\"Raised On Radio\\" album, and were revamped as instrumentals for this collection. There are quite a few gems in this set, I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply a MUST for anyone who went to school in the 80's","review":"Great American music from a great American band. Most of Journey's popularity came during the 80's, but the first disc reveals their early sound before Steve Perry hit the scene. This really is a must for anyone who was in school during the 80's. Brings back many fond memories. By the way, Journey is touring and will release a new album this year; without Steve Perry(The new singer sounds very, very much like him. You wouldn't know the difference)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"After reading the review Salome Soars. I held a samll party to view it. We were all disappinted.The production attempted to be different. It is different and it succeeded in being unpleasant.Almost everything seemed wrong with it. John the Baptist was well acted, but the dialog refers to his white skin, he needed white body makeup. The prison guards and the leering soldiers were also good. However the background music was poor and the acting was grotesque. Salome's dance was mostly grotesque body movements.By comparison the production by Gotz Friedrich was everything that this isn't. Better direction, acting, music and dancing.Caution: online reviewers tend to have strong opinions, not much in between. You need several reviews of any material to judge whether to view particular material or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsure yet","review":"Of the 2 dogs that have tried this, none of them seem very interested in chewing on it.

It's nearly impossible to get lost in Diane Zak's book. She will 'hold your hand' and step you through everything while explaining what's going on. In each chapter you will program the example with the author. Following the lessons are loads of great sample problems and questions. My instructor said this is the best text book she has ever used -for any class. I agree 100%. I'm hoping other books by Diane Zak will live up to this one.Buy this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Programming Book for new programmers and VB students","review":"I had to buy a copy...for my Visual Basic I online class in college. It's an online class so all the work is done on your own and this book is awesome.The book takes you step-by-step from designing, planning, and coding VB programs. It walks you through every stage of creating a program. Textbook is very detailed and accurate.There are tons of follow up questions at the end of each tutorial and there are plenty of programming exercises at the end of each tutorial as well.I plan on buying Intro to C++ by Diane Zak to study on my own and any other books she writes that I might be interested in as well. I would recommend any books by Diane Zak. I strongly recommend any of her titles."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Detailed Instructions for VB6 Ever!!","review":"The entire national chain of training schools COMPUTER LEARNING CENTER used this book as their introductory text for Visual Basic 6.

It seems as if the projects at the end of chapters have nothing to do with what was just covered. It's like there are missing codes.

I am also taking courses toward an e-commerce degree, and this book makes it difficult when it comes to applying the knowledge."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easy to Follow, But...","review":"Yes the book is fairly easy to follow, but the tutorials ask you to perform tasks that are not possible with the supplied software.Don't waste your time trying to learn from this book unless it is required for a class!Besides VB6.0 has reached the end of the support life cycle, and it doesnt run on xp 64bit."},{"rating":"2","title":"Likeable western.","review":"I like Copper Canyon, it's one of my favorite westerns. Admittedly the plot is somewhat convoluted and the acting is merely adequate. I think I mainly like the cast. Hedy Lamarr is gorgeous -- as always, Mona Freeman was one of Hollywood's prettiest blondes, and Ray Milland is the suave, dashing hero. Copper Canyon was just another western ground out during Hollywood's Golden Age. But at least it was fun to watch, which I can't say about most movies made these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low Grade Movie","review":"Not a movie I would order again, nor do I plan to watch it a second time. The action is slow and very predictable, and the character of the stars is never developed. Ray Milland tries hard to make his character interesting, but he just can't beat the way the movie is directed. Pretty B-Grade and silly."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an excellent sourcebook","review":"I have been a DM for years and I honestly believe that this book is essential for understanding the ADND elf.

The book is short and to the point. It covers the basics of CHF: Causes, Medical Management, Symptoms, Medications, Diet, Fluid Limitation, Daily Weight,& Exercise. The illustrations are easy to understand, as are the verbal explanations. The book could benefit from an update, since the treatments and understanding of this illness are changing rapidly.

It is a valuable reference, providing us with an indepth insight into the world of guitar building.

The book gives you instruction to build either a classical or steel string guitar, and anticipates problems you may have with various techniques, which I have found very helpful. A worthy addition to your bookshelf!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Catty, Pastiche-Rock","review":"Denim are good songwriters. But the sarcasm and irony and the cheeky Lou Reed imitation wear thin, very quickly. There are some fantastic melodies on here that could have been worthwhile, if they had been written with an ounce of sincerity behind them. If you make joke-rock, at least do it with an original sound, not with a self-righteous mockery of the 70's and 80's."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maddeningly Brilliant","review":"A typical sentence: \\"Anyone who is too lazy to master the comparatively small glossary necessary to understand Chaucer deserves to be shut out from the reading of good books forever.\\"You may use this quote as a meter for predicting your enjoyment of the book. If you find it amusing and arguable, Pound's ABC of Reading will delight you with its erudite gems. If you are repulsed by the presumption, then give the book a wide berth.Pound sets a standard for basic literacy that few literature scholars can hope to achieve (including mastery of several languages as a pre-requisite to study). Nonetheless, the book is a treasure trove of brilliant and piquant observations, and is itself an exemplar of the crystaline prose Pound extolled. You would be hard-pressed to find an ostentatious or superflous word in the book's entire 200 briskly-moving pages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Tacky in Trouble","review":"A very fun read with your child.

Yes, they suck. The images are photocopies of the printed book (small font text and all). Often the images do not even line up with the words.

Just the title of the book denote's Jim Carlton's bias.Interestingly enough, his predictions of the future of Apple is ironically incorrect. Apple's recent comeback in the computer industry is a testiment to that."},{"rating":"1","title":"The biggest blunder is this book","review":"I'm not a big Apple Computer fan, but I was very disappointed by this book. Covering the tumultuous period just before Steve Jobs returned to Apple, the book attempts to provide all the 20/20 insight necessary to explain the company's short-comings. Unfortunately, though, the book is so poorly written -- and doesn't at all hide the disdain the author feels for Jobs -- that it's nearly unreadable. Rather than tell the story in a linear timeline, the book jumps back and forth in a very confusing way. If you didn't already know the Apple story, you wouldn't know what was going on. Also, considering all the success Apple has had since then (with the iMac and Titanium PowerBook), this topic is moot now anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very difficult to read","review":"This book offers some wonderful insights on how the former powerhouse, Apple, went to near bankruptcy in the early '90's. I found much of the information very intersting. The only problem was that I could not follow the book at all! The story seemed to jump all around with no clear direction. I often found myself reading along about the company in 1992, then suddenly find myself reading about what happened in 1989 in the next paragraph. I could not draw any line of cohesion in this book, which is truly a shame. With better organization, this could have been a very good book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Error! Crash(ing bore)","review":"Carlton takes one of the most fascinating legends of corporate America and turns it into a snooze-fest. He never manages to illustrate why Apple and the Macintosh were exciting and why their fans are like religious zealots - he just states it as a foregone conclusion and then gets back to documenting the endless corporate blunders. Which is important, but you have to know why Apple matters (mattered?) to find the blunders significant (or tragic). His writing is dull and sometimes downright strange -- one scene is set at a fancy Valley restaurant, and he pointedly notes that this restaurant offered escargot as an appetizer. I assumed the snails would figure prominently later in the anecdote (perhaps they were the inspiration for the current G3 campaign?) but THEY NEVER COME UP AGAIN. It's like he was just flummoxed by the existence of escargots and had to share his excitement. Wait for the movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very deep account of an amazing company","review":"The Jim Carlton's book is an amazing account of the turbulent history of the American icon, Apple Co. It is written in a very clear and dynamic style and everyone interested in this out of the ordinary company will enjoy it all through. I am still wondering how Carlton has been able to gather so much internal information about Apple. It is all there for you to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Great Story, written like a first draft by a novice.","review":"I assume that Carlton's editors were not available to \\"edit\\" as this book is so poorly written and constructed that I gave up half way through (and wanted to much sooner). An example: How many times do we have to hear about how strangely Spindler acts or Sculley's health? Just once if it's only going to be brought up over and over and over and over and over and over (etc.) again like we hadn't just read about it in the last chapter (or page). This is one of the most fascinating corporate stories to tell and unfortunately, Carlton is over his head in the telling. A complete and total waste of time and money. Geez, I hope they don't try and make an $80 million movie out of this turkey. If only Tom Wolfe had done it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Deep detail of Mac History that reads like a suspense novel","review":"This is a book for any computer lover who wish to understand why a great company missed so many opportunities to become the leader in the information age. This is also a book that will give important lessons about business and marketing. It reads like a novel and describes with impresive detail crucial moments in the history of personal computers. I highly recomend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"facts are outdated and flawed","review":"although this book was extremely informative and interesting, its facts were outdated, and occasionally flawed. parts of this book seem to have been written circa 1996, and other parts (many about the mac os itself) are just plain wrong. the only fact in the way of the alleged \\"demise\\" of apple is that there are too many fanatics who would rather die than use windows. macs are easier to use and have better graphics features than many other platform (including windows), which still makes them the top choice for many schools and most graphic professionals. since jobs' \\"return\\" to apple, it has been apparent that wonderful changes have been made. stock has risen, prices have lowered, quarterly profit has been announced, and over 100,000 imacs have already been pre-ordered. apple is definetely headed on the right track, and under jobs' leadership, it can go even further. it's not \\"over\\" for apple, it's merely a new beginning."},{"rating":"2","title":"You have to wonder....","review":"After reading Jim carlton's book, you have to wonder what the Mac OS would be like today if it had competent management. This book is painful for any of the Mac EvangeListas to read, a pure joy for the Wintel set.Carlton's book reads a little on the dry side, written more like a history text than a rousing, yet dramatic, tragedy. Even Amelio's rambling speech at the MacExpo near the end of his tenure doesn't sound like that big a deal, but it was a huge blow when it happened. Not that the WSJ ENCOURAGES creative writing, but this book could use a little more flair.Not being on the inside of the industry, I'm in no position to comment on the facts, but what I did read made me want to turn the clock back 14 years and knock some heads together."},{"rating":"1","title":"A close minded look into the computer industry","review":"This book will leave you with an unsettled feeling concerning how decisions are made in competitive industries in general. I give it two thumbs down."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Tough Read For All But The Most Dedicated","review":"Jim Carlton's book takes a fascinating story and re-tells it - badly.The prose is deadly, even when the story is at its most compelling. Anyone who is familiar with the years of failure and foul-ups at Apple will find little that is truly new or original here, but anyone else will be appalled at the way the company threw away opportunity after opportunity.Having said that, Apple's story is not only a story of failure, it is also a story of success - just think of the great products the company has put out. Jim Carlton pays no attention to that. The book is a depressing read because it only sounds the one note: failure, failure, failure. And that is as hard on Apple as it is on the reader.The bottom line: would I recommend this book to a friend? No."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perhaps a should-read but is this a must-read? I doubt.","review":"If someone wants to read about Apple, whether from an end-user's perspective or an industry insider's perspective, to search for what this company ought to do it right in a near future, this book should in the list of important readings.My warning to such readers is that it would take a lot of will-power or strong interests to keep wading through the stories presented in this book, i.e. blunders after blunders by Apple, and an endless list of \\"what if they did that, or did not do that at the time\\".Overall, I have become pretty much exhausted after finishing reading this book. A major part of that comes from Apple's past actions and/or non-actions as recorded in this book. At the same time, I have to admit that the rest my exhaustion certainly did come from the repetitive writing style of this book, as already pointed out by many other reviewers here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Guy's wrong..it's poorly written, repetitive & disorganized.","review":"Most of the reviews on this book are correct. The author shows how Apple was rotting but avoids making a more insightful analysis of the players and the industry involved. The book is poorly written, repetitive, disorganized, and not very focused on the important issues (this is similar to much of the reporting on Apple in the Journal and other major papers). Some passages even seem to reveal a lack of understanding of aspects of computing with heinous oversimplifications of certain events in the industry. I'm sorry that Guy Kawasaki (if the review is really his) thinks it's a well written book. The only part I thought was well written was Kawasaki's forward!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Compelling subject, poor presentation","review":"I didn't need to read Mr. Carlton's bio to know he's a news journalist. The book reads like a 350 page news article. Tragic story, though, and worth sticking with for anyone who ever cared about Apple."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helpful introduction to Augustine","review":"Bentley-Taylor's book is short [166 pages of text] and easy to read. It includes a plentiful supply of short quotations from Augustine, tells the story of his life and gives an introduction to his writings. It is written from an evangelical point of view, but the author's theological perspective is not intrusive.In the course of telling the story, he mentions lots of names of people from Augustine's times who modern readers will not be familiar with. This may be necessary, but it would be helpful if he had told us a little more about some of these people, as on occasion, the story seems to be little more than a string of names.The author is not afraid to tell us where he thinks Augustine made mistakes. He is also fairly generous with him, and explains that many of Augustine's quirky ideas [to us today] are a product of his times.I highly recommend the book as a simple introduction to one of the most important people in Christian history."},{"rating":"2","title":"40 More Reasons to get this Book!!!","review":"Robert:Thanks again for another easy-to-read and even easier-to-implement, step-by-step guide for real estate investors of any level.

This can be made by oven method or bread machine - both instructions are on the box. After I mixed it and let it rest I was concerned that it only was as high as the bread pan.

It cuts well and the taste is the best we have tried."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yum!","review":"I am recently gluten-free, and first tried Bob's Red Mill Mix (it was o.k.) This was MUCH better! It doesn't have a really strong \\"GF\\" flavor, so I don't have to load it with toppings to cover it up. It is drier on the inside than Bob's--not the gummy texture.

I have been using it for over a year now, since I was diagnosed with Celiac disease, and I've never missed wheat bread since I began using it.It's very easy to make in the breadmaker. The mix does take two eggs, which might be more than some people would like to use, and butter or oil as well as milk or water. I usually use dry, non-fat milk and real butter. It made primarily of corn flour and rice flour, has a full flavor, and is dense but not heavy. My husband, who is not gluten free, enjoys it as well, especially toasted. It has been commented to me that it has a slightly sweet taste, but I don't particularly notice that.I use it for cold sandwiches such as peanut butter or chicken salad, for hot sandwiches such as grilled cheese, and it makes the most excellent toast I have ever eaten.I have tried other gluten free breads, but this remains my favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious and Soft","review":"I was skeptical about this gluten free bread actually tasting good (after some bad experiences with other poor excuses for gf bread).

She asks for a sandwich everyday now."},{"rating":"2","title":"Closest thing to regular bread!","review":"This is the closest thing I've found to regular bread. I find it simple to mix up and bake as well, which is even better! I warm the oven and pop it in there to rise, especially when it's cold out. It rises really nicely and then cooks up great. I have to cover mine partway through with foil to keep it from getting too dark on top. I have had trouble with it sticking to the pan when I go to get it out. My mother-in-law uses a double-walled pan (like the air bake cookie sheets, only in bread pan form I guess) and doesn't have any trouble with sticking, so I guess I'm going to have to try that! This gluten free bread mix is worth the time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"nearly foolproof mix, low on flavor","review":"I've had great success with this mix in my zojirushi bread machine. Ithe mix comes with a premeasured packet of yeast to which you simply add milk or water, eggs, and oil or butter. I have made bread with milk and butter and also with water and oil. I don't notice much difference between types.the loaf produced rises well, bakes quickly and has a fantastic crust. I find the plain white recipe lacking slightly in flavor, but have done well adding Italian spices/garlic/onion powder twosome loaves, and cinnamon and sugar to others.All in all this is a perfect loaf of bread for my gluten free kids' lunches. I bake a loaf on Sunday night and we slice off of it all week. the texture is excellent and the bread hold up well, no toasting required."},{"rating":"2","title":"My main stay for bead love it","review":"I tried a lot of breads but none measure up to this one.I am Gluten free amd I use this bread and even bake it in muffen rings and make H.B. buns that raise up and look and taste like regular H.B.Buns.

It is simple to make in the bread machine. I have found, however, that in my particular bread machine it does not do well on the gluten free setting. I have had much better luck using the traditional settings that take longer. On the GF setting it ends up too doughy. It is good for a couple of days after baking. I always have some of this on hand for when I am feeling too lazy to make homemade bread."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best GF Bread Mix out there!!!","review":"I've been Gluten Free for years, and have tried every bread mix, dough, or bread available. Anyone who has been on a GF diet will tell you...quite frankly...that GF bread just sucks. Recently, a few types of bread (Kinnickinick's especially) are good. However, it is expensive and is a TINY loaf.Someone bought me a box of this. I appreciated the gesture, but didn't expect much. I used Light Margarine (blue bonnet I think) and water rather than butter or regular margerine plus water. Even being GF, I also watch calories.I have a very basic, old bread machine without a Gluten Free setting. Having nothing to lose, I proceeded with the Basic setting on my machine.THE OUTCOME WAS AWESOME!!!!!I highly recommend this bread mix, and if you have a machine without the GF setting, this bread bakes up fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Bread Ever!","review":"I make at least two loaves a week,in a Breadman bread maker.

Unfortunately, after my initial purchase, I only received one additional shipment before the offer was discontinued and the price of the product went up considerably! I liked this brand because it has reasonably good texture and taste (compared with regular bread) and for a gluten-free it required minimal additional (and less costly) ingredients compared to other mixes I've tried. For now, I'm experiencing with other GF bread mixes I hadn't tried earlier and am leaning towards \\"Pamela's.\\" One other note on the \\"Pantry's\\" mix, IMO the bread's texture is better and it freezes better if it isn't cooked as long as directed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic bread","review":"This bread is fantastic.

So we gave the favorite sandwich bread mix a try, it was a couple dollars cheaper so we thought why not? The prep was easier than King Arthur with just one rise instead of two. The bread also rose higher and developed a thicker crust. Taste-wise though it's not as good as King Arthur, it reminded me of a bland Wonder Bread. But it's definitely a better alternative to those horrible tasting loaves you buy off the shelf or freezer section. Because the price is more attractive we'll stock this bread mix as a backup when our favorite is not available."},{"rating":"2","title":"Begin With This","review":"This is perhaps the easiest, most neutral tasting GF bread mix I have tried yet. It was the first I bought, and it made my GF transition much simpler.You CAN mix this by hand. I tried a single box first to be sure, then came here and ordered a case. It makes a large, 'normal' looking loaf of bread. The texture is wonderful for the first 2-3 days, then I slice what's left and store in my freezer until I need another slice. Try the Cinnamon Raisin bread recipe and make french toast for a real treat! Play around with the recipe. Try it with milk, then water. Try it with butter, then oil. Eggs, or egg-less. My personal combo is oil, eggs, and 3/4 water to 1/4 milk.The cons? A bit crumbly, and not enough 'chew' to the bread to pretend you are eating a rustic bread. All and all though...you can't go wrong starting your gluten free journey here."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't believe it's Gluten Free!!!","review":"We recently have gone gluten free to try and manage my lymphedema. One of the major problems was everything, especially bread was disgusting. Most products taste like a mix of wood glue and wood shavings, with some dirt thrown in. One of our major desires is bread that is soft, tastes good, and is not as heavy as an anchor....not brittle & dry & disgusting.THIS STUFF IS AWESOME!!!!!!!! It is easy to make, tastes amazingly good, is light & has a wonderful consistency and is soft. You can spread tuna fish salad on this bread without the bread crumbling into sawdust. It's good for peanut butter as well.Following the instructions on the box you get an awesome product.I have tweaked the directions a bit to suit our tastes more.I add an extra package of yeast, extra 1 TBSP sugar, use 1 whole egg & 2 egg-whites, and use whole milk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Consistently the best","review":"I've been using this product for my daughter for the past 3 years.

The tough question is which CD(s) to buy of the many available, including many with titles that include words like \\"best of\\" or similar claims. This CD is one good answer to that question. It has 20 cuts, including a number of Wills classics. It showcases his big band sound with a larger horn section, in addition to the irresistible fiddle, piano and electric and steel guitars and smooth vocals by Tommy Duncan. You do not have to be a country and western fan to get a huge kick out of this music. (Another good answer is the Tiffany Transcriptions Volume 2, Best of the Tiffanys. It has fewer cuts, but some I like better. It features more of a live sound.

Now the sufficiently-pristine 50mm lens was decorated with nose prints.I had never liked the idea of using a \\"soft microfiber cloth\\" to clean lenses; it just didn't seem like a good idea. So I browsed around a bit, and found out about the LensPen. Looked nice. Ordered one. It removed Samantha's nose prints, and polished up the lens quite nicely otherwise. Awesome."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grease magnet","review":"This lens cleaner has been endorsed by professional camera technicians at both Canon and at Leica USA. It will not cause damage to a lens and I rate it at 5 stars. It is also a grease and oil magnet and you need to wash the brush end in hot water and hang it to dry as one would hang and dry a good quality camel hair paint brush. As long as the brush is cleaned regularly you will be pleased.

I remember the first time I attempted to clean the LCD screen of my camera and the carbon started to smudge the glass or so I thought.

Sometimes it takes a puff of your breathe on the lens or filter for the pen to work, but this isn't a big deal and won't damage anything.

Once that happens it's basically useless..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not much of a system.","review":"I was excited to discover such a compact cleaning system, but upon use was very disappointed. The brush end works fine, but the cleaning head only smears any smudges you have on your lens.

Don't buy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It works.","review":"I bought this as it seemed more effective than lens cloths. I have to say, I still think lens cloths have their place (disposable ones anyway). But this little pen does a pretty good job of cleaning lenses.

I will buy one again when the time comes."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE This, and I'm Buying Another!","review":"This LensPen is great! It won't damage your lens like a lot of other fabrics might, and it fixes almost all smudges. I love that it's small and so portable, I take it with me everywhere. I use it on my lenses for my Canon XSi, along with the Zeikos filters I use to protect the lenses. I bet it'd work well on my eyeglasses, too!It's better to get the generic branded \\"LensPen\\" one here, rather than a 'Nikon' LensPen elsewhere...because it's cheaper, even though it's almost an identical product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very effective lens cleaning tool","review":"I just received the LensPEN today and gave it a try on all my lenses.

Especially for the price, I cannot believe how well it works. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for a quick fix!","review":"This is a great product for a quick lens clean. It's small and lightweight so it's perfect for small camera bags. It's even small enough to keep in your shirt pocket. I like how the brush retracts into the pen to keep from fraying or damage.

That filter is now semi-ruined, but fortunately it's not my lens got ruined.... I wonder if they tried to lower cost of production by outsourced it to some cheap manufacturing plant oversea....

I wish I had chosen the typical lens wipes or spray instead. This product sticks out as a simple, original, and effective cleaner but it hardly lives up to expectations. I use it on my glasses and iphone primarily. It's easy to hold and the brush is good at getting off random bits of particles that may have flown your way, but when you get down to it, the actual cleaner barely works. It explains to clean it circles - all this does is leave circular smudges on whatever surface was used. For the price of this product I would get something much more dependable and worthy. Maybe next time i'll save some money and just use some gosh darn sudsy water. I do not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what you expected.","review":"I got this unit and tried using it to clean my lens, using the brush end added grease to my lens. After reading reviews, one of them said that it maybe a counter fit. The other side seems to work fine. I saw a piece of lint in the viewfinder so I tried using the brush to brush it away. When I looked through, not only did it get worse because the brush fibers fell off, now it left a greasy smear on the view finder. I called Canon about my T3i, and it has to be sent in for repair. After reading more about how to clean the view finder, it was safer to send it to the service center to have it done professionally. It is just sad that I will be without my camera for the duration of the repair.Don't make the same mistake I do. If you are going to use it, use it only for the front of the lens.

DO NOT BUY IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for quick cleaning...","review":"While I would always recommend a microfiber/lint free lens cleaning cloth as the first choice for cleaning lenses, the LensPEN is an excellent alternative.The soft cleaning pad is pre-coated with a \\"dry carbon compound\\" that removes dust from the lens surface. The other end of the then pen houses a soft, retractable brush that removes accumulated dust and dirt.Great for quick clean-ups when you don't want to break out the wipes.This would be a 5 star product if it included a cover for the brush end; although it's retractable, it can still be exposed to ambient dust and grit when retracted, and a cover could mitigate this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the Real Deal!","review":"Not only does the shipped product not look like the picture, it doesn't work as well as an actual lenspen. It leaves black smudges on the paper I repeatedly tested it on so there's no way this thing is going to touch any of my lenses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective as noted in earlier comments (tip falls off and has black smudges)","review":"As I first tried to use the \\"pen\\" side to clean, I noticed that the felt was not attached to the pen itself. I thought about glueing it back on and using it but noticed that the black tip was creating very dirty black smudges which would obviously cause more trouble for whatever you try to clean.Would NOT receommend this product to anyone.

Doesn't require water or messy solution, no towelettes to have to clean up. Wish there were an indication of how long one of these pens is expected to last.

Don't get me wrong, Lord Shonto is a very good character, but in my opinion the whole plot and story of this book would have been better if Mr. Russell concentrated more on the development of Shuyun. All in all, I would recommend this book to Russell fans and anybody who likes fantasy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A very good book with few flaws","review":"It was a very good fantasy, with a blend of Chinese and Japanese cultures..... I have not read the sequel so I do not know the conclusion. I hate the commercial aspect where the author leaves so many unanswered questions at the end of this book. One must obviously buy the sequel if one is interested in getting answers. At this point I am sufficiently interested to overcome the negatives of this ploy, just barely. On the psoitive side, it is very good reading, and some small inconsistencies with some super-hero characters seem to be deliberate so that they appear \\"human\\". It works mostly. However one strong quality in the writing, is that the author presumes the reader has intelligence and more than a 6th grade education. This is refreshing."},{"rating":"2","title":"The comparison with Dune is apt","review":"I am capable of enjoying novels whose authors do not put the kind of thought into their back-stories as Russel has here, but in those rare cases where you can glimpse a breathing world behind the scenes, the enjoyment is greater. And so is the respect for the author.This was my first exposure to Russell. I'm glad I found it. Five stars. The sequel is harder to find right now, but worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a comment about the setting","review":"Someone posted a comment that they had a bit of trouble getting into it because it clashed with thier knowledge of Asian culture - this \\"almost\\" historical fantasy is characteristic of his work, his other series, Moontide and Magic Rise, is set in a world thats \\"almost\\" Europe at the turn of the 18th century."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful and gripping story","review":"This book and its sequel were such a pleasent surprise. I don't often pick up a book on a whim without knowing something about it before hand because my reading time is limited, but I sure am glad I picked this one up! Great story, great characters, very human, very well developed. Both books (brother initiate and gatherer of clouds) drag a bit at times but in way that builds suspense. I was dying to know what happens, but didn't want the book to end either. If you have a lot to do or have other projects to focus on, I do not recommend these books because you will not be able to put them down."},{"rating":"2","title":"fairly usefull tool","review":"It does what its supposed to do. If you drive L-shaped nails when installing hardwood flooring, and the nail doesnt drive all the way in, this is the tool to use. Better than a typical nail set. Has a wider tip for the wider nail head. Good product, worth the extra few bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste the $","review":"Spend a tenth of the price and get a regular nail set. This one slips off the cleat way too easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good when used for its intended purpose","review":"I am quite sure this tool was made strictly to set nails which are just barely above the surface of the wood when the porta-nailer did not drive them in completely. I've seen some other reviewers saying some negative things about this nail set but personally I have not had the issues they are describing, relating to its usage. It has worked out quite well when I used it to set some slightly raised T shaped cleats into the tongue and groove flooring. I have not had any problems with it. I do however feel the need to drop 1 star because that MSRP certainly is above what I think a nail set should cost, even if it has a more unusual shape. I think eight dollars would be more appropriate. Would I buy one again? Yes- because it is useful to me, but at over thirteen dollars plus shipping, that price tag certainly makes me frown a bit."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another chunk of steel for the scrap pile","review":"This tool is a big, heavy piece of high quality tool steel. It's easy to hold and smack with a hammer. Now, what is it good for? It sure isn't setting flooring cleats. The head is too tiny and way too smooth - I gave it a good G.D. try on dozens of slightly high cleat heads only to have it slip off every time. I tried roughing up the face with a diamond file - no help at all. I went back to my tried and true oversize nail punch and tossed this one into the back of the tool drawer. I guess it's good for punching a lower case sans serif L into wood. Save your money - this is not the tool you are looking for. Move along."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flooring Nail Setting Tool","review":"I'm using cleat flooring nails and found this tool completely worthless for setting them into hard maple. The tip is basically equivalent to a slot screwdriver, so it slipped right off of the nail head when aligned. I found a standard medium head nailset simpler and more effective."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sized well for the L-nails","review":"The setting tool is sturdy, but the tip is too small and has no \\"catch\\" to help it seat onto the nails. Something a little larger or with an alignment ridge would have been better for my purposes. If you already have a decently sized nailset, this one offers little additional advantage. Otherwise, it's plenty well made and held up to use just fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the price and doesn't even come close to getting the job done!","review":"I purchased this tool because I install a lot of flooring. I switched to a stapler instead of a cleat and was looking for something to drive misfires in. Well I can positively state that this is NOT that tool. As previously stated the \\"tip\\" is rounded just like a flat headed screwdriver and so is the staple. So imagine trying to hit a tiny rounded object with another tiny rounded object that you need to hold precisely in place while hitting it with great force. Oops. Not the best design. Look at the end of a quality nail punch and you will see that it is concave (dished in). I would return this if I could. I recommend just using a regular nail punch and bending the staple down into the tongue instead of trying to drive the staple the rest of the way in on a misfire."},{"rating":"2","title":"must have tool for installing hardwood floors","review":"Like the header says this is a must have tool if you install or plan on installing T&G hardwood flooring. there are times when the flooring \\"cleat\\" just does not set all the way, and it will need a little persuasion. This is just the tool to do it. I know some people who use a regular screwdriver for this task, but that is dangerous as most screwdrivers are made of hardned steel and are likly to chip and possibly cause injury to yourself, or someone else."},{"rating":"1","title":"not so hot","review":"This flooring nail setting tool was admittedly handy, but it was actually unnecessary for setting the flooring cleats we used. In fact, we used a regular nail set quite often in our project when the cutter had the fancy tool and all the nailer had was a finish nail nail set. If money is no object, by all means, buy one.

I ended up using my finishing nail setting tool instead and surprisingly that worked better. The finishing nail setting tool has tiny round tip with groove instead of this flat screw driver looking tip. That groove helped to prevent slipping when I apply with a hammer. I initially thought the round tip could ruin the nail head or puncture or leave round impression on the hardwood material but this wasn't the case. I paid three dollars for the set of finishing nail setting tools (3 total in different size) at local store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't need it","review":"The staple gun I bought (the Bynford) worked so well, I did not need this tool.

There is not a quest or a goal she must accomplish. She basically wanders around. The mermaids she meets are beautiful, shallow jerks but that was lost on my 4 year old. Ultimately Rani returns home because Tinkerbell tracks her down. She accomplishes little.I am not sure whether to get another of these fairy books. I like Fairy Crown because it made sense and there was a takeaway message. If the message in Mermaid Lagoon is that one should appreciate people for what they are, not how they look, it is too subtle - partly because although the mermaids are drawn beautifully, Rani herself is no slouch.Plus we were really hoping for a Tusked Nevershark to show up, but no luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rani in the Mermaid Lagoon","review":"I think this book is great!

But then she realizes how much she misses the Pixie Hollow and would rather face mean Vidia than the mermaaid Oola and her snobby friends (in my opinon). She also misses the feeling of the wind blowing against her hair when she's flying on the back of Brother Dove (who is her wings) instead of riding on the back of her seahorse friend.

There is no tension in the first half of the book; no suspense, no real mystery. The action is concentrated at the end. The author employs a tactic used too often in female-centered mysteries; the murderer behaves like a gentleman the first time the protagonist gets too nosy, bopping her on the head but then delivering her unconscious body to her home.

The frequent mentions of Walmart might have been overlooked, but the laudatory paragraphs advertising Home Depot in the middle of the book are startlingly obvious and strain credibility.

Since that time, the Iraq War has gone through endless issues as the U.S. has become bogged down in this country. Rummy has since been thrown out of his job.The first four to five chapters are actually very informative. It is the last five that puff up Rumsfeld's image.

Well, my disappointment in the movie started about 10 minutes in to it. The jokes were raunchy and unfunny, and neither of the actors that I admired for their previous work were at their best in this ridiculously tasteless flick.Better luck next time, Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler.

It has a very thin premise of him \\"coaching\\" her on how to successfully snare a man and of course in the end they are supposed to fall in love as they both learn to understand the other gender. The jokes aren't funny and the stereotypes of men and women are just plain depressing. I am stunned this movie even got made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth 1 star","review":"I've enjoyed K.H. and G.B. so much. However, they're performance in this movie was no where near the quality of previous movies.My strongest comment has to do with the immediate blast of foul language. I don't live in a bubble, and hear co-workers and friends (bleep) all the time. If this is common dialogue used within certain so-called intelligent, funny, chic people, thank God I don't know or want to know anyone who would be flattered by someone who speaks as if he was playing the role of a pimp.This dvd will not go to friends, nor donated.

The movie is full of laughs and Heigl and Butler are great in it. The essence is in the title! The vibrating briefs are a take-off on Meg Ryan's character in \\"When Harry Met Sally\\" for those of you who remember, and if you do a Google search, Amazon has the lowest price & has been sold out for months on the vibrating briefs.

The characters are enjoyable, the plot isn't too far- fetched, the funny bits are funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delightful","review":"The on screen connection between Heigl and Butler highlights the success of this film. Abbey, a hard working executive producer is faced with the challenging task of improving the quality of the show to increase the ratings. Herein lies the change, Butler comes in and provides a raunchy, unexpected and at times insightful analysis between men and women. The change not only increased the number of viewers for the show but led to a collaborating relationship between Abbey and Mike who ended up helping her landed her dream guy. I don't want to give away the ending for those who haven't seen it but it is worthwhile romantic comedy.This is the type of movie that you can watch over and over again. There are both unpredictable and predictable events in this movie.If you enjoyed Maid in Manhattan (Jennifer Lopez) and/or Fever Pitch (Drew Barrymore). I think you would enjoy this one as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my cup of tea","review":"At the very beginning of this movie you can tell that it's going to be very crude.

Sadly it didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"degrading production for both two talented actors and the viewers","review":"I looked forward to this movie when I heard it was on the way since I like both Katherine Heigl and Gerard Butler. But it was a disappointment and degrading to both men and women. I liked both actors much less after seeing it. Most of the slender plot moves forward with crude, slapstick-style humour (Katherine Heigl hanging from a tree with her entire lower half showing, the vibrating panties gag scene, a bodacious mud wrestling scene for Gerard where even he looks embarrassed to be there), and after the immature characters throw a fit and totally cut each other down, I was unable to believe in the kiss-and-make-up scene. On the one hand, such shallow people deserve each other, on the other, as shallow as they are, they are very unlikely to stick together through any challenge. A waste of time and mind space, in my view, don't fill your head with the trashy images and ideas contained in this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"The leads have no sexual chemistry!","review":"In a movie that is billed as a \\"sexy, romantic comedy\\", don't your main characters have to actually be sexy and romantic together? Because I may be alone in this but I thought their chemistry was severely lacking. They are beautiful people but with no spark whatsoever! And Katherine Heigl - Lord I used to love her until I realized she plays the exact same character in every movie! There were a few parts in the movie that made me giggle but mostly it was pretty lame!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Surprise!!","review":"When I saw the marquees & previews for this movie, I blew it off as another rom com. Yawn. Stumbled upon it on cable, and was delighted with it. We DVR'ed it and watch it whenever we can. It is predictable, yes...but it's also surprisinly REAL. You could really see this sort of thing happening in real life.It gets a little crude and bawdy in some parts..but it makes up for it.My favorite scenes? The panty scene...and whenever Abby does her happy dance."},{"rating":"2","title":"WAY TOO FUNNY","review":"When looking over the shows that were playing some time ago, trying to decided what my 13 year old and I were going to see, we came across this one. We both like Gerard Butler after seeing him in a few movies, including PHANTOM OF THE OPERA. Thank goodness I decided to look at the movie trailer. I quickly realized it was not appropriate for my 13 year old. When I later saw it at our local library, I checked it out, remembering that I had been interested in it. It didn't take long to realize the mistake I would have made if I'd allowed my daughter to watch it, much less if I'd seen it in the movie theater. It was far beyond inappropriate for her, and I would have turned three shades of red watching it in a room full of people.With that said, it was hysterical! Very funny! Great acting and put together well. I haven't laughed that much in a long time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relax..and just enjoy!","review":"Hilarious movie! For those who like to be fun and dirty at the same time and arent uptight about sex or easily offended - and who feel comfortable and confident in themselves. Just plain good fun - and what chemistry between the two. People may be offended - but the dialogue in this is real life raunchy dialogue that happens between good friends and lovers too. Come on! Just enjoy the ride...this is WAY better than that unbelievable, fairy tale, love story P.S. I Love You...that gagged me and the characters did not touch me as it was so unbelievable all the goo, dreamy stuff, romantic overkill - blechh. This is fun for couples and friends alike.

I got it as a gift from someone who said, \\"Have you seen it? Oh, it's really cute!\\" Um, if you like to be offended then it's about as cute as it gets.The movie it seems was produced by Heigl, who really has to re-examine how she wants to be thought of. I would not be proud to have my name all over this what-did-she-just-say?? piece of crap.I'm really not easily offended, so hats off to the Ugly Truth: you could get a prize for most potty mouth language and situations in one movie.I kept thinking it would get better, though I don't know why...and it didn't.When you read a review like mine, be assured: we speak the truth.

Gerard Butler is a great actor and has done some really good movies. This one was NOT one of them. If you want to be irritated by Hiegl and disappointed by Butler, then this is a MUST see movie - otherwise give it a big miss."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T LET THOSE 5-STAR RATINGS FOOL YOU!","review":"Unless you want to spend time with crude sexual remarks, cliches, stereotypes and some of the boringness action on a screen, you do not want to see this movie. Read those other one- and two-star ratings and believe them. Then, if you must see it, try to watch it for free. I thought I could get through it because I like both Heigl and Butler, but after about fifteen minutes, I realized this picture had no watchable qualities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your $$$","review":"Crass and at times pretty disgusting.

Perhaps my expectations were too high. My issue is with the quality and attention to detail in this board. I've played chess for over 25 years and used everything from wood and metal boards to Chessmaster. The design was aesthetically very poor; little to no effort was put into making the Knight look like a horse and the Kings were marginally differentiated from the queen. The execution of the design was worse; cut lines in the bishops weren't straight or clean while pieces of felt were still stuck to random parts of the pieces. The boad itself is simple particle board. I undrstand these are \\"hand carved\\" pieces but this thing made me feel like it was something my 4-year old niece would have done. If you read my other reviews you will see that, for the most part, I am not a curmudgeon or extremely picky. But this thing just got mailed back to Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Classic wood chess set","review":"Very poor quality. First day the latch that holds the folding game together broke.

Also, the little elastic straps on the inside to hold the pieces broke the first time I tried to use them. Additionally, the top of the board is beveled and looks like its going to come off any second."},{"rating":"1","title":"Paid too much for a piece of crap","review":"I bought this chess board to teach my 6 year old how to play and I am giving it a low rating because I do not think that the price I paid reflects the product, to be blunt it is not worth the price. The pieces are so light weight which makes playing hard because they topple over easy. There are bands in the inside of the board so you can store each individual piece which is a nice feature and I like it. I also found that the board has problems closing. You can smell real wood when you play the game which is nice but I would imagine that it would be a nicer board and its kind of generic. Do not waste your money on this board."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful, heart warming story","review":"Wonderful, well acted story of the Gretzky families struggle to help Walter Gretzky recover from a life altering stroke.

The repeater worked only intermittently and without any discernible cause for its random failure. I did ultimately determine that the greatest cause of interference was the TV itself - not helpful. It's worth pointing out that the interference was not reflected light but radio noise.Another nit would be that the installation instructions are poorly written and Buffalo's website offers nothing more.I purchased these items from Home Controls and they have been fair and square with me about it. I'm just sorry I invested the effort and drilled a hole in my cabinet. And, yes, I tested the unit before drilling the hole."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work with Samsung Plasma","review":"As others have stated my Plasma TV generates enough IR noise that it overwhelms the sensor in this and keeps the signal from reaching the gear its intended to control.

Drilled a hole in the top of the cabinet above the TV and installed the IR350 repeater...hooked up to the IR receiver and ran a flasher eye to the front of my A/V receiver and another one to my Directv box. Works flawlessly. I have also installed a similar system in my living room on my big home theater....it works great too. I do have an issue occasionally where the repeater won't flash - I would say this happens once or twice a year, so in that case, I have to manually turn on the A/V receiver - no big deal for the other 363 days a year when it works fine. For the money, it's a huge convenience to control all of the hidden equipment behind closed doors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buffalo IR-350 Cabinet Mount IR receiver","review":"Please see my review of the associated IR-100 receiver module.

The downside is there are no real Broadway Divas...where is Bernadette Peters, Patti LuPone, Betty Buckley, or (even if she is more West End than Broadway) Elaine Paige?

You can do better for the price from another brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Consider this a disposable umbrella","review":"We purchased this last year and used it on one vacation. It was easy to set up and use, and it was sufficient for protecting us from the sun. However, on the 5th day of our trip, a strong gust of wind bent the umbrella at a 90 angle and when we straightened it back up, it broke completely. Given the price, it may still be cheaper than renting one for the week, but don't expect to get too much use out of it beyond one or two vacations."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEST UMBRELLA FOR THE MONEY","review":"I bought two of these beach umbrellas in the Summer of 2010. We have just finished our third beach vacation and these umbrellas have held up very good. There were strong winds one of the days and everyones beach canopies were flying and tumbling, but our umbrellas held up beautifully. We even saw another umbrella that was identical to these; that went inverted with the strong winds, and it was good as new the next day..The material is a little bit thin, but that does not hinder the performance of the umbrella. The colors are still as brilliant as they were brand new. I just bought a third one because each vacation we seem to be adding people to our family! I initially bought these because of the price; I bought another because they stand the test of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Large, light-weight, and secure","review":"The bottom of the pole has a plastic screw and the top of the bottom segment has an aluminum rod that fits through two holes to make a handle. This is easier to screw into the sand than the umbrella holder we have for our other umbrella because you don't have to bend over as far. And the long pole means you can put it deeper in the sand and still have plenty of room underneath it.For those who were concerned about the thickness of the material, I spent a week at the beach under this umbrella without sunscreen and didn't burn.The canopy is larger than average which is great on the beach but be careful that it may not fit across your trunk because of the long pole. A related problem is that the cap is somewhat fragile and made of plastic that resists superglue and epoxy so once it has broken off -- as ours did trying to fit it into the car -- you can't repair it. I fear that the top of the canopy panels will fray now that they are exposed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice umbrella","review":"This product works well but you will need to get a sand anchor for it even though without it it can withstand some wind but for those breezy days here in FLA a sand anchor is a must."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Umbrella.","review":"I had one of these rio umbrellas 2yrs ago.

We anchored it nice and deep in the sand and it seemed secure. However with a gust of wind the material turned upside down and it seemed like the umbrella was going to go flying. I did not use it for the rest of my trip because it made me too nervous. Other people's umbrellas which appeared to be more flimsy, were staying up, but this one I just didn't feel comfortable with. HOpefully, we can find some use for it on our deck at some point, but when I go back to the beach I will buy something smaller ."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thin metal shaft","review":"Umbrella worked OK for the first several times, however the shaft bent and snapped at the site of the telescoping insertion during a small wind gust.The flaw in the construction is in the area where the lever is inserted through the shaft in order to screw the umbrella into the sand; this weakens the metal and is the site where it snapped."},{"rating":"2","title":"end og summer","review":"I like the way the umbrella looks.

We used the umbrella a few times and it worked great. It's easy to deploy and has a lot of strength as it held up with no problem in some pretty stiff gusts of wind.

Very happy with the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Umbrella","review":"This beach umbrella is beautiful and as with all purchases from Amazon, it held up and met all my expectations.

When I went to bend the pole back, it snapped in half. This was only after the 7th time I used it, so needless to say, this is a poor value for the price. I think the problem is that it's too big and the pole isn't sturdy enough. It catches a lot of wind, where a smaller umbrella doesn't.Luckily, I bought this umbrella on sale for $40, and even then, I'm upset that it didn't even last one season. I would not recommend you buy this product if you are looking for a long-term umbrella."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never Received","review":"I placed an order for this umbrella on May 31 with a promised delivery by June 9th.

We take it down each night and bring it in when storms approach and don't leave it out when it doesn't need to be used, it will probably last us a long while. It is well constructed with 16 ribs (quarter inch nylon plastic) and the two-section pole is made from one and one-quarter inch aluminum tubing. It has a push button release for lowering the umbrella which is sometimes stiff to operate however, the tilt mechanism works well. It packs away easily in to the nylon and vinyl carrying case. We expect many good seasons of use from this cheerful addition to our backyard experience!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Extreme laceration hazard, aluminum pole sheared in light winds,","review":"This umbrella is extremely dangerous. Do NOT attempt to tighten the screw in bottom with the umbrella canopy erect. We used this umbrella for the first time last week on a moderately breezy day at a beach. The umbrella was wobbling a bit, so my husband attempted to tighten it down further in the sand with the crosspin, which threads through the bottom pole portion to provide leverage. After less than a 360 degree turn, the bottom pole portion sheared into two pieces, resulting in two hazardous raw metal edges. Had one of us (or our baby) been hit with one of the edges, a SERIOUS laceration would have occured. This product should be recalled immediately, or at the very least, bear a warning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not For The West Coast","review":"We bought this beach umbrella last spring in anticipation of our mid-May trip to Coronado in San Diego. We even bought the Rio Sports Sand Anchor to go with the Rainbow 8' Beach Umbrella with carry bag. My son set it up on the Silver Strand Beach on Mother's Day Sunday. The umbrella was in place for about five minutes while my son sat under it. The wind then picked it up and started to blow it off the beach. My son chased after it all the way into the parking lot. It was about to blow into the roadway right before he finally caught it. We noticed that everybody else at the beach had umbrellas or shade tents with four big wooden poles that they hammered down to withstand the wind. I can't imagine anyone using this umbrella except maybe at a Gulf Coast Beach in the middle of the summer when there's absolutely no weather at all. Either that or you might use it in your own backyard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"colorful and recognizable on the beach. Nice wide span to block the sun and the screw end makes it easy to get into the ground."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love the umbrella, not the best made product","review":"We purchased this umbrella for a trip to the coast, expecting sun and wind. The umbrella itself is great- we were able to enjoy the beach with our baby, completely shielded from sun and wind by adjusting the umbrella. Even our dogs were able to lay in the shade. No extra parts needed to stabilize. The down side is the carrying strap broke the second time we were carrying it down to the beach. We also noticed problems with the stitching on the umbrella itself (stitching completely missing between two colors) -not actually falling apart- yet. While the umbrella was great for our week's vacation, it was very difficult to cart it down to the beach and back without a carry-on strap, and we don't know how long it will last in its unstitched form. E-mail to the seller did not generate any response at all...recommend purchasing an umbrella like this from someone else who will assist if problems with the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Easily Broken","review":"It was a nice umbrella until the pole connectors snapped w/o much force.

I do not think this product is worth the money. I will be ordering a different umbrella from a different source."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke first time I used it!","review":"The item was very bad quality. I opened after receiving a month late and found a dent in the pole. After waiting so long for the item I made the mistake of not returning it. The first time I used it on a beach the pole bent and broke in two! The pole is not built sturdy enough to support such a large umbrella. I would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst experience ever","review":"I thought this was a premium umbrella I could use for years, but it turns out it is complete junk on the first try.I was excited about this new umbrella, but it was a disaster from the moment we arrived at the beach. First, it has no auger for drilling into the sand (in contrast to what some reviews say). Next, the lever-type latch that attaches the umbrella to the base is complete junk -- the lever does not retract. So it took me about 6 tries to jiggle the umbrella into the base pole and lock it. When I finally did, I noticed that the umbrella fabric was completely unattached at the top, and all of the ribs had fallen off of the fabric. That took me another 20 minutes to fix.Finally, after the umbrella blew away and we decided to leave, I couldn't get the umbrella back into the bag because the fabric remained unattached at the top of the umbrella. Push the umbrella into the bag, and the fabric bunches up and slides down."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad design -- pops off in wind -- try Beachmall 8-ft HvyDuty","review":"Purchased this umbrella in 2010. Worked fine for a few times, but the lever design which holds the umbrella on the top pole into the lower pole is very poor. It loosened and umbrella goes for a sail in even low winds. Tried securing with lashing to hold the lever down, but this is a time-consuming set up and still doesnt do the job in higher winds. Just purchased the 8 ft. Heavy Duty Beach Umbrella UPF100+ with Tilt - Fiberglass Ribs from Beachmall on Amazon http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B004P98PO0/ref=oh_o00_s00_i00_detailsCosts $69.99 and worth it. Top pole snaps securely into bottom pole. Umbrella has silver lining coating and really blocks the sun (unlike the Rainbow) - as a SPF of 100 vs the SPF 50 for this one. Sturdy pole.

The author attempts to make some valid points and if you can read through the horrible grammar, lack of proofing, inconsistent font types, and profanity there are actually a few jewels of useful knowledge in the book. I think an effective writing course and an editor would do wonders for the author. I have to say the reference to Leon Phelps was really funny though (from Jimmy). I read the first half of the book (which is for ladies) then skipped on to the male section. Much of the book is actually duplication from each portion. I was overall very disapppointed, and it's difficult to take an author as an authority on any topic if they are unable to effectively communicate their thoughts."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW!

Not to mention the over the top admiration for himself. \\"Raymoni Love is Wonderfull!\\", \\"Raymoni Love is the MAN!!!!\\" The book itself was awful.

Mr. Love has a grasp of the English language as strong as any toddler has of metaphysics. Whether it is his remarkable ability to mix verb tenses or the occasional misspelling of words, Mr. Love's book will provide hours of entertainment. On this, I suspect he actually wrote at least two of the previous three reviews judging by the similar style of writing.All details aside, you may ask how Mr. Love actually grasps the dynamic between men and women? Unfortunately, I no longer have my copy of this work to provide you with actual quotations of Love's wisdom, but suffice it to say his understanding of the male-female dynamic is somewhere on the level of SNL's Leon Phelps, aka 'The Ladies Man'.Those of you familiar with The Ladies Man might actually get some enjoyment out of this book if you try reading it with his tone of voice, I know I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent, people need to do one for Taiwan","review":"This movies is excellent.But I think if someone would do one for Taiwan would be excellent.Now, I guess Taiwan is undergoing a very intricate relationship with China, what if the history is changed.What if Japan never gave up Taiwan, and say Japan negotiated a peace treaty with the allies in 1945, kept Taiwan.What would the world be like today?Everyone in Taiwan will be Japanese, they would not have the slightest idea that they have relationship with China if it was not for the fifty five years of Mainland Chinese administration.Taiwan would look like Japan in every way, like Kyushu I guess."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you don't martyr yourself, all the martyrs before you will have died in vain.","review":"Both sides of this story are retarded.

And I don't understand why Japan being able to hold onto Korea and Manchuria would prevent them from going for the Philippians and other countries.The time travel element does not shed any light about the current state of affairs. What we really need is a story where a Chinese, a Korean, and a Japanese person get stuck on and island and hash it out. Or perhaps an Asian Mark Twain needs to show how pointless honor can be.Something about the dialog and filming has a lot of emotion behind it which is why I give it more that one star.

After an entire book of relating the nasty things that have happened on Plum Island---and ARE happening--Carroll suggests that perhaps Plum Island is needed.

His description of the various \\"laws\\" of nature that produce success, such as the \\"Law of Cause and Effect,\\" the \\"Law of Subconscious Activity\\" and the \\"Law of Belief,\\" contribute to the book's feeling of authority, although the basis for calling such patterns of action and outcome \\"laws\\" may be uncertain. Yet, the device works well here, and many readers like to be told exactly what steps to take. In short, we recommend this zippy retelling of popular prescriptions for success - though the prescription is like mother's old-fashioned medicine: nothing new, but it goes down very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than Maximum Achievment","review":"My personal Brian Tracy book rank would be as Follows:1.

Seriously , I think there are about 5 or 6 guys out there who are competing with themselves under 50 band names . Hey it worked for Amway . That is all these new bands are (consumer product) with zero awareness of art . There is no talent here , in fact the songs sound like something that would be on kids television but with a distortion box on the guitar. These \\"wet-behind the ears\\" type bands are only mimicking the other discharge they hear and picking up a guitar etc to follow the pack . Real artists have a calling and do it because they are driven. These guys just want to do enough to get laid and it shows .Keep up the good work boys , in a few years you may get a chance to work with Nikelodeon.Total waste and should be sacking groceries .

Popular music in a sad state of affairs if the music buying public is actually taking this sort of trash seriously. The Reason is nothing more than a pop-culture afterthought, the product of image driven, corporatized muck. It is the kind of disposable music that will be forgotten within the year, I guarantee it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The \\"Reason\\" Hoobastank sucks","review":"After listening to this cd(I did not buy it myself) and their hit song \\"Reason\\" which is constantly being overplayed on the airwaves, I'm amused as well as disgusted. Great, one more whiny boy band with a three power chord progression attempting to sell something to the teenage masses. Just what the music industry needed. If I wanted a soppy, crybaby story, I'd turn on Dr. Phil when I got off work. As someone who takes music seriously, Hoobastank doesn't. Their lousy lyrics and novice muscial talent is almost enough for me to induce vomiting. If your 15 and your girlfriend or boyfriend broke up with you, and you need a reason to feel sorry for yourself because no one else will, I highly recommend this cd. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry, but its bad.","review":"Excuse me for saying, but this release is one of the worst of 2004. Maybe I'm biased, since I was never the biggest Hoobastank fan, but their previous CD had enormous potential. Unfortunately, it was thrown away for some production value. Their songwriting talents mirror that of a seventh grader. Take the title song for instance. No matter how cute and catchy you think the song may be, the bottom line is that it is terrible. Absolutely terrible. The real crime is that this album was nominated for a few Grammys. So many artists out there are releasing music that actually makes a difference, actually means something, and yet they are overshadowed by recycled lyrics. Pitiful."},{"rating":"1","title":"no Reason to buy this","review":"i am only goin by the reason cause thats all i heard and i thought it was pretty good. got sick of it pretty quickly tho, quicker than most songs.also something for the most common society out there: the mtv haters - so many of u all saying the same things about how this is pop (which it is) so stay away from it. it amazes me when people like music and just having other people liking it turns them off a band. u should enjoy sharing ur tastes with other people."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ohhhh what a letdown.....","review":"First, let me say how much I LOVED their first album. I can listen to it nonstop for weeks at a time and still not get sick of its variety.Now, for the honesty of this album...Two words: IT SUCKED.There were about 2, maybe 3 songs that I could tolerate. The Reason (of course), Out Of Control, and What Happened To Us?. I don't mean to be mean, you know, but it's like, I don't want anybody else to be sucked into buying the album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"I cannot for the life of me figure out what all the hype is about \\"The Reason\\". Yeah, its a pretty little pop ballad that could be a good slow dance song or a good makeout song, but the musicianship is pretty bad in it. Its really preditable and the guitars in the chorus sound really uninspired and just... bad. Out Of Control is a pretty good song though, the only redeeming factor here.

The best song on here is \\"Out of Control\\" in my opinion. I think the album should've been named Out of Control, and not The Reason. But that's just my opinion. Overall, I recommend this cd to anyone who wants to listen to some good alternative rock, but nothing that is real heavy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, enjoyable tunes!!!","review":"I heard the Reason on the radio and though what a pretty good tune. I listen to the samples on Amazon and decided I needed to get this album. Since I am in my mid thirties, nothing new strikes me anymore.

That was good. This album... on the other hand, isnt worth the effort of a dog defacating on it. It is sooooooooo bad. The song \\"The reason\\" is prolly the worst song in history. It is so sad to see a bad that had the goods... to degrade themselves with this effort.... oops... effort is too good a word to use for this piece of crap.

Great line to open a song with \\"I'm not a perfect person\\", oh come on! Who do you think you are? Mariah Carey? Can you try being atleast a little more creative than that?I gave the album a try when a coworker lend it to me to hear it at work. I nearly skipped every song after 40 seconds because I couldn't bear anymore what these freaks had written. For some reason they mostly atract teenage kids that by wearing converse shoes they think they're punks or rockers. I hope their record contract expires soon or better yet removed.Don't waste your money nor time on this. It's very bad!"},{"rating":"1","title":"One of the reasons MTV sucks today","review":"Why did MTV constantly played \\"The Reason\\" when it first came out? Not even Nirvana's \\"Smells like Teen Spirit\\" or Metallica's \\"Enter Sandman\\" got that much play and those songs, well they're so much better than this crap that words can't explain it. MTV was probably paid to air this just like those s***ty ass rappers whose music sucks pay MTV (probably), RAP SUCKS! I don't hate Hoobastank because they have made some decent songs like \\"Out of Control\\", but other than that this CD sucked a big one :>C.

Just about every hit worthy modern rock band, with its forced melodies and songs that are made for the sake of a hit or a reason to headbang, sounds like Hoobastank and vice Versa. THis album has no vision, no style, it's all the same thing over and over. Maybe the name of the band does give them a clue to what they themselves think: Hooba Stanks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Docile...Tame....(cough) boring Rock","review":"This band is indistinguishable from any other band out there. It is not a particulary good listen, and the song Out of Control is just some guy screaming......I'm feeling out of control, out of control over and over again. If you like nickelback or default, you will like this album because for all I care, it could have been written by those bands. Hoobastank is just not good at expressing emotions.....if there are emotions.As a closing statement, i am not one of those people who go around pointing fingers at bands and saying sellout MtV radio played band yuck.

Well, I'm not. I bought their first album, and I'll even admit to liking some of the songs on it. But this trash is just too rank for me to ignore. I believe that this album has three singles so far: \\"Out of Control,\\" \\"The Reason,\\" and \\"Same Direction.\\" None of these songs are any good, and one of them (\\"The Reason\\") makes my ears bleed whenever I'm forced to listen to it. OK, so that's an exaggeration, but this anger just builds up inside of me when I realize that this song actually gets air time on MTV, VH1, and radio stations. \\"The Reason\\" gets my vote for Worst Popular Music Song of All History. Boy bands have come out with better songs. There are only three words I have to say about Hoobastank's second album: crash and burn."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!!","review":"Awesome it is!! (and awesome is a very powerful word, almost as powerful as....love) This cd is the bestest. You can find a song that you can relate to for any given moment. No matter how you're feeling, just slip this cd in your player and listen to the lyrics. There's going to be one song that speaks to you on EXACTLY how you're feeling. I guarantee it. Linkin Park does the same to you. That's why i think another reviewer before was comparing them to linkin park. Music wise, they don't sound that close, but lyircs wise, they get inside your head just the same. There should be more bands like them."},{"rating":"2","title":"not AS good","review":"i have to admitt, being a huge hoobastank fan that this album wasn't AS good as the first but i still enjoy listening to it very much. I think i remember reading someone's review, they made it sound as if all the songs were the same and they all meant the same thing. All i have to say to him is READ THE LYRICS JACKASS! Ne ways, i think this album was very good. i heard this new stuff way before the new album dropped and even then i thought the sound was addictive. I get the music stuck in my head all the time. i would definitly recomend a hoobastank fan buy it or even someone that listens to similar music. i just now got my friend out of liking pop bull, and into listening to music from Brand New, Default, Taking Back Sunday and so on. definite recomendation."},{"rating":"1","title":"And The Winner For The \\"Sophmore Slump Award\\" Goes To...","review":"HOOBASTANK and their Sophmore Album \\"The Reason\\"...What The Hell Is This Crap Anyway? This is NOT the Hoobastank that gave us songs like \\"Pick up the Pieces\\" and \\"Running Away\\", it's a Hoobastank that has managed to bore us to death with their long awaited second release. I'll admit, \\"Out Of Control\\" was a pretty cool song before it got played out by radio, but almost every other song on here sucks. They all talk about the same boring subject over and over again, and the 12 tracks put it one step above \\"The All American Rejects\\" in snooze factor 5.

Its music is amazing and the lyrics are just as good. Plus, the songs are even better when heard live in concert. I saw them a couple months before they released the album, and when they said they were playing new stuff from their album I couldn't wait to hear it. It was an awesome show. BUY THE CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh man...","review":"The first time I had heard \\"The Reason\\" on the radio, I cried. Not because it was emotional, but because it was such a stupid, un-emotional, generic attempt at making a \\"sweet\\" love song by a band that had some rock cred. Now \\"The Reason\\" is everywhere, being played on your local pop stations every hour on the hour, on adult stations being played next to a bunch of old cheesy 80's ballads, and who knows, maybe it made it onto rap stations by now? Anyways, none of the other songs on this CD are very good either. Their just your standard Linkin Park style of music, so I guess if you like that then buy this. Hooba does stank, indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Bad Bad","review":"I was at the store and had three CDs in my hand Hoobastank, Switchfoot and Nickleback, and for some reason I chose this one and I deeply regret it.I hate this CD, the only two good songs are 'The Reason' and 'Out of Control'. The CD is so repetitive, most of it sounds exactly the same. I was really disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!","review":"Everyone has to check out this CD...even if you aren't a rock/indie fan. It is a truely original CD! The tracks are down to earth and can really touch a person. You can relate to at least one song.My Top 3 Songs:1:What Happend To Us: Song about a relationship that is breaking. It is an awesome song. The chours is a awesome.2:Unaffected: Great song about being different and not being accepted. The gutair is great, and again the chours is great.3:The Reason: A great rock balled. Robb really shows off it vocal talent. The song...you might have heard it on the radio is about a relationship that is done, and how he was trying to fix it...very powerfulIf ya don't believe me on this CD....go and by it...you'll love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"hoobastank avoids sophomore slump","review":"This album is a little different than their first one.

It was this track, Out of Control (their first single), and Same Direction that inspired tme to buy this CD. It was a great investment. Robb has such a great voice, and he belts outsongs very well, and puts a lot of passion into them. I like all different types of rock, so it's not like I'm a Hooby-bopper. The best tracks are:The ReasonOut of ControlWhat Happened To Us?Same DirectionThis is a relatively cheap CD, and it is an excellent buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Reason Rocks","review":"When I bought Hoobastank's first self-titled CD, I thought that It couldn't get any better. Well, I was wrong. \\"The Reason\\" not only incorporates traditional Hoobastank rock, but also a lighter melodic side that I have never seen before. All in all, I think that \\"The Reason\\" is one of the best CD's I have ever bought and I think everyone else should too."},{"rating":"1","title":"HoobaSTINK","review":"How can anyone take Hoobastank seriously? What kind of name is Hoobastank? Fist I have to say this: They suck! \\"The Reason\\" they suck is this: These people cannot sing worth crap. People like Hoobastank should have never been handed a microphone. Their songs were overplayed. Which is about every single one of them. So why waste money when you can STILL hear them on the radio. The songs sound the same but with different lyrics. The things they talk about are retarded, just like this band and CD. I Bought the CD before they were on the radio, thinking they were pretty good, because a friend told me about them. So when I got home I listened to the CD, and wen to hide it.

This band dosen't seem motivated to make creative music at all, they are just simply riding the crybaby rock wave. Though this isn't as horrible as pop punk and emo, it is still very bad. When the lead \\"singer\\" starts to whine around saying,\\"i'm not a perfect person...\\", it sounds like he's crying to his mother after he spilled milk all over the table. I don't understand why people like listening to this \\"feel sorry for me because my girlfriend left me\\" garbage. I mean, it's okay to write love songs and songs about relationships, but please sing, don't whine!

You know, I start to not care about this relationship after hearing about it for 50 minutes. Something horrible must have happended to the people of Hoobastank to make them right so many songs about the same thing.

I cannot emphasize how bad it is, 1 star does not show just how low a score this music deserves.

Second, The Reason is one of the most annoying things ever, giving Paris Hilton's saying of \\"that's hot\\" a run for its internet porn money.Ranting aside, there are a bunch of reasons why this is a bad album. The lyrics are why emo has such a bad name. You can't write about arbitary \\"confusion\\" or \\"anger\\" and suddenly be deep. You need a reason, and it can't just be \\"youuuuuuuuuuuuuuuuu\\" (sorry for the pun). Also, the music itself is just ugh-blech.

The only 3 good songs on this CD are Same direction, The Reason, and Unaffected. That's it. Nothing more. I know what you're thinking, no don't listen to it. Instead if you have to have some of the songs download them for 99 cents each. The music in most of these songs is just goddamn awful (sorry for the politically incorrect word). The guitar riffs and the melodies are just crappy.I admit that Hoobastank is a talented band, but with this showing they took a step back. I hope they rebound quickly and fairly well.That's my two cents."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love Hoobastank~ But only like the album","review":"I loved the first album, I listened to the entire CD for months non stop.

The only song that really caught me was \\"Escape\\" other than \\"out of control\\".Overall the album isn't bad~ It's still really good, but not as good as the last album.

I did it in a couple days because my arms did get a little tired after a few hours. It turned out rocks very easily. I did buy the weed reducers but they hadn't arrived the first time I used it and I had to stop a few times to unwind the weeds. I had them the second day and they did help a bunch. I love being able to quickly change the tines and cultivate around my plants now that they are set. No more back-breaking hoeing for me!

The electric works surprisingly well. It does tangle with long grass or weeds but the tines come off easier than my gas Mantis.Breaks up soil quite well. When you hit a rock, just let off the trigger and remove the rock. Starting is just pulling the trigger rather than restarting a gas engine. Big plus. Once you get the rocks out, smooth tilling. When I say rock, I'm talking about fist or bigger rocks. They can jam the tiller. When the this happens, circuit breaker blows. Easy reset after removal.This is not a replacement for a big tiller but does fine on small areas.Allows easy cultivation. Great for raised beds. Use a weedeater or lawnmower before the tiller for the grass & weeds.Very glad I got this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quality Tiller (if you have a heavy duty extension cord)","review":"The first day of using my tiller, the electric motor burned out.

Thankfully, a warranty service shop was nearby and after about a week without my little tiller, it was returned to me, at no cost, fully repaired.

The motor overheats far too easily. The shroud is not opened enough to allow air in, nor is there a motor shaft fan to circulate it. Motor casing cooling fins might help. These factors, in part, cause the duty cycle to be about 30', even on a 60 degree day, which then drops to 2' cycles until the motor cools for more than an hour. Incidentally, the \\"support\\" people at Mantis, when queried, did not know what the term \\"duty cycle\\" means. Other than these factors, when the machine \\"wants to work,\\" it does a good job.

The grass is ridiculously matted, and this thing went right through. Roots and rocks don't phase it, so if anything, you have to be careful just so you don't push it too hard. I'm very pleased with the company and with the machine, and am considering the aerator attachment already.

The depth of each plant reviewed is on the whole well done, however, Europe as a land mass let alone a group of exciting people, does not appear to exist for this FDA author. The introductory preface clearly identifies that the author is not in tune with real global herbal medicine. Only 27 plants are reviewed, and the choice is bizzare and incoherent. Don't bother with it - there are far better books available!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Bollywood Bloat","review":"A rags-to-riches cautionary tale straight off the Bollywood assembly-line, \\"London Dreams\\" is a lengthy, superficial account of an orphaned Indian émigré who finds that life as a rising British pop star isn't all it's cracked up to be.This cliché-ridden film pads out its interminable two-and-a-half-hours-plus running time with overheated melodrama, soul-searing angst, bloated musical numbers, and cutesy slapstick routines. And, of course, it's overflowing with that kind of self-congratulatory smugness that seems to be the hallmark of so many of the commercial films coming out of India these days.The movie does take us to many colorful London locales - befitting a wide-eyed tourist from abroad - but one could get pretty much the same effect using Google street view and not have to put up with all the drama."},{"rating":"2","title":"emotive's wide range","review":"\\"Threads\\" was ..... thought provoking, entertaining, sad, hopeless, happy, hopeful, funny, cute, teary, forceful, calming. In short, mostly a delight. I really like the tribute to Pete's dad, \\"Inventer of Love.\\" Though I thought the title a bit presumptuous. What about \\"Revealer of Love\\"Worth every penny, I would say."},{"rating":"2","title":"Songs from the heart","review":"Heartfelt songs that are uplifting and fun to listen to and never fall into the realm of sappy and self pity that so many of today's artist wallow in. Not only is Pete in great voice here, but his back up band stirs the melodic pot of steamy rhythms into a joyous cauldron of musical gumbo."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great price, super quality.

If something has that sort of impact, it's got to be good. It's a little dated but still effective nonetheless. The other movies on the DVD vary in the quality of acting, but if you need a lighthearted tale of another wimpy kid against a bully, The Phone Call will do the trick."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Cipher in the Snow","review":"Although the acting is amateurish, the message is timeless and, perhaps, even more appropriate for the present than when it was produced. The story always brings me to tears.This film should be required viewing for every middle school and high school student!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Celtic flute book","review":"The package came on time and in good condition. I was worried that the music would be too easy since I have been playing flute for a time now, but it was very enjoyable. The only thing I wasn't totally satisfied with was the CD included. I'm sure the musician is wonderful, but I felt her interpretations of some of the songs were a bit off and there was not much emotion in the music; it was pretty dry. Other than that, a wonderful product and I would recommend it to anyone who wants to have a good old time playing some Celtic music."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Passionate Lament","review":"Jessica Walsh's \\"Celtic Music for Flute\\" is a great book to come back to when reading and playing Irish traditional music. The book has over 40 traditional songs all written out plus Walsh's variations, ready to be played. The book also comes with an audio CD of the traditional songs played by Walsh herself.If I had to give a rating for her audio cd, I'd give it an honest 4 out of 5 stars. Why not 5 out of 5? Well, although Walsh is an excellent flutist, I felt like she played most of the irish tunes with too much lament. Even the songs that were not exactly laments sounded depressingly so after continuious listenings. In the end if you're looking for a great music book on traditional irish music, Walsh's book is the one. And if you love laments, then you'll love Walsh's take on it. And even if you're not a lamentable person like me, you'll still enjoy Walsh's music just because she's really good at it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must buy for any flute player interested in Celtic music","review":"This is an excellent collection of Celtic tunes and melodies for flute, fife or whistle. Well thought out including a nice description of each song.The companion CD should provide helpful insights into the music for both the beginner and seasoned player alike.The author also provides a careful review of the flutes she uses with a detailed description of her collection of individual instruments. There is also a good amount of additional resource information included."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very nice","review":"I'm a player of 10 years, and this was my first time playing Irish/Celtic music. The song selections are great and the accompanying CD brings them to life. I found the notation a little bland, but I added my own ornaments here and there and it sounded very nice. There are several songs on the CD that don't have any accompaniment (guitar), and that was a little bit of a bummer.I definitely recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Two of the pieces got cracks after about a year","review":"I wanted to let you know that on the rook and the king they formed cracks on them after I used the set for about a year (played about one time a week with it).

Time to get a new set!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect.","review":"My Mom used this book to help her explain the rules to me and my sister when we were kids. I remember loving the pictures and finding the Chess board a neat addition (on the edges there was a cheat sheet of how the pieces moved). I should note that my Mom was a very decent player herself but thought it would be a good idea to use a fun guide. Good idea, Mom!It also has a basic section on opening play. I used that bit of information in my first tournament and it helped me win two games!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best... thing... ever","review":"I can't believe they still make this set!!! I got this set as a kid and taught myself how to play. The pieces themselves are plain, durable plastic and the board is nothing fancy. HOWEVER--The book included makes learning chess fun and goes through the history of the game and why the pieces move the way they do and the significance behind them. Really engaging stuff-- and VERY easy to follow. If you want to teach a kid how to play chess, or want to learn yourself and you can get past the \\"Kids Book\\" title, I recommend this set 100%. Deserves a sixth star."},{"rating":"1","title":"a big complain","review":"Unfortunately, I didn't receive the game yet.

These folks provided the text and pictures to not only show the fundamentals of game but to bring it alive in the mind much like \\"Knight & Castle play\\" in the back yard.Haven't done a big analysis of all the available materials for chess instruction...BUT this book, some parent time, and a chess computer program FIRMLY entrenched the basics of this game in my 6 year old's brain.TO THE AUTHOR: Would benefit from more \\"example games\\" in the next version but be sure to keep up the adventuresome \\"story line\\". Would also be great if you would package a basic computer program, following the book's tutoring and pictures, with the ability to exercise the student in piece moves and actual play."},{"rating":"2","title":"building the muscle of the mind","review":"The best book available, when my 24 year old was five.

A co-worker actually turned me onto the book after she recognized my old company's name mentioned. I borrowed it and proceeded to catch up with what happened to these folks for the few years after Worldesign shut down.While the few facts I can personally relate to are accurate, they do focus a great deal on emotion and bitterness and seem to take one person's accounts as gospel without balance from others. It does state many of the hidden trials of startups.The writing style is weak. I found the plot disjoint and with too much coverage in some areas, and mostly too little development/depth in others. If I were to have read the book without personal knowledge of the people mentioned, I would have screamed for more character development.I agree with the other reviewer that this is something you borrow from the library. It was a quick read."},{"rating":"1","title":"slander and obfuscation","review":"I worked at F5 Labs during its first 8 months of existence, and much of my experience there is contradicted by this fictional account. In the few cases where I was consulted, much of what I had to say was ignored or miscontrued; I have no doubt that many people interviewed for the sake of this book could say the same thing. Given this, the story seems to have been manufactured with only two things in mind: entertainment value and marketability."},{"rating":"1","title":"Digital Greedbags","review":"This book is not badly written - I wouldn't say it's well written by any means but it's not bad. The thing that really galls one about the book are the characters - and unfortunately they're not fictitious. I hit rock bottom with the cast when I read about one \\"dreamer\\" who when presented with an opportunity to contribute a technological innovation to oceanographic research responded with the gushing realization that he could \\"make millions.\\" Not that he might contribute something to humanity - but he might \\"make millions.\\" It's a little hard to picture people primarily driven by a desire for money as \\"dreamers.\\" Maybe the book should have been subtitled \\"The Digital Greedbags who are Hyping VR to Death.\\"If the point of the book is to lampoon the crass nature of the people in Seattle working on VR, it succeeds admirably.

Who could possibly believe such two dimensional characters rendered in vivid black and white? It's not even credible on the face of it let alone in the fact. In Moody's rush to lionize Furness and the HITL engineers and to enhance drama he leaves anything approaching objectivity completely aside. The immaturity of Furness and his mignons shows through in their \\"sour grapes\\" whining commentary which is full of expletives and extremes. Just another \\"visionary/engineer as victim\\" hack job, complete with poor fact finding and even a few completely fabricated events thrown in for good measure.

The additonal beats make it more of a dance track; it is also the version featured in the music video. The \\"Spark\\" remix is definitely worth listening to. The version of \\"Cruel\\" featured on this single also has additonal beats, and shorter (but better) than the original. The Scarlet Spectrum Feels mix of Raspberry Swirl is somewhat slow.

I sold this one for $50 at a yard sale and used the money to buy another home theater system for only $50 more than this one.

The prayers evidence belief in a Savior Who wants to be known personally. There are several groupings of prayers: morning and evening, Christian living, worship, family life, various occupations, national/international life, sickness, and other categories.Some of these prayers are adaptable for pulpit use. Great for family devotions and getting out of a rut in ones private life. Sadly, the 235 little pages do not provide a volume of daily prayers. It's a shame this isn't a multi-volume set. We can use more like this! Well done."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Prayer Book","review":"I begin my devotions by reading one of these prayers (I then continue on in my own words).

Honestly, I am wondering if it is the light or the batteries. If it's the batteries, then Coast Cutlery needs to check them before shipping. Otherwise, their products are going to get a bad rap that is possibly undeserved (I have a Coast Cutlery V9 that I am very happy with).The construction is pretty nice. The batteries are a little hard to get out at first, but the V16 is solid, the bulb is protected, and the whole thing is really tiny. The light output is just horribly disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very small, very dim","review":"I bought this flashlight hoping for a very small light which was still bright enough to be useful.

Unless a slim metal candle is what you are looking for; keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Light But Overpriced, Scarce and Short-Lived Batteries.","review":"Check battery availability and pricing before you buy this light.This is a really nifty little shirt pocket light. I would give it five stars if the battery situation were not so ridiculous. The only battery seller near me is Radio Shack, and they want more for a pair than I paid for the light. To top it off, they were Chinese, which means even shorter life. A check of the internet found that with shipping, the situation was about the same.Here on Amazon, the only seller wants over seven dollars to ship just one battery.So, if I want to replace the batteries, I might as well buy a new light. There is something inherently wrong with that.I am going back to my old reliable, but slightly larger, Streamlight Stylus. It uses reasonably priced, readily available and long-lasting batteries.Too bad. I really like the light."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best pen light I've seen","review":"Extremely light weight and very bright. It is hard to describe how thin, light and small it is - but it provides enough light to defintely walk in a campground at night. It does not however have the range to spotlight something in a tree.

It is very nice."},{"rating":"1","title":"too small too bright","review":"As a big hairy nurse, I need something thats a little better fit in my paw. Too fine.

As another reviewer commented the opening credits have been changed to a generic instrumental- it had been Willie Nelson's \\"My Heros Have Always been Cowboys\\". if you've seen the original opening you'll know why this is significant.

I already own the bastardized UNIVERSAL release without the original music, so imagine my dissapointment when I opened this and it was EXACTLY the same version. On the good side, I contacted the seller and they responded immediately and told me to send it back for a full refund!

It is a story of fallen champions and their search for a new beginning. Sidney Pollack is an outstanding director. He successfully weaves several themes - the role of the news media in our culture, man vs. machine, corporation vs. individual - with the Redford/ Fonda romance. The acting is subtle and strong , including the many outstanding supporting performances (Nelson, Perrine, Saxxon, Brimley, etc). The photography is breathtaking. This movie is about finding the goodness in yourself and others."},{"rating":"2","title":"A behind the scenes look of fame.","review":"Redford as usual puts in a good performance and with the horse, the movie was enjoyable and good enough to buy.

The music was an essential in the telling of the story and I was quite disappointed when I watched my copy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Universal Blew It !","review":"I agree with a previous reviewer that stated, \\"The latest version has omitted Willie Nelson's \\"My Heroe's Have Always Been Cowboys\\" in favor of some generic faux-Western instrumental. The song was played during the opening credits and when Sonny releases Rising Star into the wild. When I watched the new version (not knowing there was a new version), I was left emotionally flat by the experience.\\"Also, the DVD had some audio to video syncronization problems.

I'm so sick of dvd release companies feeling free to edit out songs and music that it's creators should only have the power to alter. It's like spraying graffiti over someone else's artwork. When songs like \\"My Heroes Have Always Been Cowboys\\" from this movie and \\"Carry On My Wayward Son\\" from Heroes are cut out and dubbed with garbage musak, they ruin the integrity of the composition on a whole.

I always looked forward to Pollack's movies, you knew he did his best in presenting an entertaining and adult-themed movie (a minimum of explosions and special effects). He is sorely missed by movie lovers. This one was very popular when released, and deservedly so.

The teapot is very well made and should last a long time. The infuser can be removed if you are using teabags and probably should be if you don't fill up the teapot every time. If you use the infuser with a teabag you will have to put in enough water to reach the teabag as it lies in the infuser and that might be more than you need if you are just looking for one mug of tea.I would have given this teapot 5 starts but for the thickness of it's walls, they are quite thin and will not keep the tea warm very long so if you like to go back for a second cuppa you will need to get a tea cozy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stainless steel pot NOT ok for stovetop","review":"I bought this teapot thinking you could warm the water in it, stick in the infuser and have tea five minutes later. Only upon opening the package did I find out that because it has a plastic handle it is NOT Ok for stovetop. The manufacturer's response was: well we never said it IS ok for the stovetop so it is not our problem. They agreed to take it back but made me pay shipping both ways.

But \\"The Mill-Town Massacres\\" is first rate! Bad guys threaten to take over a small steel-mill town, and only THE SPIDER can stop them. The action never stops.Interestingly, the cover for this paperback comes from a totally different SPIDER adventure, \\"Dictator's Death-Merchants\\".

You do not have to understand her lyrics to feel her message, sometimes you feel moved by the tone of her voice as she belts them out.Her clever use of modern beats blends in very well with the lyrics that are mainly from African languages.She sometimes mixes them with English and other languages. Her music is really worth listening to and I feel that more African musicians should borrow a leaf from this talented atriste.

MaDonna Grimes and the backup dancers are good dancers and I like the moves, but it is definitely not a workout. I didn't even break a sweat. Her \\"chummy\\" talk with the backup dancers gets annoying too. It's also way too short. Good if you want to just learn some dance steps, but not if you're looking for a cardio workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Urban Street Heat save your money","review":"MaDonna Grimes directions calling out the steps were great, but they need a different camera crew, the camera view while she is instructing you is either all over the place on her and then on the other dancers, or on the upper torso to the head instead of the feet when she is instructing a step, thought the camera angles made it difficult to follow, rarely was the view of the entire person making the routine difficult to follow. I really do not need the zoom in on the chest up to learn a move. I would save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"More for dancers than for exercisers...","review":"I was most disappointed with this as an exercise video.

The music was bad and the dance routine was not repeated enough to get a good cardio workout. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners","review":"MaDonna Grimes can afford to take a course on how to teach beginners.

She explains the moves well and breaks the workout down into sections. I cannot dance and I dont think I'd do any of these moves in public but its fun and the time flies! It has an extra bonus 10 min. workout at the end that I always do. I have another video with some other lady and its boring and I dont break a sweat. Not to mention shes annoying.... Not only am I sweating after Madonna Grimes video...Im red in the face! I am really happy with this video and have bought four more of hers. The only reason I could see someone being unhappy with this video is if they expected to learn to dance...The moves arent exactly current or good looking when put together but thats not the point of the video...Just the fact that youre dancing instead of doing boring reps of sqwats makes it fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for beginners as stated on cover.","review":"I am a beginner, I though it was too many moves to learn, not enough repetitions. And to add to the dificulty of coordinate all the steps (and arms) together it was frustrating that the camera angles kept moving around zooming in and out! I guess was just not a good teaching method because I have been doing many dancing workout videos and I was able to follow the other teachers without a problem. If you are a begginer don't buy. If you are expert you probably won't have this problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too advanced for me","review":"I recently purchased multiple beginner fitness dvds to diversify my home workout options. I don't normally feel like going to the gym, so I thought these would be a solid home remedy. Of the three I purchased, this is the only one that I didn't opt to keep on my shelf.

I reviewed the later parts of the tape, and I decided that my other dvds would cover my needs well enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not very urban...","review":"This is a generally inoffensive DVD. The music is rather bland for \\"urban\\" dancing (I was expecting something rap/hiphop-ish). The background dancers wouldn't make the most rural midwestern farmer glance twice at them. Everything was just kind of... nice. Bland. Okay.As others have said, this really isn't for beginners. The instructor moves fast and introduces many many moves and steps. I was totally lost and ended up just randomly jumping/stepping around to keep my heartrate up while peering at the screen, trying to figure out what I was supposed to be doing.If I could, I'd give it another half-star. It's not a horrible exercise DVD, but there are tons better."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT for beginners","review":"I chose this dvd because it stated it was for beginners.

I wanted to give it an honest try at repetitive learning. Considering that this was labeled as a beginner session, my expectation was that the demos would be a little slower and provide more repetition. It could just be me, but it does seem as the video gets closer toward the end, the quicker the pace begins to move, with more complicated movements. Each time, I would stop to study the moves, because I got completely lost. Let me also say that I've always had good rhythm, timing and dance ability, and been involved in various physical activities. At one point, it just looks like they are really enjoying the recording of the video, and forget that they are there to teach the viewers??Bottom line, I would not suggest this video for beginners of dance videos."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls short","review":"This book moved along at a fairly good pace, but it went nowhere.

Warren Haynes & Dickey Betts add fire to updated versions of Revival, Dreams, Southbound & an acoustic Melissa - all decidedly different than the originals. They play some great newer ABB with End of the Line and Get on With Your Life, the latter which shows they can still play great soulful blues behind the gruff voice of Gregg Allman. The only brand new song on the disc is a revised version of Blind Willie McTell's Midnight Blues, which is given the rare Bett's acoustic slide treatment. The one tune that isn't a true gem on the album is the new version of Blue Sky. Although enjoyable, it is a little too \\"musclebound\\" than the counry & western original. The ABB is the only band of the many classic rock reunions of the last 15 years who may have come back stronger than before.

I must have played the CD 8 or 10 times in a row and began singing along as I drove back and forth to work. \\"Hearts of Stone\\" is still my favorite cut, but I also get a kick out of the follow up song, \\"Hearts Can be Broken\\", among others.

The second mind numbing. I must confess to having a love for ladlit, and have just finished Mike Gayle's dinner for two, which was not a great book, but by comparison was a classic. I am one of those people that can read ANY book, if a book appears slow or poor I will still plod along just to prove that the publisher had some reason for publishing the book.

I felt over-whelmed, did he want to introduce us to the character, his family? His friends?? Then mix past with present??

In fact, it is just a very ordinary sort of western, if you make allowances for the fact that it takes place in the Yukon, and the \\"ordinary\\" western is in American territories. The difference is not a significant one.Stewart is the only real star in it, although you will recognize Walter Brennan and Henry Morgan, who has a minor role. Brennan is Stewart's partner in a herd of cattle first, and then in a mining claim, and Stewart is supposedly one of these hard-bitten types who doesn't care about anyone. But he cares about his partner, and two women care about him. And of course, he learns to care about others.Too much is cliche, too predictable, and frankly, I was disappointed.

Corinne Calvet, 30 years old, is supposed to be a sex-starved teen and is given many embarrassing lines. Walter Brennan plays Walter Brennan. The villains sneer and scowl.

In all the tragedy that takes place, the bitter Jeff Webster (James Stewart) is concerned about no one but himself. The turning point comes about when his sidekick Ben Tatum (Walter Brennan) is killed by the judge's henchmen. Is it then that Webster's attitude takes a polar change: he vows to avenge the people responsible for Tatum's life being ended. Again, the snow and mountains of northwest Canada are a \\"drawing card\\" for this movie, and it makes a person believe that it is worth the time and effort to take a trip to this far country.

Imagine my horror as I can see water start to go up the unit and can see it still heating up. I quickly unplugged it and will be returning it to the store tonight. I don't expect a cheap heater to last a long time but I do expect it to last a night at least. I'm surprised by this though because Hagen usually makes some decent products. Avoid this heater and spend just a few dollars more for a better one."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 heater broken in shipment","review":"I received 2 heater's 1 broken, and 1 not broken. this is expected.

These recordings are taken from the Stax/Volt vaults and almost all of them are previously unreleased. Some of these songs have been released before, but these are alternate takes. Considering that these recording weren't considered \\"good enough\\" to be released when they were first recorded, the quality of the music is very good. There aren't any bad songs here, and some of them are actually great. I especially like Booker T & the MGs version of \\"Dock of the Bay\\". The two Otis Redding alternate takes are dynamite. And Eddie Floyd turns in an electrifying live version of his classic \\"Knock on Wood\\". Recommended to fans of '60s soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cellarful of Stax","review":"This album is probably the template for the Cellarful of Motown series which is alternate takes and unreleased songs from the golden era of Motown. Stax did the same thing but they were never released in America and as imports they have a higher price tag. This album is full of gems but the highlight is Knock On Wood by Eddie Floyd performed live in England and a haunting alternate version of Otis Redding's I've Got Dreams To Remember. William Bell is featured nicely with the song She Won't Be Like You. Little Willie John's sister Mable is here to with Sweet Devil which is a real treat as she did not do too many records. Walking The Dog by Rufus Thomas could have been left off though because the alternate version is not really that different from the original.Overall, a very good album that has whet my appetite for more albums in this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go to the Original TV Series","review":"Original version is far better that this \\"pilot\\" version.

This 1995 miniseries stars Scott Bakula in a similar role. Thinnes appears briefly as Vincent. Richard Thomas, who seems not to have aged a day since \\"The Waltons,\\" is one of the humans taken over by the malevolent aliens.A routine exercise in science fiction politics, the film benefits from a knock-out performance from Jon Polito, late of \\"Homicide: Life on the Streets,\\" as a harried subway operator.

It's a decent rock album with its best songs in the first half of the album. The opening \\"Stand\\" is alright, and so are \\"Bad religion\\" and \\"Jack the ripper\\". But the highlight is the semi ballad \\"Ain't no nice guy\\" - a duet with Ozzy Osbourne, and the heavy \\"Hellraiser\\". The cover of Ted Nugent's \\"Cat scratch fever\\" is not surprising in any way, and the same goes for most of the songs on this release. In fact, the five last songs seem to be more or less fillers.

Reagan gives an almost John Wayne-esque performance (you could almost call him John Wayne Light in this one). Reagan is tough, but very likeable in the role and shows the charisma that would help him in his political life just a decade later.The story itself is something of a re-working of the Earps VS the Clantons, and it even starts in Tombstone. Reagan is Frame Johnson, tough, no-nonsense Marshall of Tombstone. He decides to retire to a nearby town to start a ranch and marry his girl, but he finds the town run by another rancher and soon Frame and his brothers are in conflict with that rancher and his family. There is plenty of good western action, and a solid story in Law and Order.Law and Order is well worth buying for Western fans or fans of Ronald Reagan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pale Remake","review":"One of Ronald Reagan's few starring Westerns was this color remake of Universal's \\"Law and Order\\" (1932) - the first O.K.

His friends, co-workers, and family all think he is having a nervous breakdown as the rat drives him to drink and to act in ways he has never acted before. The final showdown with the rat was a bit more over-the-top in the movie, but was handled well in the book.A pretty creepy and well done book that was turned into a movie that scared the pants off of me when I was in 7th grade. I would like to see more from this author, who seems to have only published one or two more books in a career that spans over 20 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Quality and Cheap","review":"Amazingly cheap compared to what you can get in any store, and the quality is just as good.

The author begins with a discussion of the similarities between Christianity, Judaism, and Islam. Yes, all three religions speak of the One who is God, they share many characters and stories from the Bible (albeit often in variant form in Muhammad's later versions), and the 99 names of God that Muslims recite can aptly be applied to the God of the Bible. At that point I felt somewhat uncomfortable, wondering how far Dr. George would go in seeking conciliation or accommodation with Islam. However, when he speaks to the question of the title, the author is clear. How does he answer the question? By describing who Jesus is and what his relationship to the Father is. At times his writing was too \\"theologic\\" for me, and I was not moved by his quotes from church fathers, but overall the book was readable, convincing, and satisfying.Olivia Rodan Jacobs, author ofThe Poisoner's Agenda"},{"rating":"1","title":"The other side of heaven in spanish","review":"The quality of the dubbing of this video was very poor.

This movie gives one a new respect for missionaries regardless of faith. The special features are great too! This is a movie that the whole family can watch over and over. The only thing that disappoints me is the other reviews themsleves; particularly the one from \\"Chris in California\\" who uses his review as a thoughtles attack on Mormons everywhere.

They told me that the movie made elder Groberg seem like he was the greatest thing that happened to the island since metal. In fact he was like the typical mormon missionary who pushes their religion on to people regardless of what they say. When u lie to people that they are the decedents of a blessed lost tribe of Israel of course they are going to join your religion. My friends grandmother told me that the Mormon missionaries would basically buy them. When you give people the chance to come to the U.S if they get baptized of course they will do it.

It is unrealistic, inaccurate, cheesy and an overall poorly done movie. It was made to serve as a fantastic feel-good movie for Mormons, who happen to have a heavy presence in Tonga. The main Mormon school in Tonga also feels the need to post \\"English Only Please\\" signs around the perimeter of their facility which I find to be completely unacceptable. I have no problem with people spreading the word of their religion as they deem necessary, but to occupy another country only to insist that the locals turn their backs on their language and customs is pretty unbelievable.Anyways, this movie paints Tongans as being uneducated savages who are unwelcoming of outsiders.

Not only does it improperly portray Polynesians as waiting for a Christian God to save them, but it completely neglects the fact that Polynesians had a functioning culture before Christianity came to the islands.

If you do watch this movie be prepared for a very one sided view."},{"rating":"2","title":"It was a breath of CLEAN fresh air!","review":"I thought this movie was done in perfect taste, and very true to the book, which I have read. It started out a little slow, and maybe even a little cheesy at first, but it was refreshing to know it was a true story....and that real life isn't always non-stop fun and excitement, like we expect all movies to be now.

The lead character is sickly sweet to the point of not seeming human, and what's up with his miracle cures? I agree the overall view towards the native people was insulting, they were treated like children and really the whole mission of the church was to eradicate the native way of life -- which by the way it now exploits at the Polynesian Cultural Center on Oahu!

I, on the other hand, found this religious melodrama to be something you would find on the Christian channel. The story about a Mormon missionary working in Tonga was not believable. Not because of the idea, but because when he is there, it seems as if he becomes the King of the island, whcich I seriuosly doubt would happen, considering he is such a nerd. I found the whole story, although a true one, too cheesy and just lame. The scene where he denies having sex with the fine island girl is just too much to believe."},{"rating":"1","title":"More Morman Deception!","review":"This film is a Mormon film that hides the fact that it is Mormon until well into the movie. Nowhere in it is Morman theology espoused at all. There is no mention of Joseph Smith or the Book of Mormon. There is nothing on the cover that says it's Mormon. It deceptivly portrays Mormonism as an Evangelical Christian denomination. Why do all the cults have to try and deceive people? Why not just be up front about who they are and what they believe. Stay away from this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Movie","review":"I thought this movie was the dumbest thing ever made! No wonder it never hit the theaters. All they did was treat sick people on a little island. Someone was either hurt or dying in this movie. And I thought that Anne Hatheway was supposed to be in it more than 10 minutes. And when she was in it all she wore were white outfits. Also I thought this movie was rated PG. I don't have anything against PG or PG-13 movies but they were showing blood gushing out of these guys feet and I thought it was pretty sick. So whoever you are DO NOT get this movie. It's the worst ever. And thank you to whoever is reading this and take my advice."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Nice Story","review":"If you are interested in missionary work this is the movie for you. It provides great insight into the missionary field. I believe the film does a fairly good job not to affiliate with any one religion (only one strong reference to the Mormon Faith).

The acting is superb, a wonderful adventure plot based on a true story and is a real uplifting experience. The people are natural, sincere and made me reflect on how our complex lifestyle in many ways lacks the quality characteristics which hold the very fibres of family unity together. It made me laugh, it made me cry and above all made me think about what really lacks in many of our lives. The true spirit of giving of oneself in a totally unselfish manner and with almost blind faith is truly an admirable and courageous act. Highly recommended even if you don't think you'll like it. If humanity and love of mankind is up your alley then this movie's for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely great movie","review":"This story is about a mormon missionary who goes to Tonga to serve the people there.

It is a great family oriented film."},{"rating":"2","title":"I've seen this twice and liked it both times.","review":"This movie had me riveted and it stuck with me. The acting was very good, it had humor, memorable imagery, touching moments (got teared up a bit, I admit) and a great spirtual message. It's based on the true story of John Grohberg's mission to Tonga, but doesn't appeal only to Mormons, with its Mormon protagonist. The message is universal and there is no uniquely Mormon doctrine to make people of other faiths uncomfortable. It's not recommended for very young kids as some scenes are quite inappropriate for them. I recommend this to anyone who is tired of Hollywood filth and is spiritual."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE OTHER SIDE OF HEAVEN","review":"I love this movie. It is so good to see a movie about a different culture and how one missionary was determined to keep doing what he believes is right. Wonderful filming and casting.

It's not nearly as good as seeing him live. It seems like he isn't putting as much emotion into it as he does when he's live. The sound is more clear and he singing is better than at a live show, but the engery isn't translated very well. On the plus side there are subtitles so you could sing along if that is your thing. The best part of the DVD for me was all the crowd shots. All those tacky 80's clothes and the priceless reactions of the ladies in the crowd made the price well worth it. So if you get the chance to see Neil in person do it. If not then get this DVD, it will do just fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"must have\\" video for real Neil Diamond fans","review":"Not his very best video, but close to the top.

Conclusion: Look for a DVD that takes advantage of technology"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bit of A Disappointment","review":"Unfortunately there is not a lot of Neil Diamond available on video. Greatest Hits Live is rather hit and miss. Filmed before a small audience at the Aquarius Theatre in Los Angeles in 1988 it appears that Diamond was just going through the motions.The performance, while it does include some of his best work, seems oddly disconnected and lifeless. The mix is adequate but nothing special. There are times when the camera cuts to a member of the band and you can't really hear the instrument he is playing.I have seen Mr. Diamond twice before and I know that there are better performances out there. The song selection could have been boosted to add some more of the classics.All in all you need to take what you can get but this DVD is disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Muddled and depressing","review":"In this book, the heroine is not the title character, but cursive writing itself.

It's a great book about contrariness and defiance. Maggie has nothing against cursive, only she doesn't want to do what she's told... and I don't know many book characters who feel that way. Another thing I like about this book is its ending: Maggie learns to write cursive, but she still thinks that when she grows up, she'll print all the time. In many books the bad characters reform, which is disappointing. However, Muggie Maggie doesn't need to be banned from libraries, since the parts that tell about rebellion are mostly the ones describing Maggie's feelings."},{"rating":"1","title":"I HAVE NO WORDS TO EXPRESS HOW MUCH I LIKE THE SONGS IN IT.","review":"SUPERB CLASSIC LOVE SONGS PERFECT TO LISTEN ON A DAY LIKE THE VALENTINES DAY SPECIALY WITH THE ONE YOU LOVE MOST IN THE WORLD.WELL I BADLY WANT TO OWN THIS FANTASTIC LOVE SONGS CD TO LISTEN TO.YOU CAN RELAX AS WELL AS HAVE A NICE TIME LISTENING TO THIS ONE.SO I GIVE IT 1000 STARS IF I CAN."},{"rating":"2","title":"Completely functional, although should have a wider base.","review":"I was in a bind.

Plot sucked, story sucked. I do not recommened this to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rich, bored, and dumb","review":"The Basement is a stupid story about a bunch of idle rich idiots from Connecticut. Myra, the mostly main focus, is a pathetic excuse of a person who's conflictingly described as drop-dead gorgeous and fat/pink at the same time. There's a ghost in her rich basement which she sics on her not so rich enemies. Bloodshed and hilarity ensue as the story is so unbelievable it's laugh out loud funny in places.Poorly written, full of indistinguishable (and numerous) characters, this book is groan inducing, dull, and silly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very interesting story, but the ending didn't make it","review":"This novel had a very good plot and the character's and the events were very realistic. But at the end it seems as though the author gave up and just ended any kind of way. The story hyped you up to the max. Goody Redman, the event with the Pastori's and the bees, the assult, eveything. But when you got to the end it seems as though the author said, \\"SIKE!\\" and just left you hanging.

The feet and legs of the dancers are shown fleetingly if at all, the combinations are hard to follow and narrated only one time through (extremely frustrating given that most of the time the viewer is watching the necks and faces of the dancers), if you do not have a background in ballet you will not understand the terminology used nor will you be able to do these exercises in such a way as to get a meaningful workout. I took adult ballet, at professional schools and with excellent teachers, and found this tape aggravating to say the least. The New York City Ballet Workout is a much better tape (even though it can become a little monotonous with repetition) for an \\"at home\\" workout. Don't waste your money on this one unless you want to spend 45 minutes looking at the hairdos of dancers."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst ballet video!","review":"This ballet video was terrible! I have worked out with Melissa Lowe's original ballet video for years and I was very disappointed with this new video. I have danced for over 20 years, ballet, jazz, modern, ballroom etc. and I could not follow this video. I am so glad I checked it out at the library first. The instruction is terrible in this video, the camera angle is constantly changing and many images are overlapped so you can't tell what you are supposed to be doing. The majority of the time the camera is on the upper half of the dancers so you have no idea wat your legs are supposed to be doing. The verbal instruction is minimal and not specific enough to follow. I feel that even experienced dancers would have difficulty with this video. The New York City Ballet workout and Ballet Boot Camp are much better choices."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Explantions, Poorly Shot Film","review":"Experience is a MUST!!! Also the problem is if you do not want this video to go to waste due to lack of ballet training, it is impossible to follow along due to the poor quality of filming. The camera angles have you looking at the back of a head or bad eyeliner for minutes at a time making it difficult to copy the poses. Save your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Keep looking","review":"I have been a professional dancer for over 18 years, and found this DVD to be impossible to follow (as others have noted).There is very poor cueing. I have a studio set up in my house with a stationary barre. I attempted to follow the instructions, but was continually frustrated upon having to turn around away from my monitor - only to have no vocal cueing. This usually isn't a problem, but the combinations are not particularly easy to follow. One would have to sit and memorize the combinations before actually attempting the DVD.It is impossible to follow proper form (and work up a decent sweat) when one is contantly looking over your shoulder to follow the DVD.Don't waste your money on this DVD. Sign up for a class in your area with a qualified teacher. The money spent will be well-worth the frustration saved.For a DVD touted for restoring wellness, renewal and vitality, it simply served to raise my frustration."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its Okay","review":"I didn't like this video as much as the first.

I also used the MasterPlate. I have to say that although this tool performs as advertised, the cheap plastic base is pretty lame. I already had a dial indicator with a magnetic base, but I thought the MasterGage would be simpler to use. I was wrong. Assembling the tool is not difficult but involves fooling around with small parts twice: once when taking the tool out and again when putting it back. They at least should have a box that let's you store it assembled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Junk!!!","review":"The sliding bar is cheap plastic and stripped out the first time I attached the dial indicator."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better than the Magnetic type, very accurate","review":"I've used the magnetic type for awhile and awkward to setup and use, but with the superbar the dial indicator becomes more accurate and easier to setup. You can use it in either miter slot. First to check the blade to slot parallelism, then to check the slot to the fence parallelism (if a+b=c then c+b=a). A very nice tool to have when your making anykind of quality pieces. Once your indicated to within .003\\" you reduce or eliminate the burn marks, the saw will run better and you'll get much more satisfaction out accuracy of your work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost works","review":"The concept is good, but the execution leaves a lot to be desired. It took a lot of fiddling around to get almost consistent results. There is way too much flex in the plastic body that fits into the miter slot. Trying to get the dial Zeroed was a pain in the rear. With so much body flex I wasn't confident the measurements were accurate. Maybe others have had better luck, but for me, it's outta here on its way back for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for 3/4 inch miter slots","review":"I have a Ryobi Table saw with a smaller miter slot and it won't fit it.

The cup holders are non-adjustable and too small to keep tall bottles securely. The cup holders do protrude into the dashboard area as previously mentioned, making getting things in and out of that part a bit tight, but not impossible.

The last NCAA football game I had was '05 and the '08 version failed by not having the create a school option. How could EA Sports take away create a school??? Otherwise the minigames are fun- option dash (2 minutes to go about 80 yards and score as many times as you can by only using option plays, bowling- play from 10 yard line and you get two shots per sequence and 10 frames, and tug-of-war allows two teams to go back and forth one play at a time to see who scores first)If this game had create a school, it would be five stars!

I found playing on the defensive line was nearly impossible. I could never get any pressure on the QB. The graphics are out of this world and the game is very nice to look at overall.

If you played last year's title, the offline lag is worse this year...Other than that - it's a great game and EA is almost there in terms of a great game. The graphics are wonderful, the gametypes are extremely fun (\\"You decide to veg out on the couch and watch movies with friends...Popularity +1\\"), and the achievements are a little more challenging this year (getting six interceptions with one player in one game....grrr).Overall, it's a fun game to rent and play for a weekend when you have nothing to do, but I wouldn't buy it...next year's should be the one to put the series over the top."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Disappointment","review":"What a huge disappointment!

I'm playing Campus Legend with a QB, and I get sacked an average of five or six times a game. The line is utter crap on pass blocking. Those would be my main complaints.

I completely stopped playing it after the 07 version on xbox 360. The controls were confusing and everything i liked about audibling, shifting lineman, shifting wide receivers changed to a completely different button.

There is no create a team, no 1AA teams, no intros, no custom playbook, no crowd, they gutted the thing. Basically the game is dynasty and thats it which bloooows. Back to the playbook, the set up is terrible by the time you find the play you want....you have a delay of game.

Normal chess is like \\"how can I manuever around this person while avoiding their attacks\\" while this is like \\"I'm in the center of chaos\\". If you aren't watching everything, every second, you're done for. One person I was playing with had another person's queen surrounded with 2 of his own knights and a knight he had captured, and player 2 went to move his queen towards a king, paying acute attention to whether he would put himself in a spot where any of those three knights could kill him. He took his fingers off his queen finally, after determining he was safe, and I killed him with a pawn. This game is intense, I love it."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun variation","review":"Good fun for serious and not so serious players. Have 2 of each in our family. Have enjoyed being able to have all of us play at once. In addition to variations of play offered by game's instructions, we have enjoyed playing variations with 3 players--such as a 2 against 1 mode(2 weak players team-up against the 1 strong-with only 3 sets of pieces in play)-evens things out a bit! Have also played another variation with 3 players (2 strong players and 1 weak player) where the weak player gets two sets of pieces to control. Also is fun for 2 players to play two sets of pieces at once. In a 2 person game, even the weakest player can give the strongest a run for their money if allowed play two sets of pieces to their opponents one set. If you like chess at all, you will find the new twists on play enjoyable and intriguing."},{"rating":"2","title":"chess4 is so fun!","review":"Chess 4 is so ausome!

I finally got around to ordering more to fill the tank and ordered a couple more bags of blue. The blue that came this week is a bright aqua blue, no where near the dark blue that I first received and no where near the color on the product image. Outside of that, the gravel that I put in the tank in September still looks great and I would buy this again, but am bummed that different colors of blue were received without knowing that there would be that much of a variation (added a product image to show the difference in blues)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Vibrant","review":"The color is much paler than I thought it would be, but the stones are smooth and seem good for my new Betta fish.

The ratcheting mechanism is reversed from what is found on all other band clamps, which makes for very awkward clamping/releasing.

This meant the ratchet can't be fully closed without tightening the strap more-The part that is supposed to engage the ratchet teeth and retract to undo the strap continually sticks making it impossible to actually use the ratchet mechanism.

It is very hard to identify Damaris' finer qualities and start to care about her, so one wonders why Fitz would care. Also, although certainly anyone who reads romance novels cannot be a prude, it does seem a little strange--dare I say forward?--the way Damaris throws herself at Fitz and starts kissing him hotly every time they are alone. Ashart and Genova also seem to take over the book quite a bit. And yet one more quibble--Damaris' family situation turns out to be so bizarre that it just beggars belief (although the Trayce family mystery is quite fun). All in all, not one of Beverly's best."},{"rating":"2","title":"very enjoyable","review":"I didn't expect to like this book. It looked like a same old regency story but I was happily mistaken.

She is thwarted but is still a brat/ Ash's right hand man, Fitzrogers takes her in hand as he surrepticiously tries to prevent Ash's assassination.

The graphics on the 5 new FedEx courses are awesome. Unfortunately the old courses from last year look the same. The Tiger challenge is much better then last year.

Gameplay graphics are pretty fun.Cons:Can't make a new team, can't customize playbook, can't do formation subs, can't stop someone from going in motion, menus are slow and painful, setting depth chart is painful because the sorting by default is quite poor and never remembers what you do, kicking can be a real pain with the R3 options, play calling is overly complex and not intuitive (defaulting you to special teams formation on a 1st and 10 ?!?!) there are other things, but I'm tired of typing now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Larger system, fewer options?","review":"The simple fact that they have removed options such as \\"Create a Team\\", as well as taking away the ability to play the game in demo mode, has me regretting buying this at all. Other reviewers are correct in saying that EA are churning out the same product over and over, but they are also removing options from a game designed for a system with the ability to handle so many more options than before.It seems as if it will be another 5-10 years before EA Sports has any idea of what the PS3 can do.

Amazon only stands behind products for 30 days so you are left to calling Cuisinart for remedy. Their idea of customer service for refurbished products is to prove the product is in warrenty by faxing (your cost) the receipt then pay to ship the defective product to and from Cuisinart. When they receive the defective product, they will ship a replacement. Oh yah, the 90 day (not 3 year for new products) warranty does not start over, the warranty continues from the time of purchase. I hope the replacement product works more that 30 days or I am out of luck. DON'T PURCHASE A REFURBISHED PRODUCT FROM AMAZON.

The CD would benefit from samples of the songs discussed and more actual commentary from the band - the lack of these probably due to legal constraints. Overall, the CD is good for what it is - a chronogical description of a band's rise to fame.

The motor seems fine for reaming citrus; the directions say not to juice continuously for too long. Sometimes it's tricky to get the \\"reverse direction\\" feature to kick in. The directions say \\"hand wash only,\\" but life is too short: I put the pitcher, strainer, and rasp all in the dishwasher--so far to no ill effect.

There are no other settings, and although I considered a self-installation of some kind of a sieve material, I decided I'd rather just return the thing and buy a different one.If you are someone who buys pulp-free or low-pulp orange juice at the grocery store, this juicer is not going to give you juice the way you like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Replacing after 3 days","review":"The motor is weak and the reversing mechanism does not work very well.

I tried not putting much pressure on the fruit half but nothing seemed to matter. The motor would work the next day cooled down? but when saddling up again would do the same thing.

It ain't pretty or shiny, doesn't have attachments or extras, but juices oranges and grapefruits very nicely - and quickly. Washes up nicely too. The only thing I don't like about it is that it strains ALL the pulp away from the juice, and I prefer my juice WITH pulp, thanks! But that's a small thing and easily fixed after I'm done juicing. And the carafe is nice, if a bit small - this won't work well for a large family or group of people - not only isn't it large in size, it requires a bit of hand strangth to work, and if you plan on squeezing more than a half-dozen oranges daily then this is NOT for you.

The bad things about this one is that 1- you can see the level of juice only on one side of the container2- it does not change spinning direction easily, you often need to push and release the fruit many times to get the extractor to spin the other way.3- obviously its much louder than a manual citrus press."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great juicer for the price","review":"My daughter has one of these juicers and let me use it.

I guess it just felt a little like a sledgehammer to the head. The two main characters just don't ring true. Jack, a beaten-down handicapped man in his thirties, has all the wisdom you could ever hope for. But where did he learn all this observational insight? He has lived his entire life in isolation. His friend, Holly, grows mature by the minute just by being around him.Both characters narrate the story which, at first, seemed inventive. But, eventually, it grew wearying to see their narration of the same events create giant leaps in the development time and time again.I was shocked to see 9 reviews each scored with 5 stars when I looked this book up here. Apparently, I am the one dissenting opinion. So, I have to admit I may have missed something that appealed to others. I felt the same way about The Lovely Bones by Alice Sebold. So many people loved it, but I just didn't understand the appeal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware DVI cable formats","review":"This DVI cable is a DVI-I cable.

This cd was recorded in front of a small live audience in a barn but the recording quality is very good. On this double CD, Lake plays some traditional bluegrass standards, some unusual renditions of traditional bluegrass standards and some original pieces. Lake primarily plays 3 finger style banjo but also shows that he can play very clean and beautiful clawhammer as well. The musicians he performs with are superb. You don't have to be a banjo nut like me to enjoy this one...but it definately helps. The only weak point is that his music sometimes goes off into some weird jazz sounding threads, but for the most part, he manages to expand the banjo's envelope while still respecting bluegrass traditions."},{"rating":"1","title":"Billy Sucks","review":"Billy, Phil, and all of this horrid crap should be thrown in a fire!!

Jonathan Lebed is 14-year-old boy who is accused of Stock Market fraud. Lewis shows Jonathan in a family setting just to depict the stress the stock market could cause on a small town family. One of the main point that Lewis is showing in presented when he writes, \\"the point is even a fourteen-year-old boy could see how it worked-why some guy working for free out of a basement in Jackson, Missouri was more reliable than the most highly paid analyst on Wall street\\"(pg.57). The problem was not that Jonathan did what he did but that fact that he was so young an inexperienced.By reading this book it further my knowledge on how misleading the Stock Market could be when I agree to invest my income I will be more cautious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Marginal","review":"In the Internet world of Michael Lewis most adults are stupid, incompetent and narrow-minded while children are quick to adapt, quick witted and just want to be left alone by the suppressive establishment. Although there are salient points relative to the potential changes in personal and business relationships brought on by the communication capabilities of the Internet, I found the attempts to stereotype the people in the book in order to make a point diminished the very points he is attempting to make. A more objective rendering would have been more informative."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Michael Lewis have a point?","review":"I admittedly don't know much about Lewis' pre-Next work, but my intro to his writing wasn't spectacular. His promising subject (social implications of the Internet) died in three fairly boring narratives that you could've read about in the news, and the conclusion failed to bring those narratives together into any kind of meaningful message.But that conclusion by itself is worth a read, if for no other reason than to get you thinking about what Lewis was actually trying to say with the rest of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shallow, uninspiring, uninteresting","review":"As a lecturer of e-commerce, I was looking forward to reading this book on the social implications of the Internet. However, I am most disappointed with the boring and superficial way the subject is explored. The author takes a couple of anecdotical examples to show the concequences in the shift of power that the Internet has brought about. The result is a disjointed treatment of an otherwise most interesting topic. I have nothing good to say about this book - money wasted."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Bubble May Have Burst","review":"But while the financial part of the Internet may have disappointed, the social effects weren't overrated. This book is a great read no matter what situation you're in. You will learn a lot while being entertained at the same time. Who knows, maybe you will even be motivated after reading this book like I was!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A patchwork of recycled magazine pieces","review":"Michael Lewis fans are likely to be disappointed by his latest book. The BBC apparently backed the project, and it shows. The final result has much of the flavor of a BBC documentary: some picturesque scenery and an arresting moment or two, all patched together with a steady flow of banal commentary, in this case about insiders and outsiders and the notion of self-invention.The best moments come when Lewis skewers the doubletalk of Wall Street in an interview with the SEC's Arthur Levitt; however, this level of insight is missing from the profiles of young Internet players that make up most of the book. Moreover, much of this material will already be familiar to readers of the New York Times--over the past year or so, Lewis's stories on Tivo, Jonathan Lebed, and most recently legal \\"expert\\" Marcus Arnold have appeared in the Sunday magazine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I haven't seen his previous work, but based on this book I won't even bother. A group of 1/2 dozen examples of how the internet is impacting the lives of everyday business...itself a good idea that needs exploring. However, it's been done so many times in so many other places...there's nothing special about this. I read it and came away thinking that I should quit my day job. Stories like this, and the ramifications on society, are common lunch-room talk in most corporations today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Economic Psychology","review":"Though I started to read this book for a class, I was reading it for myself after the first few chapters. The first pleasant thing about it was the fact that Michael Lewis is a writer, not simply an economist with good ideas. He knows how to get his thoughts out in a clear and interesting manner. It wasn't exactly poetic, but it certainly kept my attention. I also liked that the book, while it wasn't totally non-opinionated, allows the reader think for him/herself. He presents the problem or conflict and usually states an opinion, but he does it in a very non-obtrusive way. While reading it, I felt that I was using his data to come up with my own hypothesis. The book is also at times poignantly funny, again usually in a subtle manner. And then of course the content was extremely interesting. Even if he were a less talented writer, the engaging topics would hold the book together.I thought that this book was a lovely analysis of life with technology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Next: The Future Just Happened","review":"Thought provoking. It was fascinating to read his sequence of thinking -- connecting the micro/macro events of today to the broader stroke of our unfolding history. It is very difficult to devine the historical significance of today's events without the benefit of time. Lewis raises some extremely interesting perspectives about the impact of our irretrievable march towards technology. While I am far from a Luddite (I make my living selling internet software), it did make me pause to consider the long term ramifications of our drive for \\"progress\\". Well written, but I detected a little more arogance in Lewis's writing than his previous -- more quick to indict and a scathing portrayal of the parents of the New Jersey teen-age stock trader.All in all a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fast Fun Read","review":"Not a profound book. Lots of story-telling to make a few good points. A fast and fun read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quit while your ahead","review":"The book Next would of been an enjoyable read if the book was a hundred page shorter. This was the first time I had read any of Michael Lewis books, and with all the good reviews on it, I was highly disappointed by the end of the book. When I started the book, I was impress how he manage to interact with the teenagers he interviewed so well. He wrote about the teenagers smoothly and you really began to understand the position that their in. 200 pages later, he was still rambling on, writing lame jokes, and even poorer examples. I recommend that you get this from your local library, and not buy it. Read the fisrt hundred pages then return it for a better book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perspective","review":"It is difficult to appreciate the full implications of a transitional time while one is in the midst of it. Michael Lewis does a good job of exploring the implications of how the internet has changed us and how societal power has shifted dramatically because of it. He does an excellent job of looking at specific examples and then backing up for a wide-lense take on the bigger picture.People who are looking for a better understanding of the rapidly changing technological life we are living and what it means for the future will benefit from reading this.To me one of his most important points has to do with how the contemporary world favors young people who are best suited to adapt to the technological changes and thrive in the resulting dynamic environment. Those of us who are middle aged will, upon reading this book, find ourselves with some serious thinking to do in terms of how we craft meaningful work lives."},{"rating":"2","title":"Commentary","review":"I've gotten quite a bit of e-mails about my commentary on this board, most of them being excellent.

The first 25% of the book is devoted to the well-publicized case of Jonathan Lebed and the kid's violations of SEC rules. Only once does Lewis use the word \\"Values\\", but by that time, I had already figured out why I didn't like these people: with the exception of the kid's obvious talents, they were clueless and afraid of the world as it was evolving and I'm being nice about this. Lewis omits a deeper and warranted discussion of values and how dangerous this kid may ultimately become to himself and/or others in the future, whether it involves the internet or anything else. The premise of the book was good, but the end result was just a missed opportunity."},{"rating":"1","title":"You have to know his work","review":"I was rather disappointed with this book. The first few chapters were rather intresting. However, eventually it became slow and boring. Michael Lewis uses too much details that were uneccessary. His examples toward the end became dull. His use of words were dragging. It seems like the only reason this book was 236 pages was because the publishing company wouldn;t accept anything less. He filled the end with endless details and awful jokes.

Some people have dvd players that have trouble with the double sided disks. Make sure that you know what you are buying if double sided disks are an issue for you. I have seasons 1, 2 and 4 and while all my season 4 sets are of the 4 disk sets my season 1s and 2s are a mixture of the two sets.

As the review suggests, the album is somewhat experimental, but those tracks are completely useless.The band meanders through eight tracks, with the exception of track 5, \\"Light Out\\", until the album really gets focused with track 9, the haunting \\"Dayenu\\". \\"Colorguard\\" is the standout track on the album, but keeping with the inexplicable production choices it is about a minute too long, so you will never hear it on the radio.This is a very talented band who like many others have released an unfocused, experimental debut full length. However, unlike under-the-radar bands like Frank Jordan, Hockey Night, and Lake Trout, this album produces some excellent tracks and is not all about potential. Less could have made it so much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"tedious enough to sap your will to live","review":"I hated this book...I really, REALLY hated it.It's so schmaltzy and cloying. Too much insipid conversation betweent he author and his student and waaaaaaay too much reiteration of the same BASIC principles (over and over and over the same point!). It's like shut the hell up and get on with it already!This is a real shame because the author seems to have a lot to teach, however the method leaves a lot to be desired. I guess if you were one of those people who needed some serious hand-holding while learning something then this is what you need. Hundreds of pages of babble. The idea of it was to teach a complete non-programmer how to program using c++. Good idea...poor execution.No, just the thought of this book was enough to make me cringe."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad for precision","review":"This mouse pad is slick and lets you zip around with little friction. The only downside is when you try to be precise, the mouse moves all over the place. Imagine trying to click on something and you see it suddenly tries to drag it. All I did was click, but the pad is so slick it moves the mouse just a hair. I've used multiple optical mice with it, and it's better to use the cheapo mouse pads because of this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plastic curls up and will not lie flat","review":"Tried two of these AllPoS Accutrack mouse pads and they both curled up and will not lie flat, see photo. This is right out of the package, without any exposure to the sun. How accurate is the mouse tracking when the mouse rolls to the middle of the pad on its own due to the curled up pad? In addition, the contact cement attaching the hard plastic top to the rubbery underlayment comes unglued after a few months. I found it sort of amusing that the pad flattened out a bit once the two layers become delaminated. I wish I could give it less than 1 star."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surface is great, rest of it is not.","review":"Right after I purchased this mousepad, it started to cup or bowl. The actual surface is great, mouse is really responsive. Unfortunately, I've pretty much been restricted to the middle of the mousepad as the sides are unusable. Would return it, but I got rid of packaging - when does a mousepad break? Apparently, this one does. If they could correct problem, great mousepad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Mousepad Ever","review":"I got this as a replacement for my other mousepad that had literally worn out. After a short period of time the hard plastic surface began to cup making it hard to use except in the very middle of the pad. Being plastic you can try to un-cup the pad but why should you have to bother?Try either the Steelseries pads or the WOWpads. For the same price they are infinitely better. The Steelseries pad is my favorite."},{"rating":"1","title":"curls up","review":"As others have mentioned, this mouse pad \\"cups\\" or curls up. You can't really uncurl it either. This makes it virtually useless, as it doesn't lie flat on the surface of your desk or table. Allsop has to be aware of this problem. Their failure to address this is disgraceful. This product should be taken off the market if they are incapable of improving it to where it does not curl up. Do not buy this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great for first ten days. Then throw it in trash","review":"The pad was awesome at first. Low profile, stuck to desktop, great tracking. Barely noticed it was there.Then, it lost all adhesion to the tabletop, and began to curl up like an old poster. I reverse curled it, heated it, everything. Its useless. Now it moves everwhere the mouse moves, and is thus worse than the bare tabletop. Waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stinky and Stupid Movie","review":"Being we own a chihuahua, we were really looking forward to seeing Nacho. However, about 5 minutes into the movie, we knew that we had wasted our money. The plot was stupid and boring. The film quality resembled something that a child did with his Christmas Present: A toy video camera. The human actors had little talent. Even more disappointing were the voiceovers of Nacho and El Nina; not only did the voices not sound Mexican at all, you couldn't tell what country they were from. Even my children were hating it. I have to say it was the worst movie I ever saw. Bad dog."},{"rating":"1","title":"Home video masquerading as a movie!","review":"I first heard of this movie when I saw it up for auction at eBay, and wondered why I hadn't heard of it before, seeing as I am always looking for family movies and Chihuahua items both. But after one veiwing, I now know why! This is obviously a home video recorded by someone with too much time on his hands who somehow managed to get it packaged up nicely and marketed. With only a handful of actors, none of whom can talk in anything other than a monotone, and shaky film footage, I can't imagine how this ever got into production. I doubt that it would hold even a small child's interest. A serious waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"kick...","review":"i don't know what is wrong...maybe you didn't quite make it to the surprise ending. i loved this movie. its even funnier, if you make sure that you watch the video all the way through, don't turn it off when the credits come on. my only disappointment was that at no point in the movie does nacho wear the hat...the rest was hilarious."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nacho Chihuahua","review":"Unless you really love Chihuahuas,don't rush to buy this.

The point she makes is that there is meaning and purpose in all suffering.

It is good reading that is meaningful and full of comfort for anyone who is suffering."},{"rating":"2","title":"Understanding Suffering","review":"This book is excellent and one that I heartily recommend.

So this review is more about a personal taste preference than product quality, which is fine, but I will look for another way to get the same nutritional benefit from something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the fit and active","review":"I hate to criticize this book since Mr. Kelley seems like a heck of a nice guy and does offer good information. BUT...much of the information about the surgery I got from my surgeon, pre-surgery classes at the hospital, hospital-provided literature and free sites on the web. I am 53 years old. I had my hip replaced Dec. 9, not using cement but natural knit. By Jan. 21 I was walking without a cane or crutches. But, I am younger and for 9 months prior, worked out hard - treadmill, stepper, weights, stretching. Within 10 days of surgery I was back at upper body weight work. I found the exercises from my therapist adequate. So if you are younger and used to exercising, this book is not for you. Older, not used to exercise, it may be helpful. It also does not mention aquatic therapy, a great vehicle, particularly for older hip patients."},{"rating":"2","title":"mystifying","review":"As one of only a few females i know who are interested in the serial killer, i found this book hard to quit reading, i was enthralled in many cases, only to find myself wanting to read a book several hundred pages long on the murderess.

The accompanying phrase book came in very helpful, however, when I was in cabs in Iraq and Jordan and needed to communicate basic destinations to cab drivers, etc (I was shooting video and photos during the 2003 American-led war on Iraq). I highly recommend simultaneously using more than one way into the language. The most useful for me were The Arabic Alphabet (Awde, et al) and Rosetta Stone Arabic, although both do absolutely nothing to help you understand the grammar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than thrilling :(","review":"This was a rather disappointing purchase for me. I am a major Matchbox Twenty fan....DONT be misled by the \\"by Matchbox Twenty\\" or whatever in the title. This is a spoken history of the band and the members....which wouldn't be so bad if it were the band members doing the speaking. But other than a few audio clips (Taken from \\"The Interview\\" CD), the remainder of the CD is spoken by a British female narrator. There is no music by the band, few new revelations of the band, and next to no verbal interaction by the band. There were a few new things I learned about the lesser-known members of the band, but that alone is not worth this CD. Your money is much better spent on their music, or on \\"The Interview\\" Cd, which at least features the band members talking about themselves."},{"rating":"1","title":"Matchbox Madness","review":"If you own \\"The Interview\\" then don't buy this . This cd lists the bands history with a few snippets from \\"the interview\\" and many dissapointments (especially the readers inability to pronounce Matchbox Twenty!) I am a huge fan of the band from England and ordered this with great expectation . It's nice to hear the history of the band from inception to superstardom but trust me , this is a listen once and forget you have . My advice - find someone who has it (or convince a friend to buy it) then listen and give back , no money wasted !"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Da Vinci Book: 97 Quizzes, Games, & Puzzles (Quiz Book)","review":"I expected more puzzles, but the book is filled with questions that relate more as a biography quiz than anything else.

It's hard to compare her sound to other artists, because it's so unique! In this ablbum, it has a kind of early 90's alternative sound in some tracks, vaguely reminiscent of The Sugar Cubes or Annie DiFranco or early Alanis or something. But then she throws in some absolutely gorgeous acoustic tracks that are serene, kind of melancholy and euphoric (think Jack Johnson or Iron & Wine). The instruments are all skillfully played, harmonious, but best of all is her voice. Soft, gentle, melodic, serene, warm, wispy... the perfect accompaniment to the intricate music and the rolling, rhythmic, poetic lyrics. Her music can make you feel ready to relax, or ready to take on the world."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Big Disappointment","review":"Unfortunately this book is just \\"trading\\" on the popularity of the show.

If you are a Trading Spaces fan you will probably find this book an amazing wealth of not so juicy tidbits. Sorry voyeurs, no real shocking scandals among the cast members, (I was kind of surprised that some of them had never been arrested for possession of narcotics or redecorating under the influence).My only gripe was that this book read like it was written for 13 year olds, kind of like those kids magazines we used to get in school and read aloud in class every Friday. Yea!!!! Weekly readers, thats what it reminded me of!!Don't look for any real good redecorating tips but you do get to see the carpenter TY in a \\"Tiger Beat\\" styled portrait for the ladies. For Serious Fans only."},{"rating":"1","title":"Everything you ever want to know about Doug Wilson, but....","review":"This book is a good example of savvy marketing at it's best. My husband and I have watched the show ever since the Alex Mcloud era, and we were hoping to get some tips and how-tos on some of the designs we've seen over the years. This book is basically a big biography of the designers- I could give a flying fig where Doug Wilson went to High School, I want to know how he does those cool paint techniques! If you're looking for tips and techniques like me, hold out until August- TLC will be releasing two more books from the TS camp; one on furniture, paint and fabric, and the other on accessories. However if you're really looking for poster-size photos of the designers (I kid you not), look no further."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Stars of Trading Spaces","review":"The book is an inside look at the designers and others who appear on the TV show. It is not meant to be a \\"How To\\" book. Within the scope of its purpose, it does well. It shows many pictures and gives a lot of information about the people. It's a sort of introduction to the show through its stars and does a good job of showing their personalities, quirks, & mess ups. It does show a little about the rooms that have been decorated on the show and has a list with comments about every show at the end of the book. It also does show a few tips about decorating. There are two more books scheduled to be published that will be more like decorating \\"How To\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have for Any Viewer!","review":"This book is a must-have for anyone who is addicted to Trading Spaces the way I am! I found all of the behind the scenes info intriguing. It was interesting to learn what really goes into the making of a show, but more fascinating was learning about all of the designers' backgrounds. I was surprised by alot of things I learned. I feel like I already know the designers and carpenters and Paige, and this book makes me feel like I know them a little better. They each come from very different and interesting backgrounds and it's interesting how each one of them ended up on this show. This book is definitely worth reading!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fluff","review":"While I loved getting a peek into the lives of my favorite designers (go, Vern!) I would have liked to get more information about actual decorating projects. I guess I was looking for more DIY substance. There is a little bit of it, but not enough to justify the price of the book. This is one you're better off borrowing from a friend, or checking out of the library - not necessarily for the permanent collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trading Spaces book is a must!","review":"I am an avid Trading Spaces fan, so when I saw this book, I bought it right away! It was certainly worth the money. This book has all the facts about your favorite designers (Frank, Laurie, Gen, Vern, Edward, Kia, Doug and Hildi), Paige Davis, Amy Wynn Pastor and Ty Pennington. There is also a guide to the episodes from Season One onward. This is a great buy also because there are decorating tips and great pictures!

This is more an album for the Horslips fan \`completist\`, although there are a few nice tracks (completely unique to this album) that would be of interest to a new fan too, such as, Johnny\`s Wedding, Green Gravel, Oisin\`s Tune, High Reel, Fairy King.

King of the Fairies and The High Reel are both especially good. Green Gravel is a cool folk-ish song, and Motorway Madness is a rockin' rock song.

The content of a trial seemed weak and avoided crtical questions. I found the main characters shallow, selfish and conceited at every page. Even the main premise is a stretch - Who would every agree to upload and just go off somewhere to die? How can machines be aroused enough for intimate relations? The anti-U.S. and anti-religion stance from every major character was very repetitve (once is sufficient) that it became painful to complete the book. The ending was very anti-climatic.

I guess good, original stories are just very hard to come by..."},{"rating":"1","title":"suffocating","review":"Interior monologue; no dialogue; paras pages long; sentences of two or three hundred words; a depressing, turgid read.

It's as though a local little theater group got together and decided to film a movie, perhaps given the money by a local millionaire. The results are pretty tepid; even kids will find this one a howler. With a script that seems written by a pink slipped author, PAWS AND CLAWS tries to make up for its human inadequacies by giving the animals \\"thought\\" dialogue, but even the cuteness of the critters can't save this one. The \\"Let's Save the Animal Shelter\\" plotline is so shoddily concocted, one can only hope the shelter shuts down and all the animals are let loose. I'm usually a sucker for cute animal movies, but PAWS AND CLAWS RESCUERS is just a big mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunate Title","review":"The title of this book alone should dissuade all readers from reading this book.

I must say I was greatly disappointed. The plot could have been interesting, but got far too bogged down and complicated, and sometimes lost in the author's attempt to educate readers on the real life history behind the plot. Add to that the constant \\"Mission Impossible\\" escapes from certain death by the protagonist that would have left Clive Cussler shaking his head, I found myself anxious for the book to end.

Well, needless to say, I won't be reading NPR recommendations any more. It was so poorly written that I could barely stomach getting through it. I had trouble skimming pages to get to readable text.

Obviously, recent history is rife with terrorism (just today there was a ETA attack on Majorca). But Thor is feeding the common, simplistic line that he hopes will sell well. The book is replete with such trite sentences, as well as being replete with factual errors about his topic. In his very first chapter, he describes the Punjabis in Pakistan as the oppressed, poor subgroup in Pakistan, when a simple fact check would lead him to the fact that Punjabis tend to be dominantely represented not only in politics, but also business and demographically. I assumed my mother greatly by continually reading out sentences from his book, which obviously showed that Thor just grasp the simplistic worldview that is being pushed by a certain population, rather than really being a master of the genre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware !","review":"This is not a prof. production, except for the narration.

Recorded in the most primitive of situations almost completely live, this, their debut cd has had an amazing impact out of all proportion to it's humble indy origins. \\"Old Lions\\" is packed with mostly instrumental cuts that overflow with gloriously raw, and refreshingly un-selfconscious guitar playing by A.S. mastermind and lead guitarist Bill MacKechnie. Touching upon Arabic, Indian, Celtic and world music in a rock base not that far removed from the proto heavy metal of bands like Led Zeppelin and Cream, A.S. takes it's listeners on a magic carpet ride that doesn't let up from start to finish. While it's doubtful that you'll be hearing them on your commercial radio station any time soon, Anubis Spire have already garnered a sizable cult following that I predict will only continue to grow and will become one of those bands that people will look back upon as a true cult classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"It grows on you, that's for sure.","review":"This is a cool CD.

The idea of a stainless steel bowl really appealed to me, but the reality of it is that you're going to lose a lot of rice when cooking a batch.There are a few recommendations for reducing the effect of this, the most helpful being to coat the bowl with oil (I haven't tried a cooking spray yet) prior to adding rice and water, but it won't completely solve the problem and it also affects the taste of the rice.Soaking the bowl overnight does allow for easy cleaning, but it's still a bummer to have a substantial layer of rice go down the sink (or, if you don't have garbage disposal, to be fished out of the strainer and into the trash).This might just be the trade off, for being able to avoid aluminum or non-stick coating, but be prepared for it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rice Cooker","review":"Have used it many times, but still can't seem to get a decent rice - usually comes out sticky or not quite done.

I used 3 cups of white rice (used measuring cup provided), water to the mark between 2 and 4 in the stainless steel bowl plus a small amount of olive oil then turned it on. The way this unit is advertised one would assume the unit has a sensor knowing when to shut-off to warm mode. I didn't find that to be true with my test. After 50 mins. of cook time I manually pulled the plug and let it set for 5 mins. I also took the included plastic spoon/spatula and stirred the rice once while cooking. There was no sticking as others have stated in their review.

If you do NOT want to keep the rice warm you will have to remember to turn the cooker off by unplugging it. There is no way to cook the rice without the wamer feature coming on. This sucks. The warmer will also dry out the rice.It would have been nice to have a smaller capacity rice cooker.The bottom rice layer does stick more in the stainless steel pot than in an aluminum pot. The automatic warming feature does contribute to the sticking problem. To remove the bottom layer you need to soak inside of the pot in soapy water.

I play the music into garage band (record) with a M-Audio 66ES keystation (which I highly recommend) and found that there just weren't enough instruments to meet my needs for all of the tracks that I like to record. This product more than meets those needs, as it has a ton of instruments to use. I especially like how much more realistic they sound than the pre-loaded instruments in the original garage band. If you are more into using the loops, they are spectacular! They would work well as soundtracks for movies or slideshows, or as accompaniments to anything you want.

Since then, me and my friends have been having a real kick reading about our secret selves beneath the tube!! My brother got hold of the book, and he's been getting a hoot out of it too.

Me and my other friends loved doing these inovative recipes to help overcome our problems.

She is unapologetic about her love affair and addiction to the stuff, and leaves out no detail, regardless how un-ladylike or un-P.C. it may have (Roman makeup slaves, how horrible!) Her lighthearted approach is refreshing, and her sense of humor shines throughout.I am a woman who has never worn lipstick and never really liked it. Rather than addicted to lipstick, I am addicted to little intersting facts and factoids. This book sated my desire to cram my head with crazy information about a piece of this culture I am a part of.Whatever Ms. Pallingston writes next, I await it eagerly!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"While there was some interesting information in the general text, I was not pleased with the presentation of the book or the photo of the author in the back. The back flap has a photo and some text about the author and says that she owns 200 tubes of lipstick, but in her photograph she wasn't wearing lipstick. How can I accept her as an authority when she wasn't wearing any lipstick for her own book on the topic?"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you love lipstick...","review":"You'll love this book! It's loaded with information--everything you could ever want to know about lipstick you'll find here; even how to make your own. It's well written and assumes the reader is intelligent with a sense of humour, mostly text, which is refreshing for a book about a cosmetic. This is not a magazine-type-picture-book for morons--it's a book for adults with a whimsical nature. Jessica Pallingston is the Professor of Lipstick!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good thing to have!!","review":"I ordered this for my wireless headphones & I'm glad I did. My Sony headphones died on me in six months so, I contacted new replacement plan. They told me how to send my headphones back & I got my check in the mail for the purchase price that I paid for my headphones. I did have to pay my own shipping charge but, It was well worth it to have this plan. I had no problems with customer service. They were very nice. The only thing there was a problem with was getting my check. It did take them from Aug to Oct to get my check. I called them one time & they said there was a problem with getting the checks out but, I would have my check by the 8th of Oct. It was here on the 9th because of columbus day. I do recommend this company. I had no problems with them execpt for what I said about waiting for my check. If you don't mind waiting for your check I say get this replacement plan.

I found the characters of Marissa and Clay to be very personable and engaging. I really liked the idea of this bold, irreverent young lady setting out to seduce her scholarly bookworm. It made a nice change from the world-weary, fabulously rich man seducing the prim and proper bluestocking. What I didn't really enjoy was the transformation from the rather endearing bookworm to the cold soldier. It was almost a cancellation of the first part of the book. However, it worked with the plot, but I missed that shy demeanor. The sequence of Mari and Clay \\"solving\\" the murder plot could have been a little more developed, I think. It just seemed rather abrupt, so little to go on and then whoops! there's the devil who did it! I think this book is definitely worth reading though. You just really have to like a story where the characters have such love for each other."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Redhead From Wyoming","review":"This is a great Western starring Maureen O'Hara from 1953.

She wouldn't speak or move or do anything. We, like other reviewers, did the same thing..checked the reset switch (which is really difficult to get to with all the clothes on) we changed the batteries...nothing.We paid nearly $100 for her in the stores..and she was a huge waste.

She enjoyed playing with it that day but in the four months since Christmas this doll has only been played with a handful of times.She comes with lots of accessories which my daughter enjoyed. She also liked the way the doll \\"talked\\" and interacted with her but the novelty wore off quickly. We found that her clothes fit very snug so they are hard for my 4 yr old to get on and off. Personally I think it is a little creepy the way the doll \\"grows\\". When she is in her \\"toddler phase\\" she looks quite odd with an elongated torso.I am just waiting for my daughter to completely forget about this doll so we can give it away.Overall, I thought this doll was a waste of money.

She was a very big disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Christmas crash","review":"This doll prompted quite an emotional roller coaster. It worked beautifully for a few hours on Christmas morning. Just long enough for my daughter to fall in love and declare it the best toy ever. Then Suzie just went silent. We changed the batteries, we used the reset button. Nothing. It was just dead. The only instructions they sent were in French, but I was able to decipher them. Nothing explained the crash and the few troubleshooting suggestions did nothing but give us a few minutes of false hope. I'll post a revision if the company is helpful to us when I try to contact them tomorrow. Ugh. What a holiday let-down for a little girl."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Good","review":"My 6YO wanted this doll for Christmas, but I resisted. When she kept asking, I made a deal to buy it for her, in exchange for clearing out a substantial stash of old toys. She and her 3YO sister did all the work to select the toys for donation or trash. For that, I am grateful. But the Susie doll was a bust. They played with it for a day or two, then the novelty wore off, and she's been sitting in a corner ever since. She's not a particularly cute or cuddly doll. She's a little odd shaped, due to the growth ability and she has limited interaction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied Customer","review":"I purchased Suzie for my little girl and she shipped within 3 days, though I had not requested expedited shipping. So far, we have had minimal issues that I would say is more operator problems than the doll itself. We are still discovering all her features, and that is part of the fun. I could probably give her 5 stars for performance, but because she is so new, I am afraid to over-rate her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"She's just so incredibly amazing!

Previously I had the wireless headset from Plantronics which looks exactly like this one only it wasn't bluetooth. The two things I'll highlight is that there is a small bit of noise that the other end hears but you don't. And the range is shorter, somewhere in the 50-70 feet range. The prior wireless version had greater distance and no one could tell I was on a wireless headset.On the plus side, I can answer my phone(s) with the headset on which ever phone rings, ie. desk phone or cell. The trade-offs are acceptable for the convenience of being able to eliminate a headset."},{"rating":"1","title":"This CD is not by Disciple......","review":"Amazon has now appropriately switched the artist of this CD from \\"Disciple\\" to \\"xDisciplex A.D.\\" My following review was written before the correction:This CD is apparently by \\"xDisciplex A.D.\\", whom I've never heard of. Don't get them confused with \\"Disciple.\\" The music is similar in style, but Disciple doesn't growl in their music. They sing and scream and the music is far more uplifting than what I've just sampled from these guys.If you're wanting something by Disciple, check out the \\"Back Again,\\" \\"This Might Sting A Little, \\"By God,\\" and self-titled \\"Disciple\\" albums.

Still has a lot of their older songs rerecorded, but it's actually more of an improvement than a cash-in, a greatest hits album, where the hits suddenly become greater than the album versions. The sound is sharp and agressive, the playing is good and tight, the overal production is grand - Varukers didn't even sound this fresh and professional in their heyday. I'm not a big fan of this kind of music, but there's no denying that it's a great album and I must recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very thick, thorough book--could be research textbook","review":"I kept this book for the longest time while I was working on my dissertation (as adjunct faculty I could keep for semester and renew for semesters as long as noone else requested it. Strangely, nobody did.) It is an excellent collection of articles, essays, etc for a researcher. It covers a large scope of topics and the articles are solidly written by excellent researchers.I don't know why professors didn't choose this as a research textbook. Perhaps the scope of the book is intimidating for a professor or maybe too ambitious to cover within any semester or academic year. With nearly 1000 pages, it is also an extremely heavy and thick book to carry around."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great staple for masters and doctoral degrees","review":"I have just finished my doctoral degree and this book has helped me enourmously.

The someday-famous McConey, a naive student, is unwillingly attracted in zillions of adventures : he'll meet a mad scientist, an ambitious journalist, a rather curious police officer, as well as burglars, snipers, lizard-looking monsters, time-travel machines, terrorists and so on. Amazingly enough, this all makes sense in Trondheim's World, where characters never lose neither their self-control nor their sense of humour.

He is classy, soulful, spiritual and eloquent in how he conveys his sound and words. He is not afraid to tune in his feminine side. For example, \\"This Woman's Work\\", with his high and rich tone is elegantly achieved. The story of \\"Lifetime\\" is definitely a masterpiece! Let me not forget the beauty and richness of \\"Changed\\" This cd is a combination of classical, neo-classic soul and the retro sound of the 7o's. It's a must have.

For those who live in or near a very large city, this book may be of some use, but be aware that not every city (even if it seems major to you) has an entry. In addition, some of the very best medical centers in large cities (the Massachusetts General Hospital for example) are largely ignored: perhaps there was an asymmetric distribution of questionnaires or an uneven distribution of respondents.

All you get in this DVD is footage of a very young Demi Lovato dancing in a poorly choreographed, lip-synching, low budget music video.

The audio is poor quality, with obtrusive environmental rain sounds. As an English horn player, I wondered why the performer is anonymous--no wonder, s/he is also amateurish, sounding like a woodwind doubler who spent 10 minutes preparing with little musicality and control of phrasing or musical shape.

She said the sound would come and go throughout the movie and to spare my feelings they ordered a new one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine Performances By Stewart and O'Hara","review":"THE RARE BREED is a film about the delivery of a white-faced Hereford bull from England to the Texas range for breeding purposes. The man responsible for the task is James Stewart. The women who own the bull are Maureen O'Hara and her daughter played by Juliet Mills. THE RARE BREED is a fairly good Western with strong performances by Stewart and O'Hara. A fine supporting cast includes Brian Keith, Don Galloway and David Brian.Andrew V. McLaglen directed many other good movies such as MCLINTOCK and SHENANDOAH."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too cosy by far","review":"The Rare Breed is one of those lukewarm westerns from James Stewart's sixties' \`loveable' phase when he abandoned the dark determination of the Anthony Mann films to go for a more Disneyfied comic approach. Indeed, the film feels more like a typical Disney family comedy of the 60s than a Western, an impression not dispelled by Jack Elam's comedy villain, Juliet Mills' and Don Galloway's juvenile leads and, most terrifying of all, Brian Keith in bushy red wig and beard with outrageous \`Scottish' accent wooing Maureen O'Hara. Throw in the standard John (then still billed as Johnny) Williams Western score, and you've got an inoffensively bland but utterly unmemorable Sunday afternoon movie.The 2.35:1 widescreen transfer is more than acceptable, but the fullframe trailer has clearly seen better days."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Jimmy's Best and Brian Keith!","review":"Jimmy Stewart had a habit of making good movies and this is one of them. It tells the story of introducing hereford(or herford) cattle to the united states and it does it partly lighthearted and partly serious. Brian Keith shows up as well as absolutely wonderful former scottish highlander soldier who's taken up ranching in the west. Keith is just great as the old cantankerous scottsman. The herford bull(named vindicator) is cleverly portrayed as well without being silly."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Time","review":"I know this movie stars James Stwwart and Maureen O'Hara. However, the plot for this Western is mediocre at best. Even some of the best actors in Hollywood history cannot save this turkey. Skip it- it will not be hard to find a better movie than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"rare breed","review":"excellent condition, thought it was a vcr though, and took forever to get...maybe I was just anxious.. would shop there again AAA+++"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time","review":"I don't know where to start with this miserable piece of dreck. You have to be, HAVE TO BE , a diehard Jimmie Stewart or Maureen O'Hara fan to sit through this. Brian Keith's performance / Scottish accent is so laughable, I'm surprised he ever showed his face again after making this movie. The whole film feels like it was made without benefit of a script or a director. We'll just stick Stewart and O'Hara in this, wink at the camera and that will be enough to make everybody happy. HAHAHAHAHA, don't waste your time on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh..? What...??","review":"A discombobulated cowboy comedy in which an aging (over-the-hillish) Jimmy Stewart locks horns and then falls in love with an eccentric, headstrong English woman, who is determined to introduce Hereford cattle into Texas. The livestock angle dominates the plot (yawn -- who cares?) and the most likeable character turns out to be her prize bull, Vindicator. I thought this was kind of a snoozer, with a somewhat brittle feel overall. Kind of a dud."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stewart's worst outing in a Western","review":"I'm still in shock at just how truly bad this one really is. I should have known better, thought this one fell through the cracks or something and it did...for good reason.Weak story is dragged down even further due to almost the entire film being shot in a studio. Some of it is comical, but not quite as comical as Brian Keith's wildman bagpipe playing Scot cattle baron. Hoot mon! You've been warned."},{"rating":"2","title":"Family movie? Almost Disneylike. memorable performances","review":"Agreeing with all the other reviewers. Good memorable performances from O'Hara and Stewart.

Tom Arnold and Judd Nelson were excellent, and the story was good. I think other reviewers were looking for a slasher when this was more of an actual drama. I think this film, being made (apparently) by independents without theatrical release didn't get any marketing which means people watching it have no idea what to expect. Its a drag when a film can't find it's audience . . .Anyway, if you like Judd Nelson and Tom Arnold and you kind of want a more realistic depiction of police, serial killers, and the ambience of a small town, you'll like this film. If you're looking for slashers or a thrill ride, you won't find it so don't watch the film :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"not my favorite...","review":"I bought this because it was filmed in a community near where I live, but I couldn't get all the way through it.

At first I was worried that Jim would teach me to take his same unorthodox swing :) but this video is all short game and Jim's short game is fundamentally near perfect. Jim and Fred are good instructors and the material is easy to understand and apply. The production quality is outstanding - this isn't a low budget video, it looks like feature film quality and you can see and hear every detail of the beautiful TPC Saw Grass course. In the video you actually watch Jim and Fred compete against eachother in a short game match while they describe how they approach each shot and what desicions they make.

I don't have any complains with this product, highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very solid, and surprisingly light weight","review":"Does an excellent job at actually opening a bottle-top, which is something that can't be said for some bottle openers. It has an ergonomic feel to it, but it lacks a certain weighty-ness I was looking for. By no means is it flimsy, as it is rock solid, just doesn't feel it in your hands. the back side is hollow, and I thought it'd be otherwise. Overall, not a bad price for a good bottle opener. No major complaints."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flimsy","review":"The rubber center and the metal body are not bound tightly so it feels cheap. Still it hasn't rusted after 6 months so that's good. Still if I'm not paying a buck for a cheapo opener, I at least expect something that doesn't feel flimsy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple, smart design!","review":"What I love about OXO and in particular this opener, is the good design and perfect function.

Whenever I desire to buy a recording of orchestral music from the classical period, especially Haydn or Mozart, my first choice is N. Marriner. His approach to the music of Rossini is ideal with its crispness, attack and attention to details.

Although the script is not the greatest, these two fine stars make the movie worth watching. Jimmy Stewart does a fine job portraying a railroad man who has been wronged by the owner, and Audie Murphy plays the Utica Kid, a bandit who was set free by Stewart.The action is good, and the plot is easy to follow which is a must for a good Western. Some of the singing scenes are a little goofy, but if you like other Jimmy Stewart Westerns, then you will like this one as well, although it is not his best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Night Passage review","review":"I really enjoyed this movie.

A footnote in western film history."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Would Pass On Night Passage","review":"I viewed this film for the first time and was very disappointed. The story is not very good and I wished James Stewart got rid of that stupid accordian. I like James Stewart in films like Wonderful Life, Mr. Smith Goes To Washington and Destry Rides Again with Marlene Dietrich. This film lacks many qualities and does not come across as a film destined to be classic. I think the main distraction is the constant singing by James Stewart (Who is not a singer by any stretch of the imagination) and the playing of the accordian. I didn't get any feeling for the characters. The film comes across as a 'B' film. Not one Jame's best I'm afraid.

This solo venture is a moving, sensual, dark journey. I was a huge fan of October Project (and still am), but somehow this strikes me as more meaningful, richer, textured. She has somehow transcended through something and to something else entirely and her voice is actually luminous. And if' that ain't enough, she's proven herself a notable songwriter. The song \\"Paolo\\" is especially haunting. The first time I played it, my 7 month old stopped dead in his tracks (well, he was crawling) and stared at the stereo, transfixed. I never saw him respond to anything like that before, even the Teletubbies' opening song.

The content is not particularly outstanding - and there is no mention of OSPF - not even in the index!

The book is well done, but you have to be interested in true crime to, if you will, appreciate this collection of photos.

These were obviously not featured in the 1971 Willy Wonka movie, even though they are still worth trying once. For Wonka chocolate, it's good. You can even find a golden ticket in this wrapper, and not just in any Wonka bar by themselves. Don't expect to bite into one because I think that's what everyone looks for when they open either one every time, and they're both 59 cents. What a price for chocolate so good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCELLENT!","review":"These are GREAT!!! Our whole family enjoys them.

Upon tasting, I was surprised at how bland and lifeless the chocolate was (perhaps I shouldn't have been, considering that the amount of cocoa is negligible compared to the other ingredients), offering nothing to the palette but a sweetish, barely-there presence. The candy sprinkles detract from what little chocolate flavor exists, while adding nothing but a sugary taste that does not sit well with the candy as a whole."},{"rating":"1","title":"I think I know why I am the lone reviewer...","review":"Very, very, very, very boring.

This book reminds us that not everyone in NC was eatin' moon pies, burnin' crosses, and votin' for Jessie Helms. And, that taking the high road in politics does not have to mean losing the race.

Parts of the back story didn't seem to add up and I suspect were either missing critical details or had been embellished.

Once you have listened to these versions, you'll realize that they contain the most pure, the most polished, and the most authentic doo wop sound you've ever heard. And best of all, every nuance from the original version is retained! Other rival doo wop groups can harmonize, but usually lack a top notch soloist. Trust me on this one! You'll love \\"Strike Three\\" and \\"Doo Wop Till You Drop\\" so much, you'll be tempted to buy a more powerful stereo just so you can crank these songs to a new level!

Naturally, everybody learns a lesson about life and both the doctors and patients are seen in their human weakness and grandeour. Midway through the movie, out of nowhere, one of the best action sequences in movie history occurs just before the intermission. It is shocking because it is such a departure from the tone and is also so brief, confusing, and brutal. Toshiro Mifune and Kurosawa never worked together again after this movie and the director's work changed radically. Still good, but I'll always prefer the b&w epics the two of them made together."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Master At Work","review":"Moving, insightful, magnificent, a stellar cast, a wonderful print, a fine commentary...cinema at its finest!

It is a very interesting and at times curious film - threaded together in a way that the western viewer is not used to - but can adapt to. Toshiro Mifune is a very subtle and interesting character actor -and maybe gives his best performance here as Red Beard. This movie at times has an almost Ozu feel about it - a tender embracing of characters in a downward spiral of events - that evokes the Ozu style (not necesarrily in a direct way). This is unmistakeably Kurosawa, however, and is the equal, if not greater than his own samurai classics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Red Beard moves you in so many ways...","review":"The legendary Toshir Mifune has the part of Red Beard, a name that is self-explanatory. One day a young doctor by the name Noboru Yasumoto (Yuzo Kayama) arrives at Red Beard's welfare hospital where he is to replace a colleague who anxiously wants to leave. Noboru has big plans for the future as he wants to be the Shogun's personal doctor. However, this new assignment will be an obstacle to his ambitions, since the new position forces him to confront his personal expectations as well as Red Beard. Red Beard requires contemplation by the audience otherwise much will be missed, which makes the cinematic experience grand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Endangered Species by Eric Bogle","review":"Eric Bogle, The Scotsman from down under is not only the Conscience of Australia but also of the world. \\"Endangered Species\\" the title song is a real hoot.

Well, it turns out that the letters take up a grand total of 17 pages, and there are only 8 letters from Lewis to Clarke: 1 that occupies a full page, 4 that occupy a half page each, and 3 that are 2- or 3-liners. The vast majority of the pages in this slim book are devoted to reprinting short stories and essays available elsewhere. Even the publishers seem to have realized that calling this a \\"War of Letters\\" is overblown, because when the book arrived its subtitle had been changed to \\"The War of Ideas\\".When it comes to CSL correspondence collections, I think this should rank dead last on prospective buyers' lists, behind _Collected Letters_ (available from the UK), _Letters of C.S.

His relationship included the life lessons that his father taught him while they were on the diamond. Remember, it is important to have this relationship with a special family member so that you always would have somebody to talk to. I personally enjoyed this book and loved reading it. The book was kind of fuzzy throughout some parts. By this I mean, that some of the book was filled with filler. The book then went on to talk about how his father was important while he was on the road for a long time. In addition, while he was on his way to the majors. It is evident that Paul is a great author and he has great writing abilities. Finally, I would just like to say that this was an all-around great book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A nice tribute to his father, but not much else","review":"While I can respect the idea of this book as a tribute to his father, I can't recommend it as an entertaining read.

But most were simply attacks on the Star Wars saga (a more and more common stance these days, since George has now decided that Greedo fired first, and since he introduced us to Jar Jar Binks, it has become cool to rag on the series).

Paper by other manufacturers tends to misfeed.As a graphic designer, I was hoping to use this as a back-up printer for work. I've had to stop, as I find it too expensive to run.Otherwise, good print quality, good skin tones."},{"rating":"1","title":"POOR QUALITY","review":"We have printed about 400 sheets through this printer and then the print head malfunctioned. And I see by many other reviews that this is a common problem. I'd bet all other Canon printers are short lived too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"Combined with Canon Photo Paper Plus and Pro, this printer produces true photo quality prints if not better.

I have used it to create digital photo albums, and people who look at it have a hard time telling if the pictures were printed or developed by a professional. The quality is much better on photo paper than on regular or high-quality paper, so the extra money for the photo paper is definitely worth it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Super Canon","review":"The Canon i950 is my first photo printer and I am truly impressed. I did a lot of research and discussed different printers with friends. Several of my friends use Epson printers and tried to convince me to buy one. I am so glad I purchased the Canon instead it is much faster and much quiter. I highly recommend and would purchase again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack customer support","review":"Bought the i950 last spring and it worked great until Nov when everything came out with a blue or green cast. Tech support would not help since I had replaced the cartridges with compatible cartridges and not with the Canon brand. They would help if I replaced all the cartridges with their brand, With a cost of almost $80.00 for their cartridges I felt it just wasn't worth spending that much. The i950 is simply too expensive to maintain so I'm back with Epson."},{"rating":"1","title":"i 950 Not a good printer","review":"I have also purchased a new print head after the dreaded 7 flashes.Nothing works. This printer was well taken care of and not used that often. Canon rushed these printers into production with very little if any field testing and reliability testing.Do NOT buy this printer. YOU WILL be sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes another bad review - product doesn't last","review":"I'm really disappointed in the Canon i950. Started out great but like others I've learned that the printer head needs to be replaced. The cost of the printer head is not worth it and certainly makes the printer a poor value. I like Canon cameras but definitely not a fan of this printer. Spend your money elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another throw-away product","review":"I really liked the quality of this printer when it was new; the pictures were outstanding. However, after only two and a half years of relatively light use, the printer head has failed. This is no different than having an engine fail in one's new, shiny car. What would one's reaction be if the dealer said \\"oh yes, after 2 years you have to replace the engine\\" \\"Didn't anyone tell you?\\".I expect more from a noted manufacturer such as Canon . Canon should be ashamed. I have had enough of throw-away products and the corporate mentality that produces them. I ask: just who does make a good reliable printer that will last for a few years?"},{"rating":"1","title":"The memorable printhead","review":"I have used this printer sporadically for about 2 years. Suddenly it stopped working; I lost a lot of ink trying to do deep cleaning. Finally Canon told I will need a new printhead for about $100. Well, it is time to move on and buy a new printer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing photo printer, excellent for text, too","review":"An outstanding printer. Photos on this printer are indistiguishable from normal film finishing. Printer is fast, quiet, moderately inexpensive to run. Paper handling is good; never have had a jam.A special bonus: text quality is excellent, letters are crisp and well-defined.Annoyance: envelopes do not print well; the ink smudges on the leading edge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing printer","review":"I've had the printer for a week now and am truly amazed. I had the printer up and running inside of 5 minutes on a WinXP machine. The printer is so fast and quiet I had a printout before I knew it had even started--I don't see a need for the quiet mode.I've tried several different papers all with good success. Most of them look like a chemical process photo. One thing to keep in mind is the recommended dry time, as some papers look odd until they completely dry; the software gets the job done with little hassle. You can have borderless photos with a few clicks.For the money you can't go wrong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyers beware..","review":"Like many of the reviews written, I share the same experiences.. It worked great for the time under waranty and then it stopped working,, Called Canon, charged for the call and then told me it needed repair..

Never another Canon product for me..I had both the scanner and printer less than two years, and then both failed.. Canon should be ashamed.."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm done with Canon products","review":"Had the i950 for about 10 months before major problems set in. First pictures took on a strange blueish hue. I replaced the ink cartridges for lots of money. It worked for a while then stopped. I stopped printing pics for about 3 months, then came back to it and the printer wouldn't budge. Totally gone. Canon support couldn't help.I also can a canon s400 camera. LCD screen went bad one day. I sent it in and canon told me I got water into the camera. I'm anal about that and can tell you that water never got into the camera! $100 to fix it. 6 months later the problem came back. Canon said it's past their service guarantee, so it would have cost another $100 to fix it.I switched to Kodak EasyShare camera and printer and am totally happy now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nightmare with paper feeding","review":"This printer is very nice in all respects -- except one big one -- which it has consistent problems recognizing there is paper in the tray. I have tried tech support, cleaning the feeders, etc. But it is now 6 months old and I'm done. I'm throwing it out to spare myself the misery. I hope you spare yourself the misery as well. Get something else."},{"rating":"2","title":"You get great photos out of it, eats ink for lunch AND breakfast","review":"This has been our main photo printer for a couple of years, actually.There's nothing fancy or special about it. It simply prints great photos for as long as you are using the recommended Canon photo paper, the better the paper's quality, the better the pictures come out. The output is a bit slow but, for as long as you dedicate it to photos printing only, and you should, speed does not matter much. The quality does matter and, to me, it's almost indistinguishable from what you would get out of your average Walmart photo lab.The only negative about it is the enormous amount of ink it consumes. You would probably need a new set of ink cartridges after every couple dozen full 8.5/11\\" sheets, printed at the highest resolution.One final note of advice: use it for photos only, print on good quality Canon paper and, chances are, it will serve you well for as long as you care to use it. At least that's my experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"no more canons for me","review":"This printer should have lasted much longer. It was a higher priced printer but had great reviews.

Then after I printed about 50+ pictures over the period of half year, they started to all come out with a yellowish tone. Replacing ink cartridge with its canon brand ones, deep cleaning, realigning the print head, none worked. Canon's solution is to replace the print head which cost $100? Not acceptable to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great during warranty","review":"I bought this printer based on Canons rep and my past experience with Canon. It performed beyond my expectations until about a month after the warranty ran out then it started making a pink tinge on all of my photos. Then I noticed that my yellow ink kept turning dark as ink from the other tanks migrated into the yellow tank. I wrote Canon technical support, from which I never even received a reply. I am so tired of fighting ink problems that I am throwning this printer in the garbage and turning to HP. I will not replace a print head that should have lasted longer than the warranty and I will no longer buy Canon. Ashame, to, because I was going to buy a digital rebel to go with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of junk...","review":"I received this printer as a Christmas gift a couple of years ago. As a result, I will never buy a Canon printer. The ink is extremely expensive. The pictures faded over time (yes, I printed on photo paper). And now to top it off, the printer head is going bad with minimal use over the years. I have nothing positive to say about this printer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive to use. Misleading marketing","review":"The i950 worked well for a little while when all of a sudden the machines stops functioning. It turns out that the Printhead must be replaced periodically and that Canon considers the Printhead to be a 'consumable'. I went back and checked the documentation carefully and there was absolutely no word of a printhead needing any sort of replacement. Well, what do you know??? A replacement printhead runs you over $100!!!!This is a case of deceptive marketing and questionable engineering. But then again, if they were truthful about their printers, who would by them?

Our group of about 15 was diverse in age, spiritual experience and cultural background yet each of us found that we could personally identify with Bondi's writings. She pesents a fresh look at a prayer that is so familiar we may find ourselves chanting it with little thought.

She presented her struggles with each phrase as it related to her childhood. Bondi's life experiences caused her to feel pain and anger when saying the words of the Lord's Prayer. Her suffering focused my attention on her problems and struggles which dissected the Lord's Prayer into unrelated parts. This not only took away the beauty of this prayer for me, but reduced it in the eyes of one who sees meaning in simplicity; like the very young child who accepts our Lord's Prayer in faith."},{"rating":"2","title":"First Rate Noir","review":"Those apprehensive about Lucille Ball in a film noir never fear. The First Lady of Comedy aquits herself remarkably well as the devoted secretary of a tough-talking gumshoe(Mark Stevens) being set up for a murder rap. Also excellent are William Bendix as a mysterious man in the white suit tailing Stevens and Clifton Webb as the art dealer with the young trophy wife. The audience gets caught up in the byzantine plot strands along with Stevens and a helpful Ball as they try to unearth the frame-up. Adding to the tension are great black-and-white cinematography and terrific New York atmosphere circa 1946. Terrific tongue-in-cheek pulp dialogue is also a plus. Look quick for Ellen Corby(Grandma on \\"The Waltons\\") as a cleaning woman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Young Lucy Deserved Better than This Movie!","review":"According to Lucille Ball's autobiography, \\"Love, Lucy,\\" Lucy had a mild nervous breakdown during the filming of this movie, due to outside personal problems. That explains a lot about the way she LOOKS in this film. I am the biggest Lucy fan on earth, and she handles her lines very well, but there is an empty-eyed, haunting sadness and apathy about her in this movie that just doesn't seem like her at all. Also, the plot is a little weak, but over-all, it isn't that bad. I saw it on AMC, and enjoyed it, but I don't think I would buy it, when there are so many other great old movies out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark Corner...Good Show.","review":"William Bendix plays \\"White Suit\\" Reed Hadley the cop and Clifton Webb is terrific again as a heavy \\" Cathcart\\"Lucy was always alluring and by now a solid performer.

First of all it is a great oldie. Black & White & the cast was wonderful. Clifton Webb makes the best bad guy. & William Bendix also makes a good bad guy. Lucy was a little out of it like the other email said but she was still good. And I loved the ending. Great pay back"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Noir Bad Transfer","review":"This is a good easy to follow story without many surprises. It is interesting to see Lucille Ball out of her comedic role, as it is to see William Bendix as a heavy. The disappointment is the poor transfer from film to DVD. If you can get over many sections of the film with the characters heads cut off or the characters out of sight to the sides of the film you might find this film enjoyable--it needs to be redone the right way, even the low price doesn't merit this kind of treatment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Film Noir","review":"This movie picks up after awhile, slow to start. Lucille Ball and Mark Stevens give lackluster performances. On the otherhand, Clifton Webb and William Bendix are great and the story picks up with these characters.

At CostCo they're priced at $14 for 8 bulbs or <$2/bulb (my reason for the 1 star for the Amazon purchase). The manufacturer of these bulbs is Feit Electric. These are really more equivalent to a 50W to 55W bulb. As for the delay in turning on... Well, these are flourescent and they will take almost a second to turn on! They do not have to heat up a tungsten filament, they have to supply a high initial starting voltage to excite the gas and then reduce the voltage while maintaining a constant current. A cold environment will make these more difficult to turn on (if they turn on at all). My ref: Electronic Ballast designer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fl bulbs","review":"Why not? Save money.

I know I may have to refill my ink cartridges a bit more often but I mainly use my printer for online reciepts, news letters and emails so I should be fine.

I used the crimp method, wrapped the whole thing in electrical tape to prevent wires exposure due to rubbing, connected the black ground cable to a bold under the dash and I was done. A wonderful fit.

Of course if you do not have a manufacturer installed amp. then you will be fine. Or you can use this one and then buy the second piece separately (MI03B).

Now Christopher Hibbert has done a fine job of stripping away the stereotype and showing us the true Alexandrina Victoria with all her emotions intact. This is indeed a personal biography, so you won't find a lot of information on the great political and social issues of her reign, but there are plenty of sources available for them if you want them.

Movies about precocious children are horrifying and awful. Somehow Wes Anderson can pull these off, but he gives us characters who are quirky. Everyone else spews out quirks that are embodied by characters and call it a day.This movie is possibly the most egregious example of this atrocity. There is not one believable character, emotional moment or joke told well. This movie simply gives us a kid who is supposedly a genius but comes off like a pompous jerk and a lot of flashbacks to the time when his mother watched her mother burn to death at a birthday party.The fire death and its reference encapsulate this movie. The scene is played for laughs and yet it is referenced so much that it's supposedly a deep seated trauma instead of a lame joke."},{"rating":"1","title":"just no good","review":"wanted to like it, but it was just no fun to watch and the acting was wooden at best. oh well"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ms. Adam","review":"The ring is beautiful, but I think it is not for an adult.

It was not written by him and it does not reflect him as the keen wit or comedic genius he was. Why anyone would want to cheapen Chapman's memory with a poorly edited, ghost-written collection featuring bits of his worst material as well as completely fabricated material I do not know. It clearly isn't making them much money. I am not sure why this is not illegal.I also find it terribly low and dispicable that the author is clearly reviewing his own book. Do take a look; it's fairly obvious. I also noticed on another book by this author he had his own relative \\"reviewing\\" the book thus again upping the number of stars one sees when browsing for books.

The book gives a more dark look at the famous comedy troupe, and even darker look at Graham himself. Great for the Python lover or the Monty Python learner. He only downsides are that it's short, and one or two stories ramble on to no result. Warning: basic information about Monty Python is needed to understand this book.

If your idea of medieval dance music is the stuff usually done in the SCA then you will hate this album.do they use period instruments? yes.But the songs themselves are neither pleasant to listen to nor match anything you're used to in the SCA.There's no bransles, no pavanes, none of the stuff you're likely to hear at a dance practice or event.The music is not especially festive or fun. It's not especially dancable for any form of dancing I know.At best you might like these pieces as feast background music--or a formal concert of scholarly works.It's not light, easy listening for the casual person.The title of this album really doesn't match my scheme of what medieval music is nor dance music.

The quality of the outgoing voice from the microphone is also acceptable...when it works.The \\"when\\" is the problem. This headset effectively operates the way a speakerphone does with a noise canceling feature that often cancels out MY voice as I'm trying to speak on the phone. Because the unit provides no feedback when you're talking, you can't tell what has been heard and what hasn't been heard until you figure it out from long pauses when the other party doesn't reply...or when they ask if you're still there.If it weren't for the poor microphone/noise canceling design, this probably would have been a decent product."},{"rating":"1","title":"*sigh*","review":"This is a very solid headset for the price it is offered at.

It ran with top notch special effects and a well-selected cast. Though a great fan of DS9, ST:Voyager had a compelling storyline with a twist, a female captain, Katherine Janeway . This concept broke the old Star Trek mold by proving that a woman can be as \\"cowboy\\" as Jim Kirk, as \\"eloquent\\" as Jean-Luc Picard, and as \\"unyielding\\" as Benjamin Sisco. Season One lands the crew of the Intrepid-Class explorer Starship in the depths of the Delta Quadrant after an encounter with a space anomaly while chasing down the Maquis. This season is mostly about the integration and initial difficulties that a ship built for only 6 month deployments has to face over 75 years from home.

I like most of the Trek stuff, but the cost is outrageous. Given the cost, I am more inclined to start my SG-1 collection. I am currently buying the Buffy and Highlander disk sets for $45 and $59 respectively, and I keep passing up the Next Generation and Deep Space Nine sets because of the cost.

All of my Voyager dvd's play flawlessly so maybe Paramount has figured out their dvd replication problems.I've decided to buy all of the Voyager series used and i'm glad the first season is readily available...the 109 dollar price tag for a new first season set is ridiculous for only a dozen or so episodes.Also, I agree that the packaging is is as clunky and difficult to manage as the DS9 packaging although I really like the look.Other than that, the first season stories are a great start to a great series and I would definitely recommend it for any serious star trek fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horrible packaging, but Kate Mulgrew is worth it!","review":"If it weren't for the packaging, I'd have given this set 5 stars. It's terrible, but then the series never really seemed to be supported by TPTB as it's predecessors, TNG & DS9 so the tacky packaging should come as no surprise.It is a lot of money for 15 episodes, but remember that the first season started in January and that a couple of the episodes were held until the fall, starting with the 37's.I've not seen the special features yet, but from what I read on the box, it's well worth waiting, esp. any new footage featuring Kate Mulgrew! I look forward to seeing the next full season on DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"A look back from the originals aired","review":"It was interesting to take a look back on who was the original Executive Officer (Lieutenant Commander Cavit), the original Chief Medical Officer (Lieutenant Commander Fitzgerald) and the original helmsman (Lieutenant Stadi) since the characters died on the pilot episode and we all forgotten about them. Still, we never knew who was the original Chief Engineer."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Series","review":"I did not get into Voyager until the 5th season thanks to my sister persistance I gave in. The series in general is great. However the plastic covering is a little Lame, but you cant get everything we want i will contitue to get the series i already have 5 out of 7 of TNG (Season 1,4-7)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Expensive for a 5-Disk Set","review":"I've been looking forward to this DVD set for years. The Voyager series is my second favorite after the Original series. All of the Star Trek DVD's have been a little high priced compared to other series and DVD packages with a few exceptions....the Special Editions of the Star Trek movies were a pleasant surprise. I noticed on Amazon's details section for this set it never did mention how many disks were included....only the small number of episodes 16....(compared to other TV series). Well after a trip to Wal-Mart the answer is 5-disks for $98 plus tax. A price of $75 for the smaller number of disks would have been fair. I will wait for the first season to drop in price before I buy. I certainly hope the later seasons are not even more expensive for the additional number of disks. The artwork on the back of the first set shows the other six seasons with probably 7 disks apiece. Thanks to Amazon for beating Wal-Mart's price but still too high for now."},{"rating":"1","title":"The cost is TOO HIGH","review":"I loved the boxed set. I bought it a Walmart for 10.00 not the cost that Amazon charges. How can the ask us to pay so much for this set and all the rest?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I'm a big fan of this series, but I came to it late. Fortunately, that was well after this collection of stinkers aired. There are barely a handful of episodes with anything approaching original plots or concepts. Unless you are a diehard fan who'll watch anything as long as the characters wear Starfleet uniforms, I suggest you skip ahead to the fourth season or later."},{"rating":"2","title":"As always, Star Trek done right","review":"Voyager was my favorite of all the Star Trek series, and I've waited three years for this DVD set. This series started out with a bang, with the characters meshing immediately. The writing for Voyager was always top shelf. The extra features make this collection more interesting (especially when you see the producers' FIRST PICK for the character Janeway!) Believe me, it wouldn't have been the same show without Kate Mulgrew.All in all, I'd say this is as well done as it gets."},{"rating":"1","title":"Star Trek Voyager Season 1","review":"Much too expensive for the way this collection was packaged. The first season of Voyager shows the great vision that Gene Roddenberry had with his first original series, but Paramount is just seeking to milk as much money from the loyal viewers as possible. The cheap cover and lack of pamphlets make this a shameful release. Compared to the Stargate SG-1 releases, which are way more reasonable and much better packaged, the only reason I bought this was because Amazon's price was more reasonable than retail stores."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good show but horror price..","review":"i like this show even though i have no chance to watch entire series, but few episodes are enough for me to dig in.. However, the price just enough to keep people away.. even with the most popular show on air now also no price this high.. i am very disappointed that i must hold off my hand on this series until reasonable price been reach.. too bad for a good show that cannot reach every people due to the price.. shame.. shame.."},{"rating":"1","title":"ST Voyager 1st episode","review":"The audio and video were out of sync.

Is it really the space needed for that? I know, it's a fact, that we unfortunately have to live with that, but so I'm going to wait another couple of months to wait for region 2 with hopefully english, french _and_ german on one single DVD (set). (The region wouldn't be a problem though..)And I have to agree on the other comment, that it's still most too expensive. Would also pay a maximum of 50,- for one season.W."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great non trekkie series","review":"Great series. Pretty cheesy, but fun to watch. Not a huge star trek fan. I only got into it because I got sick and watched way too much tv and they re ran voyager pretty often. I enjoy it. Pretty safe for non-trekkies."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is what I have been waiting for!","review":"At last, Voyager on DVD! This is, to me, the best of all the Star Trek series (except for the current Enterprise, which is excellent and getting better every week). I've always loved strong women and Janeway is a great character played by a great actress.Now, for the price... I think the price is well worth it for what you are getting. Sure, it was a short season, but it was a great season. And the extras on this set makes the price more than worth it. I never thought I would ever see Bujold clips that were filmed. The angels must have smiled when Bujold quit because I can't imagine anyone but Mulgrew playing Janeway.All the characters were great, and the story lines were thought provoking and exciting. This is a show I can watch over and over and over.(...).Thank you Paramount for finally releasing the BEST Trek series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Show Ever Created","review":"This is not only the best Star Trek series, but it is in my opinion the best show ever created. I love this show (all seven seasons) more than most anything in life. If I were born and then watched Voyager, I would consider my life to be complete and fulfilled. I simply love it that much. I can't imagine any other show that has ever been or ever will be created that can top Voyager. Plot, character development, cast, writing, and graphics (for the time) are all perfect. One must see STV at some point in his or her life in order to have truly lived."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop the greed!","review":"I really enjoyed this series, but >$100.00? You have got to be kidding me! That is just incredibly greedy."},{"rating":"1","title":"what *!@)$& invented this packaging?!?!","review":"I have all the other Star Trek DVDs and couldn't wait for Voyager. I haven't seen the DVDs yet, but the packaging is absolutely unacceptable! It's flimsy (the thickness of throw-away \\"bubble-pack\\"), takes too many steps to take it apart, doesn't protect the DVDs properly, and is overall the stupidest thing I've ever seen. Whoever invented it should be fired and whoever made the administrative decision to use it should be boiled in oil! BOO!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Neelix...oh noes?","review":"So is Neelix like the Jar Jar Binks of Star Trek, well actually he came before Jar Jar *nightmarish flashbacks*...why does he even exist?! Oh but that's just a minor issue I have so far with this series. This episode was excellent, already the captain is turning out to be much more interesting that I had anticipated. Janeway seemed a bit stiff and plain in the first few episodes, but now I see that the writers have much more planned for her. And the crew that supports her seems just as varied, I can already see the relationships, fights, and comradery that will occur in future episodes. I'm excited to see how Voyager stacks up to DS9 and TNG :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Star Trek Voyager","review":"I have the full series on DVD, but since they are not HD they look good on my HD TV.I also have Netflix, again ok.On Amazon streaming there is an HD option, and the series looks great."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lake House Wormhole","review":"This series has a lot to it, and great character development is one of its great attributes. There's a tiny wormhole to home! Can it get the crew back? (Of course not, we're in the first half of the first season). Good try though. I give this episode a solid 4.0/5 Stars. ~Keep On Trekkin'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Voyager, just wasn't all that good.","review":"I would seriously stay away from this show if I were you. It started out promising, but the writers just didn't know how to take it to the next level, and so it stayed just a mediocre show. I have to admit, I just stopped watching around 4th season or so, it just got so boring...and I'm a complete Trek fan, I grew up on Star Trek, but Voyager just bored me to tears. I would still catch it every now and then, if I just happened to be flipping through channels and there was nothing better on, but I wouldn't make it a point to watch every single episode like I did with TNG or DS9. But anyways, that's my opinion, is that it is not worth your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Voyager","review":"Voyager is by far the worst Star Trek series. It started out ok but quickly went downhill. No amount of Jeri Ryan's t&a; could save it. To post this I had to give it at least a 1 star rating. The show doesn't deserve that.If you want to see the best Star Trek series, go check out DS9. If you can't get that, then go watch the original series, or TNG, or even Enterprise. But please don't waste your time on Voyager.Trust me, you will regret it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Death of the Franchise","review":"Fans of \\"Voyager\\" must have spent the years of the Original Series, \\"Next Generation,\\" and \\"Deep Space 9\\" living in a cave. \\"Voyager\\"'s consistently miserable writing, mediocre effects, miserable writing, uninteresting/poorly developed characters, and miserable writing ruined the \\"Star Trek\\" franchise for good. No wonder \\"Nemesis\\" and \\"Enterprise\\" fared so poorly!Paramount could give me these DVDs for free and I still wouldn't want them."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Feds get a taste of their own medicine","review":"The Prime Directive doesn't look so perfect from the other side, in this case the Feds are the primitive culture who so badly needs that sweet sweet technology :D I started watching this series almost a year ago, and gave up after the first 3 episodes...thought it was boring, I didn't like Janeway, and I hated Neelix. Now I'm glad my friend convinced me to give it a second chance...coming off watching DS9 it's refreshing to see Star Trek happen on a starship again!! The crew, Janeway, and the plot is really growing up me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I Just like it","review":"This episode is interesting both from an \\"interacting with other races\\" and a \\"sci fi tech\\" Perspective.. I liked it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mulgrew and Crew: 'A gift that keeps on giving'.","review":"Like all good art, this just series just gets better with time. Kate Mulgrew and the team slaved physically and intellectually to keep up 18 hour days demanded in filming. In between, memorizing and grasping the sense of the highly challenging \\"techno-babble\\" as Kate Mulgrew calls it in interview and goes on to describe as Shakespearean at times in its complexity for an actor - only then to deliver the rich language both seamlessly and organically, moreover nobly and sensitively, producing the incredible result that speaks for itself and thankfully can be enjoyed just as well today. A supreme and unparalleled achievement. Even better in the re-watch for someone who only caught the occasional episode when first aired. Great to see it on Amazon Prime. (ps. cannot resist adding, I named my dog Janeway, also an escape artist.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"We should brush up on our ancient earth culture, we are about to meet our history!","review":"Voyager comes across a trail of rust and hydrocarbon vapors in space. They find an old earth truck floating in space, how did it get into the Delta Quadrant? It is a 1936 Ford pickup truck. The truck starts on the first try and Paris turns on the radio and it picks up an SOS code. They track the source of the signal and they go to that planet to see what is going on.....This is actually my favorite episode since the first one titled the Caretaker. I found it well written and the storyline was interesting and provocative to my imagination. I do wish that there had been more time so we could have seen more details of what they had found on the planet and when you watch this episode you will understand why. This was a good plot and it was well presented. I recommend it to you as a good episode to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"The begining of the end for Trek...","review":"Voyager is the Trek where the producers stopped taking chances with stories and characters and started the downward spiral of the franchise as a whole.Unlike the excellent DS9, which pushed the boundries of what Trek was, Voyager was content to play things safe and dumb things down, turning Trek from an interesting exploration of the Human condition into a mindless action/T&A; show.Character development became virtually non-existant and thoughtful stories were few and far inbetween.That being said, I would probably give the first season another star (maybe even two) if it weren't so expensive. Paramount is charging the same price for Voyagers first SIXTEEN EPISODE season that they did for the 26 episode seasons of TNG and DS9."},{"rating":"1","title":"So very disappointing.","review":"This show is an incredible disappointment. After the brilliance of TNG, this is just terrible.To be fair, it's not completely the writers' fault either. The actors in this show are just....terrible. TERRIBLE! (Neelix and the doctor are played by decent actors, but their characters are chalkboard-gratingly annoying. Especially Neelix.) This show is so poorly cast as to make it unwatchable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Predictable","review":"Everything in this show is 100% predictable. I predicted everything before it happened. Star Trek: The Next Generation and The original Series are good, but this and Star Trek: Enterprise are an insult the the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"C'Mon People","review":"Voyager sucked harder than a hull breach on Deck 5!!!Can anyone honestly say they felt like they got to know any of the characters in their seven year \\"journey\\"?Did the crew learn anything on their voyage except that every space-faring race in the Delta-Quadrant always happened to have spare dilithium and deuterium when they were running out?Far-scape and Babylon 5 are much better written. As a matter of fact, I'd love to see Lameway and her crew go toe to toe with the Shadows any day!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great series, terrible box!!","review":"Voyager was never my favorite ST show. It always seemed like ST lite. but it was still pretty good compared to Enterprise, and also Nemesis, (which was just awful). Voyager always reminds me of the line for Indiana Jones and the last crusade, when Indy snr says to 'junior' \\"just as you got interesting, you left...\\"Anyway, I will be buying this series, but what has Paramount done with the box - it looks awful! - cheap and in day-glo orange!! - I don't understand why we in the US don't get the same super-cool sleek boxes that they have in Europe... I bought TNG and DS9 from Amazon.co.uk, they have the really cool hard plastic space boxes.... It's a US show, how come we don't get the good stuff!!! - come on Paramount!!!

I refuse to believe the archaic pricing plan for these DVD's. With shows like Buffy and 24 releasing DVD sets with almost twice as much content for $50.00, it is hard to stomach this. Paramount's special feature list is never interesting anyway. I suppose if you like the show you have no choice, which is the unfortunate aspect of our buisness structure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Voyager","review":"For a pilot, I thought it was pretty good. It will take time to develop the characters, but Muldrew is definitely easy on the eyes, has a gravelly voice reminds me of Kathryn Hepburn. She is a little too stiff in this episode, but it's the first time out in her role as Captain. I don't know who the blonde was, but she is drop dead gorgeous. I have never seen any of this series, so anxious to see where it goes. The sound is excellent, unlike many other shows I have watched on Amazon. Wish they had CC though. For a first show, I would have to give it a five star rating, hope I won't be disappointed in what comes next."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Packaging","review":"I have seen better packaging on pirated software from Hong Kong. The package opens awkwardly. The discs have no printing, so fingerprints all over them almost immediately. The epsiode titles are hard to read. No cover over disc one. The discs slide into the outer package, so if you don't do it just right they catch on the inner lip of the case and you have to make a major effort to get them in the box. Much like the DS9 discs, the inner DVD trays are held together with a piece of clear plastic tape. Truly sad. Good show. Great show. But packaging is F minus all the way. Bend over, here comes Voyager on DVD . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Y U NO SHOW CITIES?!","review":"Here's the bottom line: stop reading this and WATCH IT ALREADY!This one is a no brainier really; it's just that good. I've found out what I love most about Star Trek: every episode is a mini mystery. And this episode kept me guessing and kept proving me wrong when I tried to predict where it was going. Really strong writing and acting here too. Only downside was they didn't have the budget to show us the cities :(Also, I must admit when I first read the synopsis I was like \\"oh no a corny roswell type episode\\" but it's so much more than that and I have no doubt this will go down as one of my favorites of this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great episodes, but the presentation is appalling","review":"I am a huge Star Trek fan and I consider Voyager a worthy part of the Star Trek universe. While the first season cannot compare to later seasons, I still found it very interesting and enjoyable. Anyone who considers themselves a serious trekkie must include Voyager in their collection.My reason for giving this one star is because of its appalling presentation. Sadly again, Paramount has let its US fans down in terms of the design of the boxsets as well as the discs themselves. The discs have absolutely no design printed on it. It's just a plain disc. The boxset while it's an improvement from those of the cardboard types for TNG, is still a far cry from the plastic boxsets from the UK version. Furthermore, there is no pamphlet included in the boxset unlike those of the TNG version."},{"rating":"1","title":"not at this price","review":"I'd love to collect the Voyager DVD's, but I can't justify spending $90 for 15 episodes.

I have always been interested in female involvement in World War I, and this book tells in a very accessible way what it was like to be in the \\"Forbidden Zone\\" during this truly horrific war. It reminds me of Trumbo's Johnny Got His Gun in that we see the VAD's struggling to keep their sanity in terrible circumstances. Well worth reading."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful!","review":"The fact that my daughter enjoyed this book, should say something about its interest level!

However, I was really disappointed with this one. If you expect a traditional Heyer novel, you also will not like it very much. The story is boring and I really had a hard time continuing the book. However, if you're intersted in history, and especially in English history at Lord Wellington's time then you probably will enjoy the novel very much, because Heyer gives a very specific account of the war on the Iberian peninsula against the French. Nervertheless, it is not a novel that I would recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I've tried twice to read this book.

It is the Napoleonic era, and the war on the Peninsula is making widows and orphans. One such orphan finds her destiny with an audacious British officer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry Georgette!","review":"This is the first book by Georgette Heyer that I have NOT enjoyed. It was only a couple of months ago that I discovered Georgette Heyer and fell in love with every one of the seven novels I've read so far, well until \\"The Spanish Bride\\" that is. I completely agree with the review by Michele and wish Id read her review before opening \\"TSB\\", the only consolation was that I borrowed it from my local library so I didnt waste a penny on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The story of Ladysmith","review":"Georgette Heyer went all out for historical detail in this book. If you don't like battles esp without maps, this is not the book for you. The historical romantic novel is mostly historical, not as much romance as I expected. But it fits in with some other books I am reading, which have maps of the battles, so I am enjoying it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice and study","review":"What can you say about a tool bag? However, the fabric on this one appears to be 'sturdy' and should hold up well. However, unlike the photo on the webpage that makes it appear that you get a 'chasm' of storage area, you actually lose 'somewhat' of the useable space when you zipper-it-up, and it collapses down to an almost 'pyramid' shape near the TOP portion of the bag. But it still has a good deal of useable storage.

It had been stolen from my car in a smash and grab. I was happy to finally replace it and not rely on the little towel set up that I came up with. Within a week the suction mount has ceased to...suck. Or rather, it does suck, but not in the way intended. It just keeps falling off after 3 min of press down. I do not keep it on when I leave the car so as to avoid another theft and excess heat. I am disappointed, but It has to be a \\"one off\\" defect as this model mount had worked well in the past.

The last few trips I would get it to stick on the windshield of my Honda CRV but as I started driving it would fall off. I had a garmin a few years back that would do the same thing. You would think that they would improve the suction as the they improve the technology. I guess not. I am looking for other options for mounting my GPS in my car. I otherwise love my Garmin Nuvi.Update to review: I have since bought the dash sandbag gps holder and it is only thing that I have found that keeps the GPS in place and not falling out of sight and also can be moved around easily as needed.

However, the 12V car adapter and the Suction Cup Unit {power end) are a different story. Much care must be taken when using these items especially by car users who install and remove the NUVI frequently in their vehicles. As you will note from the previous reviews the non NUVI attachments are very prone to break and mine have had to be replaced as well. The replacement suction cup mount and car charger are thankfully not that expensive. My power cable partially detached from the mounting unit, the suction cup holder inner part broke and would not hold the NUVI in place and the 12V plug-in detached in the cigarette lighter socket blowing the car fuse and taking the detached end out destroyed my cigarette lighter socket as it had jammed there.The unit is treated with care as I use it for both city and long distance traveling and its use is essential to me. Good luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works for the Nuvi 650 as well","review":"Bought this as a replacement for my new Garmin Nuvi 650 suction mount that got stolen.

Though the lessons look like they have had a lot of thought put into them,(the author did well) it is fairly text heavy and I'll admit I prefer a layout with more images to a wall of text. Also, in my opinion, the printing quality is poor. I could not make out some of the images in the book I received -- because most were dark and smudgy! For a book about the visual arts, this is most unfortunate. At the very least, a new print run lightening up the images (see page 142, for example) would improve it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Have","review":"I own this book I'm a artist and I am working towards my teaching degree this book is great as far as blending academics with the arts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not keeping with the title...","review":"This book was written for a University Professor, not a busy public school-teacher, with freshman-college-aged students, not little kids.

I caught them live several times as the backing band for Yes and Jethro Tull. I do not know why they call this release a box set. It does have 2 CD's, however it is packaged in a single cd sized holder (wheres the box?) These are live recordings from the BBC, the first CD was recorded in '73, the other CD was recorded in '78. I was hoping to replace my old scratched up LP's with this, but it is no substitute for the studio versions. I would only suggest purchasing this CD if you already own Free Hand, Power and he Glory, etc. and want to hear what this band can do live. Some of the songs are not the best, there is even microphone feedback. This CD does not capture the true live quality of the band.

I don't have it unfortunately. The authors say that knowing Photoshop would be \\"helpful\\"; I suspect it's required in order to do the digital printing described here.

Explanations are thorough and understandable and beautifully illustrated with masterful works of art by the three authors. Perhaps best of all there is an excellent index, glossary, and resources section listing specific companies, addresses, phone numbers and websites for finding materials. It is in my opinion, one of the very best books of it's kind that I have ever seen in a long career as a printmaker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Only Book of Its Kind","review":"This is a great book for those exploring new options for printing digital photos and artwork.

Dense with information about the planning and machinations of putting this extraordinary musical together from 1969 to '73. We get a real insider view of the recording industry at the time, and their trepidation at backing such a monumental and controversial project. Author Ellis Nassour had unique access to Rice and Webber, and their many quotes and opinions fill the 242 pages. Refreshingly, it is not a hagiography, so explores the frustrations and missteps along the journey from hit single to the bizarre Broadway production. An interesting inclusion is a detailed account of the staging of that Broadway production, scene-by-scene. Packed with never-before-seen b&w photographs, this is a rich record of this phenomenon of the 1970s. I cannot imagine anyone who loves this unique Rice/Webber concoction not loving and cherishing this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Attention, fake!","review":"Instead of \\"6 (SIX) DVDs Gift Edition\\" I have received 5 (FIVE) ordinary (definitely not \\"Gift Edition\\") disks, kind you can buy for 15-17$, and what is especially lovely, to buy them from the same seller.

That disc is getting hard to find, so this will do nicely for those who want the BBC Prims sessions. Unfortunately there are no credits in the booklet apart from the song titles and some liner notes from Paul Court, so it's not immediately apparent that these are the BBC tracks. But they are. The cover is way cooler than the original (I didn't like the balloons) - the same photo from the original CD but made to look psychedelic. It kind of looks like the Lazy record sleeves the Primitives first put out. So in short it's a stripped down version of Bubbling Up but at least these tracks are readily available again. Buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Never really gets into you","review":"I bought the soundtrack as a Marilyn Manson fan, but i was dissapointed. The real highlight is Manson's cover of Suicide Is Painless, a track that sounds pretty dark and depressing and is actually very emotional. The rest of the CD is as forgettable as the movie - although that Dark chick is really beautiful, but that doesn't make a movie -. Godhead's song is OK but nothing quite exceptional.

POD and Project86 are both Hard Hitting Christian bands while Rob Zombie and Marilyn Manson are...well...the opposite. It was weird hearing \\"upbeat\\" (if I can call it that) songs like Lie Down, and then listening to Manson. I was slightly shocked at the way the bands went together. Altogether, the album went along with the movie fairly well. You had the goth/satanic music that went well with the theme, and then you had this Christian music that....well...didn't.

Their choice of locations is always right on the money. If you're going to be in DC for less than a week, you can't go wrong by sticking with the sites in the guide.

I've spent countless ours adjusting the tensiona nd re-adjusting the tension only to give up. I've spent more time than anyone should on the phone with Singer or writing back and forth to them. I've cleaned it, maintained it and even had it serviced by an authorized Singer dealer. They agree it is a piece of work. There are superior machines in the same price range by other manufaturers.

Surely the developers of this game fell asleep when they played it ... or maybe no-one gave it a test-run !"},{"rating":"1","title":"Six and three quarters?

I will not believe that this is something JKR approved of. (Did you warn her when she gave movie rights?) The game(s) are insulting to anyone with any IQ over three, but the simplicity of the games is only understood if you can wade your way through the instructions.

The boards don't quite match, the games are too simplistic for even small children - most of whom have not read the book - and the pieces seem cheap.

I may just have to recycle it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The game","review":"The game was not the greatest ever, it had its ups and its downs. The instructions were very confusing, we had a few laughs because the instructions were so confusing we really did not know what to do. It was a little fun at first, but then it sort of dragged on. Towards the end it was just kinda like \\"IS THE GAME ALMOST OVER!\\" But then again it was sort of suspensful which was why we did not stop playing. It can help you learn to eliminate things. I would give this game 2-2 and a half stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rushed to Market with Poor Instructions","review":"The Harry Potter name and books are magical. The game should be too, but it's not. The game consists of challenges (or games within the game), each with it's own set of poorly written instructions. For most of these mini-games, we needed to make up numerous rules along the way, because the instructions are simply insufficient. As a result, players will spend more time reading and interpreting the rather lengthly instruction manual, than they ever will spend playing the game. The six challenges range from fairly standard memory or matching games to modified chess. My guess is that most people will begin wondering early on \\"when will this game ever end\\" and once it ends exile it to the game closet to gather dust. My bottom line is - keep reading the books but don't buy the game."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Low Cal Truffle","review":"As a Physician and Surgeon - I am very concerned with the physical fitness of my patients.

Tried manually to get the timer working by turning the knob back to beginning and setting it again, sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't, I figure it will be just a matter of time before it quits working altogether.Makes lots of crackling and clicking noises while it is heating up and cooling down.Feels cheap and tinny, it's going back to the store tomorrow.Just another piece of junk from China."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap plastic--not a toaster.","review":"Ugh!

Now, we are at the lightest setting and still it is almost too dark. Additionally, I believe the toasting setting relies on reaching a certain internal temperature and then stops the cycle. We have noticed that after one item is toasted, the subsequent item will not toast adequately on one or even 2 cycles. The toaster shuts off too quickly. You must toast it minimum 3 times.Lastly, and most disappointingly, the included pan rusts!!! We had noticed this ~ 9 months into ownership. It started as one small area and was not a big deal. Now however, the rust is most everywhere on the pan itself. Poor alloy, poor us. Our ownership experience has left a lot to be desired. This likely will be our last Cuisinart product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Where did the buttons go?","review":"I do love my toaster oven! The only reason I give it four stars is because the other model of the same toaster oven I had before this one (lasted 3yrs. used almost everyday, many times a day) had two buttons at the bottom instead of a dial. You could stop your toasting if you were finished. Now I have to wait till the little dial timer is done ticking. I mean I can get to my stuff and get it out, it's just the fact that it's still heating. Overall it does the job."},{"rating":"1","title":"This toaster oven is junk...and dangerous","review":"I bought this Cuisinart toaster oven because I've had a Cuisinart coffee maker for years and thought that another appliance by Cuisinart would be a good product. I used this toaster oven barely four months when the top heating element shorted out, causing a sparking and gray smoke to come out of the top vents. I continued to use it, but without the two top heating elements working it's basically useless. It's a piece of junk, totally abysmal quality. I will continue my search for a good quality toaster oven that's made in the USA (if anyone reading this review has any brand suggestions I would welcome them), and needless to say I wasted my money on a Cuisinart toaster oven. I didn't want to rate this with any stars, but Amazon insisted on a rating, so one star it is."},{"rating":"1","title":"This toaster is possessed!","review":"We had this toaster for less than a year. It worked well at first, we used it mainly for toasting, but then after a while it would only work sporadically. Then every so often it would just start beeping while in the off position and I would have to unplug it to get it to stop. Finally, when I tried to broil some fish in it and realized the broil function no longer worked, I decided to take it back to BB&B. I exchanged it for the same model, thinking I had gotten a lemon, but I am so glad I decided to read some reviews on it. Seeing that most people have had the same problems, I returned it tonight and got a different (and more expensive but way cool) model that received rave reviews without one complaint about sparks. I have three young boys; I'm busy as it is trying to keep my house from burning down. I don't need to add a toaster oven to my list of hazards."},{"rating":"1","title":"a new complaint","review":"I bought this about a year and a half ago. Finally thought I had found a well-made oven. It works well except recently the toaster tends to turn off prematurely. I just noticed yesterday that the paint on the back of the interior has blistered and is flaking off. Nice, I thought. I wonder how long I've been toasting paint with our food. I did e-mail Cuisinart and received a call back (which I was not home for). Not sure if I want a replacement if they offer one. I'm starting to feel that finding a good, well-made toaster oven is not a reality anymore. Everything seems so marginally made, even if you spend a significant price.April 13. Called Cuisinart and they offered a replacement. Now I have to ship the old one back. I accepted the offer for a new one as I don't see anything new on the market to purchase other than the Breville, which is larger than I want or need (and pricey for what I would use it for)."},{"rating":"1","title":"dangerous junk","review":"Had this given to us, no receipt, less than 6 months, won't shut off.Better to put this in the trash than burn down the house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unreliable, potentially unsafe.","review":"We've had similar problems with our Cuisinart TOB-30W as the other reviewers. We owned our first unit for two years before it started crackling and sparking when we turned it to Bake. Then it finally stopped working. Cuisinart replaced it with a brand new unit that lasted only one year before it started doing the same. They told us the three year warranty was not renewed when we received the new unit, so now they aren't able to help us. It appears that we're probably safer without the toaster oven based on the other reviews here."},{"rating":"1","title":"worked great for awhile","review":"I bought this last year for a summer cabin, so it has only been used periodically over a total span of six months. Suddenly the thing refuses to turn off. We noticed this when the smoke alarm went off last night! It only turns off when unplugged. Not only that, the top unit stopped working completely so all we can do is bake. It was great while it lasted, but I read these same complaints in other reviews so this is evidently a glitch in this particular model. I don't recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wish I had read reviews before buying","review":"It is working after approximately 2 years. Still it is a clunker. The markings wipe off the knobs with a finger's touch, obscuring the temperature or function. Cuisinart is willing to send new knobs, but the old ones do not appear to be removable without removing the entire panel, which does not appear to be easy.Somehow I was expecting more from the brand name \\"Cuisinart\\". It sounds French but is made in China.The oven door is in jeopardy, and feels like it may come off. It is not flush. A strange buzzing sound sometimes emits when the item remains plugged into the wall and not being used.I guess I was expecting it to be a higher quality than it actually is.

I took it apart to see why it was shorting out. I found that the knob that connects the circuit was made out of plastic and had melted. Thus, in a state of deformity no longer able to connect the circuit. This is what is happening with all of these reviews. Question: Why would a designer of a toaster oven that has a 500 degree setting make such an integral part out of plastic. Answer: to shave a few dollars off of production costs to squeeze out a little more for the bottom line. And on top of that, have it manufactured in a sweat shop in China. My grandpa has a toaster oven that over 30 years old that was made in America and it still works great.

It comes across as if Torie Clarke dictated the whole thing in one go with no planning or preparation.

If you would like to know more about Greek mythology, and especially if you want to know how the myths fit together, this book is highly recommended. Perhaps a bit dry at first, but it rapidly becomes more exciting as it progresses.

And that happened twice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Primeval psychology","review":"Sometimes we run across a book that makes a real difference at the way we look at the world, or at least at an area of our own world. This is one of them. A poetic run through all the myths of the Greeks results in us looking for the answers to the same questions, thousands of years later. And of course to think about what is the core of human nature and how come it has not changed that much after all. The book is well written and the translation superb. The read takes time because we must stop to think, we must go back to read, we need to understand. Reading this book is truly a journey of the mind, a journey that we can at any time go back to by picking up the book later and opening it at any chapter. And for the more practically inclined, it is a beautiful romp through Greek mythology, with interesting connections to history and psychology. You can't miss with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"An entertaining and insightful hoops book","review":"This was an enjoyable and insightful look into the Sacramento Kings. I was actually disappointed that the book was so short, but I'm sure this was done to not scare off sports fans who are afraid to pick up thick books. An extra hundred pages or so would have added more detail... but maybe that can be in a sequel. All told the stories were interesting and quite humorous. Reynolds also offers serious insight into the game itself and I especially enjoyed his take on the East Coast media \\"experts\\".If you're an old Kings fan you'll laugh out loud as names from the past refresh themselves. And if you're a newer fan who thinks 50 win seasons are not up to snuff then you owe it to yourself to pick this up to see how things used to be not so long ago. Overall it's a terrific book for a true hoops fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"A FUN AND ENTERTAINING RIDE THROUGH KINGS HISTORY","review":"I found this to be a quick and easy read. If you are a kings fan and have followed the team for any number of years you will see many familiar names throughout the book. From Reggie Theus to Jason Williams, it's all there. The best parts of the book focused on the numerous stories that documented how sad the kings really were from 1986 to 1998. New Kings fans willbe surprised at how far the kings have come in such a short period of time.Reynolds recalls the 2002 Lakers Kings playoff series with vivid detail, including his accounts of Game 5 and the infamousgame 7 at Arco Arena.It would have been nice to hear more stories but this is a fun, fast paced, and quick read.

It deserves a much wider audience. Visually it is absolutely stunning. The scenery, especially that of Moanin Meadow, always makes me yearn for summer in the Adirondacks. The color is rich and lends perfectly to the visual landscape. The narrative realizes the haunting quality of its story. Every performer in this film lends exceptional support to the drama. Beulah Bondi was never better and the always enjoyable Marc Lawrence is an absolute suprise, perfect in a part you would not associate him with. The theme music, later heard as a song sung by Fuzzy Knight, has a wonderfully sentimental quality. Sadly, this film is not available on dvd as of this writing. Get the vhs copy; it is worth it. Harry Carey, John Wayne, Betty Field, Marjorie Main, the whole cast all hit the target. It just renews my spirit every time I watch it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Movie","review":"I came across this movie by accident - and glad I did. If you're looking for a good John Wayne flick you might look elsewhere. What makes it special is the tenderness of Harry Carey, and other country folks, throughout the movie.

It's a wonder to me that Harold Bell Wright didn't file a lawsuit against the movie makers. The book is a true classic. It's wonderful!! Why Hollywood thought they could improve on that is beyond me. But, unfortunately, as is often true, they butchered a wonderful plot. If you've read the book, The Shepherd of the Hills, and love it, then don't waste your time buying or renting or borrowing this filmed version.

Add to this, incomprehensible rules, and 150 (someone was being too cute for words here) tiny, tiny tokens that conceal the Snitch.

All our other games and software work with the virus protection we have and I'm not going to go unprotected for one game."},{"rating":"1","title":"Narnia all over again...........","review":"This is a really boring game. There was never a time where this game really put me into the game. The graphics are pretty good, but the system requirements are outragis. so unless you have a pretty good machine don't buy this game. If you do have a pretty good machine and you liked Narina (the game) than you will probley like this game, if you didn't like narnia than don't get this game. Most pepole will not like this game. Nobody will like this game unless you have a gamepad. i would not recommend buying this game. it stinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT buy Eragon on the PC!!!","review":"Eragon on the pc is a direct console port! The mouse is NOT used in any way in this game. You cannot remap ANY of the controls. You are forced to use the WSAD commands and you cannot change these at all. You cannot even use the left mouse click to attack with a weapon! There is also no free look with the mouse, everything is 100% keyboard controlled. Even the menu is keyboard driven. This makes for a completely ruined pc gaming experience."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE!!!!","review":"Downright terrible. Lousy camera angles, no in depth story and if you don't have a gamepad for your PC for this, you are really screwed! Plus, you will be done in 4 to 5 hours maximum!!!Go online and GOOGLE reviews for this game and read them. Basically, here is all you need to know. A movie studio got the rights to this fabulous book, pressured a game developer to bang it out fast. Hence, you have a crappy game released well ahead of the movie just for the greed of making a buck and riding off the hype of the movie. Even on XBOX this thing plays terrible!Skip this and get Elder Scrolls 4 Oblivion or Dark Messiah if you want in depth, heavy adventure that will keep you going for months....at a lower price!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Eragon Game is just an ad","review":"This game is so boring.

Before I knew it, I had a new favorite author in my own personal pantheon. Fante has a underestimated place in California's literary canon--I can't help but think the best word for him is \\"juicy\\", as if the culture of early Los Angeles was thrown into a food processor, liquified, and drank straight-up. I owe thanks to Kordich for this knowledge.

However it is really poor quality and it definitely is not worth the money I spent. The doll is stuffed and has no support whatsoever. It is impossible to use this as a ventriloquist dummy because there simply isn't a way to support Slappy's body, hold his head and work the strings for his mouth at the same time. Slappy is made like a squishy pillow. The strings that make his mouth work or hard to pull. His clothing is cheap and his shoes do not stay on at all. Such a waste of money! Watching my son's excitement deflate within a minute of opening this long-awaited toy was hard. Do not buy this if you have any expectations at all of using it as a ventriolquist dummy. It is a stuffed toy, plain and simple and definitely not worth the price. It goes back tomorrow!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Fagile Slappy","review":"Dolls shoes come off all the time.

Just a stuffed doll with a string....","review":"I purchased this for my son for his 11th birthday. I was less than impressed when it arrived. I guess you don't get much for 30 bucks......All this toy is....is a stuffed doll with a string attached the the back of it's head. His clothes don't stay on (I finally pinned the pants to the shirt). His eyes are supposed to glow in the dark....but they don't. My son complained that he couldn't pull the string (to move the mouth) and hold the doll without having to put it in a head lock. I tried it and I couldn't pull the string without having to grab the doll by the head. This makes it pretty hard to play with it the way you would think you would with a Ventriloquist doll."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Dummy","review":"This dummy is in extremely poor quality. I purchased Slappy for my six-year-old son, and sure, he loves the thing, but it won't last him very long. It's not that he man-handles the dummy, either. To put things into perspective, this doll came with shoes--shoes that never stay on. The shoes need to be held up by rubber bands, otherwise they slide off very easily. In addition, the body can't hold the weight of the doll's gargantuan head, so it's always slouched over. Also, don't accidentally drop this thing on the floor--the paint is poor quality and it gets scuffed like you wouldn't believe."},{"rating":"1","title":"pants a saggin'","review":"...maybe pants that sag are fashonable with the hip hop generation, but slappy is not a hip hopper.as well, the pull string at the back of slappy's head is a poor design. i would think a better method for making slappy's mouth move could be achieved for a similar cost."},{"rating":"2","title":"My son loves it!","review":"My son really wanted this for his Birthday.

The other great thing about Amped is the ability to rip your own tunes to the hard drive of the Xbox and listen to them while you're playing the game. You can't do this with SSX Tricky. I'll be purchasing Amped for sure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't be tricked get amped","review":"I've found that Amped is a better game than SSXtricky. SSXtricky is hard to learn the controlls for. It seems very unrealistic. You can do four of five rodeos, where in amped you might be able to do two front flips. Also, you can hit a rail at 70mph which can't be done. I beleive that Amped has beter contolls, it's easy to learn but hard to master, while SSXtricky is hard to learn and play. Picked Amped it much more fun to play and with may levels to challange you.

Kate's mother, Cora, ran a successful boarding house, despite the handicap of a totally impractical dreamer of a husband who always had grandiose, get-rich-quick schemes for making money which inevitably failed. Kate married a small town lawyer and was happy enough until their second child was born mentally retarded. The marriage rapidly deteriorated as Kate devoted herself to caring for the child at home, neglecting her husband and other child. It's a story of just how tough a woman can be when needed, just to survive life with all of its tragedies and heartbreak. The indomitable spirit of this woman made me feel rather guilty as I'm sure that I'd never have the strength to forge ahead as she did without breaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Literary Novel","review":"Remnants of Glory is so beautifully written.

It is a compelling novel, written by a gifted story teller."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Who - 'The BBC Sessions' (MCA)","review":"A great compilation CD of the Who's repertoire,that's been culled from the BBC performance archives dating from 1965-73.Total of twenty-five songs with a running time of 71 minutes.One thing I really like about 'BBC Sessions' is that many of these tunes tend to sound a bit different from the original lp versions.With cuts like \\"My Generation\\",\\"Anyway,Anyhow,Anywhere\\",the James Brown rarity \\"Just You And Me,Darling\\",\\"Pictures Of Lilly\\",the Motown hit remake \\"Dancing In The Streets\\"(better than Van Halen's version)and a couple of my two all-time Who favorites \\"The Seeker\\" and \\"I'm Free\\".Another thing that I fully appreciate about this CD is that the announcer's chatter between songs,introducing the band is a bit less than OTHER 'BBC Sessions' releases I've heard.Recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Live ALBUM, No fat here, who in prime stride (1965-73)","review":"This album is the same as the USA released version, except for track 10 was added (man with money) so that there are 26 tracks. Otherwise, same track listing are in the same order.I got this album soley because these 25 tracks are one a cool \\"greatest hits\\" collection without trying. It was my perfect greatest hits CD for some of the older who tracks from 65-73. This is the who that I grew up with and loved. My alltime favorite track is THE SEEKER, which has a killer version available here. I also managed to pick up a bonus CD with this when it was released that had seven additional tracks that were recorded between 67-1970. If you need a good live album by this band of early stuff, this would be the one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who's Got Your Goat","review":"Well after hearing on the radio about the new Who BBC Sessions coming out I had to run out and buy it. Especially after I saw Relay, The Seeker, and Long Live Rock on it. Boy was I disappointed. The announcers are so annoying and the sound quality is quite bad in parts. Why can't MCA give us something worthwhile from this great band. I would love to see a special two cd set entitled \\"Lifehouse\\". Which has all the songs that were from that ill fated project which was trimmed down to become \\"Who's Next\\" and quite a few singles including \\"Relay\\" which now can only be gotten in a edited format on the Who's box set. Which by the way is a great waste also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Adequate performances...horrible sound","review":"Compared to the Jimi Hendrix BBC sessions, the sound quality of this disc is awful. It would have been nice if someone tried to engineer the existing tapes with some extra low-end and bass (like the Beatles BBC album), but for some reason, the engineers didn't. Perhaps the source tapes were a problem, but what were treated to is sharp and shrill early Who, with hardly evidence of John Entwistle at all. This is especially too bad since Pete Townshend hadn't yet developed his \\"over drive\\" guitar sound and it's a pretty big load for one guitar to handle. Roger Daltrey's vocals are only in the \\"so-so\\" category. The American bonus disc (from the Target store chain) is definitely not worth tracking down. Overall, the sound of The Who's BBC sessions is worse than the original US compact disc of the MY GENERATION album."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Kids Are Just OK, But The Completists Understand","review":"The sheer fact that these are genuine live Who tracks from the '60s & '70s means that lots of folks will need this CD. If you gotta, you gotta. But I think that six months from now, you will find this in abundance at your local used CD store, just like all those Beatles leftovers repackaged into \\"anthologies.\\" And yes, I'm a big fan of these guys.The BBC Sessions are mediocre in sound quality, and for the most part the versions do not improve on the already available (& better recorded) versions. Maybe \\"Shakin All Over\\" & \\"Relay\\" are different enough (in a good way) to justify this to obsessives, but even those are close calls.You really don't need this, but do what you gotta do."},{"rating":"1","title":"sound quality is bootleg at best","review":"I abosolutly love The Who.The BBC sessions are a very poor representation of this great band.The comentary between the songs further ruins the album.This one should have stayed in vaults.Get The Kids are alright sound track instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"You're going to buy it -- but that's a good thing","review":"If you're new to The Who or a casual listener, there's probably not much reason for you to start here. But remember this CD; you'll come back around to it eventually, after you've discovered that The Who is an entirely different band live, and that you can't live without knowing what every song sounded like out of the studio.If you're a Who fanatic/completist, there's no way you're going to bypass this disc -- and that's a good thing. Far from a slapdash assembly of whatever was left over from the last round of box sets and rereleases, the BBC sessions give you the Who's live energy, with relatively good sound quality (taking the sources into consideration). Taken as a whole, they give you some sense of the impact the band had when it originally exploded through the rock and roll of the day.Listening to it was sheer bliss; as close as I'll ever get to turning on the radio and discovering them again for the first time."},{"rating":"1","title":"doesn't last long enough to use professionally","review":"I got this for one of our field techs who needed a new battery but he told me that it runs down much sooner than Makita batteries.

In my class, I am learning how to use SPSS along with the statistics. I found this book to be a good supplement to my statistics textbook and it really helped me to interpret the SPSS output. The book also comes with a data CD. The data is used for examples and exercises in each chapter. Working through the examples and exercises really helps in learning SPSS. My only complaint is that only the even answers to the exercises are provided at the end of the book. I would have liked to have all the answers.In reference to the prior reviews, I agree this is not the appropriate book if you want to learn statistics. This book explains the broad concepts necessary to understand how to use SPSS. You still need a textbook to understand the math."},{"rating":"2","title":"Late Harvest by Yvonne Whittal (Harlequin Large Print)","review":"Description from the book back cover:Kate had intensely disliked Rhyno van der Bijl ever since she had known him, and he didn't seem to think any more highly of her - so how could she possibly contemplate being married to him? Yet, if she did not want to lose the home that meant everything to her, that was what she had to do. And meanwhile, what was she going to do about Gavin Page, who wanted to marry her himself and whom she would almost certainly have accepted? Still, she was only obliged to stay married to Rhyno for a year, and a lot could happen in that time!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best product for the purpose","review":"It works miracles. I've tried EVERYTHING with no result at all. My doctor was going to refer me to surgeon. But I did remember that three years ago this cream really helped me, it took me a while to find it again.

I have to admit that this guy has a lot of heart and meaning in his song writing. Most new artists have maby 2 songs on the whole cd that you can get into. Across The Moon is full of foot tappers and belly rubbers. I would put this one in your collection. I promise you that you wont be sorry that you did."},{"rating":"2","title":"SNAFU, I LIVED IT AND SURVIVED","review":"It wasn't until after I was discharged from the Army in 1972 that I read this book. I picked it up because the title and the cover art caught my eye. I think it was the peace sign...little did I know I was picking up a book about the very same basic training company I was in. I always wondered what the man was doing constantly writing in that journal of his...in retrospect it was hilarious, and dead on the way it was. For years I've wanted to thank him for a great read, a great memory. If you can ever find a copy of it...you'll have a great time with it..."},{"rating":"1","title":"unappealing and unmagical","review":"Sadly, this is not the kind of performance that is required for this late romance of Shakespeare. It is prosaic, with unattractive sets and in a wholly inappropriate vaguely 19th century setting and costuming. The acting is also a bit over-emphatic. Thus, the fantasy and suspension of belief required of oracles and lost princesses and restored queens clashes constantly with the more realistic setting. I hope someday someone can capture a beautiful stage production of this play as well as Cymbeline, Pericles, Tempest and Measure. To see a well done late Shakespeare quasi-comedy see Twelfth Night directed by Trevor Nunn with Bonham Carter, Stubbs etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"UNI filter for xr650l","review":"I have used this for a long time now and it works great and is way better than stock.

It's filled by music of third-rate wannabes and does not live up to the standard of quality set by other Matrix media. I threw it away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame there are no Negative Ratings, B/c it sure deserves one.","review":"The production quality is almost as bad as the depressingly awful music. Don't be fooled folks. The \\"artistic\\" hacks may love it, but beauty is TRUELY in the eye of the beholder. If you enjoyed the awesome first 3 soundtracks; don't waste your money on this one expecting more of the same.Instead you will receive a CD chocked full of unimaginative (i.e. high-schoolers without talent playing on their home computers) techno and \\"spoken word\\" type lyrics that are laughably bad (but only if you didn't shell out $13.99 to listen to them).I'm now the proud owner of a $14.00 coaster, b/c that's about all it's good for"},{"rating":"1","title":"Inspired by...... what?","review":"I'm fine with music soundtracks that are \\"inspired by...\\", or their musical score, but this is neither. It's a random collection of songs that doesn't fit any themes/moods of the Matrix movies. The songs aren't even done very well. I wasted at least 10 minutes of my life downloading this from Limewire. It was deleted soon after. I'd give it no stars if I could."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing.","review":"First of all, this album's sound is more like the Animatrix than the other Matrix music. A lot more down-tempo breakbeat weird ambient electronica and stuff. Though when I was listening to it first the album that really came to mind was 2 Days or Die by Atlas Plug. There is alot of good instrumental music on this album, but it's ruined by obnoxious voice samples and people talking over the music. Is it just me or do people not want to be babbled at while they're trying to listen to the music? I don't see how the talking and voice samples add to it at all, infact they really took away from my enjoyment. The music itself is great for what it is, so I guess if you're not bothered by people talking over your music you'll probably enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Each beat intoxicates your senes and beyond!!!!!!","review":"This is one of the best cd's released in its category! The songs blend together in a virtual journey through space and time!!!This cd will take you where you've never been before...like the Matrix, it is deep, philosophical and with concepts that really open your eyes...and of course your ears :) Listen to it more then once--get into it; you'll see the truth and the powerful message behind it. A MUST HAVE!!!don't skip this one--great blend of tunes--original, unique--you will not regret it, I PROMISE!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A GREAT WORK OF ART","review":"This is a very well thought out compilation. The first part is very ethereal downtempo, while the second half is a bangin' in your face techno driven masterpiece. This work is a nice contrast to the original soundtracks. A GREAT ADDITION to any matrix' fans collection.WARNING: NOT FOR THE INTELECTUALLY CHALLENGED!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"While the songs on this CD are what I expected,the artists singing them are not.I thought when I purchased this that the songs were performed by the artists I hear singing them on the radio.I was wrong.Some are but several are not.Example...The Way You Love Me is not sung by Faith Hill on this CD.It just isn't the same.I am very disappointed with this selection!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the Money","review":"I wondered when I bought this if it was preformed by the original artists and was told it was. They were wrong! If you read the CD case they mention none of the singers names, now you will learn why. Heavy instrumentation helps drown out the singers which helps. Save your money and hope \\"NOW 10\\" comes out with country albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feedback to Larry Tye","review":"It is an incredibly well andthoroughly researched piece of literature. What impressed me most washow well you expanded the scope of the book way beyond just the story ofthe Pullman Porters and beautifully told the story of what might becalled the second emancipation of the African Americans. You showedclearly how the struggle of the Pullman Porters was really the precursorof the broader struggle of all African Americans to attain their justplace in the American society and what an important and vital role thePullman Porters played in that struggle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very repetitive","review":"This is a story that needs to be told and I was very excited to read about this history. Unfortunately, I thought the writer was very repetitive in the telling of the history. His format for telling the story and history left allot to be desired and became very hard for me to continue reading. What he wrote in the forward was pretty much what he kept repeating throughout each chapter. You had to look for the \\"nuggets\\" of new information. I am half way through the book and plan to put it down for awhile and pick it back up to finish."},{"rating":"2","title":"fascinating historical connections...","review":"...and stories. that's why i recommend this book, altho my interest flagged toward the end. then i heard mr. tye talk at my public library, and the book took on a new perspective. he was so warm toward invited guests and welcoming to others who introduced themselves as pullman porter relatives. it was genuinely thrilling! Plus, an added bonus: pullman sleeping car and dining car scenes from old movies like hitchcock's \\"north by northwest\\" and 1949's \\"all the king's men\\" now take on extra meaning and importance. thanx, mr. tye."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's in a Name?","review":"Good description of Data Warehousing techniques, etc but NOREAL HELP for XML Portal builders.
