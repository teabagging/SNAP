You have to press really hard on the board with the stylus pen and half the time it does not work or it skips in the line that you are drawing.It is a great idea for a learning toy, but I agree with another person that tried this toy-it was pushed to production without working out all the problems.

After a brief discussion, we returned the Paint Station and decided to get something else in it's place. The toy has some definite possibilities, but it's our opinion not enough of the kinks were worked out before it was put on the market. It's true, you do have to press a little harder on the pen, but that's not really a big deal and didn't influence our decision.Some programs worked really well and were fun, but we grew frustrated because other programs didn't work as well and there was one program that didn't work at all. It's our opinion this product would require adult supervision in order to navigate through the 'kinks' so the child wouldn't become exasperated. I think V Smile is close to something really good, so I hope they keep working on improving the product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good idea, but it is not very user-friendly","review":"I am so glad that I tested this out before Christmas. My son is very into art and drawing, so I thought he would love this. And I am sure that he would, if it worked properly. The screen is just not sensitive enough at some times, and too sensitive at others. You have to either press very hard on the icons to get them to work, or tap a few times very lightly. There is absolutely no consistency to it. An older child might not mind, but I think it would really frustrate a 3-5 year old. I think that this is one of those toys that was rushed through development to make it to the market in time for Christmas, and that is a shame because this is a great idea. I hope that they will fine-tune it, I would definately buy it again if they would take the time to work out the kinks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really disappointed!","review":"I bought the Paint Station for my son this morning at TRU. We were so excited to get it home and play with it. Easy to hook up, but you had to basically put all of your weight on the pen to get it to write.

Another fine point of this book is the breif review he gives you about meditation and how to open up. I found this meditation to be easier than others. The sections on poppet magick and the making of a talisman charm is also worth reading to get an understanding in constructing one. It will take work and thought form study to properly contruct a magickal talisman so that it becomes effective and works for you. The book also has a section of magick squares which is helpful when personalizing a magickal talisman and for its objective for which you are using it. Highly recommend.

In fact, I bought it because I really liked the smell and I have really liked other Method cleaning products, including their wood polish. Anyway, the Method fabric softener left small gobs of itself on some of my clothes, kind of like semi-dried gobs of white glue. This was in a front-loading washer. It also didn't go through the dispenser well. It's noticeably thicker than other softeners I have used in the past. I had to switch my rinse cycle to warm water in order to ensure my clothes came out without visible softener residue. You can see my other review that I did under the Method Fresh Air scent fabric softener for more details. But the end result was I had to run my washer more inefficiently just to counteract this product's tendency to stick to fabric."},{"rating":"2","title":"Impressive CD quality","review":"I order this CD for my brother.

It's a great album that I consider a \\"Classic\\". When I saw that a remastered version was being offered, with bonus tracks, I decided to pick it up. I appreciate the upgraded sound quality. The lower end is greatly enhanced. Now you can easily hear just how well Muzz Skillings was playing those great, funky bass-lines.Just to let everybody know, the song What's Your Favorite Color? (Theme Song) has been chopped on the remastered version down to about 1:44. The first time I listened to it, I thought my cd player had skipped to the next track prematurely! The original version was 3:55 and contained twice the lyrics plus another bridge.

Once I received it, Christmas was a few short weeks away so that is why I did not return it for a new one. The other thing I was dissatisfied with was the warning label (it's not removable) that is on the frot of the box that takes away from the show quality.

Yes, because there is a U.S. version with the songs Sprangled Banner and Greenface whichare not on European version! Plus, the European version comes with the song Waterloo which is not on U.S. Version! And, to get all songs, we must fight for a limited 2CD set containing the complete tracklist plus an unplugged song. Well, they think we are stupid, this is the only answer for such disrespect with fans...

Green Face isn't bad nor is Red Baron/Blue Max, but the rest just don't feel like Iced Earth. Maybe they just missed a step since Barlow's departure, but the album just seems lacking in intensity. If you want some of the best metal ever, go back to their old stuff, like Stormrider, Something Wicked, Dark Saga, and Burnt Offerings, this just isn't worth the $15.... and anyone who says Matt Barlow was a bad singer wouldn't know metal if it stabbed them in the face with a soldering iron."},{"rating":"2","title":"an excellent release by iced earth","review":"barlow, replaced by ex-judas priest vocalist, tim \\"ripper\\" owens, is on his own now. but tim owens does put on a great performance on this seventh album. imo, he's the second best vocalist, and with blazing songs like \\"greenface\\" i think it's safe to say he's awesome. i don't think it's quite up to the standard of the past couple cds, but it still kicks. \\"the reckoning\\" is my favorite on this cd and i'd love to see these guys live. with the alive in athens disk, who wouldn't want to see these guys live..anyway, very much so worth a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another interesting album by Iced Earth!","review":"John Shaffer continues to show us with this album, that he is one of the better guitarists out there. This new album, while very patriotically themed, seems diverse enough to satisfy. The blending lighter melodies and faster riffs makes this a unique Power Metal CD. Just like \\"Horrow Show,\\" which was a dramatic epic, \\"Glorious Burden\\" is about war and history. I don't have any major criticisms of this album, other than the fact that it is slower and more conceptual than most of the music I listen to, and I don't tend to enjoy albums like that, although this CD is particularly well-executed. Expect to like this if you enjoy Iron Maiden, Blind Guardian, Dream Evil or Power Metal in general."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glorious Burden not so glorious.","review":"Boring, just plain boring. It looks as though they have lost it. When the Eagle Cries is a poorly developed song.

If this is the sort of stuff they are going to have to offer, I have bought my last Iced Earth Album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"Simply a well made album. Excellent lyrics and vocals, from deep ominous rumbles to screaming highs. Great musicianship. Not an album for the faint of heart or those new to metal. You really must be a metal fan to appreciate this album to its fullest.Using patriotic lyrics and themes Iced Earth has unleashed a very good album. I'll stop short of calling it great as the jury is still out on a couple of tracks. However, most of this album is great from the first listen, some must grow on you.This will appeal to fans of classic Iron Maiden, Judas Priest and of course other Iced Earth albums. This is not for fans of Queensryche, Dream Theater or Night Wish unless you also like heavier metal albums, or for those new to the metal genre."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD - EVA -","review":"I'm surprised the Iced Earth creativity source has not gone dry.

This cd, surprisingly, has a lot of european sounding parts, even though it is widely known that Ripper and Jon don't like european metal. Anyway, I think adding more melody to the usual rhythm guitar parts was excellent, and definitely makes for a more over-seas sound than they had before. For instance the chorus on Declaration Day has harmonizing swedish-sounding guitars, something they haven't done a lot of in the past. This is a step forward in my-opinion because while their older srtaight-american style is great, this is a much more beautiful style of guitar playing. I do feel that Ripper's vocals are lacking though, as they always have. Poor move kicking Matt Barlow out...he was great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This is a great CD!

Then I came here to see if they were any better on cd, and well I wasnt surprised when I found out that they were WORSE on cd than live, usualy its the opposite, but in this case well it wasn't. I dont reccomend them to anyone, but I do reccomend Children of bodum or well Soil work cause they bolth are fine examples of good metal not iced earth.

Not only is the music horribly dated (Euro Metal circa 1981), but the brainless flag waving and chest beating are repelent. As a lover of good music and at least half decent lyrics, this journey into a redneck's mind is a complete turn off. Regurgitated riffs that make Puddle Of Mudd sound inovative and songs that are nothing more than tuneless dirges make this a complete and utter disaster."},{"rating":"1","title":"cmon ...","review":"First, Barlow is gone from the mic so gone is the best metal vocalist in the business. Replace him with the Ripper who is good at imitating Halford but does not go well with schaffers riffs at all. He can't hit low notes and the melodies are terrible. Speaking of riffs, they are dreadful. This album sounds extremely forced. The songs have about two-three riffs at max in them and the songs themselves are 4-5 minutes apiece: yes this means that they become very boring. Hey how about the lyrics? They are pathetically childish. I'm not even going to get into that but trust me they are weak.If you liked the past masterpieces Iced Earth has put out, please i warn you of this album. It will let you down and you may actually cry to see such an amazing band drift so far from the brilliance of their previous efforts."},{"rating":"1","title":"bs","review":"only a couple of good songs. rest of the cd is crap.one more thing to note. song writers should sit down and learn history before writing songs based on \\"true\\" historic events."},{"rating":"1","title":"When the Eagle Craps","review":"My country has produced a lot of bad metal in the past few years, but just because Iced Earth sounds retro doesn't make them any dumber than numetal bands like Limp Bizkit and Korn.Getting Owens to sing the songs was bad enough, but they also just had to go patriotic and sum up all the reasons why America kicks ass. The band's conclusion? Apparently, we rule because we had a Civil War.If you want to listen to Iron Maiden-style music, then listen to Iron Maiden. If you want to listen to Metallica-style music, then listen to (pre-Load) Metallica. Don't settle for a cheap knock-off of both bands. Oh and if you want to feel patriotic, well, I don't have any advice for anyone who doesn't watch FoxNews on a regular basis."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just not the same....","review":"After giving this CD many opportunities to succeed, I have to finally conclude that this just doesn't compare favorably with Iced Earth's previous work. In my opinion, what made Iced Earth great was crunching, galloping riffage combined with excellent vocals. They were considered \\"power metal\\" but really distinguished themselves from the rest of the bands in the genre because a vocal delivery that didn't sound like some opera diva and music that wasn't \\"wimpified\\" by cheesy keyboards and riffs that would make make Bon Jovi proud! While the music on this CD is decent, it still lacks something - I'm not sure what. Most of all, the vocals just don't cut it. Ripper is a decent vocalist, but face it, he's ususally been the guy who got brought off of the bench to fill in when the starter left. If you really want to hear Iced Earth at their best, I suggest \\"Alive in Athens\\", which showcases most of their good songs and is just filled with intesity and talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"There is no bigger fan....but......","review":"I feverishly awaited this album...Jon Schaffer(song writer) is a genius to me...the underlying anger poured out through 6 strings and ideas about the folly of men and spiritual damnation strikes a chord in all IE fans. That being said, I am woefully incomplete listening to this new album. I was supposed to be in a neck brace by now. Some of the guitar work sounds regurgitated and even though I like the Ripper (Tim Owens), Matt Barlow gave Iced Earth that PERFECT haunt that this album lacks. I know all IE songs cant be about the 9 plains of hell, sacrifice, and demons unknown but its those blackened roots that all fans love.The Ripper feels a need to scream every five seconds. Barlow knew when to be subdued and when to let loose. Where have you gone MATT BARLOW?? Your true fans need you back where you belong.

While the author is content to ramble on at length about his own vast powers of perception, he neglects to offer even the most basic guides to choice of parts, proper running conditions, and tuning. There are very few parts charts, and the engines used as examples are all English and mostly out of date. All the diagrams are lifted directly from Weber's own shop manuals. The author's admission on page 42 that his own car runs very badly when cold and uses an obsolete form of carburetor is testament to his lack of troubleshooting and tuning skills. His inability to keep even his own car running well, an inability he thinly disguises with an authoritarian, opinionated writing style, undermines his credibility. Buy the Haynes book or, better yet, the BTR Engineering book (hard to find in the US)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great hooks","review":"These hooks are great. No bells and whistles here.

The 60s, the 70s, the 80s, it's all here and much, much more. No wonder Barbra Streisand is considered to be the greatest female singer of the 20th century-- no one else even comes close. Her vocal range, her variety of songs she has sung over her career-- over 40 years now! --she is simply amazing. And here it is the year 2003 and she is still as popular as ever and is on the verge of releasing what probably will be her most acclaimed work, \\"The Movie Album.\\" Keep it up, Barbra!

There's a raw, very live feel to his presentations, as he calls out when he's making a mistake, when his computer is hanging, or some random comments. However, it gives it that vibe of being taught in a J.C. Night course, because those things would obviously happen in real life.

Very engaging toy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth it","review":"I was checking this out for a Christmas gift for our 3 year old son. I didn't think it was worth the price so we ended up not getting it then. However, I managed to pick it up on clearance for $[...] at Target. Amazing price - but that is the best part of this toy. It's not very much fun to play with and it has been sitting under our couch since we bought it. I may get it out and give it another whirl - i read the reviews about needing to shake the cars longer. It's just a really big toy and it takes up a lot of floor space."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best toy","review":"We recieved this for Christmas in 2005, while it seems like a great idea the cars just don't last and they don't race around the track more than 2-3 times before they stop. Try explaining to a 4 year old well this car went around 3 1/2 time and that one went around 2 times so even though this one is in front it didn't really win. The track is very well made, easy to put together and take apart to store. It does take up quite a bit of room so it's nice to take it apart to store it after the kids have lost interest in a few days. We have 6-7 cars, 3 that came with it and several others that Grandparents have purchased, we are now down to 2 working cars. I just put new batteries in them and considering 2 boys play with them they haven't been abused, like other toys they have. So what's the point in having a nice track if the cars are junk!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Shake and Go Speedway a disappointment","review":"I bought the Shake and Go Speedway for my son's 5th birthday and was very disappointed with it. The cars would only go around the track a couple of times before they would stop. It is also very hard to hear the annoucements exspecialy who the winner is. Fisher Price will send you a replacement but you have to wait on them to send you a prepaid package to send certain peices back then you may wait up to 4 weeks on the new peices to arrive. I think the company should change their policy to where you can mail them your receipt then they could send you the replacement parts along with the return postage. That way a 5 year old does not have to wait over 4 weeks to play with their new toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of fun","review":"It was a birthday present for my godson.

His 6 year old brother played with it for a little bit, then was bored. The sounds are a lot of fun, and really add to the excitement. Some of the cars work better than others, which can be a little frustrating if they can't get their favorite to ever win. I would highly reccomend this for 2-4 year olds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cars continue to hit same side of track and push it open....","review":"It is a great idea! The problem we are having is the cars keep hitting the same side of track with such force it pushes the track open. As a result, this requires the kids to continually stop and ask for the track to be put back together. After a few runs...they are tired of it falling apart. Is my track defective?? I'm not sure, but I had great hopes for this toy. It is a shame...the kids were thrilled to recieve it. I would not buy it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not made to with stand a 3 year old","review":"My son got this for his birthday. It was such a piece of junk that we ended up taking it back to the store for a return. The side peices would not stay on and even I could not get the cars to go long enough to finish the race. The sounds were annoying and the toy was just not what i expected it to be at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun, but not","review":"Purchased for a 4-year-old's birthday. The most we could get the cars to round the track was 5 times. Reviews were read that purchased cars were better than the cars that came with the track, but this is not true. No matter how new the batteries are and how many times we shake the cars, they go around five times. Disappointing. The fencing/barriers come off so easily that we don't bother using them, and the track also comes apart easily. The 2 stars is for the fact that my boys enjoy playing with the cars on the floor. Overall, not as fun at home as it seemed to be in the store."},{"rating":"2","title":"Race Car Set","review":"I bought this item for my grandson for his birthday. He was elated because he love cars. His sisters also enjoys playing with him. I also like the ease of them playing with this set because you don't have wind up or use batteries for the cars to run. The concept of shaking the cars for them to run was a brilliant idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Idea but very poor implementation","review":"Parts fit together slopply, cars can't finish the race with one shake, the track rails won't stay on, fun factor is very, very limited.

The tank needs work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud, high pitched, teeth-grating, squeaking from fan","review":"As far as the humidifying qualities of the Holmes HM630 I have to say I'm content. It has a small footprint and takes up a minimal amount of floorspace. The large tank it great, too.What overrides all of that is the loud squeaking. I can tune out hums and other white noise, but this is fingernails on the blackboard to-the-bone squeaking. It doesn't matter what setting, but it's less frequent the lower you keep the humidity and fan speed setting. Of course, that means it comes on less often because the room humidity stays lower, and when it does come on the fan sometimes stays on longer, so you get the squeaks, but it's not quite as loud and piercing, but still loud enough to pull you out of sleep and keep you up for a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"All Around Headache !!!!!!","review":"I bought this and was happy to finally have a tower humidifier. The tank leaked a little but I glued the area and all was well until I did what many others do and barely dropped it...well the tank barely slipped from my hands when I was trying to hold it while filling it up. Very poor design for filling as there is nothing to hold onto. Anyways, it slipped sideways and shattered. Seriously, the tank must be made of the worst possible plastic!!! So I called the manufacturer and they offered to sell me another complete unit with just a 25% discount because they are out of stock on the tanks. Wow, 25% off. Poor service... Actually, every company that I researched has been out of stock on the tanks for a loooong time now. Save yourself a headache and buy a different brand. By the way this tank is used for Bionaire and Holmes, so stay away from both as there is no indication of when they will restock the tanks which might as well be made from thin cheap glass."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holmes does not stand behind their products.","review":"If something goes wrong and you go to their website, you can't submit.

You'll see it has a large handle on the top, but you'll only use this when the tank is empty. It is filled from the bottom, which has no handle, much less any ridge to hold on to. The tank will not stand upside-down. Also, because the tank is so long, the only place I could fill it is in a bathtub.Screwing on the lid of a large, wet, heavy plastic tank in the bathtub with two hands is near impossible. I dropped it, the tank shattered, and now I need to get a new humidifier. Save yourself the trouble and move on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice unit","review":"Looks good, works well, but it's difficult finding replacement filters here in Manhattan. Also, the tank empties fairly quickly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Worth The Money","review":"I have owned this for almost a year and we love it. I see that some reviewers comment on the loud noise, but I would challenge this. Ours is VERY quiet- we have it sitting on carpet so that may make it less noisy. I would highly recommend this item. The humidity increases to the desired level quickly and there are numerous settings. Also, the same reviewer that mentioned the noise problem also said you need a tub or deep sink to fill this. I have a \\"standard\\" kitchen sink that was put in by our builder in 2003. I have never had a problem filling the humidifier tank. I just tip it a bit sideways and it fills easily."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad, but some MAJOR NEGATIVES","review":"Although this humidifier has impressive features, the noise really bothered me. I found it LOUD on any setting, even on its lowest setting. When the unit reached it humidity setpoint (I had set it to 40%), it had problems surpassing the setpoint and it kept cycling between 39% and 40% every two seconds or so. Loud fan on, loud fan off, loud fan on, loud fan off -- I absolutely hated the automatic feature and I turned off the automatic feature after about an hour.A full tank on low lasted about 10 hours, not much more. Also, one needs a bathtub or a very deep sink to fill the tank."},{"rating":"1","title":"No manual in the box, no manual on the website","review":"I bought the HM630 yesterday. Today, the unit tells me the filter needs replaced. After one day! So I went to read the manual and then remembered the box didn't even contain a manual. So then I went to the Holmes website listed on the box, and their website doesn't even list this unit as one of their products.VERY impressive, Holmes. Veeery impressive."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from Holmes humidifiers","review":"Terrible, defective products. I have purchased Holmes humidifiers in the past and have been happy. However, this year, I purchased another humidifier that was defective. Waited FOREVER to speak with someone (kept getting disconnected, calling over and OVER). They asked what my problem was and offered to send a replacement. Shipping took almost TWO WEEKS. After all the waiting, the new unit was defective as well. Called again. Offered to send me a different model. Same wait time. At this rate, winter and dry air will be OVER by the time I get a proper humidifier. I'm embarrassed for Holmes and their SUP-PAR products. Obviously they are just trying to get the shoddy products out of their warehouse and will just resend and resend. ALL I WANT IS MY MONEY BACK SO I CAN INVEST IN A DECENT BRAND. Shame on you Holmes.

I can't figure out where I need to look or who I need to talk with to get a replacement tank. Has other filters and subcomponents that don't do anything except cost you more $$.

I ran the Holmes humidifier 24/7 both years and had no problems with it.I did not use any of the automatic settings - just turned it on and set to high. It would get the humidity up to about 28%-32% in an open floorplan area of about 700 sq ft.I had a large, deep washroom sink where I could fill the tank fairly easily. I agree with the negative reviews that this would be very awkward to fill otherwise due to the design of the tank.I've used other humidifiers in the past and this is the first one to stay clean and mold free.I have hard water - no issues of any kind there.Conclusion: I found the unit reliable, performed as advertised and I feel fortunate that it has worked well for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"TERRIBLE","review":"This is the worst humidifier I have bought, not only noisy but even on full setting our small bedroom air was still dry. Plus the filter system is ridiculous, you have to cut off a strip of paper material to the right size to place in filter. Already covered in mold, this was a waste of money and has gone straight in the trash."},{"rating":"2","title":"Know your water","review":"Love the unit itself, however after 3 days of running it only 8 hours a night, I noticed the filter guage was saying \\"Replace Filter\\"So I called the company to say, \\"hey .. it's only been 3 days. I think the filter guage is broken\\" and they had me check the filter (it was yellow and crusty) and they said, \\"no .. it's your water. you need to replace your filter or use distilled water.\\" Then she laughed and said they had customers that replace their filters several times a week because of their waterSo of course I'm not going to replace my filter every 3 days and I'm not going to use a couple gallons of distilled water every night before I go to bed in this thing ...so if you have hard water .. this may not be the unit for you. Buyer Beware."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed","review":"I definitely agree on all points made by reviewer Mr. Average. I found this humidifier to be quite noisy, but bearable only on the lowest setting. The humidity level does increases rapidly. However, I stopped using the programmable features for the very same reason -- loud fan on, loud fan off. It drove me crazy.Also, the bottom end of the filter sits in the resevoir and remains wet because it is constantly in contact with the water originating from the tank. Despite my efforts to empty the tank/resevoir and air out the filter every morning, it never completely dries out. Now when I turn the humidifier on, it gives off a moldy odor. I have just purchased this product and have only used it about 10 times, so it seems rather soon to have to change the filter. I plan on returning it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a good investment.....","review":"We bought this a week ago, it did not have an owners manual, so we did not know what to do differently when the gauge said after 2 days that the filter needed replaced.

I have made the mistake of buying a number of Holmes products including this Humidifier.The Humidifier has never worked correctly and sometimes will cycle on/off/on a half-dozen or more times before it stays on. Holmes answer was that I should turn up the setting to a higher value.The Reservoir is difficult to fill as there is no handle, then it is difficult to put the cover on it because it will not stand upside down, you have to try to hold it with one hand and screw the cover on with the other. I have already broken one reservoir.The Humidifier is also quite noisy on all but the lowest setting. The only way you can have it on a higher fan speed setting is if you are not going to be in the room.Very disappointing Humidifier and Strongly Not Recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Bought this unit from a local home improvement store. Loved it on day one... Quiet and it used a lot of water meaning it was putting that water in the air as designed. By day two, the fan is now extremely loud on all three speed settings. So loud that we have to turn theTV way up and we can still hear it. It doesn't sound like it will last much longer. I can't comment on the filter life or longevity of the unit. I will be returning it tomorrow (day three). I would not recommend this unit and I will not buy another from this manufacturer."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not buy","review":"I bought a Sunbeam cool mist humidifier and to fill the thing you have to turn the tank upside down and remove the cap.

This flooding seemed to make the water get even hotter than before, finally the tank became so warped I couldn't get the cap on or use the unit at all.If I could get a new tank and keep it from warping, I'd be very satisfied with the unit. It raises the humidity quickly. I use it in the kitchen/dining area and so noise has not been a problem for me. I have contacted Holmes requesting a new tank, let's hope for the best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Holmes quality has fallen off a cliff","review":"I bought 2 of these in 2010 to replace to 5+ year-old Holmes units that had died after long and reliable service. The older units' heating elements had failed, but the tanks remained intact.These units worked adequately for a year. The capacity was lower than earlier units despite Holmes's claims--humidifying even a medium-sized room drained the tank fully in 10 hours as opposed to about 16-18 on the earlier model. It was also much more difficult to get the tank aligned properly, and several times slight misalignments caused slow leakage (1-2 hours) of the entire tank. (Fortunately I learned long ago to place towels underneath humidifiers.)Nevertheless, I was reasonably content with these units until I took them out of storage for this winter (2011). When filling the tanks, both cracked in exactly the same spot. This is an obvious design flaw. After having bought 7-8 Holmes humidifiers over the last 15 years, I will not be buying anything else from this company."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great, if you're a reasonable person and read the directions!","review":"Like ogden-ogden and a few others, I really don't understand all the bad reviews for this. The complaints seem to all originate in either improper use or unreasonable expectations. This is pretty simple it boils water, creating steam which provides the humidity. Its better than others I've used previously in the winter, because the tank can be removed and refilled while leaving the unit in place, and there's a control to allow you to set the level of humidity you want, so you can use it in smaller rooms without the walls ending up wet (again, as long as you're semi-intelligent!)I agree with others, do the \\"daily cleaning\\" once a week, do the \\"weekly cleaning once every month or two, and you should be just fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy, doesn't produce enough steam","review":"Just purchased this model.

I would fill it up in the sink and test it to make sure it didn't leak. Many times it was fine, but on more than one occasion, I would place the tank on the base only to have the water drain out of the tank, even though the cap was on firmly. One night it seemed to be working fine, but I woke up the next morning to find the tank not only completely drained, but warped out of shape! The stand I had placed the humidifier on was also damaged, apparently by the steam. I'm lucky it didn't cause a fire. I will not buy this humidifier again."},{"rating":"1","title":"lots of knocking sounds","review":"I don't know if it's just my unit, but mine makes a lot of \\"knocking\\" sounds from, what I assume, are all the bubbles forming from the boiling of the water. I do hear a light gurgling sound, which isn't so bad, but even the low setting causes a bigger knocking sound every 10 seconds or so. The high setting is just unbearable for me during the night as I am a very light sleeper. I do get a continual mist, which is great, but the noise from this unit is a big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy a different model","review":"I bought this one because it was on sale at the time and I didn't have to deal with buying filters. Unfortunately, it turns out that the water gets too hot, or the designers placed the tank too close to the heating element, because the tank started melting after the second or third night of using it. It didn't take long for the melting to render it too warped for the cap to fit properly, and now it leaks all over the inside of the unit. Judging from the other reviews on this page, it isn't a problem unique to my experience.I went to the Holmes website to see about ordering a new tank, but they don't even have it listed, just the tanks for the larger units.This isn't even to mention that this unit is often so noisy I can hear it over the highway I live near, and it's halfway across the house from me. The next humidifier I buy, I'm going to do a little research first."},{"rating":"1","title":"BUY EARPLUGS TO GO WITH THIS","review":"Works OK but if you buy it put it in the attic.

I bought this one since it was the only warm mist humidifier available at the store, but I wish I had read these reviews first. As soon as I took it out of the box I could tell that it was very cheaply made - it felt flimsy, unlike previous models I've owned. Also, the slot meant to hold the tank in place was not secure, the tank easily popped out. I decided to try it out anyway, but as soon as I filled the tank and flipped it over, it leaked even with screwing the cap on excessively tight. It's going right back to the store. I do not recommend buying this model."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible design","review":"I too have had trouble fitting the cap back onto the tank after filling it.

I would never buy this one again, however."},{"rating":"1","title":"A lot problem","review":"I think there are some design problem with this humidifier. For 5 times I refilled the tanks, only 2 times works.

It appears to read wildly different humidities based on whether or not the humidifier has heated up; the result is, in practical terms, that it's either on continuously or it doesn't come on at all.I also note that on high, running continuously, it runs through a full tank in about 8 hours, and on low it runs through less than a quarter of a tank in 8 hours, making the low setting rarely useful.It's possible I got a defective unit, but I'll be returning it and buying a different brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent skillet","review":"Just a pleasure to use.

Fast shipping and a proper product.Maybe this is what Sociology is SUPPOSED to be about. I don't know. But the author has such a blatantly slanted view of the world that it is quite disheartening. The book contains an overly pessimistic and biased take on a great number of subjects. The tone that resonates throughout is such that you would think the author is fed up with the world and has considerable resistance to adjusting to change.I pray that the author finds some balance to his viewpoints and considers that constantly giving thought to negativity and despair is a destructive practice.

The SOG is cool and feels solid but is 10 ounces lighter and shorter than the smith bowie. Just wished the SOG had more ass to it. Hell, my cold steel G.I. tanto weighs in 2 ounces heavier with only a 7 inch blade.That being said, it handles well and feels sturdy. Grip is solid and firm, teeth are cool and useful as is the little teeth on the bottom of the blade. Finish is cool and looks nice. Overall I am content and happy with the purchase.1=24-13.

I have to change my opinion to it is just right and feels good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great prop, horrible knife.","review":"This knife looks very cool and mean and I think it was a smart move by the SOG marketing team. Would make a great prop in a Rambo movie or something similar. But for anyone who knows even a little about steel and knives in general, this piece is plain JUNK. The steel is horrible and is as cheap and low quality as you can find. The blade is thin and very easily damaged/broken. The balance is also bad. This is not a useful knife at all in that it loses it's edge just by looking at it and the light-weight flexible blade is horrible for trying to chop anything. The saw-teeth on the back are also useless in that you can't actually saw anything with them.Don't get me wrong with this review... I'm a big SOG fan and own several of their products. (Trident, Seal Team). But the knives I own and like are made much better with much better materials. The Jungle Primitive is just plain junk and should be avoided like the plague by any real knife owners looking for a useful blade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good hybrid","review":"I like it I did some research on this chinese alloy and is supposed to be equal to our steel alloys.

I did my due diligence before purchasing this item and I find it to be everything that is claimed. A through tang gives it a completely solid feel. The 91/2 inch blade comes razor sharp and ready to go. The handle is a rubberized/neoprene type material and helps to lessen shocks when chopping with the blade. I found the handle a little rough for my delicate hands but I had always intended to wrap it with para-cord anyway so no need to worry about me. The sheath has a sizable pocket on the front I have stowed a small sharpening stone and fire starter in it. The jungle primitive is ready and so am I."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not great","review":"When this knife arrived I was a bit disapointed. The build of the knife is good for the money. The sheath is not so hot. It is cheaply made synthetic, and you get what you pay for. The knife arrived dull, and needed to be sharpend. That was disapointing due to the fact that when reading the reviews, everyone said thier knife arrived sharp. Not a problem. I sharpend the knife and headed out to my camp here in the Adirondack's. I put the knife thru a ton of work, and for what it cost, it did fairly well. At the end of the day, it needed to have an edge put back on.

Wether your sawing, hacking, trimming, throwing, stabbing, whatever. It blew my mind. I spent next to nothing and got a pretty great knife. The only con to this knife is the sheath.

Each feature is carefully detailed to make the ultimate multi-purpose knife. The blade is sharp and long. The serrations are just big enough to be useful and tucked back enough to not get in the way. The saw teeth don't just look cool but actually work. The handle is surprisingly functional while keeping your hand safe. As usual with SOG products the sheath is a custom fit.If you hike, explore, or just have land you maintain I highly recommend this knife. SOG makes a lot of great products but this might be one of their best, if not most functional."},{"rating":"2","title":"SOG F03T Jungle Primitive","review":"This is a nice piece of equipment. I read a few reviews that said it came sharp out of the box. The tip was sharp, but I had to put an edge on the blade myself, out of the box it wouldn't cut paper; however, I put edges on all my knives. I also read a review someone said they bent the blade chopping through 1.5 tree branches. It's a knife, not a machete. Knives and Machete's are different so if one wants to do machete work, they should buy a machete. I read one review that said the handle felt like cheap plastic. The handle felt fine to me material wise. I give this knife 4 stars cuz I had to put my own edge on it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The SOG Jungle Primitive","review":"This knife is a beast! It has that scary eff your es up look while still keeping a practical use. The blade is a good size it has a good weight while not being clumsy. You can use it to chop and to cut. Its great from people who want a machete but don't want the weight that comes with it. The blade is very sharp right out of the box and the little saw-like serrations on the back have some use if they don't just make it look scary. The handle is really good quality. Itscomfortable and provides good hold. The sheath is the weakest part to me it isn't bad but it could be better. Overall its a good knife I know some people have given it poor reviews but they're just naysayers. Most other knives like this one are crap so I would recommend this one just to be safe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Quality","review":"Item was quality and arrived in perfect condition.

I think it's a great entry level large sized knife. It's pretty sturdy, and weighted pretty heavy towards the end of the blade making it good for using in a chopping motion. I feel it's a good knife for him to start with but will need to upgrade in the years to come. SOG always puts forth a good product for the price. I personally wouldn't buy this for myself but for someone getting their first large style knife, its pretty good. The sheath is adequate and it may be a bit tough the first few times of securing the snap over the handle as I had to do it for him and get it stretched out a bit. The smaller saw portion is very sharp so watch that, the larger saw portion is no too sharp to the touch but would easily rake bark off a tree, the blade is sharp enough to use but would need to be sharpened more for my liking. Overall, for the price, its great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice for the price","review":"Like most things you can always spend more money, but you definitely get your money's worth with this knife.

Tried it out in the backyard, a lot of force is required to cut anything down (which is what a survival situation would call for) not good for batoning, blade bends pretty easily which makes me nervous. The saw on the back is alright, but it's a little to short to be truly effective and was a little annoying. I don't think I would put my life in this knife's hands.

Worst of all, the dialogue was stilted and the voices of the children were just awful -- sounded like grownups pretending to be kids.

It was sad how uninspired Stevie Wonder was. Macy Gray was nothing special, and I couldn't believe Darlene Love missed the mark, when she's done such wonderful Christmas music in the past. And did anyone tell Tom Petty what kind of album this was? Sheryl Crowe did a passing fair job.

Why put Wyclef Jean rapping in the beginning of Stevie Wonder's first song? As one of the reviewers mentioned earlier, it did not put me into the Christmas mood.

I don't know why people are knocking Darlene Love's White Christmas, which is a studio cut. Of course she's not going to sound the same as she did in 1963 - nobody is. But she can still belt it out, as she proves every year on David Letterman's show. Bottom line, a CD with variety, studio and live cuts, mostly holiday tunes and a couple not holiday related.

At least two of the larger patterns are photographed in two-page spreads with the center of the design in the crease of the book. Because of the binding, it's nearly impossible to see what the center of the design looks like.

The young adults who were fans of the TCG when they were kids would love this game. For the new fans of the TCG, this could be a history lesson on how it all began. The game follows a similar pattern to the rpg-style Pokemon games: 8 gym leaders and one final Champion. This game has high replay value due to its gbc-link compatible fighting and trading system. And collectors can enjoy the challenge of getting all the cards.My rating: 4/5"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool Game!","review":"This game is really neat! You get to trade for Game Boy exclusive cards.

I might extend that to include all Evelyn Wood material. As others have noted, the simpler concepts that are introduced are too basic to have a great effect on your reading/comprehension. The more complex concepts are glazed over too quickly.Essentially, a majority of this book consists of pop psychology to make you feel good about your potential and of inspiring anecdotes from the program's students that, I suppose, are meant to lend some credibility to the concepts in this book.Its saving grace is the few chapters it spends on outlining proper methods for studying in preparation for tests and exams. While nothing revolutionary, it manages to approach that topic in a practical way, which might be helpful for mediocre students that might be looking to develop non-existent study skills.But this book isn't supposed to be about studying, is it?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this, get Breakthrough Rapid Reading by Peter Kump","review":"Reading this book feels like talking to a used car salesman. Stanley Frank spends as much time in this (very thin) volume giving anecdotes on how wonderful Evelyn Wood speed reading is as he does giving any useful information about how to read faster. The book does give some rapid reading techniques, but fails to link them into a curriculum for actually training oneself to increase reading speed.By contrast, I found Peter Kump's \\"Breakthrough Rapid Reading\\" (recommended by another Amazon Reviewer) to be quite helpful. Kump's book mixes the theory of Evelyn wood with comprehensive exercises to put these ideas into practice. Kump also gives the reader a way to record and track progress through the course.The concepts of rapid reading are not difficult, the challenge lies in putting them into practice. Save your $7, skip Frank, and buy a book that will actually help you learn to read faster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on Amazon","review":"Amazon as sells this book under the title \\"Remember Everything You Read\\", it is the exact same book word for word.

Most of the book was devoted to informing the reader how fast and efficiently they could study, and how successful their courses are. There was very little instruction and what was there was vague. The book ended up being of negligible help to my reading speed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice paperweight","review":"I read this book because it claimed to help increase reading by 50%.

Well, after reading this book, I read about 250 words per minute. 20 words wasn't worth it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Big on claims, short on detail","review":"I wouldn't exaclty label this book as worthless; indeed, there are many useful tidbits and techniques which can help many students become more successful in the classroom. My complaint concerns the nuts and bolts of how to attain the \\"3,000\\" word per minute reading level which is regularly advertised throughout the book. In fact, I found the book largely containing anecdotes and stories of how other readers utilized the program to acheive superhuman reading levels. I was left thiking \\"is there a book 2 that I'm missing\\"? If you can learn to read via skimming your fingers underneath the sentences you've pretty much already got 90% of this book down. Perhaps the author should have focused only on speed reading rather than incorporating other information regarding studying skills, note taking, etc; all worth while, but not pertinent to those who got the book for the primary purpose of reading faster. In short, there are more useful books out there on the subject."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wealth of information","review":"This book provides a wealth of information on the Frank (trails, history, geology, etc.). The organization of the book is useful, although more small scale maps would help orient the reader without running out and getting forest service maps of the wilderness with the book. Still, a great guide."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confusing to read","review":"I was not impressed with the way this book was organized. The hikes all run on into each other. It is very hard to navigate where a specific hike starts and ends,, and calculate the distance. Hiking books for the BigHorn Crags are tough to find,, but I will be searching for others for my trip there this summer as this one is not going to cut it.

The first few tracks are really bad, as bad as \\"The Ballad of Jed Clampett\\" (I thought they got all that out of their system?). Maybe it will grow on me, but I think with repeated listens I will become more and more bored with it. I will say that as the album moves on, it gets better and \\"Misunderstood\\" is definitely the high point on the album (Too bad it takes so long to get there). I have a really hard time recommending this album especially considering their ridiculously strong output leading up to it. Here's to hoping their following is looking better for the mighty Flecktones.Look for _Outbound_ or _Little Worlds_ instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pleasant (newly defined) mix of genres","review":"This was my introduction to Béla Fleck and it served me very well. It's supposed to be very different than previous albums (more jazzy) and this is absolutely well done. I find it magnificient!

I like most: Rococco, Kaleidoscope, Weed Whacker and The Whistle Tune.Buttom line: In my view, Béla Fleck's sound and melodies have evolved for the better in the past years. It's getting more unique every time. I like it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Lords of Tikal","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It does for part of the Mayan world what much of the early work by epigraphers did for that of ancient Egypt in the 18th, 19th and early 20th centuries. The translation and interpretation of Mayan hieroglyphics is a recent phenomenon, occurring only within the last three decades. Through the efforts of dedicated researchers like Dr. Harrison, who excavated at the site of Tikal, and the late Linda Schele, who worked on Mayan hieroglyphics, a synthesis of the epigraphic material is only just beginning to reveal the story and characters of the Maya world for the enjoyment of the armchair enthusiast like myself. This work is definitely an illustration of what is likely to come from the fieldwork in the future."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic for the Classic Maya.","review":"The pyramids at Tikal are perhaps the most breathtaking and awe-inspiring structures of the pre-Hispanic world. The research available in this book helps shed light on the fascinating history behind the facades of limestone.

And this is a clear, concise, enjoyable read to learn about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Evil White Dust","review":"Been using this humidifier for about 2 weeks now, and while it is stylish, and very very quiet, and keeps my one bedroom condo at a comfortable humidity level.The amount of white dust it produces is rather irksome, even with the filters it produces alot of white dust, fortunatley most of it seems to collect on my TV so I just wipe that down a couple times a day.. You could use distilled water to eliminate it, but I go through about 4 gallons of water a day, so thats alot of distilled water.I also do not like how there is no humidity gauge, so you can't set it to shut off when it gets to a certain level of humidity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks cool, but DO NOT BUY","review":"I was sent this humidifier after shipping a different model back that was broken and under warranty. I thought it looked cool, however, so I kept it and decided to give it a try. It's small, has two chambers (twice the cleaning!) and requires 2 filters. It's approaching winter so I went online to buy new filters... they want to charge $27 for the 2 filters, plus $16 shipping. I'm better off buying a new humidifier.I won't ever buy a Holmes/Bonaire product again."},{"rating":"1","title":"not recommended","review":"It's stylish and it's quiet. Those are about the only good qualities this humidifier has.Refilling it is really annoying: it's a two-chamber design, which means you're doing double the work, and because each chamber is only .5 gallons, you have to refill them quite often.There is no built in hygrometer, so it will not shut off when the humidity reaches a particular level. The light changes to blue when it is \\"too\\" humid. However, it is a useless feature if this occurs in the middle of the night.There is no middle setting. On one, it is barely OK. On two, the entire floor area in front of it is completely soaked.Finally, I think it is overpriced (however, that is a matter of opinion. They might, in fact, be charging extra for the stylish design)There's no way I'd ever buy this thing again."},{"rating":"2","title":"My personal favorite Bangles album","review":"Of all the albums that The Bangles have put out in the 1980s, Everything is my personal favorite album. I always like the songwriting, pop hooks, and the harmonies between the four members. I recently acquired a cd copy of the album and have found myself falling in love with the music all over again. I find myself relating to the lyrics in the songs as much as a I did when I was a teenager, especially on tracks such as \\"Complicated Girl\\" and \\"Some Dreams Come True\\". My personal favorite tracks features now former bassist Michael Steele \\"Glitter Years\\", and \\"Complicated Girl\\". \\"Glitter Years\\" reads like a great story right out of the glam rock years in the '70s. I will say that I prefer the version of \\"I'll Set You Free\\" on the band's greatest hits album over the version on Everything. I also wasn't big on the melodies and lyrics on \\"Watching the Sky\\". Just not my favorite song but overall I still give Everything five stars. Just love this album and the band."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Bangles Get Boring","review":"From their very first single (back when they were just \\"The Bangs\\"), I bought the Bangles' records as soon as they were released. I was never disappointed until this, their last album. The group gets all dolled up for the cover with glamorous looks, then attempts to sound more \\"mature\\" and \\"adult,\\" and as a result they put out this lackluster album. It is overproduced, saccharine, and just boring. The only song that I think is really worthy is the Michael Steele song \\"Complicated Girl,\\" a simple melody with great '60s harmonies and sparse production compared to the other excesses like \\"Eternal Flame.\\" Go with one of the earlier albums instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything for everyone","review":"EVERYTHING is the Bangles' third album,released in the fall of 1988.

DULL, & I LOVED these girls. Why isn't \\"Everything I Wanted\\" on this album? U can hear it on GREATEST HITS. The girls thot it didn't fit in here, but it sure woulda spiced-up this dull fiasco -- MayB woulda lifted it up 2 3 stars....

There are also pages inserted in the Bible on different Orthodox traditions as well as full page icons. Once you start reading, often you are inspired to dig deeper into the subject and learn more and there are a bunch of other Orthodox publishings out there on a variety of topics, especially from Light-n-Life Publishing.

The Holy Apostles Convent has published a two volume version of the New Testament that is heavily annotated with comments of major figures of Orthodoxy such as St. John Chrysostom, and is probably the more scholarly of the two versions. However, I still find the accessibility of the writing in the Orthodox Study Bible to be extremely helpful. and often read the versions together. The list of individuals who worked to create this Bible is a veritable who's who of contemporary Orthodoxy, and I certainly don't feel even remotely qualified to criticize their efforts.

Bit inside, I found long, detailed discussions of basic, operating system functionality like saving documents and such. Wading through this oh so basic stuff goes on for 600 pages. The best part was a discussion of AppleWorks where I actually learned something. Finally, I reached the UNIX part and all that appears is a short list of commands and descriptions. There are no examples. There is nothing to help you use UNIX. Out of 700 pages, I found, perhaps, 50 that were somewhat useful. And for what I wanted, I found nothing.

Apple's implementation is very interesting and they have done a bang-upjob in synthesizing a beautiful GUI with a kick-a** operatingsystem.From a \\"power-user's\\" point of view, there are numerous differencesbetween BSD and OSX that should have been covered in a \\"Complete\\"reference. Foremost amongst these is how to use \\"NetInfo\\"to manage deamons, printers, etc... There are a number ofgood books on general Unix admin.

Most of it is simply a longwinded explanation of the basics, and the advanced section is far to short and lacks too much detail. Take the section on programming: what's the point? It's so short, it's not going to do much of anything for you.Also, from what I read, the author clearly doesn't understand object-oriented programming very well. He says that OOP-based programs should avoid using 'if' constructs.

What is missing is good book design and good editing. The book is unnecessarily repetitious and it is impossible to follow the outline easily without keeping one finger in the table of contents. A trained editor would have made use of the many possibled variations of type fonts to clearly distinguish main points from sub points. All levels are in the same face, same style, with miniscule size differences. Whatever happened to ALL CAPS, italic, caps and little caps, underline, and the other possibilities?

The two books cost and weigh the same, yet the ratio of useful text to overall text in Mr. Pogue's book is nearly one, while I'd be hard pressed to even rate Mr. Feiler's text with 0.3.

They even have a preceding introduction to the concert footage saying that there were \\"NO OVERDUBS, REMIXES, PITCH CORRECTION, AUTO TUNING, or 'CORRECTED' MISTAKES in the following recording. It is raw and it is real.\\" As if giving it that X-TREEEME outlook is supposed to change the fact that the footage looks and sounds like utter sh*t.

I like this whole CD in fact!Former General Music.. sales rep., Chris Anthony, created a demo for the General Music S2 Music Processor Synth (now evolved into the GM Equinox) of the song \\"Prime Time.\\" It was Chris, a very talented British keyboardist, who introduced me to this group and their music at Chuck Levin's Washington Music Center in Wheaton, Maryland a few years ago demoing the GM S2 synth.This group has a very unique sound and that's why I still keep buying their newer CDs, but this one is a stand out among their work! I highly recommend it to synthophilles or as great road music for a trip..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short-lived","review":"The quartz halogen Dual Brite security lights worked fine at first however, one bulb burned out fairly soon (about a year). Shortly after replacing the burned out bulb, the whole thing stopped working. When I went to replace the bulbs again, I found that the ceramic electrodes that hold each end of the halogen bulbs had crumbled causing them to burn out. I have an old yard light that uses the very same halogen bulbs that was on my house when I bought it almost 20 years ago and it still works flawlessly. I'm fortunate that the Dual Brite unit didn't short out and start a fire. These things are built to sell, not built to last. I now have to either find replacement ceramic bulb holders (fat chance) or replace the whole thing. My next security light sure as h_ll won't be a Dual Brite!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A worthy effort!","review":"If you havent heard any 'new' Steppenwolf in a while then this is the one for you.

This incarnation of 'The Wolf' is worth a listen."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want some authentic live Steppenwolf...don't buy this","review":"This is a brand new release from the current edition of Steppenwolf which is John Kay and none of the other original members. Strangely enough though is that the current edition has been together a lot longer that the real deal. But that's neither here nor there because this band is just too slick. There is no edge here from a band that had a lot of edge in their day. John Kay still has a strong distinctive voice but it too has mellowed with age and who wants mellow with their \\"heavy metal thunder\\"? I know I don't. Some people might say that's expected with middle age but I don't see that happening with other music legends like Eric Burdon, Iggy Pop or Neil Young. Plus half the concert consists of new songs which are truly horrible! If you want some authentic live Steppenwolf, buy the original MCA title released in 1971."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Python history on video","review":"I'm not a Python completist, but I do have the DVDs, the 40th anniversary Almost the Truth, the 30th anniversary Life of Python, and a few other things. For some reason, I found this to be the most entertaining and understandable. Disc 1 clearly lays out the origins of the group, telling the story more clearly than the other works. It doesn't get bogged down in the movies or the various solo careers. The second disc is a good retelling of their success in America, a story which does not seem to be told in any of the other discs I have seen (though, like I said, I'm not a completist).Even though it seems to be cut from interviews done for the 40th anniversary set, there doesn't seem to be too much overlap. For my money, this is the best intro to the group's history, with something to interest newcomers and long-time fans alike."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unclear titleing","review":"The actual contents of this disc consist of interviews with the Pythons and their associates and material relating to their American tour. Its well done, and I especially enjoyed seeing what the late middle-aged Pythons look like now. But the title of the album does not make it clear that this is a documentary about the Pythons and not a compilation of their performances. It therefore is for some people not what they expected, and hence disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Weird","review":"I didn't like this movie at all.It wasn't funny and it was just a strange movie.I usually like James Franco that's why I wanted to see this movie but his character is so unlikeable.The only thing I liked about this movie were the colored horses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Waste Your Time Watching This","review":"Described on the DVD case as a \\"romantic comedy,\\" anything comedic in this film immediately fizzles out. Wikipedia calls it a \\"horror comedy,\\" which is half correct. Opening with a young bride's completely inexplicable devotion to a zero of a guy, followed by developments which make no sense even if one accepts this \\"fantasy\\" movie's absurd premises, the following 90 minutes of slog presents a terrible way to spend precious lifetime on Earth, and waste a Friday or Saturday evening.Yes, the actress looked wonderful in the red wig. And Scott Glenn's performance, as always, was great. Still, do avoid this piece of trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"B and C Actors in a D Movie","review":"Blu Ray transfer looked decent.

I was halfway through the movie when I wanted to turn it off, but I gave it the benefit of the doubt and continued to watch the whole thing. Big mistake...The movie has a very interesting storyline and is definitely the best part of the movie. The acting was certainly sub-par with a lot of forced dialogue and very predictable lines.

When my wife tried to rip this into MP3 format for her portable player it generated a lot of errors and that's when we dicovered we had been sold something other than the original product.I'm disappointed that Amazon is selling this type of product, that resembles what most of us would have called a bootleg CD a few years ago, even if Sony has given them permission to do so.

That \\"secret\\" is written in 10 ancient strolls who were given to him by another rich merchant before he died.

The stroll marked 2 starts with this sentence: \\"I will greet this day with love in my heart\\" and number 4 begins with \\"I am nature's greatest miracle\\".This is the kind of insights you may expect from any book but a one called \\"The greatest salesman in the world\\".

He does this through simple and direct parables which are woven into a profound story, with clever plot twists to explain the 10 principles for successful salesmanship as well as success in life.I loved to read the book because it is small and can be read and finished in a couple of hours and yet leave one with a deep impression.

I have seen a few negative comments about the mount but in my experience these comments come from inexperience which is understandable. For those who beleive the mount does not fit a certain TV, make sure your TV is vesa standard compliant [Some TV's are not]. I have yet to find a TV that was not compatable with the mount up to and including 70\\" TV's.Mi-Mount [or amazon] just needs to get that price back down to around $35.00....after shipping I consider that a good deal.

I shut it down and proceeded to call the company, just to get a run around and they were not even concerned about the dangerous heater. After arguing on the phone for an hour with three different people, they said that if I paid postage to send it back they would replace it with another one.

If you value your wallet don't buy one of these products. In my opinion they are a scam and no one should plan on purchasing one to save money.

That one didn't work any better and it went off constantly. I replaced it again - and that one didn't work either. I am now on my 4th replacement which is a different model - with a remote - that I received in September 08. That one didn't even turn on. I am now told that the warranty is over - based on the FIRST ONE - not the replacement units. This one will go in the junk yard. Save your money. Go to Home Depot or Lowe's.

New England gets really cold and I want to buy her one of these great heaters.I have used mine (a gift) for more than 5 years. It heats my home quite comfortably and reduces the need for my oil furnace to kick on, saving fuel costs.I wonder if the negative comments are coming from competitors... When I read some of them I decided to add my 2 cents.If your unit stops or the house doesn't feel so warm as usual, clean the filter.Other electric heaters I have had over the years always had to be within a few feet of me or I was still cold. That meant having heaters in several rooms and high electric bills.The EdenPure is just the opposite.Don't put it next to you. Place it away from you in an open area.

It's 63 degrees outside, sunny and of low humidity. This heater has been running in my house for two days and never gets the area to 72 degrees. The room is 15x18. It should easily be able to do this. The $19 space heater I bought at Target can cook us right out of the room on a 30 degree night. How this company keeps selling these heaters is beyond me.

A 1500 watt heater produces 5118 BTU/hr. So a big buck space heater puts out the same amount of heat as a $19 heater or 15ea 100 watt incandescent light bulbs.And at $.10/KWH a 1500 watt load (5118 BTU/hr) on for a month (30 days) would cost, $108.00I'm buying a $19.00 space heater."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please do not waste your money on this!","review":"My compassion for my fellow man demands that I implore you not to waste your money on a rip-off product such as this.

The company also \\"repaired\\" the original unit and shipped it back to me giving me two units that whistle. I contacted the company and they mailed me a return lable for the original \\"repaired\\" unit to be shiped back to them.

Their next suggestion was taking it to a repair shop or buying replacement bulbs ($40) as that \\"may\\" be the problem. Of course the heater is out of warranty.

The style is easy going rather than academic! I do suggest doing some kind of counselling course before reading the book because some of the concepts are related to that area; the book has made me appreciate what really happens in human communication. The areas are well researched with quotes and personal experinces which give the book substance.

The colours are slightly off, and not as RICH as the other book.I did a master copy painting class, and used this book, and found out that it was not true to the color of the original painting.Too much life story for my use, but im sure if you want to know about her, this will be just as good as any. She was quite a painter!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hypnotically Erotic!","review":"This is one of the most erotic CD's I've ever heard!

Sade is focused on doing the music which she wants to do, rather than trying to make chart toppers - this gives this a soothing element that's hard to find elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"This girl is too tight!","review":"Wow. Sade strikes again. As usual, Sade has made a way excellent album. I listen to it every day because I love it so much. Her pictures wallpaper my room. She is a goddess. And Stronger Than Pride is a really good album. I wish I could get everybody I know to listen to it. Sade's kind of singing is different from any others that I've heard. I think I'm gonna love her forever. Matter of fact, I know it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply timeless...Simply the best!","review":"We are now living in a time where music just in not real music. When my Sade CD arrived, I was so thrilled. While I was listening to every song, enjoying a nice glass of wine every now and then, I was amazed by the pure vocals of Sade. Her background vocalist and her musicians are incredible. She is simply timeless and you would not believe this CD was released as early as it was. It sounds like she just released it. This CD is for sure one to add to your collection and you will enjoy everytime you listen to it. Sade's voice hangs over you like a blue light mist and her music surrounds you and wraps you up and doesnt let you go until the very last song ends. I love her."},{"rating":"2","title":"stronger than pride","review":"there is only two words t say(THE BEST)I am very happy after waiting so many year for Sades new recording."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love Is....","review":"The opening title track is easily her best ballad. Listen to it in a room all alone on a rainy, quiet afternoon. The gentle, soothing, African-flavored percussion and muted guitar backing will have you floating on a cloud. When she intones \\"I still really, really love you, love is stronger than pride\\", you will be instantly enveloped in her womanly warmth. The upfront bass and drums of \\"Paradise\\" will draw you in even deeper and the rest of \\"Stronger...\\" is just as inviting. Several tracks from this album have become light FM jazz staples, and with good reason. Sade (the entire band, not just the lead vocalist) create upscale, classy, relaxing yet urbane and imaginitive music that sounds perfect in any enviroment. \\"....Pride\\" is a welcome addition to any collection, and will both relax and uplift you with every listen. This wonderful album hasn't aged a day since 1988 and is highly reccommened."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard to get shocked","review":"Shocking Arm Wrestling - great idea and would be excellent fun, but the hard plastic cuffs seem designed for someone with small fists and wrists and average-sized or large people will find the edges of the cuffs dig into their opponents wrists and the contacts that create the shock don't touch your skin - so no shock. The shock is BIG when you get it...but it's hard to deliver. Would have worked much better if the cuffs were flexible, not hard plastic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Belkin USB","review":"The Belkin Components 16ft USB Ab Device Gold cable is an excellent, well-built, sturdy high-speed cable, that works well with my Photo Printer, and every other high-speed device that I have.

There are only about 5 charts that I would find useful for myself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth reading","review":"Kahn's skill at capturing and conveying nuance, the highlight of his sports books, is not as evident in this effort, but it is still an interesting take on one of the better known student revolts of the 60's. Student revolt in the 60's, a phenomenon entirely apart from the \\"turn on, tune out\\" hippie movement, is a topic beyond the scope of a single volume, but the fact that both the students and administrators were still feeling their way in those days is skillfully conveyed. There is a negative review of this book on Amazon whose author seems to have an agenda beyond his or her review. One can't quibble that most Columbia students came from financially secure homes but I don't think that distinguished this skirmish from those taking place at other universities, or serves to trivialize the phenomenon at all. This book is worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trashy Book On Trashy People","review":"This only interesting thing about this trite and dated account of the student revolt is that the author takes these self-indulgent kids so seriously. These self-styled \\"revolutionaries\\" came from comfortable homes and went on to yuppie lives but spent their college years engaged in self-congratulatory political masturbation. They should simply have been expelled at their first violation of the laws, and they are worth a magazine article at best, certainly not a tedious and ideologically shrill book. Grayson Kirk was right."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is THE worst video I have EVER seen","review":"Do not, I repeat, Do not, waste your money or time on this video - that is unless you are suffering from insomnia and need something to put you to sleep. This is one BORING video. It looks like someone shot the video from as far away as they could possibly get, e.g. from across the street, or on the opposite side of a big field. The video is out of focus throughout and all you get are shots of the backs of people's heads. They should have named this video the \\"Black College Freaklessfest because there was NOTHING going on in this video. You'd see more action sitting in church than you would sitting in front of this video...As you can see, I can't say enough bad things about this video.The bottom line: These guys didn't work hard enough to earn or deserve your money, so keep it in your pocket."},{"rating":"1","title":"PURE JUNK!","review":"mannnnnn did I get shafted this thing is sooooooo flimsy WOW, it bork instantly and the light it did give off was totally useless! do not buy this thing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"good video light","review":"good video light that does not use up your video camera battery power as it got it's own battery. light is good eoungh for near by shots. however need to remove the video light when changing batteries for my case. overall, good product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not bad","review":"I was not as impressed with this CD as I wanted to be.

The characters are realistic and believable as they interact with their new-found world. Behind the surreal fantasy however lies a social commentary on how our world is and was, and the growth of the characters in maturity and understanding of life as the story progresses is inspiring"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as impressed as others","review":"I read the book several years ago and found it silly, fairly unengaging, and filled with poor dialog.One other problem, and this is only partially the author's fault, is that the material is fairly cliché riddled.Granted, the book is fairly old and predates a lot of other DM transports characters into the game, but the idea wasn't really new then either."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best beginning of a fantasy series EVER!!!","review":"I have read this book numerous times. I love everything about it . . . it changed the way I look at life . . . and gave me a hope that I have never had before."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"This is the book that got me back into reading. It is a wonderful tale of a group of college role-players who are transported into the world and bodies of the very game they were playing. The story has many twists and unexpected surprises. I would recommend the entire trilogy. The stories that appear later on in the series are hit or miss for me, but the original three are the best."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read a long time ago...Finally 'refound' it","review":"I borrowed this book 12 years ago in high school.

The edges are not ergonomically aligned to fit an average hand when seated at a desk. Over the course of a day's work, the mouse's rigid edges rub the user's fingers uncomfortably. Otherwise, it's a mouse. Tracking is average. Clicking resistance is average."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Japanese Music!","review":"This CD is great if you are just getting into Japanese music, and have not been exposed to much of it. It spans dance, to rock, to rap and pop music. I was a little disappointed that they included an anime theme song in the list, but L arc en ciel is a very popular band in Japan, so it makes sense to put their latest hit on the CD.My personal favorites are Orange Range's \\"Shanghai Honey,\\" Aiha Higurahi's \\"Baby Beautiful\\" and Asian Kung Fu Generation's \\"NGS\\"However, I was disappointed by the ACO and Takkyu Ishino songs included on the list, but otherwise, it is a great CD from beginning to end!"},{"rating":"1","title":"MAJOR DISAPPOINTMENT!!","review":"I bought this CD during a visit to J-town in San Francisco last year and I was shocked at how un-listenable the CD was, I think I only liked two of the tracks. The mix overall is very uneven, I wouldn't consider this as a fair sampling of available jpop, this is an unfortunate rubbish tip packaged for quick sale to the poor soul looking to explore a rich and fun musical vein."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad for a DOS game","review":"There are four games here. All four are DOS games. Battle Chess 4000 and CD enhanced ches both may have some problems with the EMS manager you are using. They need EMM386.EXE. Chinese Chess had a problem with a sound driver for digital sound. If you are using Windows XP or higher I recommend using a virtual machine to run these games. Microsoft Virtual PC sp1 runs DOS quite well."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTING","review":"When we were reading product description my husband was very excited. However, not only did it arrive later than noted it was very disappointing. What the product description said & what we got were two diffeerent things. We also ended up buying the actual chess set elsewhere. I would not recommend this to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different kinda country!","review":"A melancholy, slowcore indie-alt homage to 1960s/'70s outlaw songwriter Kris Kristofferson, featuring modern artists such as Califone, Calexico, the Radar Brothers, Creeper Lagoon, Court & Spark, and others. The overwhelming rock/lo-fi slant of this album makes it a bit of a fish-out-of-water curiousity. I suppose it's a good match, though, for Kristofferson's own overly-deliberate songwriting style. Don't expect much twang on this album, outside of a couple of tracks by Richard Buckner and Bay Area old-timey champs, the Crooked Jades. Kristofferson fans might also want to check out the more country-ish \\"DON'T LET THE BASTARDS GET YOU DOWN\\" collection, which was released at the same time, on a different label."},{"rating":"1","title":"All of them","review":"If you love listening to Kris, you will HATE this album.Sounds like a high school garage band or a really bad nightat a karaoke bar.Am very disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Tribute? You've got to be kidding.","review":"I have never heard a collection of as much trash in my life. I listened to try to find just one redeeming thing about this album and was unable to. Perhaps I am just too old but I can only think of a bunch of non-musicians sitting around after too much drink and smoke and believing that they are going to make a hit record. I am ashamed of myself for relying on the Kristofferson name and being taken by 3 of the 4 reviews I read.It is no wonder there were no tracks to listen to on Amazon. Never again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't do Metal in a bathroom","review":"I like the look, but it's so hard to keep clean.

I got a couple, but then thought I needed more, so I purchased five more here.It took a few weeks to realize that they literally come apart (the plastic plates are not riveted to each other) easily, and all of the pieces fall apart. You then have to assemble it back together, only to have it shear apart again. I needed to literally tape the halves together after being continually frustrated.So, I do not recommend you get these. They are more of a hassle than they are worth in \\"clever.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible set. Do not buy!","review":"I bought this set for my 3 yr old who is going through a \\"everything Wizard of Oz\\" faze. The previous reviewers are right. There are a million pieces. The threading is coming apart after only a week. The clothes are also too small. My daughter loves the Dorothy dress but its a pain and she complains that the sleeves are not attached, the undershirt un-velcros in the back whenever she bends over and I already had to re sew the straps to the dress because they came apart. One of the Ruby slippers snapped in HALF within the week! She barely touches the Glenda and the witch costume. My recommendation would be to get after market Halloween costumes of the characters which even if they are cheap will be MUCH better quality than this trunk. Interesting idea but very cheaply made and not meant to withstand little girls constant changing and playing. Terrible set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete Junk","review":"This is complete junk. The clothes are more of scraps of material that you piece together than clothes - you can't really tell this in the photo unless you study it. My child is 3 years old and has a small, slender build and the clothes barely fit her. The 'cute' storage truck is some cardborard stock you fold to put together, which doesn't seemed designed to stay together on it's own. Also, there's no photo on the trunk. Buy something else!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"I ended up buying another set of costumes....too many bits to the outfits (frustrating for little ones trying to keep it all together), shoes not the safest for 3yr olds - one of the hats too big the other too small.Pity as the concept is great sadly though quality definitely not worth the $20. My 3yr old is slim and these costumes are too small on her.Lastly the trunk that it comes with does not stay together unless you use a lot of tape.Hope this review helps - if I had someone giving me a heads up about this product I definitely would have thought twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Some of the clothes wouldn't fit a 1 yr old","review":"I was a little disappointed to see the clothes from the dress up trunk. When my daughter took them out on Christmas day and started trying them on, we all broke out in laughter. The shirts that they included in the trunk came up to her upper chest area. I'm not sure who they made these shirts to fit, but they don't fit my very skinny 4 yr old or my 3 yr old son who is shorter in stature then my 4 yr old. Some of the clothes are cute but I would save your money and buy something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute, but not what I expected","review":"This is a very cute dress up trunk--however, Glenda's witch crown fit me, the bad witch was really little and the shirts to all three outfits was really short--which was a problem for my daughter. She likes her shirts to be long enough to tuck in and these definately weren't even close. If that isn't a problem for your little girl, this would probably be fine--just have to deal with the size difference in the witch hats."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed with this","review":"When I received this and opened the package immediately I was disappointed, the outfits have too many parts to them. The Dorothy dress sleeves are not attached, the neck part is not attached and the blouse is not attached to the jumper. I had to end up getting my sewing machine out and attaching the arms to the blouse because my grand daughter was so frustrated in the sleeves falling down. All the outfits the sleeves are seperate. The toy cardboard chest is a JOKE. My husband and I took forever to figure out how the box parts fit together and then they would not stay together I had to end up getting out my stapler to keep them stay in place. For the money it not worth it. I must say that once I made all the adjustments my granddaughter will NOT part with her Dorothy dress. The rest of the outfits she could care less about so if you little one is into The Wizard of Oz and like Dorothy try some other site to buy only the dress."},{"rating":"1","title":"Runs Small, Too Many Pieces, Bad Trunk","review":"The costumes run very small.

Listen to the reviews, do not buy this!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Junk","review":"I bought this for my 3 and 5 year old girls, who have fallen in love with the Wizard of Oz this year. This trunk and the clothes are a total waste. Cheap, oddly fitted, and did I mention cheap? Each outfit comes in several pieces, so no real dress, just skirts, shirts, sleeves (yes, even the sleeves are separate). Crap material as well. Really, it's a huge waste of money. Better to invest in one solid dress-up piece than this trunk. Garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excitement Deflated","review":"This is a fantastic dress up idea but just isn't right for the manufacturer's age recommendations of 3-6 years. With the exception of the shoes, this item would be good for 2-3 year olds. I am sorry I didn't heed warnings on how small the clothes are. This was purchased for my 4-year-old. She wears a size 4T-5T in her regular clothes and these dress up items were too small to wear comfortably or decently. The shirts are too short showing her midriff and the elastic in the skirts and sleeves dug into her skin.One of the plastic shoes shattered a couple days after she received them and the cardboard trunk's lid does not stay together well.Like I said, this is a really great idea and it could be a very successful product if the manufacturer will make some improvements."},{"rating":"1","title":"The WORST thing I have EVER Bought","review":"My little girl saw this in a catalog and was so excited for Santa to bring it to her. I would NOT believe the poor quality when I opened it. First there is not really a costume. There just scraps of materia that you put on your arms and then there are skirts. My little girl is 3 years old and small for her age and cannot fit into any of it. The witches hat barely fits my 12 month old and the Glenda crown is a joke. The box is made of cardboard and falls apart - - i wouldn't call it a trunk.This is the ONE present she wanted and does not play with it a day after christmas. Save your Money!!!

I couldn't believe it when I watched them open their presents. Little pieces of scrap materials make up the costumes, most of them too small for even a three year old (and it is advertised for 3 an up???.

I learned my lesson, and will definitely read reviews before purchasing on line again."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money","review":"Since my 3 year old loves to dress up and The Wizard of Oz is my favorite movie, I bought this for her for Christmas. What a disappointment! The sleeves, tops, skirts and even the collars are seperate pieces. She can't put the costumes on herself because of this. The shirts are too short causing her belly to show. She likes to go out in costume, but I would never allow her to be exposed like that in public. One of the bows on a shoe fell off immediately and the wand came bent so it also immediately broke. These are some of the worst made, flimsy costumes I have ever seen. My daughter seems to like them, but with such terrible construction, they won't last long. We're returning them immediately. Please don't buy this product! Great idea, terrible execution!"},{"rating":"1","title":"very poor quality, impossible for child to put on independently","review":"These costumes are extremely overpriced. The shoes broke instantly before my daughter even put them on. The dresses come in shirt and skirt form,however the sleeves are unattached as a seperate piece and there is no way my daugther could begin to get them on herself, especially over clothes.

The sleeves aren't even attached. also, my 3 yr old is very normal size and could barely fit into the costumes. What a sad present, that we had to tell her to put it all back so we could return it!

However, they are the cheapest costumes out there and it shows. The ruby slippers broke the first day, without being mistreated at all! My daughter was walking across the carpeted den and the shoes snapped in half. (She is 4 and small for her age.) The Glinda costume ripped in a week. The \\"shirts\\" are too small, even for my 2-year old. It is not \\"one size fits all\\" and the sizes are not consistent, as the Dorothy dress is huge and would fit a 7-year old. The witch's hat doesn't even fit the head of my children's baby dolls (too small). If your kids are obsessed like mine, I would bite the bullet and buy a different product that is better made and will last longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"The product is of very poor quality","review":"The material is cheap and there are so many pieces to each costume that the kids will never be able to keep it all together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money...","review":"This dress up trunk is of very poor quality.

You and your child will be sorely disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected","review":"The quality of these dress up clothes was not at all what I expected.

I have a 3 year old and she is on the smaller size (2T), the tops only cover half her abdomen, she said Santa must not know her size. The witch hat looks as if it might fit a new born, definitely not a toddler, the diameter is maybe 4 or 5 inches. And the ruby slippers not only are they open toe (closed toe in the movie), but they are huge, makes no sense with the size of the clothes. One of the bows is also turned up and down and we can't turn it to go across the shoe. In retrospect I should have ordered the costumes individually. Other downside, no basket or Toto."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"We got this very quickly in time for Halloween but the sizes were variable - some were too small for my four year old and others were too big.

My highest praise and recommendation for this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"INAPPROPRIATE GIFT","review":"Because of all the wonderful reviews of this book, I decided to purchase it.

My husband and I had to laugh when we noticed that all the women are pictured full frontal while all the guys are shot from the back! I have since found that most massage books follow that same philosophy. It's interesting that, given the century and the subject material, a photographed (...) still seems to be taboo. I finally had to order a book aimed at gays in order to get actual pictures and how-tos on giving my partner a sensual massage."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Book Launched My Career...","review":"Before Gordon Inkeles, I didn't know if there was anyone in the world who shared my intrinsic belief of what a massage SHOULD be. Having experienced too many clinical and impersonal feeling massages in my life, I knew I had a good idea what massage should NOT be. This book transcends the limitations of traditional massage therapy and teaches you how to convey caring and warmth through touch.Knowing the strokes is just half the equation of massage. Massage as Gordon Inkeles teaches it is both physically healing and emotionally soothing. With his technique, you feel like a person being nurtured, not a series of parts being manipulated with detached professionalism. When a masseur doesn't care about the person they work on, you can feel it. Touch is personal. It can communicate positive, enriching energy, or indifference.This book launched my career. I can't rate it highly enough. I wish every masseur and masseuse in the world would read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Berndes Stockpot","review":"I discovered Berndes years ago when I purchased my first piece at an outlet store.

This novel was a reminder for me not to purchase a book just because it has a gay theme and is written by a gay author. The characterization was so wooden that it was almost humorous. The reviews I read must have been written by the author's friends or someone who has a lot of copies in inventory.

Additionally, when folding or unfolding the stand, the springs now seem to stick and are tough to open.When everything worked properly (brand new), the stand was exceptional. However, it did not take many uses to discover faults in the construction.This stand is very lightweight and I only use it indoors standing very close to my speedlight should it happen to fall over. Luckily I have never had this stand tip over on me.Overall, I'm disappointed, but the stand is very affordable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stand","review":"I love the stand.

I have a small home studio and have purchased several light stands of similar quality. This one by Westcott is very sturdy and quite well made. Adjustments are easy and the stand has a nice feel/weight to it. For the price and what it is, a light-weight light stand, I would highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid stand - not so compact","review":"This is a solid, medium weight stand. It does what it's supposed to do and is better for lights/flashes/etc that are on the medium weight side(or if you have softboxes). Frankly, I prefer my Manfrotto 001B, which is a super-light-weight 6 foot stand, and folds down much smaller. So in the end... as a studio stand, great. As a portable stand, not bad, but you can buy lighter. Build quality is fine and none of the hardware seems cheap. A previous review said this stand was \\"air cushioned\\" but it really isn't. It might have that effect in the right conditions but I own some true \\"air cushioned\\" stands and this one is not. For the price, you won't complain."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hunk of junk","review":"This was designed so poorly, it broke after only 4 or 5 shoots.I took it apart to see if I could fix it, and found they used tape in areas to keep parts together.Also, it is very easy to tip over."},{"rating":"1","title":"Light Stand","review":"I got what I paid for, not a sturdy stand at all.

It has a good maximum height (remember that if you're attaching an umbrella, you will need an additional 1-2 feet of vertical space), but doesn't collapse too small (it is about 2x the length of my tripod with the umbrella adapter attached). It is lightweight, but not very stable at max height with an umbrella and canon 430ex attached. It is made of cheap material, and the spring inside does not sound like it will last very long...it makes metal-on-metal sounds sometimes.However, it does what it's supposed to do, and at a low price.

Our 10 month old daughter has been standing and 'cruising' now for months, yet when she grabs onto the handle of this product, it moves from underneath her way too quickly (or just flips over!), and she falls hard to the ground! Even flat on her face at times! If your baby has control over this aspect (i.e. OLDER babies, or developmentally advanced ones), the product should be fine. BUT, if not, as is the case with many younger babies at the incipient stages of walking, this product can hurt your infant. The wheels should have some resistance built into them, so that the product does not roll out quickly from underneath the infant. BUYER BEWARE!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for kids over 12 months","review":"We visited family out of town last year and my son would not leave this toy alone the whole time we were there. We came home and bought him one. He was already over a year old and walking, so we never have used the \\"walker\\" feature on this. He will be two years old in a couple of weeks, and he still loves this toy. He'll load up all his toy cars under the \\"hood\\" and take off for a ride around the house. We even take it camping with us (we camp a lot) and he will scoot around the camp ground on this while the older kids ride their bikes.The only problem we had was when we first opened it up and put batteries in it. The lights and sounds did not work. After fiddling with it for a while (hoping I wouldn't have to return it), I found a loose wire connection to the battery compartment.

As luck would have we couldn't find it anywhere and ended up with this item. Our son loves it. He opens and shuts the hood and tries to put the shapes in the sorter. He races across our family room when the toy is in the walker mode and does try to ride it in the same mode. This toy has really helped strengthen Jason's legs.

She is an adventurous girl but even she doesn't like the \\"feel\\" of it going so fast. With the Little Tykes my son was walking by 11 months on his own. My daughter, I think due to the lack of practice with the laugh and learn, is 12 months and still just cruising. If you have hard wood I would not purchuse this walker.

She was learning to walk, and while it was a little difficult to use as a walker at first, as she got better at walking it worked better for her. She loved all the sounds she could make with it and played with it all the time. After 3 months, this toy suddenly stopped working. A change of batteries didn't help - it just suddently broke. We cannot get any sound from the toy. This was NOT caused by rough play - she was just playing with it normally and it stopped working. Unfortunately, the seller - eToys Direct - has a 30 day return policy, so there is nothing we can do about it. For a $30 toy to only work 3 months is highly unacceptable.

When I looked closer at the toy I realized that ‘The Abc’s under the lights, the eyes and the smile on the front of the car�?are all stickers that are put on by the manufacturer.

The sound on this is awful, very similar to the Stooges live recordings. If your familar with those, you know what I mean. I would have given it one star, but it is still a interesting listen, as I love The New York Dolls. I'm shocked they would release this the way it sounds.

If you are interested in the early space program as I am you will not want to waste your money on this film. It is not worth even the $5.50 I spent on it. It is a low-budget rendition of what can be found elsewhere. Even the scenes of the astronauts' houses are very clearly not filmed in the US and the other scenes are full of very evident short-cuts. Curious about where the film was done, I discovered it was in Lithuania! How in the world do you set out to do a film about the US space program only to end up filming it in the former Soviet Union? Florida and Houston could not have been that much more expensive.

The now legendary astronauts are portrayed as humans with quirks and flaws and also with the courage and determination to undertake a challenge that was just as likely to kill them as it was to change history. I enjoyed it far more than I would have enjoyed a more typical documentary featuring the same information and would recommend it to anyone interested in learning about the people behind the infamous video clips."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very bad version","review":"With a already 5 star documentry in VHS, why would anyone attempt to duplicate a lousey remake like this one. Naming it or otherwise using the same name as MOONSHOT is a discredit to the original.

These themes are by turns grand, nostalgic, quaint, romantic and beautiful. Don wrote just about all the tracks except for a lovely, meditative version of the Ravel Pavane. There are also a couple of vocal tracks along the way, \\"North Atlantic Sand,\\" a duet with Karen Peris that could easily have come from an Innocence Mission album; and \\"Young As You Feel,\\" with Denison Witmer. In all, Go When The Morning Shineth made for a very pleasurable listening experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Take a deep breath...","review":"Great to put on while working in the office, reading a book, or just chilling out. Almost all the songs are instrumental, and the couple that do have lyrics are very mellow.If you're a fan of Peris' work with the Innocence Mission, I'm sure you'll enjoy this album as well. The only drawback (as is the case with many instrumental albums) is that the tracks are pretty short, and the whole album's playlength isn't all that long."},{"rating":"2","title":"Protects Like a Tank, But Impossible to Push Buttons","review":"This thing is the most durable case for a MP3 Player by far. I dropped my Zune a couple of times and it didn't even scratch it. I was very pleased with the removable clip on the side too. If you are walking or working out, it's nice to have hands free music. The only problem with the case is pressing the buttons. In simple terms, it's really hard to press the buttons exactly. I accidently press stuff all the time. It's all thumbs. If you want something that is going to protect your player you HAVE to get this case. Just know that the case is cumbersome when using the controls.

You can plug it on the Belkin TunePower but you can't place it inside the TunePower.Another major problem is that you can't take your Zune out when you put it in! It's almost IMPOSSIBLE too!

There are plenty of noteworthy guitar licks and all original tunes, with the lone exception of the cover of Jessie Mae Hemphill's \\"In This World\\". As you might expect from this unusually large man, he is all over the place on this recording. The CD opens with \\"Slide Devil Man Slide\\" with lyrics spoken in a manner which made me recall the 70's \\"Hot Rod Lincoln\\" by Commander Cody. He maintains that rather awkward style on two other tracks, \\"Young Guns\\" and \\"Smugglers Game.\\" While that is style will not appeal to everyone, Popa returns to a rocking blues style on songs like \\"Long Deep Hard and Wide\\" and two up-tempo instrumentals, \\"Kinda Dicey\\" and \\"Buffalo Chips.\\" To me the standout track is the mid tempo \\"Why I Can't Have You.\\" Overall, this is not as good as some of Popa's earlier releases but in this day of cookie cutter blues, the originality of this composition is worth noting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Product","review":"No ventilation at all.

Previously, I was using an inexpensive (non-crepe) pan with fair results. I wanted a pan that would heat more evenly and quickly than my existing pan.The Berndes pan produces a perfect, lacy crepe that is consistent in size and texture. The shape of the pan makes it easy to handle the crepe at all stages. I have not had any issues with the non-stick surface. Though I use the pan regularly, I do admit there is very little contact with anything that may damage the surface. A silicone spatula loosens the crepe much better than a wood or plastic utensil.All in all, I am very satisfied with the Berndes crepe pan. If I ever buy another crepe pan, it will probably be this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"didn't hold up in the long run","review":"I have had this pan for four years, and it is completely pitted and the nonstick coating is peeling off.

I'm kind of grossed out to think how much Teflon we ingested before I noticed the pitting. I would not buy this pan again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this pan!","review":"This is the best pan I own. My others are all Calphalon, which I am learning to hate.

There is some rake, maybe 4-5 degrees, but tilting the tools to give some clearance results in negative rake.The other three bits--the C-type chamfer bit and the 90 and 60 degree V bits, were ground OK.More of an annoyance than a show-stopper, but the paint on the shank also covered the cutting edges, and you have to chip it off with a fingernail before you can get started."},{"rating":"1","title":"Short","review":"The bits are very short.

No sound in this case works just as well, but plays no music, a very very very good idea.

There are several flaws. Although it is big and kind of wraps around the baby, her foot is right by one of the trap doors where the balls come out and so it gets blocked. Also a big flaw is the center of it. The ball sometimes gets stuck in there. It needs to be more of a slope because the balls sometimes stop rolling once they get to the bottom. And... the dinosaur head does not always go back to the \\"upright\\" position and so the ball sometimes gets stuck.ALL IN ALL: Needs to go back to the drawing board. Then buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute toy","review":"My 9 month old daughter really enjoys the lights and music on this toy.

The kids just are not interested in it. The balls with different textures are a great idea but the holes are too small so the balls often get stuck.

His foot got lodged in it and his father had to saw through the plastic in order to get his foot out. It was a nightmare for the baby and his parents! This toy needs a recall!

My now 12 month old son loved it. He received it as a Christmas gift (he was 6 months old). When he started to stand, he would use this toy as a brace, and then he and the toy would fall. I had to hold down the toy every time he would play with it. The balls would frequently get stuck inside the toy. This was not much of a problem until my 2 year old neice helped my son get the balls out and her arm got stuck in between the pendulum and the dinosaur. It took 2 men to take the toy apart, myself to calm the screaming child and 45 min. which seemed like an eternity.

At the time he wasn't walking and he would try to use it to pull up on. It always toppled over. And since he's become mobile, he'd rather climb on it than use it the way it is meant to be used. He doesn't bother with the balls and just pushes the buttons to make the lights and songs turn on. All that said, for $[...] or so, it's not a bad buy. But now they are asking $[...] for these. That's just absolutely ridiculous. Totally a rip-off. If you go on ebay or craigslist, you can find them for $[...].

In fact the only use it gets is him crawling on it to get to something out of reach. He has played with it a few times but only because we were sitting right there playing with it with him.The balls get stuck in the middle hole and our son likes the sound and lights and all he does it stick his finger in the hole and make the sound and lights go off without the ball.Out of 6 mths he has maybe played with it five times (again because we were playing with it to get him to play with it) for about 2 minutes.

It is also a fun \\"interactive\\" toy--any one of us enjoys playing with it with her. Definitely worth the price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not impressed with the dinosaur","review":"I bought this for my first child when she was sitting on her own.

(All together there was a 4 year-old, a 2 1/2 year-old, a 9 month-old and a 6 month-old.) They all loved it! I admit that the two infants played more of a watching role, but the older ones really liked it. Now we are teaching our daughter (9 month-old) how to play with it. It takes a little teaching, but she is catching on and really likes to play. Plus, she is starting to climb up on things and enjoys \\"walking\\" around the dinosaur.

But, we have gotten our money's worth because he still plays with it and he'll be playing with it for some time to come. There are a handful of toys my son asks me to get for him to play with, this is one of them. He, truly, loves it.I have not had any problems with this toy as far as durabiliy goes.

He enjoys twisting and turning them checking out the objects contained within, as well as rolling them and chasing after them.As an infant/toddler toy I might recommend it more for young ones 9 months to year unless they are very coordinated.

I like to use it as a sort of \\"fence\\" so that he does not crawl to \\"off-limits\\" areas of the room. He likes somewhat the balls but he is absolutely not interested to learn how to put them in the holes. The music attracts him for a very, very short while. He uses the dino though to lean and help himself get on his feet sometimes. I was hoping he could do more with it. The balls get stuck very often, which is pretty disappointing for a prize-wining toy. The roar is very disappointing too.I hope he will learn to play differently with it in a near future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous....................","review":"At first I loved this toy.

My son got his arm stuck the circle on the orange plate and even somehow managed to twist his arm once in the toy. I had to unscrew the back in order to get his arm out. It took about 45 minutes and it felt like eternity. Needless to say my mom threw the toy out the very same night."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed!","review":"From the first time we played with this toy, the balls get stuck behind the pendulum behind the middle hole. My son got very frustrated with this. When I contacted Fisher Price, they said they could replace it if I shipped the toy to them & paid for the shipping myself. I boxed it up & the shipping was more than I paid for the toy. I think they should send me a shipping label to pay for their disfunctional product.

It is particularly useful for people working in the public health field such as health departments or researchers. However, it is also very handy for clinicians that want to know how to react in front of diseases that may not be common anymore. Specially useful is the chapter on surveillance and reporting.

It's not bad and only a tiny bit of extra work takes care of it. Lots of other less healthy products streak too. Compared to the other environmental products, it is clearly better.

It is VERY unsturdy and unsafe for crawling babies learning to walk. The accompanying play wall is awesome and my daughter can pull up on that, so you would think Fisher Price would make the attaching tunnel just as sturdy especially since it attaches to a toy used to learn how to pull up.

They did also say that it is a new toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sturdy...","review":"My child started crawling at 6 months and soon after was pulling up. I thought that this tunnel along with the climbing wall was would be perfect for him. The first day I brought is home my child pulled it on top of him self. It is very unsturdy. Now that my child has a little more control he can pull himself on it without falling but that took him a little while. We do play peek-a-boo with the side curtains and he has learned to crawl under the sides (commando style) which has been fun to watch. The climbing wall I bought with this was a much better purchase and I do recommend that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for advanced babies","review":"This toy might be good for babies that are not advanced. My baby is 8 months old and has been crawling, sitting and standing for a month now. She tried pulling up on the tunnel and it fell over on her. She grabbed the rattle toys and they hit her in the head. When I tried to take it apart...to return it, I couldn't! Once you snap the pieces in, they are in. You can't remove them. My husband even tried and we were afraid of breaking it so we stopped. If your baby is younger and learning to crawl and sit....this would be a fun toy. My daughter was very excited at first. After she couldn't pull up on it, she stopped playing with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this item","review":"We recieved this as a one year birthday present for our daughter. She had just begun standing at the time, and was still into full crawling mode. We initially thought it would be a good toy for her. However, she had little interest in the toy on her own but was interested when we played peek-a-boo around the tunnel with her. My main concern is that she stood up at the tunnel and fell over backwards with the unit on top of her with the plastic bar striking her on the mouth. This toy must be supervised by the parent to stablilize it when the baby pulls themselves up to stand at the tunnel. This toy should be rated only for babies that are not standing yet. She did gain enjoyment from pushing the music button but soon tired of that after a couple days. We returned the product, it was not possible to take it apart (perhaps intentional?), but we stuffed it into the box anyways."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same as the rest","review":"I just wanted to put my 2 cents in, but it's the same as the rest.

We got it for their 1st birthday and I thought they might be bored with it but was wrong. They both loved it and especially loved when one of them was in the tunnel and the other was out. But the love didn't last long. It only took a day before they started pulling up on it and both my girls toppled over bringing the tunnel with them. After the 3rd time we said enough, packed it back up and took it back. I love FP items, as evident to our playroom, but seriously, what were they thinking. It would be one thing if it was an item only for crawling babies, but they market it with an item that is obviously for babies pulling up and cruising. Don't waste your money, unless you plan on holding it everytime your little one gets near it. Such a disappointment!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangerous for little ones","review":"I just bought this for my daughter who is 8 months and learning to stand and pull herself up. I wanted to warn other parents about the dangers of this toy...and see that many others have had the same problem.

A parent must supervise the use of this toy and hold it down while your little one holds on. I would not reccommend this toy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"FUN BUT NOT SAFE","review":"Yes, please do pay attention when people say this item is not safe and listen. It is not sturdy AT ALL, and my son is constantly pulling it over on himself. He is pretty good at standing, though, and knows how to use it to help him without always doing this. Since he absolutely loves crawling through it (in connection with our Baby Gymnastics toy), I haven't taken it away from him. For the most part, this toy doesn't really do anything so he's not too interested in it. I was lucky I found this item on a Christmas-leftover clearance pile for $14, b/c it's not worth any more than that. I definitely do not recommend this toy for any child unless you are literally attached to your baby 24/7 to make sure they won't pull it down and crack themselves in the head with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fun if supervised...","review":"This toy is very unstable and tipped when my daughter pushed on it. It toppled over and she fell over with it. After the incident she disregards the toy for the most part. She seems to like when I lay with my head inside the tunnel and play peek-a-boo out the sides.Buy this toy if you don't mind your kid falling over on top of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great fun","review":"My son really enjoyed this tunnel. I did not leave him unattended (who leaves their crawling or starting to stand/walk baby unattended so that they fall and hit their heads?!) We covered it with his blanket and played peek a boo for a long time with this. Hiding toys around and inside it led to him crawling through and having fun learning that things are still there and he can get them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shame on Fisher Price!","review":"As much as my nine-month old enjoys this toy, I have put it away for good this morning. It is unsafe and is engineered quite poorly. One of the screws would not fit when putting it together, so we had to go to the hardware store to get another one. The sound also worked for less than a week. What is more disconcerting, however, is that like the other children in the reviews, my son constantly pulls this tunnel over on himself while pulling up. He has suffered many bangs and knocks since Christmas because of this toy. Shame on Fisher Price for creating such a poorly designed toy. DO NOT PURCHASE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Purchased Blindly","review":"This was a gift and did not see any reviews on this item!

The casting rarely works, and we often wonder, did they read the book at all?I watched the movie once; I will give it a chance. But Carnal Innocence is one of my favorite novels; I enjoy the characters immensely, yes, there are a few flaws in the plot, but overall, a very good read. The movie was just flat-out boring; neither of the leads clicked singly, or together, and as much as I enjoy Shirley Jones; that was just pitiful! Major parts of the plot were left out, but that's normal in these.So, don't think that just because it's based on Nora's books that we automatically love the movies, and don't bother with the movie; just go read the book again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sadly Lacking","review":"I enjoyed the book so much that I was excited to see it was made into a movie. It is too bad it had to be purchased and not just rented. The characters in the book were better than those presented on screen - and the story moved too quickly and yet they missed some basic things that would have been simple to include. Lesson learned - no more lifetime movies based on books - it is not worth the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carnal Innocence","review":"Love this movie! I saw it on lifetime and I had to have it. :) Would recommend to anyone who loves Nora Roberts' books and movies."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great movie","review":"Love the idea of Nora Roberts books being put into movie form. Gabrielle Anwar plays Caroline a violinist (Burn Notice). Collin Egglesfield plays Tucker Longstreet (Rizzoli and Isles). Together they are magic and a great couple.

The blade shape was not the same as what is pictured,they were just the wrong shape for a ctulass. The tip is sweeping and diamond shapped (wrong) and is way bigger and therefore way heaver than what we were looking for. I've had to do a lot of work cutting and grinding on them to make them look the way they we need them to look (as advertised was close that's whay we purchased them). We also had to make new scabbards for them to fit the new shape.I know, why not return them... We needed them for a field show and had less than a week when they arrived.

Punctuation and grammar was...very bad. Except for a few pieces of information that actually sounded like biographical content, and a few biographies (of a sort), I really didn't understand what is his point. Now if I read in between the lines....well, the author seems like a total manic depressant who looks for outside drama as an excuse about why his life is a struggle. But I bet that he spends most of his time on the couch watching sports, instead of preparing for his, or his daughter's, future."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawless Songs, Cheesy Arrangements","review":"The songs contained on this release are absolutley stunning. Cohen mixes a world weary point of view with a dry dark humor, and his verbage so economical that not a word is wasted. Cohen may not have the \\"golden voice\\" that he jokes about in TOWER OF SONG, but he nails the vocals on every song here with just the right emotion and inflection.Then comes the backing tracks. This could be a primer on cliched 80's production values. Cheesy synthdrums, backing vocals worthy of Diane Warren songs and generic keyboards would destroy lesser artists or tunes. Only TOWER OF SONG and EVERYBODY KNOWS get treatments worthy of their fine lyrics and vocals.I would love to see Cohen redo this album with a sympathetic producer, who would frame these dignified tunes with the backing they so richly deserve.

Some issues with installation. The tie straps were not long enough to go around the tree and the snaps used to attach to the umbrella come off too easy. Also the Pivot roller that the umbrella pole sits in would not keep the umbrella from tilting in a minor amount of wind. Once modifications were done to take care of these issues is worked pretty good. I would have liked to see gromet holes that secure the umbrella to the tree instead of snaps. Longer straps and a fixed \\"L\\" frame to provide more of a secure attachment to the tree.

In fact it is an essential read for anyone interested in the culture of the Southern states. His research goes beyond such inaccurate terms as 'Scotch Irish' to reveal a more accurate interpretation for the identity, culture and customs of the migrants from the British Isles into this region."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nonsense","review":"Although fun to read, this book relies almost exclusively upon English and Northern travel accounts, and their descriptions of Scots, Irish, Celtic, and American Southerners. Because they all share the same traits- lazy, drunken, idle, violent, uneducated- it is concluded that this Southern character directly stems from his Celtic ancestors.Although the South is clearly influenced by Celtic migration, the logic of following English accounts to portray Scots, Irish and Southerns as the same is illogical, considering English accounts of blacks and Native Americans (and almost every other culture they met) give the exact same descriptions. Suggesting that Africans and Scotsmen share the same decendancy, because Anglos have decribed both as lazy, violent and savage is ridiculous, yet this is exactly the logic that McWhiney follows.Scots and Irish influences are clearly felt in the South, but they are beyond the English and Northern comic book descriptions that McWhiney trusts"},{"rating":"1","title":"Repetitive: A compilation of quotes by other authors.","review":"This book was a compilation of quotes.

What no one has pointed out, however, is the extent to which his work is used to support the racist ideologies of the Neo-confederate movement, and the fact that McWhiney himself sits on the board of one if its most virulent organizations, The League of the South. Before you give your money to this man, please learn all you can about him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting, but perhaps overstates Celtic influence","review":"I read this book while writing my MA thesis concerning the origin of antebellum concealed weapon laws. While I generally agree with Cracker Culture's thesis -- that the South was dominated by a Celtic cultural survival, unlike the North, I believe that McWhiney and McDonald may have overstated the breadth of this Celtic survival. Much of the South's distinctive culture comes specifically from the Scots-Irish immigrants who arrived in the 18th century, setting up cultural patterns that survive even today. By the time Irish and Welsh immigrants arrive, the patterns were already well established."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cracker Culture:Celtic ways in the Old South by Grady McWhiney","review":"This is actually a text book that had me in stitches laughing.

The patriarchs of the south were mostly of English descent. Their plantations were mini-recreations of what they remembered the British Aristocracy to possess. Granted, there was a large Scottish influx in the south, especially in Virginia and North Carolina, the majority of Celtic Scots, Irishmen and Welsh settled in the North. It doesn't account for why more Irishmen, Scots and Welsh fought for the North and yet there was so much more hostility. Those Irishmen and Scots who fought in the North came from an Ireland and Scotland that was subject to the English and viewed the south, with its slavery, as a re-creation of what they'd left behind. They wanted no man to be subjected to such ways. The northern anglos referred to in this book came from the line of those who split with the crown. Cracker ways indeed! I wished I hadn't bought this one. It was a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Compelling if only anecdotal in connecting Southern & Celtic","review":"Relying on name comparisons between the Celtic forebearers and Southern descendants and drawing on many anecdotal comparisons of Anglo/Yankee -v- Celtic/Southern customs a strong case is presented that the War for Southern Independence was virtually ordained from the beginning of colonial development. The comparisons are overdone however, and obvious character contradictions in the evangelized and disciplined Southern personality exhibited during the late unpleasantness is not explained.

I have read the book though and certainly enjoyed it. I'm told that it covers more material than the video so together they probably make a good set.Mr Elgie's comments regarding the lack of depth are probably correct if the book is anything to go by. This is not necessarily a bad thing though as it provides the reader or viewer with a good overview of the whole 4,500 yr period.

After 3 months, the first bulb simply quit working. I sent it back and after about a month without a bulb I received a replacement from the company.

Unfortunately I could not find the box or anything else proving when and where a purchased the bulb. So, that same day, November 3, 2011, I went to Pet Smart And told one of the cashiers about the issue and he told me that the dome that I had was wrong. Not only did I have to buy a brand new UV light but I bought an \\"appropriate\\" dome as well. When I got up this Morning (January 7, 2011) to turn my dragon's light on, it came on and went right off...

My first few sessions were not so great, so the stable owner who is a centered riding certified instructor, gave me a few lessons on a longe line and bareback pad. What a difference! By studying the basics in Chapter 2, and focusing on how my body moves with the horse, I've become balanced and confident after just 3 hours of lessons. I'm not normally a fan of programs that use imaging to achieve results, but Ms. Swift appears to have hit on a method that puts me back in the saddle so both the horse and I are comfortable."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the book!!","review":"Whether you're just learning to ride English or may already know how but want to really understand what your trainer is telling you, this is the book. Sally Swift really knows what she's talking about when she show's you different exercises to help achieve a better seat, balance and comfort level for both you and your horse. I've been taking lessons on my own but with the help of this book, I am better able to understand what my instructor is telling me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book on centered riding","review":"This is really the only decent book on how to ride centered. The only problem is that the imagery is more confusing than it is helpful at least for me. But I am the kind of person that needs to be told how to do something(tilt your pelvis, relax your ankles) rather than be told to think like a tree(whatever that means!!!)I still recommend this book because it does contain excellent detail on the proper way to ride. The anatomy lessons are excellent and explain WHY(based on physics) you have to sit a certain way. I just find myself rereading this book over and over to get a full appreciation of the information."},{"rating":"1","title":"The title says it all.","review":"And I mean all.

Not expecting practical items but at least material that was researched and had some credibility. Boy was I wrong.

About the only use I will have for this book is to level out a wobbly table or maybe to start a fire using the paper. Save your money.The title had hooked me. I'll save you the trouble. To \\"Catch a Pig\\", use a covered pit that is baited and be careful extracting the pig. There you have it, the basis for the entire title is one sentence.Oh yeah, I would have given it \\"0\\" stars, but thats not an option."},{"rating":"1","title":"Historical Lessons of Marginal Practical Value","review":"When I purchased this book, I went in with my eyes open knowing that it is a collection of campfire stories and old \\"best way\\" methods. I had hoped, though, that I would gain a little insight into some practical tips and suggestions for today's nature enthusiast. And though there were some, there were very few. The redundancy and laughable suggestions (use a 8'- 10' fishing pole for pike; the best fishing poles are bamboo) eroded the practical application of the remaining insights. So if you're looking for a lesson in firearms (35% of content) or entertainment of how things used to be done before technology entered the outdoor world, the book has real value. If you're looking for tips and suggestions on how to survive in the bush or to support a true roughing-it camping experience, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expensive Dud","review":"This bulb lasted less than 4 months.

I figured I would try this out and for the most part it helps. Also, fennel and peppermint teas, or just herbs brewed as a tea, help calm stomach problems naturally.I would and probably will buy this and keep it around as a natural fix for stomach upset. As I have read in other reviews, most of the time you will get a little indigestion-type backlash from the peppermint, but it just makes my breath taste minty. It's not uncomfortable or anything.

With there big hit \\"You Spin Me Round (Like A Record)\\", \\"Brand New Lover\\", and \\"Something In My House\\", you can't help but put on your dancing shoes and dance like a mad person in your living room, or move around like a mexican jumping bean in your car while people look at you thinking you are ready for that padded room. Dead or Alive's songs may sound similar to each other, but heh?, I like the beat and it is easy to dance to."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great album","review":"This album contains all the old stuff by Dead or Alive (the good stuff). The music really kicks you into a dance mood. Some may complain that the synth-style music is cheesy, but actually, that's what makes the music awesome. Dead or Alive has a lot of talent and their creativity shows. Don't complain that synth-style lacks innovation-- this band doesn't let you down. All the tracks on this CD are remixed for continuous, fast-paced, dance music (the songs are very catchy; you can listen to them repeatedly and not become bored). For best results, turn up volume very high and boost the bass. It's impossible to sit still when hearing Dead or Alive. Go now and order this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"This CD is GREAT...But The VIDEO is even Better!","review":"I have always been a fan of the \`80\`s Synth-pop dance music genre,and no band had it down better than Dead or Alive...and this CD with one track segued into the next is awesome...But GET THE VIDEO!! See this band bring down the house at Budokan in 1987!!! Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the import version with the bonus track","review":"The Import version of this CD can be gotten pretty inexpensively from amazon marketplace, and what makes it a gem for Dead or Alive collectors is that, as a bonus track, it has the full length 12\\" version of \\"Turn Around and Count to Ten\\". It stands completely alone and is not continuously mixed with the rest of these chopped up edits. As of this writing, that is the ONLY place you can get the full 12\\" version of that song on CD, and it pushes this mere 35 minute disc closer to 45 minutes. I just wish they had added a bunch more 12\\" versions as bonus tracks to bring up the CD duration."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dead or Alive rules!","review":"This CD is definately one, if not THE best, album ever recorded by Dead or Alive. They are an awesome synthesizer sound/beat dance group. Pete Burns, lead singer, has the most incredible voice you will ever hear! Buy this album and you'll be dancing! The synth used is too extreme for words. They sing YOU SPIN ME ROUND, which is something a lot of people would probably recognize from 1985. I'm 15 and absolutely in love with them!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not required. Oh no SONY!","review":"Epic, whatever! This LP just isn't necessary. Don't waste your time. This LP is an afront to my musical soul. Pete Burns would agree, just nothing. Put your $$$ on \\"Nude\\" instead of this rubbish. What a shame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Painful to listen to","review":"Ouch. This really hurts. Dead or Alive could have released their greatest hits as a CD single, and saved a bunch of album space.Yeah, \\"You Spin Me Round (Like a Record)\\" is a great track. \\"Brand New Lover\\" has an incredibly catchy vocal hook, the kind that can get stuck in the head for days on end. The final two tracks, \\"In Too Deep\\" and \\"Hooked on Love\\" are passable...barely. The rest of the album sounds like overdone synthesizer noodling and screechy dancefloor gimmicks. The songs aren't particularly memorable, and, as a result of the overdone productions and general musical messing around, not even really fun to dance to.Unless you loved their albums in the '80s, and Dead or Alive is a proven quantity to you, don't bother with this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Zakk is Awesome!!!","review":"My favorite album of the year!

It's so well-written, it's fun just to thumb through.I am surprised at how much of this overlaps with the 1987 revised edition. The typeface is darker (thank goodness), and the layout has changed, but the content really hasn't. Do debaters still use index cards? I much prefer the 3rd edition.

Characterizations are believable and quickly developed in the compact and economic fashion suited a page turner. Flawed protagonist, Gallegher, possesses honorable (and not so honorable) attributes that bring you on his team. I liked it in the vein of a Mike Hammer tale with Stacy Keach, a likeable and standup guy just two bucks short of a tip who gets knocked on his keister, gets up, falls for a sinister vixen, but in the end, remains true to self, and maybe, just maybe, slips the double cross."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad timing","review":"The Surfer Dude Wig has been available for years.

I am a pretty true Priest fan and I've got the tattoos to prove it. When I bought this album, I was so excited that I went to the mall the day it came out and it NEVER lived up to the expectation. The songs are forced and silly. Even highpoints like \\"Blood Red Skies\\" fall flat due to the almost adolescent lyrical content.If you doubt me, go over the set lists for the tours that have followed this one and see how many songs they play from this album... I'll give you a hint, zero.Buy every single Priest recording, except this one.Long live Judas Priest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of their best......","review":"This is Judas' weakest effort. After hearing the title track, you think the tone is set for a great album. That just doesn't happen. The songs are ok musically but this album has many weak songs which leave you skipping to the next track hopefully to find the Judas Priest you've been looking for. Along with Turbo, this album just doesn't grap your attention. Bypass this one and go straight to Painkiller."},{"rating":"1","title":"UH-OH!","review":"I hate this album!! From the cliched song titles(\\"Love you toDeath\\", \\"I'm A Rocker\\", \\"Hard as Iron\\",\\"Come and get it), to the overly simple,cliched lyrics, this album shows JP at their least intelligent.Also, the guitar playing is horrible! Technically, it may haverepresented Tipton and Downing at their best, but their guitarsolos were merely speed exercises! Their guitar solos used toactually SAY something!! Also, Halford was losing his knack atwriting melodic and catchy vocal lines. Side one is JP at theirworst and side two is only just a little bit better. I do havea few nice things to say about the album, however!First of all, the album cover may be their best ever! It's avery well drawn cover, to say the least! Secondly, \\"Blood RedSkies\\" is a very powerful song, especially when the drums comein! Also, \\"I'm a Rocker\\" is a very catchy hard rocker, with oneof the album's only memorable vocal lines!Other than that, RAM IT DOWN is a truly pathetic JP album!"},{"rating":"1","title":"perhaps the title is wrong","review":"maybe they should have titled it 'ram it in' and had a picture of a male bum"},{"rating":"2","title":"Defender of RAM IT DOWN","review":"Oh come on now . . does anyone listen to JP for the lyrics, really?

Very unlike Priest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Forgettable and Disappointing","review":"Every great band has a weak point or two and \\"Ram it Down\\" is Priest's. It's without a doubt the most forgettable and uninspired Priest album to be released. To me, it seemed that the band's collective fuel tank is pretty much on EMPTY for this one. Yes, the album has a few high points and the muscianship is its usual brilliance. Rob Halford's wake-the-dead wail is there. The composition and arrangements are OK. But the album is missing Priest's greatest strength: and that is the sense of rebellion, energy and edginess that just propelled earlier LP's. Without that energy, \\"Ram it Down\\" sounds just plain silly in most cases and difficult to take even a little seriously. About the only thing \\"Ram it Down\\" can do -- with tunes like \\"Hard as Iron\\", \\"I'm a Rocker\\", \\"Come and Get it\\" and \\"Love Zone\\" -- is make a fan truly appreciate their other material."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT SO BAD AS EVERYBODY SAYS, BUT NOT SO GOOD EITHER ...","review":"RAM IT DOWN is a big dissapointment, no matter how you look at it. None of its songs are present in Priest's live set. The most annoying thing, in my opinion, are the drums. Maybe that's why Dave Holland left. Other than this, the lyrics are weak ( a now common factor for Priest, unfortunately). As for the musical merits of the album, we have the following: great guitar solos, Blood Red Skies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing, overly biased read","review":"I had to read this book for a Worldview class at Dallas Baptist University. The goal of my class was supposedly for me to establish my worldview and develop an understanding around my reasons for believing as I do. I would have enjoyed the book much more if Sire had attempted to truly take an unbiased look at other worldviews. The tone is almost always preachy and arrogant against all views except Theism. It's no surprise to anyone with half a brain which worldview he subscribes to (hint...it's the one he doesn't make weak, circular arguments about and attempt to drag through the mud). I don't know if I'm more disappointed in the book or in my school for making me read this with the supposed intention of understanding my belief system. I found this book to be a waste of time and no help at all to anyone who really wants to examine their worldview. If you are a Christian looking for someone to validate you in a half-baked manner, this is the book for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Picking up this book in the philosophy section of a bookstore, I was excited to see a book that would summarize several worldviews in order to begin my own trek into philosophy. I was encouraged by the author's introduction, promising \\"to suggest [each worldview's] strengths and weaknesses.\\" Unfortunately, this book failed to live up to my expectations. Theism only gets a thumbs up, and no weakness are admitted in that \\"complete worldview\\". Each and every other one is portrayed as having no truth whatsoever; he concedes no truth to any of the others. I am currently in process of getting a refund for this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Obviously One-Sided","review":"If you are a Christian (in the Western tradition) and you want to reinforce what you already believe, by all means get this book and be happily naive. This will supply you with trite arguments against misrepresented belief systems that you can use to witness to unbelievers. (Atheism is wrong because it says there is no God- You can use the author's tactics against montheism.) However, if like me, you are disenchanted with contemporary Christianity and want to seriously explore/understand other worldviews, this is not for you.

Excellent overview of world views and proclamation of truth (oops. not politically correct)","review":"It seems that the reviews here have turned more into an open forum than an effort at objective reviewing. As a Calvinist I found this book excellent. The various world views are given a brief overview from a Christian perspective. In his critiques Sire's point is that there is only one world view that is able to answer all the questions he postulates. His questions do not deal with \\"I\\" because he does not see himself as the center of creation. Eventually all world views must admit some sort of origin, which is why all questions necessarily lead back to a Creator.For the Christian, this book is an excellent overview of varying world views.For those who are not Christians, this book gives a good understanding of how Scripture relates to and answers the challenges of each of these world views.In this Sire has accomplished his purpose. Five big fat stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"For people with minds are already made up.","review":"This book presents itself as a \\"basic worldview catalog.\\" While it does cover many of the major themes it is heavily tainted by the authors inability to see things from anything but a Christian perspective.A quote from the end of the book says it all in my mind: \\"In terms of possible worldviews, our options are numerous but, as we have seen, limited. Of those we have investigated, all but theism were found to have serious flaws.\\"While no worldview is perfect, to not see the flaws in theism requires a very blinkered view of the world and this shows its self again and again through the book.If you want to read something that tells you why Christianity is the best worldview there is - go ahead and buy it. If you want something more objective I would look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great content... a little hard to read.","review":"James Sire's book \\"The Universe Next Door\\" is absolutely essential to understanding people's ways of looking at the world. Keep in mind that this book only deals with Western thought, so it's not completely exhaustive. Sire outlines the points of each chapter very well, but sometimes the thoughts themselves are hard to comprehend at first read. If you want to get everything out of this book, you're going to have to devote your complete attention to it. Highly recommeneded."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entirely useless literature","review":"I had to buy this book for a philosophy class. I hate it. Trying to learn about a worldview through a third party (Sire) is, at best, fustrating. Sire often sermonizes and is incessently adding his own opinions about whatever.

They really are remarkably easy to program. We have two garage doors, and configuring both was a snap, including the third button to control the garage door light.

However, it does not. The manual for the 972LM specifically has instructions for a match/duplicate feature. This remote (973LM) does not appear to have the match feature and this unit's (973LM) manual is silent on the matter.

My garage door opener only allows for two unique remotes, but I need more than that as we have three cars and a motorcycle in the family and two workers need access to our garage as well. So, if you need/want dip switches, or to clone a remote, or you want several unique remotes, this is not for you.And...I gave it two stars because it stated it would work with purple craftsman programming button, but it did not.

Chris writes songs that anyone can sing, no matter what your vocal ability is, and it makes the worship experience that much better. He has a heart for God, and with every note he sings, you feel it and experience that with him. Don't even think twice about picking up this album, just get it now!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Arriving by Chris Tomlin","review":"This CD is just amazing. Could listen to it 24/7. Chris Tomlin's voice gives each one of those songs a special inspiration that you can't help but join in with him to praise the Lord. I give it a 5*."},{"rating":"2","title":"This disk has heart","review":"Chris Tomlin is an amazing worship leader and this is without a doubt a solid worship album all the way through. We use the song \\"How Great is Our God\\" in the youth band at our church and the beauty of it hits the whole congregation every time. Most worship albums you can't tell if they're really worshipping God or marketing themselves, but not on Chris Tomlin's \\"Arriving\\". You can hear in his voice and in his song just where he's coming from."},{"rating":"2","title":"Encouraging, Jesus Glorifying Music","review":"I have owned this CD for sometime now and have enjoyed it immensely! I put it on in my car tonight on my commute home from school and I was once again blessed - blessed by how encouraging the music is! It is all about God - His power, love and grace. The song about God's grace being enough is worth the buying the CD in my opinion and really all the songs are just great! Hearing it is so refreshing after being bombarded with \\"me\\" centered ways of thinking all day from the media, school, work and just our own self-interested ways of thinking!To turn our eyes toward Jesus really does cause the rest of the world and our own complaints and troubles melt away as the song says and this CD really helps you do just that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Inspiring, An Awesome Purchase","review":"This album is simply one of the best worship CDs I own. It is inspiring, encouraging, and most importantly, drives one's thoughts towards the character and person of God. It can be upbeat and fun to listen to, but also worshipful and reflective. The words always puts a smile of joy on my face. I cannot say enough good things about this album, so I will just say that I love listening to it and that you cannot go wrong with this one. Don't hesitate; just buy. =)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have For True Worshippers!","review":"The energy on this album is felt by the listener. Makes you want to lift up your hands and enter the throne room with Mr. Tomlin. He has definitely been gifted with songwriting and singing and I am so thankful that he is using it for God's kingdom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music","review":"PRAISE GOD..PRAISE GOD. THIS ALBUM IS AN INSTANT CLASSIC. EVERY SINGLE TRACK PLACES YOU IN A STATE OF JOYOUS GLORY. I RECOMMEND THIS ALBUM TO ANYONE WHO WOULD LIKE TO GET CLOSER TO JESUS...SINGING AND DANCING LIKE DAVID!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Among the better artists I've found","review":"Chris Tomlin is among my favorite contemporary worship music writers. This CD has many worthwhile songs, and I'm sure most listeners will be pleased. Not quite \\"5 stars\\" because the lyrics could be more creative. Words like \\"great\\" and \\"awesome\\" to describe God appear, reappear, and reappear. In this way, the CD is not quite as mature as it could have been. However, this weakness is often offset by the other creative and worshipful aspects of this CD. (If you don't yet own \\"Not To Us\\" or \\"The Noise We Make,\\" I recommend these earlier releases slightly more.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Arriving","review":"This CD is beautiful! The first cut is so anointed for worship. There are many that have now become familiar standards in contemporary worship. I highly reccomend this to anyone who likes Chris Tomlin. If you're unfamiliar with his work, you certainly will not be disappointed with this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Supreme CD! Love It!","review":"I have played this CD over and over in my car and never get tired of it. I have become a new fan of Chris Tomlin's. I seldom find GOOD Christian music~ this is God sent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"LISTEN...","review":"Just LISTEN, to the WORD OF GOD made human...Then ADD the music from the mind of Chris...COMBINE all of the above to begin to form the road to YOUR eternal life...YOUR salvation...and THANK JESUS for the blessings HE has given YOU!Then, ask HIM to come into YOUR HEART and live in YOU, and giveYOUR life to HIM...Then, sing PRAISE...Hallelujah,Amen"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Worship CD","review":"This CD is so good. Each song is a powerful worship song. Indescribable is my new favorite song. I find when I listen to this CD I get lost in the greatness of God and find myself just pausing to worship him. If you love worship music, I highly recommend this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This CD is ridiculously good! All the songs are catchy, inspirational and just plain awesome. If you ever have the chance to see Chris Tomlin in concert this is pretty much the lineup! Great music, recommended to everyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Grace is enough","review":"This is a wonderful CD for a christian music lover. Chris Tomlin is a wonderful Christian singer!! I enjoy singing his songs"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I was at a retreat singing these oh-so-familiar songs when I noticed the composer's name. \\"Hey! I know these songs and they're all by Chris Tomlin\\". Loaded this CD onto my iPod and can't stop listening to it! It's not your grandma's worship music anymore.Peace!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Actually a gardening book rather than any brew recipes.","review":"It's more a sales brochure than anything. Just a teeny bit of plant history, but mostly what the garden center grows and sells."},{"rating":"2","title":"does what it's suppose to","review":"Stops bleeding from cuts, good little carrying tube with a resealable top.

This item costs a little more then 2 dollars, yet the shipping is over 8 dollars! $2 product with $8 shipping!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific.","review":"A carefully crafted, well-paced and taut story, leading to an exciting and unexpected ending. After the first few chapters, I couldn't put it down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once started; couldn't put it down! A wonderful book.","review":"From the very beginning, the author transformes the reader into the eyes of the main charactor, as he experienced the events that were occuring as the story unfolds. I could see all of the other charactors as each one became a part of the story. A truly realistic experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great debut novel!","review":"I would definitely recommend this book to anybody that likes fast-pace police novels. After being transferred out of the Organized Crime Unit and put back in uniform and teamed with his cousin, Nick, Eddie North is torn between doing his duty as a cop or protecting Nick, who seems to be straying from the straight and narrow. Throw in a love interest (who just happens to be the Commissioner's daughter), street riots, and mafia and you have all the makings of a great read. I look forward to hearing more from this author."},{"rating":"2","title":"New Respect and Admiration for Cops!","review":"Scott Flander's book so immersed me in the world of Philly cops that I no longer look at cops the same way. A few weeks after reading Sons of the City, I was sitting in a diner and noticed a large group of cops having lunch together at the next table. I found myself smiling at them and felt like I actually knew them. I realized that I recognized them - their smiles and mannerisms - as the characters from Flander's book. And I felt such a strong respect for what they do on a daily basis. Aside from enhancing the way I perceive cops in real life, Flander's book is superb! Very gritty, a lot of humor, and fantastic dialogue. The plot lines have been seamlessly woven together and the characters are so solid, you never question their actions or motivations. A definite pager-turner recommended for anyone who likes cop novels, mysteries, mafia story lines, the city of Philadelphia and/or just great writing!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fast Pace Tour of Philadelphia","review":"This was an excellent first novel. It is fast paced and gives the reader a great tour of Philadelphia and its neighborhoods. The story's quick tempo and many surprises keep the reader intently interested. I am hoping to see more from this upcoming author."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent sound - very cool guitar playing","review":"The focus is on guitar work - and Wes had a style like no other. Nuances of his playing come across beautifully in this set. The organ accompaniment works well. The sound quality is excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"LOUSY execution of product and frustrating to put together!","review":"My wife keeps buying Fisher-Price products for our infant. I don't know why. Most of the P.O.S. products we have bought from them have either malfunctioned prematurely, or have fallen short in expectations due to shoddy construction and/or poor design. This product is no exception. The concept is good, but execution is terrible. You will go crazy trying to find the tiny, recessed screws on the battery pack, in order to attach the unit to a crib. In addition, they easily strip, even with the proper sized screwdriver! This makes it impossible to either install the unit, or to remove it!!! Whoever designed the crib attachment battery pack part of this product should be fired Donald Trump style!!! Back to the drawing board Fisher-Price."},{"rating":"1","title":"hazard","review":"I had the 2002 version of this also, and I my daughter loved it. I recently put the same one in my new baby's crib, and all the water leaked out of it. Thank goodness my daughter was not affected by it, but I will never buy another toy with liquid in it again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery Pack a Hassle!","review":"Like other reviewers, we had the original aquarium and our son loved it. We received the new one as a gift two years later and were excited UNTIL we took it out of the box and had to hassle with the battery pack. To make matters worse, the battery pack is so heavy that the connection will not stay, thus the music does not work. I was very disappointed in this model and ended up trashing it in less than two weeks. Did not have receipt or name of store purchased, or I would have returned it! Definitely would NOT recommend purchasing this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have the old one, you won't like this one","review":"Our old \\"fishy tank\\" was 2.5 years old and has been through the ringer, so we decided to get the \\"new improved\\" version. I can see someone liking it if it is their first experience with it, but if you liked the old one, you'll hate this. The battery compartment is a pain, the sound of the animals going round and round is louder than the music (the old ones \\"floated\\" more gracefully) and the bubbles are really lame compared to the old one. I'm going to return this and get the old one again from amazon, because you can't find it in the stores! So sorry!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Works erratically","review":"My 6-month-old really likes this and I had no trouble installing it in her crib. However, it does not work consistently, sometimes the music plays for five minutes, sometimes for one minute, sometimes I get lights sometimes no lights. No matter which setting I choose, it seems to just randomly pick how long to stay on. It is very unusual for it to play continuously for more than a couple of minutes. It is fairly heavy and bulky so not worth returning. If you really want to buy one of these, I'd get it at a store where you can easily exchange it if the music stops working."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why did they mess with a good thing?","review":"My first child had the earlier version. She loved it and was still using it when my son was born so I rushed out to get this new one. What a mistake! Like the other reviewers said the battery pack is too heavy for the toy. It won't work unless it's propped up against the wall. So anyone with a sleigh style crib beware. Very disappointed with this model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Instant calmer","review":"I bought this toy for my 4 month old, thinking that ocean sounds could be soothing and help him go to sleep more easily. And it has been exactly as I hoped. When I put him down to sleep in his crib, he can be very restless at first. But as soon as I turn it on with the setting that has the bubbles, fish moving and music, he is instantly calm and mesmerized. He usually drifts off to sleep before the standard five minutes of playing are done. I agree with the other reviewers about how ridiculously difficult this was to install. I was ready to take it back. But now I am very glad I kept it. I've read from others that this uses a lot of batteries, but that has not been my experience so far and we use this frequently."},{"rating":"1","title":"Load Motor","review":"I purchased this item yesterday, and it will go back to the store tomorrow. I got it together, turned it on, and the motor on the thing was louder than the music. It really does sound as though the motor is straining and it will break any minute. There is no way I will be able to tolerate the motor to put my baby to sleep."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery eater!","review":"This was the one item I was adament about purchasing. I was worried when the older model could no longer be found in stores. When the new model arrived, we purchased it immidiately. We replaced the batteries twice and just gave up. We were gong through them like nothing! I am so dissapointed. I would save your money. We do however RAVE about the fisher price aquarium bouncer- a life saver!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not sure if I got a defective model?","review":"While my 5-month old son IS absolutely mesmerized by the bubbles and lights in the Ocean Wonders Aquarium, I'm wondering if we may gotten a defective one? It makes HORRIBLY loud, groaning, thunking sounds while it runs -- does anyone else's do this? Sounds as though it's on its last leg and might go up in a puff of smoke at any point! We (fortunately) don't rely on it to soothe our son to sleep (I can't believe he could sleep through all that racket). I've tried contacting Fisher Price/Mattel customer service to inquire, but have just gotten the runaround, and unfortunately, our local Toys R Us doesn't have this item in stock to go \\"test\\" at the store (to see if they are all this noisy!)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Baby hated it!","review":"Maybe it was the one I purchased, but when I would turn it on, it would make a loud windshield wiper type noise as the fish moved around. Baby did not like it at all. I thought it was a little pricey also. My advice, keep looking."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loud","review":"I now understand why this was upgraded by the manufacturer. Though the toy is appealing to my child the internal parts are extremely loud. This is not a toy that will help put the child to sleep because of the volume of the internal parts."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old model is much better!!!!!!!","review":"We just got this for a baby gift and had to return it for something else. We had the old model with our 2nd son and loved it, especially when the lights projected on the ceiling!!But this new one does not have this feature and we were not impressed at all, it is just not as great as the oringal one.I guess new is not always better!We took it back and got one with moving birds that project light and music on the ceiling called FLUTTERBY DREAMS by another company, which both us and baby love alot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed in this toy. . .","review":"I receieved this as a shower gift and was very excited about it. I put it together today and attached it to the crib, only to discover how loud the motor really is! THe other reviewers are absolutely right. The sound of the motor practically drowns our the music. . ."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give NO starts I would!!!!","review":"This was purchased for a second baby. The battery pack on this sits outside of the crib - which would seem like a very good idea to make changing the batteries much easier. However, the battery pack OFTEN becomes unattached from the unit and then the thing will not turn on. What a disappointment!!! Do not waste your money - we are going to try the cute little birdies!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sleepiest Baby!","review":"We got this as a crib toy for my daughter, she absolutely loves the wave music that plays. It's very soothing to her and usually calms her right down when she's worked up or over-tired! She recently found the lights and moving fish as well and think they're pretty neat to watch! This is a must for nap time for us!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as the original one!","review":"I don't have many negative reviews about anything but this my family(husband and daughgters-5 and 13) and I were truly dissapointed with! We had the original one for my 5 year old. She still plays it. This one is ridiculously bulky and the motor moving the sea creatures is loud. The music isn't soothing by any means and the little creatures don't move easily around.I don't like this at all. I recommend Fisher Prices aquarium mobile instead. We returned this for that and have been very happy with it. So has our baby!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My baby and toddler love this soother!","review":"This soother is very nice. The display captivates my toddler and infant and the music and bubbles are nice. Unlike my Flutterbye soother (which my older daughter took with her to her big girl room), this one has a spinning crab and spinning fish so the baby can interact with it rather than stare at the soother. I do wish it had a ceiling display like my flutterbye soother, but even without the light display it is very nice.My main complaint though is the giant battery pack in the back. It takes up a lot of space and is heavy. because our crib mattress is on the highest setting and we use a bumper we have to put the soother over the narrow side of our crib, so it is a bit higher than I would like. I prefer the design of the flutterbye soother which has the battery pack on the soother itself, rather than in some separate compartment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Impossible to attach to my crib","review":"This soother is really hard to attach to the crib - you have to unscrew the whole back (yes, tools are required) AND then we learned it doesn't even fit our crib (we have the Simplicity Ellis 4-in-1 Sleep System). The straps that go over the side aren't long enough to attach but without them, it slides down and scrunches our bumper since it's so heavy with 4 D-batteries. My husband used some rubber bands to attach it, but it's supposed to attach to the side of cribs easily and it doesn't. Plus, it doesn't really do much. Overall, I would not recommend it. There must be other soothers that are designed better."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice toy for all ages","review":"I got this aquarium for Christmas in 2006, probably from Santa Claus and I have been using it every night for six months now. The music and lights are very soothing and the fish are cute. The toy is appropriate for all ages from birth through 100 years old."},{"rating":"2","title":"we are all enjoying it!","review":"I bought the ocean wonders musical aquarium attachment for my 4.5 month old son. It's been very fun so far. It was a little complicated to put together. But he stares at it fascinated(we call it baby tv). He has already figured out how to turn it on himself and play with the buttons. Today, he figured out he could turn it on with his feet.I had wanted to get the flutterby dreams because I heard great things about it, but this was half the price so I went with ocean wonders instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great toy but bad design for older babies","review":"I bought this for my daughter for her first birthday. She was pulling on her mobile in her crib so I thought this would be safer for her and since she was already used to falling asleep to music I thought it was a good choice. She is able to turn the music off on the top parental controls because she can stand up, then she gets frustrated and upset when she pushes the seashell and the music doesn't start. It has ended up being more upsetting to her than relaxing. If I go in to turn it on she usually goes right to sleep, but it sometimes happens a few times before she falls asleep for the night. They needed to put those controls at the back of the toy so baby can't get to them. Great for a small babies but not great when they can stand up and are curious!"},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible design","review":"The only reason im giving this 2 stars is because my [...]loves it.She lies in her crib and turns it on and off with her feet for the first 30 minutes of being awake in the morning.That is its only redeeming factor. ITs impossible to get the battery to stay on, and when the fish are set to rotate it makes this awfully loud noise, now. So i just turned that part off."},{"rating":"1","title":"I wouldn't buy it again","review":"I bought this aquarium for my baby girl since her brother loved the original.This was a terrible re-design. It continually falls apart. My husband even used zip ties and duct tape to keep the battery pack connected to the main body.Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoying Battery Pack!!","review":"I was very disappointed with this toy, due to the fact that the battery pack makes it very difficult to operate. I returned the first one because the air duct where the bubbles were supposed to come out wasn't working. I don't recommend this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"A big disappointment & totally frustrating!","review":"My [...] has the OLD version of the Ocean Wonders Aquarium and he loves it still to this day. Upon learning we were having twins last year, the first thing I set out to buy were two more aquariums for the new babies. When I saw they had a new version with the battery pack on the back, I thought 'terrific! what a great idea! I won't have to take off the entire aquarium to change the batteries.' My excitement quickly faded as the stinking battery pack is WAYYYY too heavy and will not stay connected to the toy, thus making it worthless. And in the slim chance I am able to engage it, as soon as the baby rolls around or moves, the battery pack is no longer engaged. I'm seriously disappointed and hope this new version is removed from the shelves. Do yourself a favor and find the OLD version. Don't waste your money otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mine doesn't work","review":"The battery pack on the back of this toy won't stay on, so the music stops before it is supposed to. I've tried everything to get this to work, but only ugly duck tape will keep this toy together. I hope they solve this problem and come up with another model."},{"rating":"2","title":"Battery Pack Issues!","review":"I too don't understand the thinking on this design as to why they would place a huge battery pack on the outside of the crib. I would have to stand there and press the batter pack to get the thing to work.I finally called Fischer Price about it and they said they get many calls about this. Underneath the batteries there are screws which must be tightened to the main part of the toy before putting in the batteries. This will secure it to the toy and keep it from coming loose.It is still a poor design but this might help some of you who were having the same problem as me."},{"rating":"1","title":"I \\"WONDER\\" Why I bought it!","review":"I had the older model for my first son so naturally I thought that the new model would even be better, boy was I wrong. Everytime my baby touched the aquarium it would turn off. This is because the battery compartment is way too heavy and is not on secure enough. So in order to use it I have to set it in the crib. Ofcourse thats not a good idea because it will end up falling onto my son. All I have to say is - Fisher Price what were you thinkin?"},{"rating":"1","title":"this aqaurium sucks!","review":"I have the older model and I like it tons better. The newer one we had to duct tape to my son's crib so it wouldn't keep shutting off. It has actually made me question buying anything from fisher price in the future!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy Construction","review":"My daughter has loved this toy since she was a year old, but the recurring problem we've had with it is the ginormous battery pack is always falling out. It has the potential to be a nice educational and entertaining toy, as she loves pushing the blue seashell to start the music herself and then pointing at the seahorses moving inside the box. But the stupid battery pack disconnects so easily that every few minutes the music and movement inside stop and she starts screaming for me to fix it. I don't understand how this toy has such a high rating when the construction is so poor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cumbersome to Install","review":"My older daughter has the old model of the Fisher-Price Aquarium and we love it. We bought this new model for our infant and were surprised to see how the structure has changed. There is a huge battery pack on the back that screws into the aquarium and it is supposed to anchor it to the crib. We are having a very difficult time fitting it onto the crib. Also, the holes in the strap are too small to fit into the pegs on back of the aquarium. I don't know why they changed these features from the old model. I would recommend skipping this model and finding one more like the earlier aquarium."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why the bad reviews? I love it!","review":"I'm not sure why so many people are unhappy with this product. It's adorable, and more importantly, it puts my daughter to sleep! Heck, it puts ME to sleep! I haven't had a problem with the batteries and it's been 3 months, and we still have plenty of water in ours. The songs are cute, but I like the lights and bubbles function best. The only downside that I see is that the music, lights, and bubbles don't stay on long enough. Definitely something I'd buy again, and something I would give as a gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"Gift for new baby","review":"My twins loved this in their crib. It helped them go to sleep when they were a baby and as they got older they loved to play with it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy!","review":"This is a great toy. First, my son was using it to fall asleep (when he was 2 m). Then he learned to turn it on/off and play with the crab and the star. He loved this toy when he was little, but when he turned 6 mo, he stopped playing with it. We still have it and turn it on occasionally. It is a great toy for a baby 0 to 6 months."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent crib toy","review":"It's kind of big and clunky, but our baby likes to watch and listen to it. It has a good volume range -- some toys are just too loud. The bubbling water is a nice effect. The toy was fairly simple to install on the crib and a plus is that it can be used beyond sitting-on-own age."},{"rating":"1","title":"New & Improved-----NOT!","review":"The parents here have already said it, this product is a huge disappointment from the original model. My son loved his aquarium, but it began to leak so I went out and bought this one (really had no choice since I wasn't able to find the old model). Assembly was a huge hassle----I'm still scratching my head at how FP could have allowed this design to pass! It has a very loud mechanical sound to it that clunks and the light on it is so bright. I woke up to its horrible sound this morning at 5 AM! It's going back today."},{"rating":"1","title":"If it's not broke - why fix it????","review":"Nothing like the old model. I used the older aquarium for both of my children and they LOVED it. I gave it for every baby shower I went to. This is terrible. All you hear is the motor. The music is not nearly as soothing as the previous model and the back will not stay on. I was terribly disappointed and will never buy one again. I don't know why they had to change something that worked great!"},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL - Waist of Time & Money!!!!!!!!!","review":"If you had the older version of this Aquarium you will most likely hate the new one. It is bulky and nearly impossible to attach properly to a crib. And as stated by another person, if the battery pack moves just a hair out of alignment it will not work. I bought this one because my older daughter loved her old one so much that when we passed it on to our little one it finally stopped turning. The new design was poorly thought out and hopefully will be replaced soon. Don't waist your money or time on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"worth 12$","review":"I got this for the baby I'm having in January, but it doesn't fit her crib. I put it on my 18 month olds crib, but it is terribly unimpressive. Mine only came with directions on how to install the battery box, but I'm not sure that just wasn't overlooked at the factory. Not a bad deal for 11.99, but I definitely wouldn't pay more than that. I'm glad I got it on sale here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was eager to buy, but highly disappointed!!!","review":"I was looking forward to this toy even before my daughter was born this past August. I held off buying because we planned on having the baby in a bassinet in our bedroom for the first 3 months. As soon as we set up her crib I went out and bought it. The options it has are great....BUT...there is only one option for play length and it's not nearly long enough. I have to go into her room and hit the play button for a 3rd time before she goes to sleep. There are times that if it's off too long before I check on her she's completely awake and I have to wait for her to become sleepy again...or she's so tired And irritated that she cries (definately not the soother I was hoping for.) What really bugs me is that all Fisher Price had to do was add a time option. 10, 20, 30 minute options would have been great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Noisy & bulky","review":"after wanting this item the most off my registry, I purchased it myself. What a disappointment from the original one from 5 years ago...after 1st fighting with the box to get it out that I ripped the darn thing, attaching it to the crib was a nightmare because now there is this big bulky box on the back that has to be screwed in before putting the batteries in, after 3 tries I was able to get it to align right to screw it in only to finally turn it on & it is definitely not \\"soothing\\"...the grinding noise it makes it very loud & annoying, not calming or soothing at all. I packed it back in the box (Another fight) & will return it ASAP....can't wait to buy the crib CD which I know will be much more comforting!"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I'm very disappointed with this toy! It is hard to assemble and every time when I put on in moving fish and lights my son starts to cry. Just try to find something else, don't buy this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Re-Design","review":"We have the orginal from two years ago and love it. This new one is terrible to attach to the crib. The new HUGE CLUNKY battery pack is horrible- It sticks out of the crib so you can't use this along with a bumper, so we had to wait until we were no longer using a bumper. We have twins and the twin with the old version was able to play with his months before his sister. In addition, it is difficult to keep the battery pack engaged, so often times we go to turn it on and we can't-- we have to wiggle it until the leads match up again.On top of everything else, it sucks batteries like crazy. We put new batteries in both when we put them into the cribs. We have changed the batteries twice on this new version and not once on the old.If you can get the old version-- buy it. Otherwise try a different brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't mess with things that are not broken.","review":"I bought this to replace the older model, beacause by 18month loves it. I left it at the hotel during Thankgiving. I found it loud and quite obnoxious. My daughter really missed her old fish. So I tracked the old one down and had it shipped to me.The new fish are going back to the store. Like I said there loud and the battery pack that detaches in the back is a pain.Hope this helps, If you can find the previous modle it is squarish in shape.Itis much better and has more bubbles."},{"rating":"1","title":"Annoyed!","review":"After spending all that time attaching it to the crib I was so annoyed when I heard how loud the motor was. My 9 month old does enjoy playing with it while he's sitting up in his crib, but there is nothing soothing about this item. With two other kids, ages 5 and 3, I really needed something that would help my little guy put himself back to sleep. This certainly is not what I needed. If you're looking for crib entertainment, for while the baby is up, go right ahead. Otherwise, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointed","review":"I also had previously bough the old aquarium for my now 3 1/2 year old , and he loved it. He played with it even at 2 years old. So now that I have a 3 month old girl I thought, she would enjoy a new version of this toy. How wrong was I. I had to take mine back 3 times to get a new one. The motor was horrible. It barley moved and when it did, it was loud. I got so frustrated taking it off and on to get a new one, that I finally settled on a diffrent one. I purchased a nice one with birds and it even projects a little movie about the birds. My daughter loves it. I am so happy with that, because this one was a nightmare."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I like others, did have the old model which we bought in 2001. It had been in storage and when I went to get it out, the fish no longer moved, so I ran out and bought the new version. It is SO bright and SO loud it doesn't soothe my 6 month old to sleep like it did the first time around. I liked the feature on the original model that allowed the light to be out the top and shine on the ceiling. It made the crib much darker yet the fish were still visible. The battery pack also was a bit of a hassle. Bring back the benefits of the older model!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"bad toy","review":"The motor on this toy is SO loud! I don't know how any baby could fall asleep to this, mine never did. I looked everywhere for the older version and found it. What a difference. That one is so much better and no loud motor. It is so much more soothing. Still doesn't put my baby to sleep but he likes looking at it."},{"rating":"1","title":"a great idea but dangerous","review":"I bought this crib attachment for my first daughter in 2007, but I never got around to using it. Now four years later I used it with my baby and the attachment has caused alot of problems. It is very complicated to attach it to the crib and requires screwing in the screws, which is not clear. If the screws are not attached then the battery pack can fall out and injure someone. Second, now that my daughter is rolling over and lifting her head she has banged her head badly on the attachment because it juts out. She woke up one morning with a big bruise on her eye. I am very disappointed. One thing I must point out to be fair, my daughter does sleep in a mini crib, so maybe the size of her crib makes to product more hazardous. Either way, there is no warning on the product! I had to take the aquarium off her crib even though she did love it. It did sooth her and entertain her."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bulky and inconvenient","review":"I shopped around for a soothing crib attachment since my daughter loves my nephew's. I should have gone with the one he has. I have a convertible sleigh crib and it doesn't fit on the side as shown on the pictures. It also has a huge battery pack on the back that makes it a pain to put on. You have to remove the batteries in order to attach it to the crib and it fits so snugly that it won't go over my bumper. So she has to lay sideways in order to see it with the bumper pushed down. For the most part, she likes it. The interactive part on it doesn't really serve much purpose since I turn it on for her to go to sleep. The motor that makes the animals go around is very noisy but she likes the bubbles. I definitely would not recommend this product to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"10 minutes??? Really???","review":"Ok, I didn't purchase this aquarium, it was given to me by someone whose son didn't use it much. Good thing I didn't pay for it or I would be really unhappy. At first I thought it was great. My son loved it. The first time I tried to use it to calm him and put him to sleep however, I discovered 10 minutes were just not enough. He would just start to go to sleep when it would shut off. That made him made. For as much money as this thing costs, there should be a time setting too so you can choose how long it plays. I am going to go buy one that actually plays longer at a time. Hope this helps you."},{"rating":"2","title":"soother that captivates baby","review":"soother that captivates baby . I got my ocean aquarium at toys R us for lot less. I think it was about 45$ My son loves it we used it for little over a year. When he was a newborn and I needed him to sleep. Worked great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed, older model is much better","review":"I never write reviews on toys, but this one is a must. I LOVED the aquarium I received for my daughter. She still plays with it and she is 22 months old. So I bought one for my son, and the only had the new model at the store and I cannot believe how silly this thing is to put together with the clunky battery pack that hangs off the side.. it doesn't even make sense. It is so much more complicated than it has to be. It does seem to be much louder than the first, so not as soothing. I think I am returning it to find the old one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Original Aquarium model better","review":"I like the original model where you can see the wave ripples on the ceiling & you can change it to where the baby can see it in the crib. This new one is louder than the original model which makes it a \\"play\\" toy more than a soothing toy.I would find the original model before buying this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"the old model is better","review":"This model looks nice but from all the bad reviews it's getting it seems like fisher price has to go back and fix this issue with the battery pack that hangs out of the crib,sounds like a big pain in the butt to me,so I went to a second hand store and bought the old one.It's awesome and my little one loves it.It even helped her get to sleep in her final stages of weaning.I just turn on the music with the soft glow of light and rock her to sleep and I no longer have to nurse her to get her down!And that's just amazing because as perfect(to me)as she is,she's a tough cookie.It's really too bad they discontinued the old version,but if you can find it in a thrift store make sure you grab it!It also just hooks right onto the crib,very easy to install."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motor Too Loud","review":"I bought this for my 7 week old and I was excited to finally have this since I'd heard so many wonderful things about the previous two styles of the Aquarium. I couldn't wait to hear the relaxing bubbles sound that would put my baby to sleep. I loaded the batteries in, turned it on and my 4 year old and I both said \\"what is that noise?\\" It was the motor that is used to move the 3D fish around in a circle. The motor was so loud and annoying. You could hardly hear the music even with the volume up. Since the bubbles only float up on the mode that moves the fish, you couldn't hear the bubbles at all. Also, the music is really odd. I had read that in some reviews on the older models so apparently that hasn't changed. What a disappointment. I returned my Aquarium to Walmart and am now hunting for another soother."},{"rating":"2","title":"So far best baby gift we got!","review":"I got this as a baby shower gift and my husband and I loved it. The ocean sounds were exactly what we needed for a soon to be collicky baby, and little did we know that over a year later our son would still play with it in the crib! Our only complaint is that the motor that moves the ocean life is LOUD. It overpowers the music and ocean sounds if you have the volume turned down. Otherwise it is lovely!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Battery Pack SUCKS!!!","review":"I was really excited to get this at the baby shower. I've seen them at the store, and thought they were really neat, with the moving fish, and the sounds and music. Well, it WOULD have been neat, if the stupid battery compartment would stay on! The thing attaches to the back of the aquarium, and does not even snap into place. You just jerry-rig it onto the base unit, and any slight movement detaches it from the base and makes it useless. You then have to move the crib, reattach the battery compartment, and shake or jiggle it into place. Sounds like a relaxing experience for the baby? Not so much! When it does work, the music is great, and you can change the tune and adjust volume, but the light is extremely bright, and when the fish are moving, the motor is very loud. In theory, this is a great toy. In reality, it is a huge hassle and not worth the money. I would definitely not recommend this one!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to Use","review":"I had heard wonderful things about the older version of this toy. We purchased the newer version and had a lot of difficulty getting it to work properly. It was so big that it constantly pushed down on our bumper pad, and we were not able to get the screw to line up to make it work. It was heavy and bulky. I love the idea of fish, aquarium sounds and soothing bubbles, so we got the Calypso Mobile instead, which has many of the same benefits with some additional ones. (see my review of the Calypso Mobile)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good crib entertainer.","review":"I have this product in my 6 month old baby's crib and she loves it. My only issue with it is that it's so heavy and bulky and her head got wedged between the toy and the crib so be careful where you position it or they can easily hit there head on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would love it if it worked!","review":"First I must start by saying my son really loves this product. That being said, we are on our THIRD one and none of them have worked properly! They all have a problem with the fish moving and/or bubbles. The first one worked for about a week then the bubbles stopped working. Second one the fish moved VERY slowly and made a lot of noise. The third one was working fine for ONE DAY and now the fish don't move at all and the bubbles come out of one tiny area. I have been very disappointed in most of our Fisher Price items since my son has been born. We will be returning this one and trying AGAIN only b/c my son really likes it but what a headache!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"If it worked - it'd be great","review":"we can't seem to keep the battery pack on... we tried just resting it in the crib- but it falls over onto the baby. not good. so we keep it outside the crib- which does not allow her to view it or play with it. i see other people have the same issue. if they would just fix the design, this would be ok."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"I got this toy for my first grandson for Christmas 2005. My daughter loves the toy and says it helps put the grandson to sleep. Only problem is it stopped working after only one month. Changing batteries did not help. Of course the box was thrown away as with all the Christmas gifts or I would return it. It is extremely bulky to fit on the baby crib also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but doesn't last very long.......","review":"My wife and I had seen this advertised on tv and thought it would be a big help getting our son to sleep in his crib. He loved it but there were a few problems. It only lasts about 2 minutes which is not nearly long enough for him to fall asleep. There should be settings on it for different lengths of time. Also, the fish started to get stuck after a week or two. Something with the motor. My son still loves to watch the fish but it isn't quite worth what we paid. Needs improvements."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!!!!!","review":"I agreee 100% with pp's. This thing is awful. I bought the old model in 2002 for my son who still uses his fishies. He loves them. The new model is cheap, loud (all you can hear is the whizzing motor), impossible to put together. I'm so glad I am not the only that feels this way. Well I guess on the bright side, we will only have one fishie addict in the house."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good concept, bad design","review":"We bought this aquarium because we saw our friend's son playing with his and he just loved it. Unfortunately, the model they had was replaced with this newer version. The concept was the same and the music, bubbles and fish are great. Our son loved the spinning crab too. But, functionally, the design is horrible. The battery pack plugs into the back of the aquarium once you have attached it to the crib. Since it takes D batteries it is really heavy. The pack kept losing it's connection to the toy because it was so heavy. It would only play if you held it in place. We took it back and the only model they are now stocking at TRU is this jungle one which didn't look nearly as neat. So, I went and found a used version of the older model our freinds had at a second hand store. Our son absolutely loves it. This one has the batteries inside the toy and it works great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Battery pack doesn't stay attached","review":"This never worked from the start. Battery pack is too heavy and keeps detaching from the unit, turning it off and frustrating my son. Tried pushing it against the wall but even the slightest touch detaches the battery pack. Don't buy this product - horrible design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke in three months","review":"This was a great toy my son loved it. It kept him in his crib when I needed to do things and soothed him to sleep. Untill much to my dismay the motor went out. Now all it does is play the music. My son loved his fish going around. I am not happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Designer should be shot","review":"As a new father I have had to put together and set up many of the new toys for my baby. I have found that most of the directions and the way these things are put together are stupid, this Fisher Price Ocean Wonders Aquarium is the worst. The only wonder is how I havent thrown it out the window yet.The way it mounts to the crib is just plain crazy. Why do you need to have this thing Screw through the crib???? Why is there a stupid little cut off switch built in???? Forget about mounting on the side up aganist the wall. You would have to move the entier crib away from the wall just to change the batteries.And could they have made the motor in this thing any LOUDER???Its an Ocean Wonders Aquarium why dose it not have ocean or water noise, only the standard lullabys. Save your money, go with something else."},{"rating":"1","title":"so sad...","review":"The ocean wonders aquarium has been in our family since my 1st was born 5 years ago. We LOVED the original model and it has gone down hill from then. This is the worst by far. What is with the huge battery compartment? It is loud and the back disconnects, turning the whole thing off. It doesn't last long enough for her to fall asleep before shutting off and the one setting that all my kids have loved \\"the bubbles\\" won't stay on. I am usually happy with Fisher price but they bombed on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY DISSAPOINTED","review":"I purchased this item when my daughter was about 1 month old. First of all, like all the other parents said....it is a HUGE hassle to change the batteries. She is now 4 1/2 months old and I have changed the batteries twice. One thing that really bothers me is when you look at this item online and click on the \\"watch in action\\" button it shows it playing really soft music. NOT EVEN CLOSE!! Like another review, the motor that moves the sea things around is SOOO LOUD. It is not soothing AT ALL. I would not recommend this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"I purchased this for my son and do not like it all. First of all it does not attach to my sons crib at all and it does not play 10 minutes of continous music. It is so bulky and heavy even before you put the batteries in it. I am disappointed in this item. I plan to return this item and get my money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining...doesn't install well...","review":"My 7 week old daughter will lay and watch this thing for 20-30 min at a time...she loves it! My only complaint is that it isn't easy to install...you have to take the back off and screw it onto the back of the machine while its hangning on the bed!!! I also have a VERY thick wood bed and the hanging plastic strap things wouldn't go over the railing of my bed. Fisher Price either needs to make a different attachment for the thick wood beds or redesign the way it hangs! Currently we have rigged it so that it can be in the crib for her, but once she's more active it will have to be moved!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good entertainment","review":"I got this for my 8 week old grandson. He loves it. Everytime I lay him down for a diaper change, I have to start the music for him. He becomes quiet and looks at the moving creatures. Much easier to change him then."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perhaps not quite as good as the old model, but still great.","review":"The battery issue is not a big deal. Where the old model needs to be completely removed from the crib to replace batteries, this model has the battery pack on the outside of the crib. The crib itself would need to be pulled out for replacement, but I have always had to pull out the crib to detach the old style one (I have three kids, two in cribs). Just incorporate the battery changing with sheet changing. The aquarium itself is fun to watch and my son seems to enjoy it. It is his cue to go \\"night-night.\\" It gets turned on when he goes down for naps and bedtime."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fish don't move!","review":"My 3 month old enjoys the lights and bubbles but the fish get stuck on the track and don't move around the corners. This happened straight out of the box. I called Fisher Price and they said if I return the straps they'll send a new one in 6-8 weeks. I have to pay for shipping to return the straps. It always stinks when something is broke right out of the box! At least the bubbles and music keep him entertained for now. I wouldn't recommend this unless they fix the track. I also agree that the batteries are a pain to replace b/c of screws. It seems like many baby toys are moving over to this. As if parents have time to hunt for screwdrivers on top of all else we need to do! A plug in version would be great. This item takes 3 D batteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is pretty good, weird attachment method","review":"I can understand why they attempted to make the batteries easier to access, but really it doesn't buy much by having the pack on the outside of the crib. Installing it was much more complicated than the earlier version (although still manageable). This toy never made it to my 9 month old's crib because my 3 year old snagged it and likes to play with it (he had one when he was very young, but I didn't think he'd remember it, I guess he did!). It stands up by itself on the side of his twin bed up against the wall because of the new battery pack, so I guess that's a benefit?The movement of the fish seems louder than the previous version, but not too loud. The light on this one is not too bright or dim. All in all, its good, I liked the original version better though :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could be great, but big mistakes","review":"I bought this for my youngest son because my older child loved his! I mean really, really loved his, actually he still does!I thought that the new design was ok. I kind of missed the fish bobbing up and down. It was also much harder to assemble. I thought that the removable battery compartment would be great! On the older model you had to take the whole aquarium off of the crib (or headboard) to change the batteries, which could be a big hassle. Well the battery compartment comes loose and then the aquarium won't work. This happens A LOT! What a pain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Baby loves it!!!","review":"Our 9-day-old daughter already appreciates this crib soother! The motor for the bubbles sounds loud to me, but she really likes it, and it can be set to play music and lights with no bubbles if needed. It calms our little one down so that she can fall asleep.There are a few improvements that would be nice. It really is a MAJOR pain to assemble and attach to the crib. It would also be wonderful to have a remote control so I could restart it from outside her room, or perhaps the ability to set the timer to play for a longer period of time.But overall, we're really happy with it already! On a side note, she also LOVES the aquarium bouncer. We're looking forward to using the aquarium high chair later on as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressed","review":"This toy does the trick of putting my 8 month old daughter to sleep at night, that is when it actually works. I found it is very difficult to keep the battery pack attached tightly enough to the back of the toy. I have tried EVERYTHING I could think of, but it manages to come loose quite often. It seems to me that someone could have found a more convenient place to put the batteries!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Pain!","review":"I bought this for my daughter while we were on a trip-she can't sleep without her music! We have the Fisher Price lullaby soother (the one with the little birds, I think it's called the flutterby) and I had forgotten it. This one is such a pain. The batteries are in a seperate box that \\"plugs\\" into the back of the music box and it constantly falls off. Don't waste your money, buy the one with the little birds, I promise you will enjoy it more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too noisy to soothe","review":"We had a previous version of this toy when our 5-year-old was a baby. It was really great-- played music or wave sounds, nice lights, and the fish went around in a circle. When it died on us, we asked for a new one for our new baby. This latest version is a huge disappointment. The changes in the features were expected and tolerable. However, when the fish are in motion, it is too loud. The motor makes an annoying buzzing sound. Also, the volume control will only allow you to turn the music down so far. You cannot turn it down to a level that we thought was conducive to sleep.I will say, though, that it fastens more securely that the previuos model.On the whole, though, if this type of toy were important to me, I would shop around more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old version is, by far, more superior","review":"I hate the new disgn of this product. The detachable battery pack sucks. We have the old version for our 18 month old and he loves it and uses it to soothe himself at night and I wanted to have the same option for our 7 month old however, this version is horrible. I wish they would not have redesigned the product. It was great the way it was."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy needs some manufacturing adjustments","review":"My son started to notice this toy in his crib at about 4 weeks. He loves the bubbles and movement. I highly recommend this toy for infants. The only problem I have is the way that it is attached to the crib. We have a problem with the battery pack staying on the crib. We are constantly adjusting it to stay on."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great when it works","review":"This toy was given to our 6 month old daughter this past Christmas. Like some of the other reviewers, we had the older model for our first daughter in 2003 and loved it (we gave it away to charity once she outgrew it...thinking we would get the \\"newer and more improved\\" version when we have another baby). This model is not \\"improved\\" like we thought it would be. The lights are brighter and the battery pack is the worst! It is bulky and falls off easily. If it is playing and my daughter kicks the side of the bed or moves in her crib wrong when she is falling asleep, the battery pack falls on the floor (and startles her to an awake state). If we accidentally bump against it when trying to comfort her, it makes a horrible bump on the crib, upsetting her more. It is also difficult to use with a bumper, as noted by another reviewer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Get the older Version or try the Flutterbye line","review":"Don't waste your time with this version. The older one can be found in most children's consignment stores and is much better. I also have the Flutterbye version, which is even better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"The battery pack would not stay tight so therefore the toy would not work most of the time. I could not get a good snug fit on the crib so it would slide to the bottom, but the directions sat to keep the toy elevated.

I found it bulky, time consuming and a waste of my time trying to get it to fit to the crib. I returned it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"New & \\"IMPROVED\\"?","review":"Like many other reviewers, I have the older model for my son. He loves it, and can't sleep without it now.

I bought this new & supposedly improved model for my nephew and it was terrible. Didn't fit his crib, sound was awful, and it would have been a huge pain to change the batteries.

I remember also that I paid a lot of money for these. Needless to say, the seperate clunky battery pack will not stay in place because there is a small \\"plug\\" area that the battery pack connects to and from the weight of the battery pack the connection will not stay, so I can't use itI have never written a review about a toy before, but I am very disappointed with this. I think the improvements would be great for my children to enjoy, but my aquariums have gone back into the closet since i never could get either of them to work and stay connected."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of my time!!!","review":"Don't you hate it when you bundle up your little one, go to the store, purchase something, only to get it home and find that it's not what it claimed to be? This is the case with this item. I saw a friend's old version, and thought the new one must be even better. I couldn't even get it to run properly because the battery pack was so heavy on the outside of the crib that it kept detaching itself.

Save yourself the time of wasting 2 trips to the store, unpacking, & repacking, etc. and skip this item!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Stupid Battery Pack","review":"I thought this new model looked great in the store so I bought it for my 1 month old baby. When I got it home and tried to put it up yesterday I discovered that it won't work on our crib. The battery pack is too wide to fit through the slats on our crib so while I can hang it up...I can't turn it on. I'm really disappointed that FP didn't do more research on the width of most new crib slats before making this new model. I'm hoping I can find the old model somewhere. I gave 2 stars only because it looks very nice and works wonderfully....if you can get it work on your crib. I measured and the battery pack is just under 2 inches wide. Measure your slats before purchasing! I have to return mine now."},{"rating":"1","title":"ocean wonders musical aquarium crib attachment","review":"I was quite disappointed with the item.It looked used, even though clean. It was an older model than I expected. The back of it does not fit into the spokes of the crib thereby making it jutt out too much, awkwardly, for the baby to play with and it is something that needs attention to turn it on and shut it off. The model I was looking for turns itself off and you leave it in the on position until baby presses various buttons to make different noises."},{"rating":"2","title":"They love it!","review":"I bought this for my 7 month old twins. They lie in their cribs when they wake in the morning and play and kick at their aquariums. Keeps them happy till I or my husband gets out of bed at 6:45.

I bought it for him when he was only 4 weeks and put it in his crib. He has loved it since. He uses it when he is in his crib, swing, car seat, and floor. The thing I do not like about it is that battery pack. You have to take out the batteries out and the pack of to take it of the crib. This is a pain in the but because my son wants it with him all the time. I tried to just set it in the crib and that worked for a while but know he pulls it over and get mad because he can not see it. I just bought another on at a thrift shop (an older the batteries go in the back) and we use that on for the car swing floor. My son has just started walking and he pulls it around with him by the straps that hold it to the crib. This toy is very well made. Still works after being dropped and thrown. I you are think about buying this toy I say you should. Just be prepared that you might need to. My son it 18 mo and still loves it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect","review":"My son is 2 months old and has loved this toy from the day we brought him home. When he is tired it soothes him right to sleep, and when he is not so tired he will just lay there and listen to it. I can hear the music through the monitor and it even puts me to sleep :) The light is perfect when he wakes up in the middle of the night so that I can see him but not have to turn on the bedroom light. Also, it is great on batteries. We have used this for 2 months and it is still working great. I gave it 4 stars because the motor is awful sounding when it is on the setting for the animals to move. So, I just use the light and music setting for now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Older vintage is much better!","review":"My son has enjoyed the original Fisher-Price Ocean Wonders aquarium since he was only a few weeks old. We recently purchased the NEW version to keep at the grandparent's house. I was very disappointed! It is a terrible system - the batteries are in a separete housing that attached to the back of the machine THROUGH the crib slats. No more easy transfer. Also, the buttons are hard to push and the background light is enough to light up the entire room. This is NOT a good thing when trying to get a baby to go to sleep.I give the OLD version 5 stars. Trust me, it's worth the search!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Why can't they get this right?","review":"We had the older model that was also round looking with two fish. My daughter loved it but the gears came off and it started clicking and the fish wouldn't move anymore. The square looking model was tacky looking to me so I was so happy to see this one now that I have a new baby b/c I thought it looked similar to the original model. The battery pack fell off the crib and broke the first time I tried to put it on. If you have a Next Generation or any other large, sleigh type crib.forget it. There is no way to attach it. I had to set it in a corner and tie the straps to the crib with fishing line. They need to make the straps way longer(test this on different types of cribs).Next problem....it needs more water in front of the toys. It is obvious they are not in the water(not a problem on the older model), it would make better bubbles too. I like the fish and the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was wrong with the ORIGINAL?","review":"How disapointing. We just evacuated Hurricane Rita and did not remember to bring our original Aqauarium with us. So my mother-in-law bought us this piece of crap (not her fault). We intended on buying another anyway for our baby who is due any day (our 2 year old son still LOVES his, but this one is going back tomorrow.) We could not get it to stay together (just read the review about the hidden screw) so we taped it up for the night. What was wrong with the original? So the fish just move up and down instead of around, we didn't even use that function. He just likes the water sounds and lights and then plays with the toys in the morning. Fisher-Price, bring back the old one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"10 Month old loves it and has slept with it for 8 months","review":"The gentle light (which can be turned off), bubbles, and moving characters make this a mesmerizing toy. It also plays very soothing music and very pretty music. Also comes with running water sound. Really helped my daughter sleep in her own bed. She can turn it on herself now, and sometimes, during the night we will hear that she turned it on and went back to sleep. As other reviewes have noted, the toy does make a noisy sound I would describe as grinding gears, but my daughter was not bothered by it."},{"rating":"2","title":"multiple settings are a plus","review":"I love that this toy has multiple settings. You can set it so there is light, movement and sound, no movement with only lights and sound, or only sound. There is music as well as ocean sounds that are soothing to some babies. The sounds last about 15 minutes and there is a volume control. It is a bit difficult to install on a crib with wide crib bars but if I can do it, so can you! :-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"We purchased this aquarium for $30.00 in October of 2005 and it broke down last night, June 25th, 2006; not even a year after we purchased it.My first complaint was that when we bought it, it is a HUGE hassle to attach it to the crib. So be forewarned about this, especially when the batteries run out. You will have to remove the box on the back to just replace the batteries! Time consuming to say the least.My second complaint was the the lights are VERY bright which I found did not soothe my son, but made him squint.Thirdly, after spending double what we did on the Fisher Price Peaceful Planet Aquarium (which lasted 6 years, by the way) this was a huge disappointment and would not recommend this product to anyone.In the midst of trying to come out with the newest and greatest next toy, I feel manufacturers are missing the big picture. Refine the good ones they have and leave the junk behind.I hope this helps someone to keep $30.00 in their wallet."},{"rating":"2","title":"It keeps him entertained","review":"We received this toy from my son's grandparents when he was first born. It does keep his amusement for some time, however, I don't turn it on if I am trying to get him to go to sleep. It is so loud that it ends up waking him up instead of lulling him to sleep. I only put it on when he is laying in his crib and needs something to keep him occupied. The fish and music will amuse him enough to allow me to get some chores done."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still LOVE IT!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I have a soon to be 3 month old and bought this for him when he was a couple weeks old to help him sleep in his crib. He never pays much attention to the fish moving, the lights or bubbles but loves the music and bubble sounds. However, the directions state that it can be set to play music for 10 minutes but it always goes off after 5. (Yes, I've timed it) Overall, I think it will be used more the older he gets.He's 6 month old now and still uses this every night and in the mornings he plays with the spinning toys. I like it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Motor very loud, bigger than it appears","review":"The toy is fairly nice as it does appear to capture the attention of my son at night and calms him down when we put him to bed. Yet, it sounds like the older version was better. Frankly, in my view, there are two problems with the current version.First, the motor that moves the fish around is quite loud. Even with the music at the loudest level you can still hear the gears rotating loudly (probably more annoying for parents than the child).Second, to attach the product to the crib, you hang the display (the part you see in the picture on Amazon) and then need to screw in a large battery box through the crib openings. As such, there is a large (think the size of two cans of Coke) box that sticks out the side of the crib and looks very bad/tacky."},{"rating":"1","title":"What were the designers thinking?","review":"Awful! Awful! Awful! I bought the first model for my twins when they were newborns and they loved it. When they were able to get out of the crib into toddler beds they would not give it up. So, when I had another baby, I got the second model knowing it was just as good. Big mistake. To make a long story short, the new version does not come as one model. The battery compartment is separate. You have to attach the model to the crib then insert the battery component to the model. Once my son starts to play with the aquarium it knocks the compartment loose and the only way to get power back again is to push the battery pack in each and every time. Who ok'd this as a new and improved model is beyond me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time, Waste of money","review":"Read the review by \\"718 Session\\" on 8/12/05, pretty much nailed it!!! The only reason I don't agree 100% with that review is that he/she gave 2 stars, while I am only willing to give it 1 star because the design is cute and the sound is good. Otherwise, it does not even compare to the first Ocean Wonders Aquarium. We have that and the Lullabye Dreams, which are both good. Our son is now 2 1/2 and he loves both of them. We bought this one for our daughter, who is now 5 months old. Not only does she hate it, but we hate it too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Discontinued for a reason","review":"This toy has been discontinued at stores so I ordered it online. Boy, was I sorry. The battery pack does not attach properly and leaves a gap. Due to the weight of the batteries, the pack needs additional support to hold it on securly (duck tape/string). I even sent back my first order to find the replacement was worse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great tool!!","review":"I've had this for approx 3 years. Every time I use it, someone asks me where did I get it. It really works. Slicing and serving cake is so much easier now.

When it works it is an efficient, time-saving, neat way to expertly cut and serve a piece of cake. Unfortunately this idea was/is produced out of the country using materials that are guaranteed to break. If you check the reviews at the inventor's site you will see numerous complaints about the same thing, the handles break off. I will continue looking for this or another manufacturer to produce a like product, made in the U.S. out of sturdy materials. The one I have cost $10.00, if I thought it would last $15.00 would be a fair price."},{"rating":"1","title":"A poorly designed product","review":"I had to send this back because it could not even be assembled. There are 34 little metal clips that are supposed to hold the sides together. But they are too small and cannot even be pressed on with pliers. Their suggested solution was to have one person hold the pieces together while another put on the clips. I am pretty mechanically inclined, and it is clear to me that these clips just don't fit. I am returning two of them. If you like frustration and a challenge, go for it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great pots/pans, poor handles.","review":"I bought this set to replace a similar set that is over 15 years old and was abused by a former paramour. While they cook the same as the previous set, that is to say wonderfully, the new style handles are a serious shortcoming.The old handles were made out of rose wood and looked great and were well tapered and smooth. These new ones are a lighter wood which hurts the asthetics. In addition, they are rough to the touch and feel as if you might get a splinter from them. The finish, varnish or polyurethane seems to be missing in a few spots, and the grain of the wood is palpable.This set was about $250 for the 10 piece set and is a real bargain as the origional was over $300 16 years ago.If you are considering these, buy them and you should love the way they cook."},{"rating":"1","title":"MISSING LID AND HANDLE SHIM","review":"Upon opening this set I found the lid for the 9 1/2 in fry pan was missing (671024)And one of the plastic shims that goes below the knob was broken on one of the other lids.both half's were in the packingCan you please send me the missing parts?if you would like to call I can be reached at 402 578 8845best regardsGary"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Holy Bible(Large Print)","review":"This is the best bible I have ever owned.

The live CD is just ferocious, as compelling as Television's \\"The Blow Up\\" but tighter. Just great. Amazing guitar work from both Verlaine and compatriot Jimmy Ripp, solid backing by Fred Smith and Jay Dee Daugherty.The retrospective CD is good, though I wish they had chosen fewer tracks from \\"Cover\\" and more from the brilliant \\"Dreamtime\\" and \\"Flash Light\\". But since \\"Cover\\" is the only album Verlaine recorded for Virgin (the label behind this release) that's probably to be expected. Big plus - the inclusion of the wonderful Verlaine/Richard Lloyd \\"Call Mr. Lee,\\" with Lloyd's Stratocaster moving sideways over the chorus like an angry crab.Completists will complain but the uninitiated will enjoy this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not His Best","review":"I have seen TV, I have seen Tom and this \\"Anthology\\" is a mixed bag too loose to keep me into it.

It can only shoot about 4-5 feet, despite that they say it can shoot fourteen. Except for that it is perfect, and is very fun. Also when you make more fog, a blue light turns on so you can shoot rings in the dark. There is also a faster, and a slower switch that allows you to choose about how far, how fast, and in a way how big.

Perhaps written by persons better able to write code than books, the syntax is overly loose and informal. The really useful data in this book would fit about 20 pages.

According to this \\"biography\\", Dr. Gerald S. Hawkins apparently went into hibernation after 1969.What about Julia M. Dobson, his second wife? Was he a widower or divorced? Does either wife survive him? Do his daughters survive him? Where did he work from 1969 to 2003? Was he blacklisted or something? Where did he live? Did he travel? Did he do any research?

The rounded corners on the top give it a better-than-prepackaged look. I would recommend it in looks. It went together fairly smoothly. It is makes very usable organization space. The ability to divide out the long shelves makes it more flexible for individual needs.Note that the bottom longer shelf has three options for adjustable height. The only thing to be aware of that (which is hard to see in the picture) is that the shelf is set on the middle setting in the picture; this doesn't match the height of the top shelf and will leave a gap above the dividers. If you need space for a phone or anything under that long shelf, you will probably use the top setting which won't leave room for the dividers. It's a give and take. However, I think that is fairly minor. I think the shelf is great.

And this because I praying daily the verse 'And return our eyes to Zion with mercy' always assumed that somehow to be religious meant to support a modern Jewish state in the land of Israel.As I know Ravitzky's political position and bias ( He is a left- of center religious Zionist, ) I have a certain reserve about his writing about Habad , who are in the other camp completely.But this is certainly a work worth reading, and even studying if one wishes to understand the variety of religious positions on the redemptive character and nature of the modern state of Israel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Do yourself a favor and read this book before buying a home.","review":"I'm in the process of buying my first home, and I felt prepared and ready to ask all the right questions of my agent after pouring through the tons of tips provided in this book.

I am so proud of this man and hope that other men (young and older) will see that this is the kind of music and positive representation that is needed in the world. If you have a friend who does not have his music do them a favor and buy them one or both of his CD's.

It took about a half hour to put together. The car comes off the track or flops over often although it does sometimes right itself. The most I have been able to get is eight laps with one charge and without it coming off the track. Three laps is probably the average. The cars are very fast and if it comes off the track, the cars go zipping around, crashing into things which my three year old finds funny. When the car comes off the track and zips around, it sometimes runs into a room with carpeting. The wheels quickly build up with carpet fuzz and hair which you need a tweezers to remove."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't Work!","review":"My son received this for is birthday last year and was very disappointed when the car rarely made it around the track. My husband tried numerous times to adjust the track, but the car was only able to make it around the loop about 1 in 15 times. The best part was the glow-in-the-dark car. My son would turn out the lights, charge the car, and let it go across the room... he found that more amusing than the failed attempts on the track.

I take it by the publication date that this was one of the author's first published works. If I were him, I'd do my best to re-obtain the rights just to remove it from the market for a complete re-write. One story, 'The Revenge Squad', was actually enjoyable even in its present state, but could've used a sound 'chopping' of perhaps five-hundred words or more.

The stories aren't funny whatsoever. Most of the time the punchline is hardly delivered or isn't at all. The fact that more than half the stuff in this book is taken from other books is sad and frightening. It's sad because the author is just taking other people's stuff. It's frightening because if he's picked the best humor he could find from those books, then those books are a pretty sorry case or he has horrible tastes.Bottumline, buy an actual humor book if you are looking to laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tepid humor edited by someone who should know better","review":"This book of humor lacked any of the bite that I would expect from veterans of the military bureaucracy so sharply satirized in \\"Catch-22.\\" It's as if Osgood chose to reinforce the overblown portrayals of World War II veterans as demigods rather than as regular, vulgar, lusty, angry, scared humans.

My 2yr old has already gotten a bit frustrated that she cannot fit all of the animals in the zoo. I didn't have a problem with the mat laying flat as others have stated.

Animals are cute, colorful, very well made and adorable.Now the mat and the play set is a whole other story. VERY poor quality. Just as an example the seam on the lion's den is as poorly melded together and the fences are cheaply made and the one at the back of the tree acting as a gate keeps falling out making my toddler running to me every 3 seconds asking me to fix her \\"broken\\" toy.

My shelves are lined with the original Grimm and Perrault, and I was really looking forward to the artistic rendition this film seemed to be.I was sadly disillusioned. Although 16 year old Christina was endearing in her silent Lolita-esque role, the rest of the film fell flat on its face. It tried to be artistic and sexy, but only came across as weird and stupid. The wolf was ridiculous. Parts of it were so bad I thought about giggling, but it wasn't even unintentionally funny enough to make me laugh.LAME."},{"rating":"1","title":"Strange","review":"It's a weird movie of a few short stories that don't really make much sence to me.

The base station has a corded handset in case you have a power outage or talk too long on the cordless and run out of battery. Even the base station has a battery so if you disconnect the power cord for a minute, you don't have to set the clock or answering machine message again. Having the extra handsets is a convenient feature. I have a three level house, so I put one of the additional handsets on each of the two other levels. Each of the handsets has its own private phone book, plus access to the shared phone book that the base station has. I have no idea what the other people were talking about; the volume on the handsets and in the answering machine is fine. I have no trouble hearing anything.

Potter's own work in the field of becoming one-up on one's fellow man is supplemented by the researches of others in various fields: the carmanship of Godfrey Plaste; the art of not rock-climbing of G.

It portrays women as people who can't make their own decisions, can't work outside of the home, can't handle finances, etc. This attitude toward women is so ignorant, and often results in psychological (if not physical) abuse. For example, one suggestion to a husband is to discuss plans with your wife before you make them, and to give her the reasons for making the decisions you made. What, a woman can't make decisions, too? Thanking her for her attempts to please you. As if all we can do is attempt, but never succeed. My personal favorite, the book suggests that the wife watch football with her husband, and try to really manifest an interest.

This book will never be mistaken for literature. It is an amateruish attempt to create a book from a screen play. Did anyone proofread this book? I found a lot of typos, which immediately makes me wonder about desire to get it to market to take advantage of the film. I am sure the movie is better than the book, even though I haven't seen it. I was tempted several times to quit reading the book...only my curiosity as to its outcome made me finish it, and even the finish was so poorly done, it leaves you sitting there with bubbles over your head. Go see the movie (if you so choose) but don't waste your money on the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls short","review":"While I must say that the artwork in this collection is among my favorite styles from any DC period, I felt that writing fell well short of excellent.

However, given that storyline was a commentary on the Authority et. al., the JLA having their own version of Stormwatch Black is not really believable. Particularly with Flash and Green Arrow in there, the non-lethal approach will cause conflict, as you know there will be no brain splattering punches a la Jack Hawksmoor."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your money....","review":"I recently purchased Archives from ebay for only 150 dollars. I am not a big fan of Yngwie but I wanted to see what the hype was all about. The box set lacks diversity. You can hear 2 cd's and not bother about the rest of them because he does the same thing over and over. He's a good guitarist, but I think this box set was overdone. The price is also a lot! imagine 8 cd's + 2 dvd's for 361.00! 8 cd's you can purchase used for around 10.00 and 2 dvd's for around 40.00...that makes it 120.00$ Whats the silver chain used for....who wants that unless u are one of Yngwie's family member. This is a huge investment so think and buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not one of Jeff Beck's best","review":"After having this cd for nearly a year, I have determined that it just isn't very good. Beck's guitar playing is good, but I don't like the tone on this record. And I have always heard what a great drummer Bozzio is, but I assume that is not based on this material. Also, despite what fans of this cd think, it DOES sound overproduced. It just sounds like way too much effort was put in to make it sound just right and the music suffers for it. Also, several songs are ruined by that annoying talking. Don't get me wrong. I think Jeff Beck is one of the greatest rock guitarists I have ever heard, but this is not one of his best. I prefer Blow By Blow, Wired and Who Else and would recommend those long before this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Every song rocks!","review":"This is definatley one of Beck's best albums. Before I go on, let's clarify that. Jeff Beck's best albums, IMHO, are: Blow by Blow, Wired, Guitar Shop, and You Had It Coming.Like on Jeff's new release, You Had It Coming, he serves us with some raw guitar with funky beats and great stuff to listen to. It's great to listen to in the car. As always, Jeff's solos are timeless on this album. Where Were You is worth the price of the album alone. It's Guitar Shop's 'how did he do that!' song.As with all Beck releases, his genius and emotion are served at great amounts. Savoy, Stand on It, Big Block....they are all great songs. As said before, Where Were You is the standout. A Day in the House is REALLY fun to listen to, it's really funky and portray's Jeff's humour as well. It's a great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"Guitar shop is one of the best rock music ever recorded by Jeff Beck.This album is an instrumental album featuring some of the finest guitar solos.This album contains 9 of the finest songs and is very highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech","review":"I'm cracking up at reading a review that calls this a \\"timeless masterpiece.\\" Gawd...no offense, but groupies drive me nuts.You HAVE to be kidding me. As I said in an earlier review of Beck: it's been said that when he's good, he's very good; when bad, very bad. Folks, this is bad. Not his worst, but bad. It pains me to say that, but it's true. DON'T waste your money on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best JB","review":"I cannot agree with previous reviewers that this cd is in the same class as \\"Blow By Blow\\" or \\"Wired\\".

It is a commercial CD at best, in my opinion. With the big name musicians, and reputations to match, I was very disappointed.

It's boring, and simple."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ear Pollution","review":"Being new to Jeff Beck's music (Crossroads '07 video found me wanting to know more) and after listening to \\"Blow By Blow\\" and \\"Wired,\\" I found this recording to very unredeeming. Over-Produced to the max. It kinda sounds what a \\"garage\\" would look like. There are some great moments, but too few. The rip-off of Zappa is very apparent, but Zappa it ain't. One listening is enough."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not yer daddy's Jeff Beck album","review":"When this album came out, there was a great deal of hype surrounding it. I (being a huge Beck fan and mindful of his highly under-appreciated \\"There and Back\\") bought the hype.Sadly, I also bought the album. No, it's not as absurdly bad as works like \\"Flash,\\" but it's up there (or should I say \\"down there\\"). That's the thing about Beck: when he's on, he's the best. But when he's bad....phew.......Another reviewer said it best in that this sounds like someone doing a cheap imitation of Beck. Save your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential: Jeff Beck","review":"They Principally recorded at the Sol Studio, England on Sunday, October 2, 1988. Mastered at Tape One, London on Sunday, November 20, 1988. Jeff Beck's Guitar Shop with drummer/percussionist Terry Bozzio and keyboard player Tony Hymas is a another Jeff Beck instrumental masterpieced in 1989, as Beck plays as a guitar hero in his prime should - full of fury and finesse. This album won the Grammy in 1990 for \\"Best Instrumental Rock\\" album, and it's easy to see the reasoning, as Beck is in top-notch form throughout the album. The tremendous tandem of Hymas and Bozzio aren't exactly slouches, either. Guitar Shop highlights include the songs \\"Big Block\\", \\"Savoy\\" and the title track. Beck fans will find his playing here mesmerizing, surpassing the technical mastery of Flash. Apart from a sizzling instrumental version of \\"Big Block,\\" less devoted listeners will find Guitar Shop as captivating as most other incidental film music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beck, Beck, Beck","review":"For a while there, this was mandatory listening in my house.

Probably so."},{"rating":"2","title":"Jeff Beck's middle years were great too!","review":"Jeff Beck is one of the great artists of the electric guitar. After Hendrix (who is in a class of his own), Beck is one of the greatest. Unlike many others, he covers a broad musical spectrum, incluing hard rock, more or less straight blues, jazz fusion, more or less straight jazz, and classical (bent his own way, of course).In Guitar Shop, Beck continues his journey. Not as groundgreaking as his very early work--with the Yardbirds--he replaced, and improved upon, Eric Clapton), and not as revolutionary as his work with the Jeff Beck Group (Truth and Beck-Ola). Not cutting edge jazz fusion (Wired and Blow by Blow), it still stands head and shoulders above virtually anyone else playing on electric guitar!Buy it, but don't stop hear!"},{"rating":"2","title":"FANTASTIC","review":"Jacoby is unforgettable in this one!

I bought a used dvd of the production and was so disgusted with the performances I wanted to throw it away. On an episode of Frasier - Dereck Jacobi did a parodoy of himself playing Hamlet. I now think the parody was intended to mock his poor acting in this play. The screaming and yelling of the stage actors to make up for a lack of sincerity and proper editing one would find in a movie only made me angry. The direction was absolutely terrible. The play appears to be a work of high school students and not professionals."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best film version of Hamlet of the six I've seen","review":"Like one of the previous reviewers (Drektah), I've watched this Derek Jacobi version as well as the ones with Kenneth Branagh, Kevin Kline, Mel Gibson, Laurence Olivier, and David Tenant, and I like Derek Jacobi's version's best. I feel Jacobi and Olivier do the best job of conveying Hamlet's intelligence and sensitivity. When hears Jacobi or Olivier one believes Hamlet is making up his soliloquies as he speaks and is feeling the philosophical ambiguities and angst suggested by his words. I do feel the Olivier version might be slightly too angsty, but I think people's tastes will differ as to how consumed with anguish and uncertainty Hamlet is.I also agree with Drektah's assessment of the production quality of the aforementioned versions of Hamlet."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Big Let Down","review":"Lindsay's books usually mean tight plots with plenty of inside details about how the FBI works, crackling action scenes, and believable dialogue laced with humor. This book has it all except for the tight plotting, and without the tight plot the other ingredients don't hold together very well. The humor is good, the insider details interesting, and the dialogue excellent. Unfortunately the meandering plot is so loose the book kind of falls apart. Think of this book as a cake with every ingredient except the flour. Lots of sugar, baking soda, and eggs but the key ingredient is missing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clarifying Harlan Ellison's Role","review":"Just noting that Harlan Ellison did not \\"ghostwrite\\" this show: he created it; things went horribly, horribly wrong; and then he took his name off it and used his standard Writer's Guild pseudonym \\"Cordwainer Bird.\\"He did write the pilot, \\"Phoenix Without Ashes,\\" but again, without his name attached, as he couldn't stomach what was done to his original teleplay.You can find the whole story of his experience with \\"The Starlost\\" in his essay \\"Somehow, I Don't Think We're in Kansas, Toto,\\" which you can find in his book \\"Stalking the Nightmare,\\" available through Amazon."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two hooves up, WAY up!","review":"A MUST-HAVE for horse lovers!

There is no index and no rhyme or reason to the order of the book. The ghost writer has advanced degrees from Stanford (or somesuch) and apparently has never written a book before this vanity effort.The content is so so at best. The author has no formal education in biology or medicine and wants everyone to eat raw, rotten cabbage.

They can bring back fond memories of the late 60's or bring you right up to date with what's happening now. The lead singer is phenomenal. The songs are fresh and provoke thought and the music is pure rock and roll. This album should appeal to all of theose folks between the age of 10 to 60 and maybe beyone. Give it a spin.

The music is so infectious and their performance so energetic that you can't help but jump up and down. South Normal is good, raw rock and roll. I was hooked from the first track through the last. Nathan's voice pentrates and leaves a permanent impression on your brain. Ben and Jason play off each other so well, they might just be the same person. Keeping the whole package grounded in solid beats are Jeremy and Shannon. This group is so well versed in their craft. The only bad thing about their recordings and live shows is eventually it has to end. South Normal is a band to watch.

When I received mine it was all oxidized and had strange squiggly marks all over the blade. I scrubbed it down with WD-40, which made the blade a lot cleaner, but it's still really ugly. Who knows if there's lead in the blade or something. It strangely feels warmer to the touch than my stainless steel knives do. Do not trust it.The sheath is also a piece of junk.The only reason I gave this blade 2 stars instead of 1 is that the blade is very sharp as advertised."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well, you get what you pay for........","review":"I bought this knife a a birthday present for a friend, and couldn't bring myself to give it to him, it's so cheap.

That smell wafting out of the box wasn't the leather smell I had anticipated; it was SPRAY PAINT. I went to wash my hands of the black residue, and one of the tails fell into the water, the water started turning black. underneath all that spray paint, there is actual leather, as promised. It's a red/brown leather, but I can assume it is genuine nonetheless.This wasn't at all what I was hoping for, but I guess it depends on what you intend on using it for.

It is also well balance so it doesnt require a lot of aiming to hit the wanted spot. Also, what counts, Im receiving excellent feedbacks from the people at the other end of it.

The main character, Bunny Love, is just so annoying: her obsesion with 'new age' stuff is too much, she is a trouble magnet, she is invasive and she is clumpsy all the time, then when she 'hosts' the Dog event, out of the blue she becomes 'gracious'. Don't waste your time, it's not worth to read!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Predictable!","review":"It is rare that I don't finish a book or skip through pages but, this book demanded it! It wasn't funny, it was so very obvious and predictable. There were a few entertaining moments in it but very few. I can't say that I won't try another book by the same Author. I'm just hoping that this was her fledgling effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Makes you smile","review":"When I first saw this book on my Kindle I passed it by. The mention of Feng Shui in the description turned me off. However, I realized after running across it a few times that this story was by Kathleen Long who wrote Love Unlisted. I had absolutely LOVED that fabulous story so I decided I'd give this one a try too. I'm happy I did. I didn't find it as engaging as the other book, but it was a fun lighthearted read. The characters are rather oddball which makes it interesting. There were definitely some funny moments throughout. I love the combination of zany main character meets predictible sane hero. It was a nice fun romance.If you aren't into main characters that walk to the beat of a different drum you may want to give this a miss. I also don't think I'd recommend this for a young adult. Overall, if you want a good laugh and a unique story line I'd give this one a try."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quick and Easy Read","review":"This book is great for the airport, beach, or train ride. The writing was seamless and for free it was a deal. At first I found the main character, Bunny Love, endearing. Then it got annoying. The constant harping on positive chi, chakras, energy, was distracting. It really didn't add to the story. The romance between Bunny and Nate moved extremely quickly and honestly didn't make sense to me. There seemed to be other characters introduced that seemed to make more sense in terms of romantic match. Then there were characters introduced that really didn't add to the story, just made it even more disjointed. What started off as an enjoyable read ended in a disappointing and anti-climactic finale. This is definitely a fluffy novel but the author is a good writer which made it bearable."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beach read","review":"This was a cute/funny book.

Nate Mcutly is a very A type man who just by having Bunny near him is sending him to the ER. This was cute fast read -- that left a smile on my face on a Sunday afternoon.If you enjoy this genre I would also suggest;Forever and a Day (Lucky Harbor),The Marriage Bargain (Marriage to a Billionaire),The Fireman Who Loved Me: A Bachelor Firemen NovelandTime Out (Harlequin Blaze)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"A mind-cleansing read that takes you to a warm fuzzy place.

The first few chapters explore commentary and \\"reasons\\" per say about why gay men choose Meth. But the stories at the back of the book are the ones that capture the true feeling of growing up gay in America and how addiction can take a hold of ones life and rip them apart as well as the ones that they love and love them.It is highly recommended for someone suffering with addiction, families and loved ones who may be witnessing this now and those who have been fortunate to come through the otherside.As stated above....A Must Read!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Please support this book","review":"Dr. Ken CiminoYour dedication on this book inspired me.

Customer service blamed interference from other lights nearby, but the light was >50 ft away from the second light (same model and both flickering). When no other light around, same thing happened. We bought 8, and 6 of them are defective, 75% failure rate(!), making one wonder if the manufacturer ever QC their products. The service then shipped some cheap plastic so called \\"universal blinders\\", they are in different color, wrong shape and too big to fit. Finally we were told this is a discontinued line and no replacement available. Not a good experience at all. We now have to disconnect the photo cell, pretend it is just a decoration.Please note this review is about the manufacture, Maxim Lighting, their product and service, Amazon and retail vendor provided excellence service and have nothing to do with the defective product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for the Audiophiles","review":"Although it is great to remember these songs, I can only recommend this CD for listening while driving. With the windows open. Going atleast 55 mph.The sound is so compressed to be almost unlistenable in a quiet setting. Particularly, Mel Torme's Careless Hands is the worst. Not all the songs are affected, but enough to keep me from giving this more than two stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sort of stunning","review":"One Eyed Man is a real shocker. A shocking disappointment, that is, for anyone who is a Hunters & Collectors/Mark Seymour fan. Considering how H&C were incapable of making anything but innovative, emotive music for two decades, it's hard to believe that it took Seymour four years to put out this gutless album. And Seymour already had a gorgeous solo album, King Without A Clue, under his belt. Some critics have described One Eyed Man as Seymour doing Crowded House. That's about dead on. There's a lot of sound, a lot of notes, but no hooks and no real songs. You wonder how anyone had the patience to labour over the flawless production of these flabby tunes. Seymour once seemed to have a bottomless well of lyrical wordplay and melody. It's a mystery how quickly it all dried up. Hopefully he was just distracted, trying to make a tribute album to his brother (Nick, ex-Crowded House) or something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Produce Good Sear Marks","review":"I have several Berndes pans that function wonderfully. However, the Berndes grill pan is not one of them. The problem is you cannot get an aluminum pan hot enough to produce good sear marks. Try as I might - I can only produce barely visible grill marks on a variety of foods with the Berndes grill pan. In contrast, my cast iron LeCreuset grill pan produces beautiful dark sear marks every time on the same burner on my stovetop. Additionally, the handle on my Berndes grill pan came loose after every use. The pan is not well made nor does it function well. Save your money and buy a cast iron grill pan."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Quality and Customer Service","review":"This pan arrived with a defect and I contacted customer support (unfortunately, I did not use the pan within the Amazon return period).After several unanswered emails to the customer service email address at the Berndes site, I contacted them by phone and they said they would send a part that I was to use to repair the pan. Bad enough that it wasn't immediately replaced, but I never received the part.Most people expect higher-end cookware with a \\"lifetime guarantee\\" to have decent customer service, or some semblance thereof, but none exists here.My first and last Berndes purchase was a complete waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way too much filler.","review":"Justify the cover price by making the book thick:75 pages of the history of the guitar (\\"the lute had a number of drawbacks\\") and famous guitar players -- 12 pages of glossary, several pages of blank music staffs, an overly inclusive index--there's too much air in this book.Advice on buying a guitar: 'bring along a friend who knows about guitars'The beginning songs presented are the same old 'twinkle twinkle' 'merrily we roll along' 'jingle bells' that are in EVERY old, not-very-good guitar book--this wasn't written for children, why all the children's songs? The bits and pieces of music theory are not well organized. The general tone of the writing is condescending. And there's way too much filler: you've just learned \\"twinkle twinkle\\" -- do you really need a chapter (well, a couple of pages) on recording yourself in a studio?If you have ANY beginning guitar books already, then 90% of the actual guitar-playing information in this one is redundant."},{"rating":"2","title":"good buy","review":"I needed some extra USB ports for my computer because only 1 was working, and this port really picked up the slack, it's great that it has the card readers too, it makes it quick and easy for my sony cards and sandisk.

I give it an 'A' for effort because the author really tried to create something useful.

Hopefully an entirely new edition, or new book even, will come out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very, Very Cucumber","review":"Where to begin? Method makes good dish soap. It cleans well and usually smells wonderful. The cucumber version is no exception. This soap offers a strong cucumber scent, one that smells very clean and fresh. It cleans just as well as any other dish soap I've ever used, so no worries about compromising cleaning power for environmental friendliness. My one reservation, and the reason I gave this product a 4 instead of a 5, is that the cucumber scent is sometimes so strong that it remains on my dishes, and I don't want to be smelling cucumber through my spaghetti sauce. This is the only scent with which I've had that problem. Otherwise, I'm very pleased, and I still use this stuff because I like the cucumber scent, even if it is too strong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaves soapy taste","review":"Usually I really like Method products. This one was very disappointing. I washed a couple of water bottles and a bunch of pots with this soap. Now all of the water from the bottles tastes like the soap. They have been rinsed repeatedly and washed with a different soap. The Method Soap taste will not go away. The same is true for food cooked in the pots I washed. Vegetables taste like they were steamed in soap."},{"rating":"2","title":"I luv this product","review":"It's the best and biodegradeable too! It doesn't leave a soapy film.

King (and that's high praise). \\"Strawgirl\\" is the second in her series about Bo Bradley, a manic-depressive investigator of child-abuse cases. Sounds like a downer, but it's not. Ms. Padgett's skillful, imaginative writing, ingenious plotting and complex characterization make this fascinating reading, high on my list of unputdownable books. Bo Bradley is a most admirable, courageous and likable character, as is psychiatrist and cult researcher Eva Blindhawk Broussard, who is introduced in \\"Strawgirl.\\" I hope the publisher will make this book available again soon. I had to seek out a secondhand copy, and it was well worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"What is Evil, really?","review":"Armed only with her own mental illness and the strange idea that only the guilty should be punished, even if the crime is terrible, Bo Bradley sets out to see that justice is done.You can read any of the books in Padgett's Bo Bradley series in any order, but I recommend reading this one before TURTLE BABY (you will see why if you read them both.) In this book Satanism is not the source of all evil, though evil lurks behind every page in the book.Padgett deserves the awards this book won. It is a tour-de-force, complete with a Frenchman with a romantic flair."},{"rating":"2","title":"my time in paradise","review":"Real human emotions, sometimes set up in a magical way, sometimes in the most prosaic, are the subject of Joan Leegant's An Hour in Paradise. She is able to draw out our sympathies, our hopes, and even our disdain, for her characters, whether we like them or not. For example, I could feel for the poor schlepper who found himself lost in Sefad, even though I could not and probably will not ever like him or identify with him. I certainly did not like the Yeshiva student, but his difficulty is universal, although drawn in a narrow situation. A writer who can draw my emotions for a character I find dull, ordinary, or despicable, is doing her job, doing it very well indeed. I spent many hours in paradise reading and discussing An Hour in Paradise."},{"rating":"2","title":"I found a treasure in Paradise!!!!!!!!","review":"This book is a real treasure!I began each story in this collection with eager anticipation and was never disappointed.

I bought several!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a week in Bakersfield","review":"I was very drawn to the notion of a collection of short stories with Jewish characters - since I am one myself. Unfortunately, and there is no kind way of saying this - this is a writer without talent - not a smidgen. She prattles, endlessly piling on pointless colorless details. She digresses, she's chummy, she's boring. The net effect is narcotic. It was a struggle to finish her tedious stories - and, to tell the truth, I finally gave up after reading several. If there is a gem in that collection, I missed it..This author says she teaches writing at Harvard. That is very unfortunate. She may have single handedly decimated a generation of writers by putting them to sleep.Pick up a book by Isaac Bashavis Singer or Phillip Roth or Norman Mailer if you want to read about Jewish characters... .... \\"An Hour in Paradise\\" was more like a week in Bakersfield.... with all due respect to Philadelphia."},{"rating":"1","title":"No keywords","review":"I bought this as a gift for someone to whom Shakespeare is of constant interest.

I got it at walmart for $14.99, it has a 5-year warranty, and it just works great! There is a red indicator light when it's on, and a green indicator light that turns off when the desired temperature is reached. I can get right to the roots and haven't burnt my scalp yet! It's design is amazing so there is nowhere to catch your hair on.BUY THIS STRAIGHTENER!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the price.","review":"I recently ordered this hair straightener, and was satisfied with the results after using it. It's probably not best for me because I have lots of thick hair, but if you really don't feel like spending a lot of money on a straightener, have thin hair, or are not going to use it very often, this would be the right item for you.Pros:Size, convenient for straightening bangs.Quick heat up.Price.Cons:Not amazingly effective but for the price you can't complain much.Overall, I am glad I purchased this product as my previous Hot Tools straightener was extremely damaging to my hair and I pretty much just needed a quick cheap replacement, which will do for now."},{"rating":"2","title":"just perfect!!!!","review":"i have to say i love this little thing. i have it over a month now and i use it every day and love it. it warms up realy quickly and does the job. the way it's build your hair doesnt get stuck in it . get it."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT QUALITY, 2 HOLLYWOOD GREAT MONSTERS","review":"this is a great quality toy and has fine detail.

The illustrations and photos are abundant, and the text doesn't assume a great deal of specialized knowledge on the part of the reader.

Despite the sub-title, the author ranges freely across Adorno's work in philosophy, sociology, aesthetics, music and literature, and just over two hundred pages (of main text) is not enough space to deal adequately with the material, let alone with the additional portraits of associates such as Horkheimer and Kracauer. Some of Adorno's major works, such as Negative Dialectics, receive cursory treatment, and either the author, or possibly the translator, is not comfortable with technical philosophical arguments. Some discussions of Heidegger's views, for example, are nonsensical.This has the appearance of a hasty piece of work, and as one reads on, the impression grows that the author has little respect for his subject. As a person and thinker, Adorno was surely flawed, but his story deserves a more balanced, detailed and informed recounting."},{"rating":"2","title":"hidden object","review":"Wants you to buyto much unsteady of playing game.

It is VERY different quality than displayed in the picture on the box and commercials (showing crystal clear quality) while the actual picture is grainy, drab and virtually free of color.

It is nice because you can plug it into your tv and sing along with the songs and hear your voice coming out of the tv.

The idea is great, but maybe they should put a little more thought into this product. The picture that shows on the t.v. is very grainy. Almost cannot make out the picture. I thought that ours was stuck in the color warp mode (it wasn't). Also the microphone barely transmitted our voice to the t.v. We cranked up the volume on our t.v. to help, but it never got any better. Another negative to this is that the music ROM are too expensive (about $10 each) and the songs are not really appropriate for the younger child. Also, start saving all of your extra change for the batteries you will need. 3 AA and 6 C. That's right, the system does not run on electricity... only batteries. Overall this is a piece of junk for what it costs. By the time I bought all of the ROMs and the unit I spent about $140.

After listening to one song, she told me it was boring. I even bought some additional song packs, but they are not music that she relates to. She loves to sing and dance, but if she is singing, she can't hear the musical recording. The clarity of the picture on the screen is not what I would consider a high quality and the star image never appears on my screen. Instead it appears even darker then the normal image.To make matters even worse is that you must put batteries in it and the instructions specifically state that if you do not turn off the device after each use, it does not turn off automatically. Therefore, you are required to turn off and turn on with each use.Most of the songs are far over my child's head and even with buying additional song cartridges, I don't think we will ever get our money out of this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"not what it is in the store","review":"looks and works great in the store but, when you hook it up to your tv the picture you get is nothing like what you see on the display.

Even with the proper lighting your picture is just to dark not at all what it was like on the stores display. Then to make matters worse the picture wheel on the top of the toy stoped turning after about 10 minutes of play. Back to the store this went funny thing about this is my daughter did'nt even care.

However, after purchasing this toy and the limited amount of music that was avaiable for purchase with it, (not to mention the amount of battery's with no power cord)I returned the toy to the store less than a day that I had it and my children choose V-Tech, Vsmile instead, now that's a great toy!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"Picture quality is horrible, and eats up batteries.

After putting about $10 worth of batteries into the thing, the microphone didn't amplify very well. Our picture quality was about what you would expect for this price range. Overall, a good idea, but if you are looking for a good microphone, skip this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your money","review":"Scammed again by the toyman...........Saw the commercials, kids begged for it, stood in line at Toys R Us three days before Christmas to purchase it even though my gut told me otherwise. I have a 5 year old and a 2 year old, they enjoyed the gimmick for about ten minutes christmas morning and then went on to their other toys. The picture quality is terrible, the voice sound volume is barely audible. The shame of dropping $60 bucks on this piece of crap is unbearable. Hopefully this review will help save some of you. Take a stand against these companies constantly ripping of the consumer and keep your money in your pocket."},{"rating":"1","title":"Star station disappointment","review":"We were very excited for our daughter to receive this toy for christmas...We were really disappointed in its picture & music quality. On display at Wal Mart, the picture is clear and in color...On our tv at home the picture is grainy with very little color. Our (4 yr old) daughter has a difficult time getting the music to play. It is also hard to line up so that she is the \\"star.\\" Although it takes a lot of batteries, she has not used it enough to use them up. I would not recommend this product until it is improved upon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it!1","review":"Ok, I got this for my twins for their bday yesterday and it's already boxed up and ready to return. First off, it takes way too many batteries. The sound and picture are horrible as well. It's so not worth the $50 I spent. Save your $$$ and use your video recorder!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible! May I have a REFUND, Please?","review":"To say that I searched high and low for this toy is an understatement. I just knew that my wanna be singing daughter would love this toy. She probably would have if the darn thing ever worked. I couldn't get the microphone to work and the play button on the machine wouldn't advance. Was this supposed to be in color, Fisher Price? The picture (black and white) was the only thing that was right on this machine because, although no color, the picture was clear. False advertisement because the box was in color. I did return it to Target and went searching again. I ended up buying a karoake machine for myself and my daughter loved that. I'd go with grab a microphone and some CDS and wait until Fisher Price does it the right way and save your money until then! Fisher Price, you've not done it this time and I usually love your brand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"I went crazy looking for this toy everywhere. I searched in Toys R' Us, Kaybee Toys, EToys, Walmart, Target, etc and couldn't find this toy anywhere. Even the Fisher-Price website said they were sold out. Some places told me this item was discontinued. Finally, after all my searching the place where I least expected \\"Linens n' Things\\" had the toy including 3 tapes so I went ahead and purchased it for Christmas. I was very disappointed once I connected it. The songs are too difficult for small children and they are not even popular songs for the exception of a few such as \\"Who let the dogs out and the Shrek song\\". Honestly, it looks very bad on TV and it's not what the commercials made it look like. If I would of known all this I wouldn't of taken so much time looking for it. In conclusion, people save your money and if you have a camcorder video tape your kids and let them watch themselves after on TV. This product is going right back to the store!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Money spent better in other places....","review":"Way to much money for this item. And the supporting music is WAY over-priced. There are so many better ways to get your children to sing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Idea...Poor Product","review":"Both our kids love watching home videos of themselves and they also recently started to sing their favorite songs using home made mics, so we came across this toy at a local box store and thought it would be the perfect Santa gift! It's very easy to plug in and start using, but with fresh batteries one of the mics stopped working in under 20 seconds. It also gives off a horrible buzz in the speakers...and you have to have the volume turned all the way up on the base station for the music to be heard. Also...with HDTV being the standard these days, why market a product that has less than great \\"standard def\\" quality? That doesn't make any sense. With toys like the Wii and X-box, this toy is very sub-standard! A complete waste of $50.00! Do NOT waste your money!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Please don't waste your money","review":"My daughter got this toy as a gift for her fourth birthday. She played with it once and has never touched it again. What I dislike most about this toy is that you have to buy batteries for it. It has to be connected to the television set why not make an AC adapter as well for it???? The music is also age inappropriate. It's just a total waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"all those batteries for poor quality","review":"I thought this would be a great hit for my son who loves to sing and dance. When opened on Christmas the whole family (cousins included) was so excited....until we had to put in so many batteries, hook it up to the t.v. and man what a disappointment. The picture is so fuzzy it was a little scary to see ourselves like that. Fisher price really let our family down with this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Soooo much fun for a 5 year old......","review":"This toy was a big hit with our 5 year old daugher, She loves to sing and dance and now to do it and be seen on our big living room t.v. just was the best, my husband and I laughed so hard watching her perform for us and she loved every minute of it, only bad thing is it takes lots of batterys, if it had a plug or could take a universal plug this would be the best toy...The picture was a little dark, but we added a lamp near the camera as they said to in the instructions and it was just fine. My daughter loves the feature of the double image screen, you can add a cd player to it with a cord and use your own music, I think we will be doing that instead of buying the 10$ each extra music roms, they were kinda corny...Other then that and the battery thing it is great fun for all ages...."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT IS NOT WHAT IT APPEARS TO BE ON THE BOX!","review":"I saw the ad for this product and thought it would be such a fun gift for my children! I was disappointed in this toy. First, it takes 6 C batteries to operate the machine and AA batteries to operate the microphone. The picture was not in color and just projected shadows and the microphone didn't even work! In addition, the words to the songs don't appear on the tv screen like a real karoke machine.I love fisher-price, but this toy really disappointed me and my children. I highly recommend NOT purchasing this very expensive machine!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money on this toy!","review":"I bought this for my 3 kids for Christmas, ages 3,4 and 5 and I thought it would be the biggest hit but I just took it right back to the store. The picture quality is terrible!!! It is very misleading considering the picture on the box. Even with great light, the screen kept fading to black. I kept thinking it was the batteries (which is also a pain) and after 3 sets of new batteries, it was still doing the same thing. Even when you could see the picture it was awful. The kids really had no interest in it after realizing they couldn't see themselves very well. Also, the sound on the microphone is terrible. Fisher price is usually right on with their quality toys but definitely not on this one..... I wish I had read all of the reviews before even buying it......I hope this saves someone from making the same mistake."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Christmas Return","review":"I purchased this for my daughter as a Christmas gift because it seemed like it would be alot of fun..much to our surprise my love to sing daughter played with this for about 10 minutes on christmas day and hasnt gone back to it again.....The music cartridge is horrible and the sound quality is AWFUL....something else to add to my return list this year."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Santa Disappoints\\"","review":"What a disappointment! This toy looked like it would be such fun! Santa left it for my 3 kids ages 6,4 & 2. They could not get the volume on the mic to work without having their mouth right on the mic, the picture on the TV was very blurry. \\"Santa\\" is taking this back, my kids don't even remember this was one of their gifts because they played with it about 3 minutes total. I actually would not even give this 1 star, rather a -3 stars for a BIG DISAPPOINTMENT"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"I agree with all the other bad reviews of this product. I bought this for my daughters birthday, she thought it was fun for about 10 minutes after she realized she didn't know any of the songs. She hasn't played with it much since we got it. The quality of the camera and the sound is horrible. The song disc that comes with it doesn't work all the time. I am taking it back and getting her something she will play with more. Even though the toy is $50+ dollars, that is a lot to pay for 3-7 year old toy. Save your money and buy a toy they will actually play with."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Volume","review":"OK - I didn't expect too much when I got this product. Just a chance for my daughter to see & hear herself on TV. Well - I guess one out of two will have to do. The microphone didn't work at all for transmitting sound to the TV. It did fine to change the picture effect. Was kind of a bummer for our 4-year old on Christmas morning. I returned it hoping to get another that worked, but maybe I'll just save my money now.Great concept - too bad the execution wasn't half as good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hesitant to buy, but glad I did.","review":"After reading these reviews I thought I will get it and save the receipt. We hooked it up and it is great! Good picture, good sound and the kids love it. I have a 5 and 8 year old and it was a birthday gift for the 5 year old. Can't wait to buy more music for it. The picture quality is much bette then I thought it would be. And we have a older TV. It only has the input jacks for the yellow and white. I love it. Not any problems. Microphone works even when the music is not playing so you can play a CD you have and they can sing to it. My 5 year old is singing to High School High as I type this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Are you kidding me?","review":"I bought this for my 3 year old before reading the reviews. What is Fisher Price thinking recommeding this toy with top 40 hits for a 3 year old? Give me a break! When was the last time you got into the car and your child said: 'hey mom, have you heard that new Black Eyed Peas song?' Give me a break! Unless the song is on Shrek or Chicken LIttle...they don't know it!!!! I'm really in awe that a TOY COMPANY can't figure this out! At least give one cartridge appropriate for a 3 year old. On top of that, I agree with the other comments about the picture being grainy. To FIsher Price, if your going to make a product...at least do it right. I'm so tired of all these cheap toys that don't last a week."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was not impressed........","review":"I purchased this for my daughter for Christmas. On tv it looks pretty good, however, when you get it at home the picute looks a mess. Okay, so I figured what can you expect for the money, but the most disappointing thing for her and myself were the songs. The only song that she knew was \\"Who let the dogs out\\" and all she knew was the chorus. They should have songs from difference genres, not just pop.Wish I kept my receipt, because it is sitting around collecting dust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible quality","review":"I bought this for my 4 year old daughter. The idea is great, but the execution is terrible. Picture quality is extremely poor and you have to tilt the camera just right and have your child stand in the exact right spot to get the image. Save yourself the money and headache and skip this one!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor Sound Quality","review":"The Star Station is a fun concept and my daughter and three year old friends love to see themelves on TV but the audio is poor and images are distorted. I advise you to wait to buy this one until the glitches are worked out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Expected a bit more than we got","review":"Toy is reasonably entertaining just for the simple fact that the kids get to see themselves on TV and hear thier voice. There are some neat image options that spin around the image on the TV screen, but the controls for it are on the microphone so if the child has the mic they would either have to do it or the adult would have to try to figure out how to maneuver their way through a 2 year old's fingers to press it, there is no control for it on the console. Also, we expected words to the songs that are on the cartridge to be displayed on the screen...they weren't (obviously geared toward younger children) and while the songs are playing it's really hard to hear your voice through the microphone."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Star Station could've been better..","review":"It is almost like the makers of this product didn't think we would notice the poor quality of the picture and sound. Did they test it? The idea is awesome! Young kids love to see themselves on tv and play it up for a crowd too. Unfortunately even with the best lighting it is hard to see the picture.. and we have a huge t.v! Worse than the bad picture is the sound, without putting my ear up to the unit I cannot even hear the music.. how is my son supposed to sing along? That is the worse part. Great concept.. needs improvement. MUCH improvement. We kept ours, just never use it. Too frustrating."},{"rating":"1","title":"A waste of money","review":"I purchased this toy on sale at Christmas for my 5 yr old daughter. Not only is the video picture quality very poor whether in natural light or room lighting, but the product is wrapped so tightly in hard molded plastic, that it is impossible to return after it is opened. The music cartridge that comes with it has no songs that are recognizable to little kids. I am very disappointed with Fisher Price on this one. I feel like I've been a victim of deceptive advertising."},{"rating":"1","title":"Star Station Songs not age 3 appropriate","review":"We were excited for our daughter to receive the star station for Christmas - as she loves to use a microphone and sing. She has a great time with the star station singing on her own (and not with the Black Eyed Peas!) and watching herself on tv. None of the star station cartridges are age appropriate for a 3/4 year old (well at least not ours) most of the songs she knows are twinkle twinkle and row row your boat. I WISH they would make some cartridges with nursery songs on them so the younger kids can sing along with the music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Glad I read these reviews!!!","review":"I went to Toys R Us today to pick one of these things up, they were out of stock, then found this site of reviews while looking for it online. After reading the reviews, I'll SAVE MY MONEY"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Worth The Money","review":"I was so excited to buy this for my 5 year old after he tried it out in the store. On Christmas morning, the experience was totally different. The picture was awful, my son realized that he had to stay still in order to be seen in the TV (he loves to dance around), and there are no words to the songs. He lost interest within 10 minutes, and has not picked it up since. I will be returning this to the store, which is not something I normally do with toys. He has had more fun with a keyboard and microphone he received as a gift."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Idea - Piece of Junk?","review":"Grandma & Grandpa brought this for our 4 yr old daughter. She loves to sing and dance so we all thought this would be the perfect gift for her. We did see that batteries were required and were surprised that an AC Adapter was not built in. We attempted to hook it up to 2 TVs. Our living room TV has AV jacks built into the front. After plugging it directly into the TV, we had sound and no video. Then we tried to run it through the VCR. Still only sound and the sound quality through the VCR was horrible. Finally we tried another TV running it through the VCR for that TV and still audio and no video. Finally we decided that the video input jack must be defective. What a disappointment - right out the box it does not work! We planned on exchanging it assuming it was defective, but after reading these reviews we may reconsider."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Order from Amazon","review":"The product was fine, waiting 7 months to get it was pathetic. I received an email once a week saying the item would be shipped within 14 days, and the only way to cancel was to try and call and get a human being, which I failed to do on numerous occasions. You can NOT cancel online. I ordered this for a Christmas gift in Nov 2005 and received it sometimes in June 2006. I do NOT recommend anyone purchasing any item from Amazon online."},{"rating":"1","title":"so not worth it!","review":"I recently returned this toy. I purchased it before I read some of these reviews. But I thought what the heck, it can't be that bad. well, it is. I figured I'd give it a shot. My daughters Would love the idea of this toy but the picture quality is NOT good and I think I had better than most. The music is really not apprpriate for little ones and they get frustrated because they can't sing along. older kids might enjoy it but will not tolerate quality. So not worth even trying it out!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a favorite","review":"My 4 year old son got this for his birthday. After scrounging around for batteries for it (taking them out of other toys!) we got it hooked up. He really liked playing with the video effects, but when we put the music on he was very disappointed. I don't know what other children listen to, but my kids did not know any of the songs that came on the cartridge and the only one I knew was \\"Who Let the Dogs Out\\" Where are all the classic kids songs like \\"Twinkle, Twinkle\\" and \\"Old MacDonald\\"? I tried to find other cartridges with familar songs on them, but they all seem to have Pop sogs on them that my kids just don't listen to. I like the idea of the toy, but I would rather see it come with songs that are appropriate for preschoolers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay away from this - very disappointing!!!","review":"Bought this gadget for my 4 year-old daugther for her birthday. She loves to sing and perform. She was completely bored and disappointed with this thing in just a few minutes. First of all this product requires a total 0f 9 batteries to operate (6 for the base and 3 for the microphone. There is no option to run this with a power adapter, thus is a huge money-drain when you have to constantly buy batteries. Secondly, the microphone is such cheap quality that it was hardly audible. The only way you actually hear the sound is if you completely stick it to your lips and even so, the sound quality is awful. Thirdly, the video quality is very poor. Image is blured and faded for the most part, even on the nicest TV set. Fourthly, it only comes with one music cartridge with only 4 songs in it. You have to spend about $10 more per cartridge and they only have 8 songs.I strongly advise that you don't waste your time or money on this product!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Santa delivered this toy, and we were very excited about using it. Like most kids, my two daughters (5yrs and 2yrs) like to sing and watch themselves on TV. After hooking this toy up to our TV, we tried and tried to get a picture that was clear enough to see the 'Stars', but we were not successful. When we finally accepted that we were just going to live with the poor picture quality because the girls really enjoyed the toy, the picture fades to black, then turns itself off - while in use. After turning it back on again, the same thing happened after about 5 minutes of play. We finally returned the item for a refund.DON'T WASTE YOUR MONEY, OR YOUR TIME, ON THIS TOY!"},{"rating":"1","title":"what a let down","review":"Great idea needs a lot of improvement.Poor picture.

Terrible toy.","review":"Bought this for my 3 year old - who loves to entertain w. singing and dancing. He was not at all interested. Really disappointed.

Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible disappointment","review":"I thought this would be a great gift to buy my 4 year old. It takes 6 C batteries in the base and they drain faster than you can unscrew the battery cover.

I agree with other reviews, by a kids bop cd and video tape your child. Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was fisher price thinking?","review":"We recieved the star station as a gift for christmas from grandma. As soon as we plugged it in, my kids gave me this look like \\"what the.........?\\" The sound quality totally sucks. The picture was blurry. We couldn't get the color change screen to stay on. The cartridges had to be pushed very far down even to get them to work. What is my overall review? This toy deserves 0 stars actually. Use a home video camera and put on your kids fav music. They will enjoy seeing themselves on TV much more. We ended up taking this peice of ***it back to the store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing toy","review":"My husband and I have a house full of fisher price toys. Usually the quality is excellant. Not so in this toy. The picture quality was so so. The microphone did not work on ours. The only way our sons voice could be heard was if the mic was practically in his mouth. The songs are not songs that our 4 1/2 year old is familiar with. You would think a preschool toy would have songs the kids could sing to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Star Station Needs A LOT of Improvements","review":"I was very disappointed with the Star Station in many ways. I'll start with the good - it is neat that the kids can see themselves on TV and that there is a wireless mic. My daughter was impressed with this ... Buying batteries was ridiculous, though. It is cool that you can make the kids' image different on the screen, too. However. why would a karaoke set not have the words to the songs, and why are these songs that kids don't know? I am going to find the lyrics to the songs that are on the two cartridges we have online, but this just isn't what we thought it would be. It would be much better if the words to the songs came on the screen so parents can sing along, too. This is an overall waste of money, and a tradtional karaoke set would be much better. I would consider this a glorified CD player with only a select group of cartridges people can buy. And, only 8 songs per cartridge?? Don't waste your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I purchased this for my 3 year old son because he LOVES to sing and dance--after we hooked it up and got all of the batteries required for it, the microphone doesn't work. Yes, it is what it is but I really expected alot more from this product! I agree with other reviews that a cd player, camcorder and a spoon would be sufficient!!

I could not get a picture on any of the television sets. When I did get the camera to work, you could barely see anything, it was so dark. We had proper lighting. I thought maybe it was broken and that was why it was returned to the store. Now, after reading the reviews & from talking to another friend who also returned hers, I realize it is just a piece of crap.

They love singing and dancing around the house so we thought they'd love being on tv. Too bad the picture quality was awful. Not to mention that you have to put the station up on boxes or another item to get it close to the same height as the tv just to make it look somewhat normal. The mic stinks too. You can't hear the kids over the music. We took it back this morning. The kids will have more fun with a video camera and a cd player. Don't waste your money!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Great idea, but has a lot of kinks to work out..","review":"My 7 year old got this as a present from Santa. Santa thought she'd love it because she's always looking at her reflection in anything and everything that shows it. It took us a while to get it working, we plugged it into the tv but we couldn't get it to play anything for a little bit. The video part came in very clear for us and my daughter was loving seeing herself on tv. The music was way too low and like everyone else says, she didn't know any of the songs. Our biggest problem was the feedback that we kept getting from the microphone. It's not worth the money, but it is a great idea. We told our daughter that it must have been broken during all the bumps in Santa's sleigh. We returned it today and she picked out a better toy that she hasn't but down once since she's gotten it home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Think twice before you buy","review":"My daughter had to have this toy. The picture quality is nothing like what is shown on TV or on the Fisher Price web site. You can barely see the picture on the screen. The extra cartridges are really a rip off. You would be better off using your own video camera and Kareoke machine and CD's. Unfortunately Santa brought this so of course we have to keep it. Which we are doing after we had to exchange it 2 times on the day after Christmas because the microphones weren't working. Think twice before buying this item or save your receipt so you can return it after you realize it doesn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money!","review":"My husband and I bought this for our 3 year old. First of all, the picture quality is awful! We read alot of the reviews before we bought this product, but we said, it can't be all that bad! Well we were wrong! Also 3 year olds don't really know any of these songs. Maybe if it had twinkle twinkle or old mac, or more children's songs, it would be more entertaining for toddlers.

Not at all the happy faces at play at our daughters 4th birthday party."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too much trouble for the price.","review":"My 3 year old son saw this displayed at the store and loved it. We thought it would be the perfect gift for his 3rd birthday but we were sadly mistaken.We put in the batteries in the main camera, and the batteries in the microphone(all brand new). By the next day the batteries were dead on the microphone and we only turned it on once. The main camera system was half used up and we only turned it on once.Hook up: We found that you need a tv with the hookups in the front for easy hookup. If you only have a choice of one video and not all the extras like video one, two etc and you have a dvd player you will need to unhook the dvd player to get the system to work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I bought this after viewing the display at Walmart. The picture quality was no where near what came home in the box. That alone bums me out.The cartridge that comes free with your purchase is for older kids. My 4 and 6 y/o were clueless when it came to the songs. Come on Fisher Price!We tried again today - our first since Christmas. I think it would help if the set came with songs that kids were familiar with. I ordered a more kid friendly cassette today and hope that will change things. My son loves music and this is a great idea. Just needs some help!I would not buy again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Waste of Money!","review":"My daughter wanted this for Christmas, so I searched and searched for one. I wish I had not wasted the time or money! The commercials for this make it seem so enjoyable, but my daughter played with it for 10 minutes and then pushed it aside. The picture quality is horrible, the songs are all muffled, the mic has to be right at their mouths, and the songs on the cartridges are for 30 year olds, not 4-7 year olds. I bought 2 extra cartridges and those both stink too. Don't waste your money on this big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Songs Are NOT Age Appropriate!","review":"My 4 year daughter loves to sing! She can't stop. So when she saw this on T.V., it's all she could talk about. She received one for Christmas, and was so excited. After turning it on, the only song she had heard before was 'who let the dogs out'. That's the only song I've heard that had any pep for a 4 year old. The camera part does work well as do the different camera effects. You do have to hold the microphone on your lips for it to work. We did get an extra cartridge and don't like any of those songs either. They really need songs for the age group that this toy is aimed for. If the box hadn't gone out in the trash before I could get all the batteries the unit needs (6 C size and 3 AAA), it would have gone back to the store. I'm very disappointed in this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fisher Price needs to read these reviews and go back to the drawing board!","review":"Just bought this today at Toysr'us.

The picture is grainy...not completely horrible but I could get better with my camcorder. My biggest complaint is the batteries.....it should come with an adapter. Also, the music cartridges don't have appropriate music for a three year old..they need more toddler-type music available instead of songs from the radio etc. This toy could be so much better...I hope they get the message from all of the returns and make some improvements!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"This item may have been more enjoyable for my 2 year old if it had songs he knows like twinkle twinkle or old mcDonald. He new none of the songs, and the picture quality was terrible. We returned this item to the store. It is not worth the money. It is a shame too because we bought it after our son got such a kick out of seeing himself in a video camera monitor at the store. Maybe Fisher Price will try this again with better quality picture and songs more for a toddler."},{"rating":"1","title":"WHAT A WASTE OF MY MONEY!!!","review":"I bought this product for my 4 yr old daughter for Christmas 2006. I was so excited for her because she really loves to see herself on camera. Every time we go to the grocery store, we have to walk in front of the camera three or four time so she can see us on the monitor. I would've been better off just taking her to the grocery store more often. The visual quality of this item is extremely poor. The television commercial portrays this crystal clear visual that the actual product doesn't come anywhere close to, not to mention the fact that my daughter, didn't know half the songs on the cartridges. I had to keep adjusting the screen to try and get a good picture, but I never really did. It's a year later, Christmas is a month away, and this \\"Piece of Crap\\" toy looks just as Unused as the day I took it out of the box. I wasted my money, but hopefully, you'll save yours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Star Station Not \\"A Star\\"","review":"I was excited about this toy when I saw the video on the web site. We bought one for our daughter and one for my nephews. I have never been more disappointed with a Fisher Price toy. This is terrible. The picture quality is bad. You can hardly hear a child's voice in the microphone. The background music in the actual Star Station is not very loud either. The music on the cartridges is not for the preschool set (the recommended age for the toy). My daughter has only heard a couple of the songs and doesn't know the words well enough for those two songs to even sing along. If I could give this toy negative stars I would. I'd return it too if my husband hadn't already thrown out the box."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"My 2 1/2 year old son got this from grandma for Christmas. The picture quality was extremely poor and distorted. Had good overhead lighting as the instructions suggest, but no dice. I am returning this promptly!! Thumbs down to Fisher-price."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Disappointment","review":"I was really excited for my kids to open this for Christmas and get a chance to play with it. However we were very disappointed when we actually plugged it in. First of all it was difficult to get the cartridges in far enough for them to play and worst of all you could not see the kids clearly on the tv...even when we added extra light (which is really inconvenient for everyday) we still could not see them clearly. The image on the box does not accuratly portray the clarity and brightness that you will get on your tv. I returned this to the store right away. What a waste..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wanted: Dead or Undead","review":"There seems to be some confusion concerning the merits of this film, but love it or hate it (& consensus seems to be on the side of the former), 'NetherBeast Incorporated' has a life of its own.I bought the DVD for two reasons; one, I am a lukewarm fan of the genre (this is a genre? you say...), & two, my cousin is in it. To say I was pleasantly surprised, cousin or no cousin, is an understatement. I really didn't know what I was getting into, but in fact, I was hooked immediately & watched with growing fascination as the thing unfolded.The inspired insertion of President Garfield & Alexander Graham Bell as pivots, & the kind of Bill-&-Ted-Do-Phoenix aspect thereby engendered, had me laughing out loud. The DVD presentation is further enhanced by the Commentary Version in the Special Features section. A good time was had by all, apparently, & I recommend 'NetherBeast' wholeheartedly."},{"rating":"1","title":"You will groan like a netherbeast","review":"This film has a good premise and the opening scene is laugh out loud funny, but it gets steadily worse after that. Many of the jokes fall so flat that I actually felt embarrassed for the actors trying to pull them off. About 1/5 of the film is composed of expository first person narrative asides set to elevator music, and much of the actual dialogue feels like filler--dull, jokey conversations that do nothing to advance the story or tell us anything about far too many underdeveloped, gimmicky characters. I can forgive an indie movie for bad production and sometimes even bad acting, but this script should probably never have been made into a movie in the first place."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is going on your permanent record!","review":"Could you ask for a funnier movie? Killer cast, great gags... Definetly more in the \\"comedy\\" genre than the \\"horror comedy\\" genre, nothing in here is really going to scare you, but if you're looking for a great laugh, look no further!Great production value for an indie flik, well written, well acted, the only problem with it is some of the timing, laugh moments come so quick and often, I had to rewind it a couple times cause my friends were still laughing when the next bit came at them!If you have a sense of humor, and are looking for a bit of a different take, please take the time to add this to your cart, you won't regret it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"avoid this move","review":"i wrote a long review but somehow i lost it.'netherbeast inc.'- it's on the level of a poorly made tv comedy [that really doesn't make you laugh.vampires hide in a corperation. they've been doing it for so long that they bicker. the ceo vampire has a brain disease like alzheimers. he hires an outside consultant [industrial psychologest or sociologist] to bring back morale. now who's killing fellow vampire employees, why kill them, and is this all just to take over the ceo's position??? can a vampire and mortal fall in love??? the real answer, based on this movie, will be: 'who cares. give me my money back!'david foley [whom i really like, deserves better roles] is as two dimentional as the other charactors.i see that there do exist 7 people that think this is an 'okay' movie. good for them, at least somebody made a movie they could enjoy. you're probably not one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"terrible!","review":"didn't get past 15 minutes... maybe it improved but i have to say there wasn't much they could build on. one of the worst movies i've ever seen..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely gift to yourself and others","review":"Wonderful things come in small boxes and packages.

I guess I was looking for some ground pounding Primus like material. Instead I get some goofy guys dressing up like some DEVO rejects putting out crappy music. The video looks like it was shot by a third grader and the sound is like some second grader recorded it on a walkman tape player. I am sorry I spent the money on this. Les, you got me on this one. I really dont know what happened to you, but please re-visit the Primus albums, and take a listen. The only saving grace is the bass playing is still good in most parts. Les, you really \\"jumped the shark\\" on this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"4.5 stars really, great dvd for claypool fans","review":"this dvd is honestly one of the best i own, the jamming on all the frog brigade live tracks are out of controll, so much energy and the version of Buzzards of Greenhill off the jam cruise is the absolute greatest thing ive ever herd, i dont remember the guys name, but a special guest comes out and RIPS on the guitar for this song, honestly the biggest highlight of the entire dvd, i had to watch it again to let it set in for me, its honestly and overwhealming amount of great jamming on this dvd, the only disapointment for this dvd, is the lack of Oysterhead tracks, i love Oysterhead and i was pretty bummed out to see the only track of theirs on here is Shadow of a Man, a great song, but a little too eerie and slow for this dvd i think, all in all its a spectacular dvd, and worth the buy"},{"rating":"2","title":"a must have for the Les fan","review":"this dvd is for Les Claypool/Primus/Oysterhead/Frog Brigade/...well, you get the idea..there's behind the scenes footage, live performances, a video here and there and taggin' along with Les fly fishing..who could ask for anything more? so, if you're not a fan, don't bother..if you're on the fence, borrow it from a fan and return undamaged once you're done..but if you're a fan, i highly suggest you buy this for yourself if you haven't already..trust me..Les would be proud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Showcases Les Claypools ART","review":"Les claypool truley is a music ARTIST. This DVD showcases multiple bands of his with varied styles, but with the same Claypool flavor. He uses unusual music elements (Home made instruments, strange keys and time signatures) that are not common place in pop music. The song \\"Shadow of a Man\\" is particularly great, combining ambient sounds and spooky atmosphere with meaningful lyrics about vietnam.This DVD is not Primus heavy (which is a nice change) and does a good job at showing Claypool's other musical offerings but do not expect alot of Primus music."},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't compare with better crafted \\"B\\" Westerns.","review":"A staggeringly corny work made with a miniscule budget, this is one of four westerns produced by deservedly little-known Yucca Pictures, and features glyphic Sunset Carson playing himself in his customary fashion, i.e., a discomposed delivery of dialogue when not sitting atop a horse - which he does with surety - the plot presenting Al Terry as Bob Ward (listed as Wade in the titular credits) seeking to avenge the murder of his father, apparently the work of the eponymous hero. Filmed in colour, uncommon for the period and genre, the movie is cumbered by pitiable production values, as well as possibly the most embarrassingly poor stunt work to be found in a professional effort, yet includes in its cast some capable character actors, including a winsome Pat Starling whose clear soprano graces a duet with Terry, and a viewer must be glad indeed that several musical novelty numbers are presented featuring gifted fiddler Buddy McDowell."},{"rating":"1","title":"trackless chapters and the voice ruined it","review":"First of all, the audio recording does not track with the chapters of the book. Pretty hard to read with a group and impossible to go back pick up where you left off.Dan Cashman, \\"the voice\\" of audio book, just about KILLED all of the jokes in the book. I had to turn up my volume to almost max to hear \\"the voice\\" in my car. Save your money and get the paperback! Or better yet just rent it on amazon.com"},{"rating":"2","title":"Testiment to God's Love","review":"A friend recommended this book. It is a smooth read. I was left with a conviction of God's love for us that was conveyed so sincerely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Abba's Child","review":"Brennan Manning has a wonderful way of expressing himself which draws the reader deeper and deeper into the book. This is a book that is packed full of spiritual insight and nuggets of wisdom. This is the first of Manning's books I've read, but it is touching me so deeply that I will be reading more. If you have ever struggled with feelings of inferiority, or wonder about your purpose in life, this is the book for you. The title of the book says it all: I am a child of God, loved and beloved. This book is a reminder that I am special, God loves me, and I can be confident of that!"},{"rating":"2","title":"we are children of God...most precious in His sight","review":"How silly we humans are. We are loved beyond comprehension. Still, we try to put on painful masks to hide from our lover. What nonsense! What idiocy. I have been trying to be something I am not almost every second of my life. Yet now I see that my value is not in what I pretend to be...or what I think people want me to be. No...my value is in a love that I never asked for--in a lover I never sought--in a God who calls me to recognize my \\"impostor\\" and leave it in order to enter into His love. I thank Brennan Manning for writing a book that forces me to hear my Lover's voice clearly and honestly. I hope that if you read this, you'll get a copy for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This is the first book of Manning's that I have read, and I am stocking up on many more! This amazing book illuminated so many hazy thoughts and feelings that I have never been able to put words to and helped me deal with a lot of issues. The sense of relief and comfort I have recently found in God is largely due to this book. I highly recommend it to anyone who is struggling with any kind of identity issue, or anyone who just wants to get closer to his/her true Father."},{"rating":"2","title":"Once Again, Brennan Manning delivers!","review":"I have to admit that I was skeptical in beginning this book. Could this really measure up to 'Ragamuffin Gospel'? Or would I be left disappointed? Surprisingly, I was not at all disappointed. In fact, I would even go as far as to say this book surpasses \\"Ragamuffin Gospel!\\" Manning beautifully describes the intense and fierce love of Jesus for us, and states the necessity of teaching the Church today this truth. I recommend, like Manning, to read this book slowly, meditatively, and prayerfully."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's all about the Audio","review":"This is read by one of the most boring narrators I've ever heard. Manning writes with passion and conviction. The narrator makes it sound like we're walking through the park on a sunny day in some sort of dream world. I'd fall asleep before I would understand that I'm \\"Abba's Child\\" in this audiobook version. Buy the paperback, it's worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought provoking","review":"Dig deep. Challenges deeply held perceptions and behavior that can be contradictory to spiritual growth. I took it in small bits to absorb and sift through my inner life. Highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow...","review":"Brennan Manning is a gentle but no nonsense writer. One needs not be an impostor to protect their true self any longer when they grasp Jesus Christ's love for them. YUM!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Abba's Child","review":"This is a very insightful read, And is much more than just a quick read. I will probably have to read it several time's as of right now I have it loaned out to friends whom are also reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"One of my favorite books. I read it every year and have given many as gifts. If you are a serious follower of Christ, read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful book!","review":"If you want to experience the love of God and peek into how that's worked out in your life, you will find this a good read."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book will change your life if you let it","review":"It's hard for me to describe this book; it's been instrumental in my own personal growth. Suffice to say, Manning has nailed the single-most pervasive problem in today's church: the utter lack of self-worth in the presence of a perfect God.Manning showed me that there the idea that I can somehow be good enough, or smart enough, or holy enough to justify God's love is at best, a fantasy. The truth is, God loves us utterly and completely, and there's nothing we can do to change that.I would recommend this book for anyone who seeks a genuine relationship with God."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad News","review":"I started reading the 1st chapter and did not finish it. He quotes a mystic and then 3 or 4 pages later he talks about a spirt guide. This is not the true gospel of Jesus Christ!!!The first chapter has to do with a type of meditation that scientology uses.Do not be decieved!!!Jesus loves you and you can accept Christ as your savior right now. The steps to eternal life are for you.1. Tell God that you are a sinner and that you cannot earn eternal life.2. Tell God that you believe Jesus Christ is the Son of God and that He died on the cross for you.3. Ask Jesus to forgive you of your sins and to live in your heart through His Holy Spirit.4. Commit your life to love and serve Him.5. Thank Him for you new salvation.A bible study I have found to be very helpful is called, \\"Beth Moore, Breaking Free\\" It's wonderful how she brings the brokeness of self with the Word of God.It truly is a acurate bible study of the truth of God's Word. I went through the study myself and found it to be very helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Well intentioned but disappointing","review":"I had high hopes for this work, based on the reputation of the publishing house and the importance of the subject. Alas, what I found was Christianized pop psychology, with facile references to \\"the imposter,\\" \\"the inner Pharisee,\\" and, believe it or not, \\"the inner child.\\" There was virtually nothing said about the great biblical themes of adoption and our relation to Christ, the firstborn of many, with whom we are heirs and co-heirs of the kingdom. In fact, there was a more-than-subtle anti-intellectualism evident and a distinct distaste for theology displayed. The one thing that saved a star for this book was Mr. Manning's treatise on the Apostle John--if only the whole book had lived up to the content of this chapter. A wasted opportunity to speak to a vital aspect of Christian life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brennan Manning preaches a false gospel - don't be fooled.","review":"Fr. Brennan Manning is a Franciscan priest who attempted to marry without being dispensed from his vow of celibacy in 1982. He has since peddled a false gospel that is built around the idea that God's pardon is unconditional - a euphemism for saying that you can be forgiven for your sins without repenting and amending your life. This is a lie, and a defense mechanism Fr. Manning has evolved to assuage his guilty conscience. If you really want to seek the Mercy of God, I suggest you read \\"Divine Mercy in my soul\\", the diary of St. Faustina, avaulable here on Amazon.com. God's Mercy is endless, but you cannot be pardoned if you are not sorry; Fr. Manning's false gospel will do you no more spiritual good than it has done him. He needs your prayers and your pity - not your money or your reading time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointment","review":"An oversimplified and unrealistic treatise on how to gain intimacy with God. I have not read any of Manning;s previous works and am not planning to having read Abba's child. The main premise of the book is in seeking solitude in order to gain intimacy with God. Manning himself escaped to a cabin in Colorado with nothing but the Bible. I, unfortunately, am not a bestselling author and cannot drop out of life so easily to contemplate the Word. A disappointment that fails to rise above other unoriginal mass market Christian self help."},{"rating":"1","title":"utter crap","review":"God is about relationships and fruits of the spirit, He is not about abandoning everyone and everything to find Him. This dude is so contradictory, depressing, negative, angry etc. I just don't see how anyone can read his stuff and not vomit. If you're depressed and need to feel worse, dive right into his stuff, if you are a Christian trying to learn more about God, yourself, and the world around you in a positive, enlightening, Godly way then skip this waste of trees and find something else to read or do."},{"rating":"2","title":"Learning more about what it means to be Abba's child","review":"As I am slowly making my way through this book I am being challenged and strengthened in my faith. The beauty of my privileged relationship as a beloved child of Abba is being reinforced page after page. I find Manning's way with the written word is intelligent and thought-provoking. It is like being in a graduate level class discussion in which you are being discipled rather than \\"talked down to\\". Very powerful. Well-worth reading and recommending to others who wish to better understand how much our Abba loves us, even when we aren't perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read","review":"If you ever wondered why you behave or react to things the way you do this is a excellent book to help you understand why and how you got that way.

Only Tasha and Eric know why things are so easy for her. But something is about to happen that isn't so easy. Mysterious freak accidents begin to happen to Amy, almost causing her to die. Then some scary things begin to happen to the other kids. This definitely is not a safe place. Will Amy be able to survive a place that once seemed so much fun?This is the first special edition in the series. To be honest, I don't think it really is that special. Sure, there's much more pages than a normal Replica book, but it's quality, not quantity. However, I really did like the novel. We get to learn more about Amy's past, and Amy meets someone who may not be as nice as he seems. This is a book you should check out, and definitely a must-read for Replica fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"And The Two Shall Meet (Replica #6)","review":"I never knew there were boy clones to come in this series and I never expected it. Reading it, I thought that Brooke was being mean to Tasha by telling Amy that she could be with Andy and Tasha could be with Willard.I thought Eric was also being mean to his girlfriend because he wouldn't listen to her when she wanted to tell him about Andy. It wasn't really nice from Miss Perfect to kiss Andy, though.I really enjoyed reading this book and I am looking foward to reading the next ones that are not out yet where I live.This book was really good.

The only reason I didn't rate it as a 5 star is that when you have boxes stacked up to the top handle, there isn't any way to hold onto it without having your hand stuck between the handle and the boxes. Sort of annoying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for relativly light loads, does not stand up to daily use that well.","review":"The main problem about these hand trucks that will keep me from buying them again is that the plastic molding that locks the wheels in place after you unfold them wears out and tends to fight you when you try to lock them in place. It also leads to the point that if you were to pull instead of push (like when you have to turn around) the wheels fold in and collapse the hand truck. We haven't exceeded the weight limits on these so that is not what caused the problem. I run a computer support department and we frequently have used the six lift trucks that I ordered. The other noticeable thing is that on two of the units the telescoping rod support on the back broke loose. We weren't even that hard on them. After almost two years we have two left. I will be trying another hopefully more durable brand. They might be better for light work though."},{"rating":"1","title":"Swats you in the face when you load it","review":"Hazardous design - swats you in the face when you load it.When the hand truck is opened up, it rests on the wheels and the back of the toe plate. The front lip of the toe plate is about 1/2\\" off the floor.When you lean over to place something on it, the entire hand truck snaps forward. The handle (only part of which is padded) strikes you in the face. If the item is heavy, this happens with a lot of force. I can tell you that it really hurts. The injury could be quite serious if one is wearing glasses.The cause is that, unlike most hand trucks, this truck has the wheels positioned about 1/2\\" off the floor when the toe plate is flat on the floor. You can see that in the product photo.The Safco 4061 \\"HideAway Collapsible Hand Truck\\" does not have this problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective wheel lead to deterioration in function","review":"I've had a similar one of these before, from a different company, but this one kinda sucked. It worked OK for about a week or two. Then it started to feel like the wheels were always dragging, even though they were clear of all debris. I've figured out that it doesn't seem to click into the open position all the way for some reason. So, unless I have something heavy on it, the wheels start to collapse. And even when I do have a load, the wheels cause a big drag. Really frustrating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hello Dolly","review":"This medium weight aluminum dolly fits the bill when you need something less substantial than the warehouse dolly you've stored in the garage.

The video editing switches from multiple camera angles at a rate of about 1 camera every 2 seconds. You never get to see anyone in the band \\"jam\\" out. I think the editor wanted to avoid being boring by just showing the stage from one camera, but the result is the opposite extreme.It pretty much ruined a perfect DVD for me.

It is laugh aloud funny and I was sad when it ended. It is cleverly crafted and the tension created at the beginning is brilliantly sustained and brought to a rewarding conclusion. The author engages you in an intimate and hilarious experience of contemporary student life and describes friendship and communal living with affection and humour. He captures the charm of youthful idealism and its poignant fading as the hard realities of life press down to crush it. I thoroughly recommend it to anyone who wants to indulge in a delightful revisiting of their student days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pretentious and tedious","review":"This is one of those tedious self-published books that, fortunately, will never reach an audience much beyond the author's close friends and acquaintances.It isn't any good. It's too long and it's over-written. It reads like Kraft's Amazon review of his own book (posted here at the time I write this): confusing, pointless, and not at all funny. There is throughout a sort of painful striving after humor that drives the reader to a lot of cringing. There is also throughout a great deal of pointless obfuscatory language, which was perhaps meant to substitute for plot.

So...my 0 star rating applies to just those two tracks. It sounds like when yer playing guitar hero and you aren't playing well and the crowd starts booing. Godzilla is played way too slow: the guitarist is clearly playing some other song and we're pretty sure the drummer was trying to scare off a roving cat or possum. The singer has 2 minutes of pointless banter at the beginning of the track and throughout this crunchy jam session is totally tripping out on his own voice effects. \\"Don't fear the reaper\\" doesn't even sound like they're playing it...I think the other review was right...I think that IS Steve Winwood playing an organ while the drummer chases the cat off his kit and the guitar player plays way too fast.

Bad live recordings at that. Classic guitar riffs replaced by an organ as if Steve Winwood joined the band. I was pissed to say the least. Once I heard then examined it I remembered buying this same exact album on cassette when I was 12 and feeling duped then. Completely forgot about that incident until it happened again.

This one is a bit safer around the kids and has non-toxic materials.I found the spray spout very effective and it covered a decent area. The family also enjoys the \\"almond\\" scent of this product much more than other products we've used in the past. This product is very good at removing smudges, as well as dirt and grime (we have small children, so we get more than our fair share of sticky gooey stuff smeared on the table).We've actually found that the product works so well, that we can dilute the bottle with water (about 1/3 to 1/2 of the bottle) and still have the same results. This has helped us extend the use of one bottle quite a bit.Another great reliable product from Method."},{"rating":"2","title":"Savor Some Almondy Goodness..and clean too!","review":"Love the fragrant almond aroma I get from using this product. We use the entire Method cleaning system in our home for cleaning because we have five small children, and it makes me feel safer knowing that Method products contain very low toxicity.The Wood For Good product is very effective on wood. A word of caution, though. This is a wood cleaner and not a polish. If you are looking for something to shine or wax your wood, then you might want to find another product. This does a really good job at cleaning surface dust and dirt and a minimal layer of protection for wood, but leaves the surface relatively dull or unpolished after cleaning."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Afternoon Read","review":"This is a short book about two people seeking solitude who get thrown together in a remote cabin and try to make the best of the situation.

It will print one page of a print job, then spit out four or five blank sheets before printing another page.HP still does not have Mac OS drivers for it, so if I want to use the photo paper drawer I have to print from a CF card. After several attempts with HP customer service, they basically told me they didn't want to and couldn't help since I am a Mac user and it works fine with PCs.As I have said already, I have had several HP printers in the past and have always been impressed, but this is most certainly my last HP."},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T GET THIS EVEN FOR FREE","review":"I had this printer for past 9 months.

There is no way to clean the tubes internally.Therefore, unfortunately, as good a job as it does while alive, it is absolutely not recommendable. HP should recall them all and replace them for free even after warranty expired. It is a substandard design to me and should not have hit the market in the first place.

I got someone in India that i could not understand for the life of me. She took about 15 minutes to take down the serial #,Phone # etc. She lost the info a few times and had to retype.

It seems it was recorded in a a garage. The singer, Pit Passarell, is a joke when singing live. The drums are annoying, the set list is disconnected, the guitar are uninspired.

It lacks the originality of his 1st solo album Street Talk. Without his Journey bandmates to pull him out of long painful ballads, this album is dreadful. There are a few standouts like You Better Wait which has a catchy hook. Most of the others did not match the rocking magic of Journey.

I live in an area with very hard water, and have to clean it much more often than once a month. The manual is not clear on how to clean all the parts, and I also had a problem with mold getting into areas that are not accessible to clean. The company told me to put vinegar into the water in the base, and run it through the machine while on, that didn't help either.

Also I've noticed that if you don't have all the numbers in front of you, you can't play the game successfully either because it frequently asks for numbers that are already in the jar.It seems that the jar is of dubious use as a learning tool as well. If the cookies are too difficult to put in the jar, it won't count them. It also frequently misreads the cookies and then tells you that your correct answer is incorrect.

Maybe Amazon should allow those of us who bought parts 1 and 2 from them to exchange them for the 3 disc set. It would be good business practice IMHO. Hopefully Capital will hear our plea and offer disc 3 on its own.Coming back to this review in 2006, one year after I wrote the 1st part of this review, Disc 3 is now available on its own, so I will now say that this set deserves 4 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous Lounge Music","review":"the songs on this CD take you to a different time and space.

A great value."},{"rating":"2","title":"does not like to be dropped","review":"My son loved this toy. But he's dropped it from the height of his one-year old arms, and the drum function no longer works. It only plays notes when rolled on its side. He's dropped many electronic toys, most of which have not broken. It was easy to open, but neither my husband nor I could see an identifiable source for the problem.

One of several albums Perry has done with the Mad Professor, the tracks are hypnotic and spacy compterized dub masterpieces with the Mighty Upsetter ranting and raving in incredible torrents of pscho-babble poetry. Altough the sound is much more sleak and clean compared to Perry's Black Ark days, his collaborations with the Mad Professor are every bit as ingenious as when he was performing miracles with simple analog gear.

This would dull the blades. This new larger mat covers the entire table and it is self healing, so I expect to be using it for some time.

When tis was recorded, Spector was at his absolute peak of over-indulgence--his only other works that were as bad as this were John Lennons \\"Rock and Roll\\" and Dion's \\"Born to Be With You\\" (so bad it didnt even get a US release. His wall of sound consisted of about 100 musicians playing loud and for the most part out of tune.This recording with Cohen should never have been released--if it had remained unreleased, or come out as a bootleg it might have gained some \\"BeachBoys-Smile\\" ledgend, but it is awful.Truly awful.

It's one I listen to again & again. Yes, it's a different sound for Leonard but all the songs are decent (sans Fingerprints--actually, its just the corny chorus that I don't like). Don't buy it if this is your first foray into Cohen. Go with something safe like \\"The Future\\" instead, then progress backwards into \\"New Skin for Old\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why do people hate this album?","review":"I love Leonard Cohen's stark poetry. I love Phil Spector's overheated orchestral fantasias. Many negative reviews of this album lay blame for its \\"failure\\" at Spector's feet. True, the combination of Leonard's words and Spector's music may be unusual and even disconcerting, but for me the end result is a ragged, absurd glory. A fantastic, underrated piece of work. Don't listen to it with any preconceptions and you may appreciate it."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is the one to avoid","review":"I consider myself a Leonard Cohen fan. Still, I heard this album only twice in my life. The first time, as soon as I bought it, full of excitement... The second time, about four years later, only to realize it sounds just as bad as the first time...To me, it was a total dissapointment. Leonard Cohen's voice is squashed under Phil Spector \\"wall of sound\\" and both sound dull, uninspired and incompatible. The subtle eroticism of Leonard Cohen's lyrics gives way to gratuitous raunchiness.And the few fine moments (which there are, I must admit) are not strong enough to justify spending your money on this album.Rush to get all of his catalog but, please, pass this one by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spector's Folly","review":"Yes, yes. I understand that there is a certain sort of reviewer mentality that likes to defend horrific material so as to appear off-beat, hip, and exceptionally insightful. Regard the raves for Lou Reed's Metal Machine Music, for example. But there IS a reason why Cohen himself disownes \\"Ladies Man\\", and considered taking the master tape from deranged producer Phil Spector at gunpoint. Spector's orchestral, muzak excess, as bad and inappropriate as it has ever been, combined with a mix of Cohen's vocals that make him sound like a fly trapped in a salt shaker, remove any charm that the lovely lyrics might provide. Better to just read them in one of Cohen's poetry collections.Is any of this junk salvageable? \\"I Left a Woman Waiting\\" (just barely) and attempted single \\"Iodine\\" have a glimmer. A very, very bad place for new Cohen listeners to begin.Trust me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not among his best","review":"This is, without a doubt, Cohen's most atypical album - especially from the perspective of production. His other album all have a timeless sound. This one, however, smacks of lush overproduction typical of the late '70's. It's almost as if someone (the producer, Phil Spector?) was trying to bring Cohen into the pop mainstrain.The lyrics and songwriting are excellent (as is anything written by Leonard Cohen). Cohen would please his fans very much if he re-recorded these songs in his normal style.If you're considering this as your first Leonard Cohen music purchase, please reconsider. Any of his other albums is a better choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"This deserves a \\"0\\" not even a \\"1\\" or how about a \\"Y\\" for YUCK","review":"A huge Leonard Cohen Fan I am..what moved me to purchase this CD?

This may be the only Leonard Cohen album that I couldn't bear listening to for a third time and it ended up in my 'give away' box on the first day that I owned it. The album should have been called 'oxymoron' because the lyrics do not go with the music. All this boppy, unemotional, horny (in the musical sense) stuff doesn't suit our beloved Leonard.Thankfully, Cohen seems to have realized this very early and didn't make the same mistake again. Lucky this album didn't ruin his career though - your LC collection can do without this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"cohen meets spector","review":"This is one of the wierdest albums ever, and worth owning even if you can't decide whether to love it or hate it.For me it is certainly one of the oddest pairings in the history of popular music with cohen's darkly intellectual and sensual understatement meeting spector's affinity for huge and often vulgar production with unpredictable results - you just couldn't make it up- God knows what they were thinking. The album is patchy, but well worth the highlights. 'Don't go home with your hard-on' is probably the only cohen track you'd be ever be able to get people to dance to, while the tite track finishes life as a kind of stoned wigout with cohhen's vocals swamped under some of the mudiest production you'll hear this side of the 1950s, but somehow it all works in some strange way. Any decade other than the 1970s and it probably wouldn't have happenend- buy it just for the sheer unlikeliness of the whole thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lost in Specter's sea...","review":"Alas, even Cohen, perhaps eager to shed his folk-poet garb from his earlier (and far more interesting) albums, fell under the spell of Phil Specter's \\"midas touch\\" in the studio, although Specter rarely, if ever, was able to turn anything into gold.

Well, it is the same Phil Spector who botched up Paul McCartney's \\"Long and Winding Road\\" and John Lennon's \\"Across the Universe\\".

Having tried, on separate occasions, to sit through \\"Songs of Leonard Cohen\\", \\"Songs from a Room\\", \\"Songs of Love and Hate\\", and, later all of them consecutively, I had all but dismissed Cohen's work as overrated. Yes, I do recognize he writes well - but, as a musician, he just isn't compelling. Leonard Cohen's music gives you all of the catharsis of a root canal.Having enjoyed some of Phil Spector's productions a great deal, I decided I would give a chance to one last Leonard Cohen album. \\"Death of a Ladies Man\\" does have nice lyrics.

While it may seem a little dated in some of its references, I think it is still one of the best things ever written about the shadow side of being a helping professional. I continually recommend it to the grad psych students I supervise as an essential guide to being a psychotherapist.

Lesson learned, I ended up getting speakers with a headphone jack instead, and that has worked out very well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"When inserting the headphone jack completely, I only got sound out of the right side.

I intended to use it as an extension between my PC and my speakers. However the cable does not transmit any signal to the left speaker. When the speakers are plugged directly into the PC they work fine, but using this cord the left speaker does not play at all.If I jiggle the connection between the speakers and the cord, then sometimes the right speaker's signal will play in both speakers, but that's not good enough. I want true stereo sound, so I cannot use this cable.I suspect that I got a defective cable (as opposed to false advertising about the cable being stereo).

For years I've been thinking that most Americans lack common sense in the simplest things.

Best classified as pseudo history, it is a complete misinterpretation of christianity, the bible, religion, fraternal organizations and the occult, espousing a point of view that perhaps can only be understood if seen through the narrowest lens of fundamentalist christianity. A lack of honest scholarship that would be laughable, if only the views contained within were not so often wielded by the christian right.

You think you may be getting actual information and some inside information. What you get when you open the book is like scraps of newspaper stories pasted in. Almost 600 pages of it. What I get from the author is that almost any gesture of the hands is an insider secret message direct from either the Freemasons, the Illuminati, Satanists or some other secret group. I'm just curious where and how they teach these groups all of these hand signals. According to the book anyone from the cast of Seinfeld to Ben Stiller are Satanists. You can find much better paranoid delusions online."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Most Superficial and Uninformed Treatment of This Material Possible","review":"If you want to buy a book full of public figures making the peace sign and the \\"El Diablo\\" sign (or \\"I love you\\" depending on your interpretation), and then have that be the basis for calling each of them a Satanist, then go ahead and waste your money.If you are looking for a history of the use of hand-signs for communication, or the actual literal and symbolic meanings and disambiguation to the interpretations of these hand-signs, you will be every bit as disappointed as I was. The hand signs discussed and \\"interpreted\\" are done so through one lens and one paradigm only - through the eyes of a fundamentalist Christian who can only see a \\"sign of the Devil.\\" Very little history of such symbolism is given and when it is, it is distorted to fit the purely Fundamentalist Christian paradigm.There are far more informative ways to look at this data. This book does not explore any of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading and Poorly Researched","review":"This book is extremely misleading and poorly researched. I found a ridiculous number of glaring errors that could have been corrected with the slightest amount of actual research. It's also written with an extreme anti-semitic leaning.According to this book every person of note that has ever exchanged a handshake with another is a member of the terrifying ILLUMINATI! Every person that has ever crossed their arms or legs...ILLUMINATI! Every Jewish person or Qabalist...? You guessed it.Pictures of the Bush family doing the Texas A&M; \\"hook 'em horns\\" AT the Texas A&M; marching band is evidence of their Satan worship. Hellen Keller doing the sign language for \\"I love you\\" is seen as the same.Sensationalist and ludicrous trash for the lowest common denominator."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Read","review":"this book is very eye-opening and professional, considering the topics at hand. Not at all \\"conspiracy-theory\\" feeling, very well researched and documented. Hard to put down once you open it. If interested in what the people in power really are up to...then this would be the book for you. I'm sure theres a few instances where the info being presented may be misguided (although not purposely, im sure), but really how many coincidences do you need before you realize that its not just a coincidence?

This book is good, but it could have been better without the frist story of the Empress of Ireland. The thing that made this book really good was the last two storys of the dirigibles. Captain Noble set out on an adventure to the South Pole. But when caught in a storm somthing goes wrong. In the R-101 case the story was much diffrent. The engineers were rushing to met an up coming deadline. The voyage starts out ok but becomes a DISASTER!

It turns out that the Apple Cinema Displays accept ONLY digital signals. If the Dell (or any other computer) outputs ONLY a VGA signal (analog), there is absolutely NOTHING this adapter can do to convert the analog signal to a digital signal.Physically, it fits: it allows you to physically connect your DVI male plug of the cinema display to the VGA female receptacle of your computer, but nothing in the description even hints that simply physically connecting the 2 devices means it will work. It won't! What you need is a converter box to convert the analog signal to a digital signal (if you're connecting to a display like the digital-only Apple Cinema Display)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooked on Classics","review":"Hooked on Classics is a CD that I have been exercising with for many years.

Interesting weapon concepts but not well-developed... coupled with poor enemy AI, and less-than-helpful allies (who often step into your line of fire and get themselves killed) makes the experience unsatisfying.Occasional bugs and crass, off-color humor throughout detract from the fun.Overall: a few cheap laughs without a lot of replay value.

Originally recorded in 1967; (pre Tropical), Domingo \\"says\\" and \\"sounds\\" perfectly what a beginning to a lazy Bossa Nova Sunday should sound like. Pure, simple, innocent; almost naive in it's simplistic beauty. Now, on this Japanese import; it retains it's simplistic beauty, but the remastering is Simply a revelation. The instrumentation and arrangements which are \\"almost\\" absent on the original Verve cd mastering of the '67 recording are crystal and bring this magnificent recording to a brand new level. Stunning!P.S. I've never been moved to write a review for one of the 100s upon hundreds of cds I've purchased through Amazon (although many might have been worthy).

It never gets hooked up (unlike the one with the hanging glass bulbs in it, which gets hooked up on itself all the time, no matter how carefully you try to balance it, it doesn't work for long). This makes a great gift too. It said something about coating it if you want to keep it the shiny bright unweathered copper look, we didn't, so its less shiny and more weathered, but I still love the look."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very well made, Very Cool!","review":"I was going to hang in my back yard, but the spinner was so good looking, and made so well, that I had to show it off, and put it by the front door.

Clearly the author couldn't make up her mind. The beginning hinted of mystery and romance, the middle took the various aspects off on their own dead-end paths, the end just became a silly summation of misunderstandings and pathetic introspection. It was, however, ironic that the center of the plot was an American author writing insipid novels for masses of inept readers. I feel like I've been had in buying this book. If you must subject yourself - borrow it from the library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth your money, time or bookshelf space!","review":"If you love Italy, romance, mystery or good writing, you won't like this book.

Surely there are ghosts there, and eccentric families, which were the only 2 things about this book that gave it any need to be placed in Italy. I believe the author gave it that name in order to seduce people into buying it, thinking they would be reading a story that related to that fascinating country or that had some unusual plot or theme that would not be believable in another locale. This book was basically a story about a woman with no sense at all who spent her whole time in Italy, expenses paid, holed up in an uninteresting villa with a married man who virtually ignored her when they were not in the villa. Not much suspense, not much imagination, not much to recommend it. One star is one too many. Don't waste your time or believe any of the good press about this one. Valerie Martin should be ashamed."},{"rating":"1","title":"A mediocre red at best","review":"Italian Fever was pretty disappointing. I kept hoping it would get better, but it never really did.

Not worth your time, and really who would you want to pass it on to after you're done reading it? An uninteresting non-mystery competes with long descriptions of the heroine's flu symptoms.

This character clearly hadn't lived much, raised a child, lived through a famine, or experienced much suffering. Her main posture is one of feeling superior, but for no apparent reason. I was fed up with her in a hurry, and skimmed much of the book without losing anything significant. The best parts were observations about art and travelogue-like descriptions of scenes in Rome. The rest of it was the usual blather about love and lust, affairs with romantic Italians (how stereotyped and insulting!), and a \\"mystery\\" that amounted to a hill of beans. I advise looking at the beautiful Titian on the cover of the book and then quietly putting it back on the shelf. Want to read a book about affairs? Try Anna Karenina or how about Madame Bovary?"},{"rating":"1","title":"If no stars were an option, it would so be","review":"Terribly disappointing to find the author straying down one unconnected path after another without ever finding appropriate cohesion or unity. This was obviously done as a series of short stories, patched together by an inept editor. The long, overdone bout with gastroenteritis came from a writers' class exercise and had very little place in this book. The ending was tacked on as an afterthought by author and editor when they realized they had already gone too far to quit and needed some sort of conclusion, no matter how incongruous."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fascinating story about love and art","review":"I thoroughly enjoyed this book.

And even if Jimmy himself wasn't involved directly in the mastering, he was still there to make sure we get a quality product. As long as he's involved, we'll always get our money's worth.

For someone like me, they are almost like mythical gods, because I can only see them via video. I bought this dvd for both my mom, and my aunt and uncle (who were all at the Zeppelin riot show in '77 at Tampa Stadium). While Plant's voice unfortunately can't handle the strain of the chorus of \\"What is and What Should Never Be\\" or \\"Black Dog\\", he is amazing on \\"Thank You\\" and \\"The Battle of Evermore.\\" Also, one song on this dvd made the purchase price well worth it- \\"Gallow's Pole\\"- this live version blows the studio recording out of the water.

This is rock 'n' roll, kids; it's gonna be loud so forget that other review. The audio on this is so much improved it's not funny. I always found that the vhs release never had any bass, even through my home theater system with a powered sub. This release corrects that & follows through on the possibilities with a great DTS mix! The audio is sharp & clear & I found that after watching this for the first time in quite awhile that I enjoyed it even more than before. That's probably because of the upgrade in quality. Kevin Shirley for those of you who don't know has been doing excellent work producing for the likes of The Black Crowes, Dream Theater, & Iron Maiden for years as well as the phenomenal job he did restoring last year's Zeppelin double dvd.

Backed by an Egyptian orchestra on several tracks and talents Michael Lee, on drums, and Charlie Jones, on bass, the two legends revisit and revise such classics as Kashmir, The Rain Song, and Thank You, and also introduce new material, including standouts like Wonderful One and City Don't Cry.

Though most of the tracks are the same as in No Quarter cd, there is one important difference -- Plant's voice has been fixed. It had sounded quite horrible on the cd (apparently he had a cold during the MTV performance) but here, the tracks sounds as they were meant to. And every one of them is a little gem in its own right. I was particularly pleased to hear \\"the rain song\\", my favourite led zeppelin track, which was left out on the CD.The downside is that there is not a whole lot in the DVD on the visual front. They try to intersperse tracks from different concerts & settings to avoid the visual monotony but the last four or five tracks are all from the same concert and it shows. What would have made real sense is if the tracks on this DVD had been released as the original cd, then there would have been no need for this DVD.

Harry's range was not too evident, but what made this CD even more lackluster was the true missing ingredient from a Harry Nilsson offering; his humor.If you just have to know what Harry sounded like in 1962 then you need to buy this CD.

My copy (from Japan) has few credits I can read, but I do believe that's the powerful voice of Ashley Holt roaring these numbers out, as he had on JOURNEY..., KING ARTHUR, NO EARTHLY CONNECTION, TIME MACHINE and PHANTOM POWER. Wakeman was on a roll around '91-'92, and did at least 7 albums in a ROW that I rank among his best-ever (the others being THE CLASSICAL CONNECTION, SOFTSWORD, CLASSICAL CONNECTION II, 2,000 A.D.

Furthermore, they seemed just a shade narrower than the Fellowes protectors, which can lead to slight catches of the stylus as it passes over the far edges of the screen.

Construction of this has problems: the plastic is thinner than rescue hero stuff has been in the past, and both the doors of the truck won't stay closed at the same time. The latches designed to keep it closed just don't work right. Also, when the special Action Max Billy Blazes with floppy arms-- which we had to buy separatly-- is put in the truck to turn the crank, there is no notch to hold him in by his backpack connection, so when his arms turn, he comes out of the truck head first. Another miss by fisher price. My 3 year old is very frustrated with this toy.

The section with advice on how to play certain hands depending on the format of the game (hi-low split, high-only, pot-limit or no-limit) is especially good. Also some good post-flop tips. The only negative I had was having references to a different format in the chapters for a particular format. For example, in the chapter on hi-low, saying you would play a certain hand in hi-low, but not in pot-limit. In other words,although good advice is given, I would prefer staying on the subject being addressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rare Find","review":"There is very little information available about the games of Omaha and Omaha high-low-split-eight-or-better (O8 for short) so this book is a rare find.

It doesn't need a medium, so Beckmann's self-published argument falls apart.Even if it did, why should we assume that it doesn't rotate, except of course out of convenience for the sake of this bizarre theory?

Heavy editing can cause the music to have an \\"underwater\\" sound, kind of a warbling. I've experienced this myself when editing music from vinyl records.Also, the CD case is not the regular CD case you would expect. It is a slim cardboard case with a plastic mount for the CD inside.

It turned out to be one of the most creative movies I have seen in recent times. It takes slapstick comedy (if you can call it that - I call it art!) to a whole new level. True - it is at-times surreal but the two actors (and the director) handle emotions so well, that even without much dialogue they succeed in keeping you hooked for the entire movie. The director does a fine job weaving the tale around situations that take some real absurd turns (for eg: the flaming fake leg scene). And yet... in the end it does not feel over-done. What keeps you going is not only the quirk characters but also the fine creative way of story-telling, in my opinion.In terms of creativity, this movie was definitely off-the-charts and for that alone, this deserves at least 4 stars and gets a must-see recommendation from me. (Must add: Definitely not a movie for people that are used to standard fare that Hollywood churns out though.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet physical comedy that recalls silent films and early talkies","review":"Like their earlier, even better 'L'Iceberg', this is an inventive throwback to silent films and physical comedies, directed, written and chieflyperformed by a talented trio of circus trained clowns.It's complete with their trademark minimal dialogue and dark events that never keep the film from being light and funny. For example, near the start of the film, the two main characters are in a car crash; one loses a leg, the other his memory, but somehow it works being played for laughs.As a whole, this didn't work quite as well as their 'L'Iceberg' for me - that had a more interesting, surreal plot to hang their routines on, andmore of their bits rose to the level of truly inspired, but this is still a sweet, funny, good-hearted film that cheerfully refuses to play by modern rules."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"DisappointedI bought the DVD Rumba because I enjoyed enormously the gags shown in an advertising short cut movie presentation.

Great for ages 8 to 100!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"great eye candy - little else","review":"Lots of really cute pictures - but I bought it to make certain items that I saw on the cover and in the book. Well - much to my surprise, the instructions(lengths of paper, etc) for all of the items I wanted to make were not included. What a major disappointment. I am an experienced quiller, so I can probably figure it all out, but it would have been so nice to have instructions for all of the pictures. Not so few. To say I'm sorry I purchased this book would be an understatement."},{"rating":"2","title":"creative new ideas for quillers","review":"I have been quilling for quite a few years now and was so excited to see some fun new ideas besides the same old flowers that are in all of the other books! This book gives good instructions for beginners and provides a nice selection of paper to do quite a few of the projects shown. The only issue I have with the book is that there are not directions for each and every design shown, which is minor because you can figure out how to make things once you get the hang of it. Great fun awaits anyone who wants to give this book a try!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I got it just for the cover of the book, because it had things that weren't even in my other books. However, when I got it, it wasn't what I was expecting. There were TONS of designs, so much to do. But most of it is just pictures. Only a few projects have measurements. I like to be able to just look at the book and cut out everything and make it. Not to sit there and make up what size I want it to be. So I've got to make time to figure it out and write it down for the next time I'm ready to quill. It also doesn't give actual size picture.(One book I have does) Which would help out a lot, since most projects are rather large. Other than that it's great. So much to do! I've already done all the ones that it has measurements for and shown them to my family and they all thought they were great! And they are! I am glad I did get it overall, even if it was just the cover that confinced me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that I would purchase again","review":"I already have this book and found that it was simple and straight forward to read. Its great that it comes with the necessary quilling paper and quilling tool as it means that you can start working on some of the projects. I use the projects for card making and loved doing the butterfly, dragonfly and ballon projects for some cards that I made. In fact I have purchased another copy of this book to give to my sister for her birthday."},{"rating":"2","title":"Used it as a camp shower","review":"Some of the other reviews mentioned that it wasn't sturdy enough to hold the water for a shower which is probably true, however, we tied the water container to a tree and poked a whole in the top of the shelter for the water tube and this was the perfect makeshift camp shower. The inside has plenty of room to move around and the shelter held up great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless Junk","review":"The Stansport Cabana Privacy Shelter is an absolutely unusable piece of garbage.

I thought this product may be useful as it appeared to receive some good feedback from others. I received this and then attempted to put this together. I have put together maybe a few hundred tents of all shapes and sizes over the years. This Cabana ranks with the worst of the worst. After a mere 5 minutes I was packing this up for it's return journey. Thank you Amazon for such a super return policy, that's why I buy from you. Seriously folks, someone MUST be kidding when they say this product is great. It is NOT. Please but two 8x10 plastic tarps and your in business for your business!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not purchase as shower","review":"Not strong enough to hold even 2 gallons of water in a shower.

Good if you are looking for privacy or changing room but not for a shower."},{"rating":"1","title":"Falls Apart","review":"Most tents, after they are assembled can be moved around like an empty box, the Stansport Cabana Privacy Shelter falls apart. You must spend an additional 20 minutes securing each joint with twine or it will just come apart when touched. Save your money. Buy a regular dome tent for changing instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Outdoor Bathroom","review":"Shelter is well constructed and can be securly fixed to the ground, so you are not exposed to the world when a breeze comes along that attempts to blow it away. A folding rack placed in the interior keeps clothes off the ground. It has a small interior pocket large enough for soap and small shampoo bottles. Overall, a well designed item."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stansport Privacy Shelter","review":"For the people reviewing this as a shower, it is not meant to be one. No where in the description of the product or on the box does it mention it's designed to be a shower. That's about all I can say to defend the Stansport Cabana. It's poorly made and difficult to put up for one person. The door is hard to zip close at the top because of the tension on the poles. The poles feel like they are going to break when assembling it. There are two windows at about waist level on the sides for limited ventilation and none at the top. And if you close the two windows for privacy, you'll have no ventilation. The shelter doesn't have a floor in it. That may be a plus or minus for you depending on how you are using it. We sent it back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outhouse/Shower","review":"The price and function are great. However, it does take a little longer, and a little more muscle to setup than your standard dome tent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product for the price!!","review":"Read alot of the reviews for this product and thought I would give it a try. Its a great little privacy shelter! We used it for a toilet shelter in florida, even though we had wind gusts of up to 60 mph this little tent held up! Its pretty roomy inside and with the fact that it doesnt have a floor it breathes (so no smells). The price is pretty awesome as well. All in all I give a thumbs up and definately recommend it! Keep in mind the product does not say it is for showering, this shelter is NOT strong enough to hold a shower bag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Their is better out there.","review":"My tents not this hard to put.

We used it with a portable Coleman toilet. But it is very difficult to set up. We have a Coleman 10 person tent that takes half the time to set up. It does travel well - light and compact. It has handy pockets inside for things like toilet paper and hand sanitizer. Overall a good product. We're happy with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Rubic's cube of shelters","review":"I camped at seven different sites over a course of a week, as I was making my way along the coast. This required taking this structure down and reassembling it on as many occassions. If you want to picture yourself wrestling with poles, and pins while camping, then this is the item for you...and I am patient,handy and not a stranger to assembling things. I don't know why manufacturers sometimes take a potentially simple design and complicate it. The number of poles is way too many for this structure, and their configurations are way too complex. The instructions are made only to confuse things more. It could be made so much more user friendly.Once it's up, it gets a thumbs up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of problems","review":"I cannot recommend this product. One of the tent rods was the wrong size and even after modifying it I found it really impossible for one person to set it up. I did like the price and I think there is a market for a low price no frills Cabana like this, but I ended up paying for another brand at a much higher price that is much better designed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid but weak Zippers","review":"Set this up in a windy area near water.Works well.PROSEasy to set upFollow directions, the vertical poles seem best put on with the tent 'skirted' up high to allow for easier fitSturdy - even in windy conditions, holds up wellRoomySimpleNOTEThis is primarily good for changing and pottieFor shower use there are two issues:1. No hole in top to lead in water source or hose, only works with bag showers2.

The songs are to the point and in your face. The recording quality is PRIME!

This collection, sadly, does not do it justice. There are only 13 tracks (and only 9 artists, as 4 of them appear twice) and what there is in no way represents the best of the period.The Watersons were a great group, but Lal Waterson, singing solo on two of these tracks, is painfully out of tune. The other performers on this album are fine, and are well worth a listen, but you will find them all better represented on other albums.I realize that this selection is restricted to recordings from the Trailer label, but I cannot believe this is the best they could do. Both quality and quantity are lacking. A sad leave-taking indeed."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Book on a Hard Subject","review":"Being an introduction to so many branches of mathematics and still self contained in the development of a specific theory, I think this book is a must for anyone who wants to get at least a glimpse of what lies beyond the curtains of real mathematics. I studied the book as an undergraduate, and the subject was hard to me, which made it all the more fun. I have pursued my graduate work in physics and although not directly helpful yet, the introduction to commutative diagrams, homological algebra, the abstract approach to products and coproducts and many other advanced subjects of mathematics has really been a wonderful intellectual challenge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and interesting book","review":"Muhammad Yunus describes in this book how the idea developed about starting a bank for the poor. The writing style of Yunus makes the book very easy to read; almost like a good novel.

Now, I feel like I am participating in the sport with her."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple and Practical!","review":"I have read a few books on soccer drills before, and looked at many more. This book impressed me because it had pictures, not stick figures and confusing diagrams. Each drill had a picture to accompany it, but more importantly, the drills in the book seemed real simple to follow and had real game value. I liked how the author gave each drill a value, and the fact that each had an age recommendation and skill level!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"We got this for a gift -- I'm shocked to see how expensive it is to purchase...I seriously thought it was a $5.00 toy.

If you find it for under $20, then I'd recommend it for a rainy day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Gives worthless trash a bad name","review":"This book gives worthless trash a bad name. I only finished it because I wanted to see if the simple-minded plot had a final twist as some sort of redemption, but it didn't. As a clue, the only mystery in the whole sorry mess is how the editor and publisher allowed the author to use two different names for the perpetrator. The characters are deeply unsympathetic caricatures, the local colour about St Paul is sub-tourist info (don't go in summer, it's hot) and the prose style is somewhere between made-for-TV movie script and computer generated text. The publishers should be ashamed of themselves.

Even though I was mistaken in my memory thinking that Roy Rogers was the singing cowboy, it still was a good story. It exemplifies the love of a person and an animal and solidifies the reason for family. It is a story of courage and challenges. Even though in today's world it might be considered a bit sappy or corny, it is a touching story of personalities, old habits and traditions, and beliefs. I am happy to see it on DVD because it is a lighthearted, G rated movie that I would like to share with my students, especially because it is outdated in costume, vehicles, electronics, and the like. They take so much of what they have for granted, I would like to show them a different lifestyle."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious","review":"This beautiful book is definitely one for the coffee table... large and glossy and full of delicious pictures.

Have no doubt, this is edgy cartooning, often vulgar and unafraid to tread in strange or dirty waters, but he plays it all up like you're reading a strip in your daily newspaper. The cartooning style is some perversion between Crumb and Walt Disney. The characters seem to be influenced by Popeye, Krazy Kat and Max Fleischer. This insane combination hits you spot on and is very, very funny.My favorite volume is volume 1, but volume 3 is a close second."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for raw desserts!","review":"These cherries are fantastic!

I have just finished reading his \\"The Ghosts of Berlin\\" - which I highly recommend - and in it Ladd exhibits a close eye for architectural history and how Berlin, unique among all European capitals, wears its complex and troublesome history on its sleeve, so to speak. The monuments, the buildings - the contentious debates about the design and placement of new buildings - and even the parks and roads all ooze history and make Berlin such a rich place to visit.

There's no sugar coating in this documentary. It's the tale of a young man with a conflicted mind that led him down a self-destructive path. Luckily, his family had a background in Buddhism that he called upon in his darkest hour. His journey is so uplifting. Believe me, what he did is not a miracle - it's hard work. Noah stopped just short of suicide to finally ask for help. And luckily for him, he knew where he could find it. Now he's there, as a beacon to others of his generation, to make sure THEY can find help too. I hope young people from all walks of life are exposed to this story, because this young man was able to stay true to his rebellious spirit, and the life he loved, while discovering a deep understanding of the human condition and the compassion in his soul.

Born-again Buddhist authors such as Noah Levine, Brad Warner, and Dinty W. Moore have established a certain brand of Buddhist minimalism designed to allow people to graze on enough spirituality and contemplation to reassert their belief in their own goodness. It's hard to take seriously, or with any depth any writing that begins quite so many sentences with the phrase \\"Buddhism is just...\\" something or other.

It holds a battery charge well and warns when it's getting low.The manufacturing quality of the piece is terrible though. It feels very cheap and is uncomfortable. Comments about the headset being designed for a 5 year old are exaggerations, but just barely. The headset is very small and the adjustments are hard to make without feeling like you're going to break the head loop. Because of the angle and placement of the adjustment slide on the loop, trying to make it bigger actually pushes the other side's grip pad further into your head at an angle. The pad is just a rigid piece of toothed plastic with no actual padding for comfort.I bought this at a deep discount and still don't feel it was worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap Made Crap","review":"Yes you can hear very well with this product But This Item should have come with a roll of Duct tape and a tube of superglue. Its was falling apart from the moment I removed it from the package, To start the ear piece fell off, The headset size was made to fit a 5 year old,The wall charger plug in prongs stayed in the wall When I unpluged them the first time I used it.

A very expensive endeavor! The earloop ones don't stay on my ears, the ear bud ones hurt my ears, other over the head sets are too bulky or heavy or tight fitting. This one fits perfectly for me.This is actually the second time I've gotten this particular headset. The first one lasted a little over 2 years when the clip that holds the adjuster part broke and the mic boom detached from the speaker. So I thought I'd get the \\"upgraded\\" one. Another expensive mistake. Now, I'm back to the tried and true. And I'm very happy with it. Granted it could use some minor fixes but I'm good with the way it is for now.The sound quality is excellent. People I talk to usually don't even know I'm using a headset. And the unit is so light I always forget I'm wearing it. All in all, a good buy for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent quality","review":"I am very happy with this product.

I like the overall look/design and the fact that it's black so you can 'see' the birds better against the black wire. It a nice size too, except I wish it was a bit deeper, meaning more square in its overall 'footprint' size. The three small sliding doors work very well and the food containers have covers on them to keep out bird mess, etc. (a nice-to-have). The larger door that swings open is great too for rearranging perches, toys, etc. This cage also cleans easily. With the birds still in the cage, you simply 'squeeze' the cage off the plastic base and set it aside. Then clean the base, droppings tray and floor grid separately in the sink, then reverse the process to put it back together. I haven't used the stand. However, it looks like its constructed well, similar to the cage, albeit a bit short in height for a bird cage stand (probably can be about a 1/2 to a foot taller). Overall, a nice buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, but disappointed","review":"The book was nothing of what I expected,own fault.

Recorded in 1991 (a few months after the other 2) this contains more variation in sound and style than its predecessors, notably the delicate \\"Churchyard\\" (which somehow brings to my mind visions of pixiedust) and \\"Mount Fuji By Night\\" (is that a samisen, or only an imitation?).

There really is not much cut from these, they are very complete sets. Sorry, no subtitles on these seasons.Love the music, the Latin pop stars and variety of bands, dancing and the club scene. At some point you know Javier and Isabel will get together, I'm sure of it--season 3 perhaps?!?! I know the story line is over the top, but it really is fun to watch.My favorite character, of course the bad girl \\"Topacio 'La Matadora'\\", can't help it, we all love the bad girl, she's not evil like Daniel just on the edge.

DeNooyer-Moore reveals in rich and meaningful ways the shadows that so often color life's understanding of concepts of right and wrong, black and white, past and future, perfect and imperfect. With a deep love and respect for the culture, the land, the people and the language, the author invites the reader into this time and place, into the life of a family with roots in the soil of the Appalachians - a family that sturggles to do right.A quiet humor laces the culture and people together.

If I want to do a long hike or backpack from one trail head to another, the layout of the book makes if very difficult to figure out where to pick up the next trail to link the route together. Probably what is most confusing here are the maps. Many of the maps just end at the edge of the map and it's difficult to determine where in the book to pick up the next map that will allow me to complete my planned route. The layout just doesn't seem as clear as it could be for route planning.I do like how the maps show distances between points though. Profile data for the routes along with the maps would be nice though.Overall it's a nice guidebook with lots of information and good descriptions of the routes, but the layout seems to be the only drawback and it makes route planning more difficult than some other guidebooks I've used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great guidebook to some of Idaho's best locations!","review":"Margaret Fuller is an exceptional writer that combines how to get to some of the best locations in Idaho with a little history of the area.

Being a native Idahoan growing up in Salmon I was surprise at how much information and different hikes Margaret has put into her books.

The story for this episode is Lord Zedd decides to attack the North Pole and kidnap Santa. The rangers of course go up there and put a stop to his plans.

Obviously in a short amount of time the weight of the doors will pressure the screws to let go.The worse part is that both the seller AA Store - Amazon Marketplace would not cover the damage.

The book makes virtually no sense, reading like a sermon.So far as legitimate advice, I found little, and certainly none that was unique. The useless advice was shocking - the book had might as well be entitled \\"How To Fail In Business By Preaching Religion To Your Coworkers\\".I'm going to be a lot more suspicious for a while about book purchases.

What's very pleasing is that during the inevitable lulls that accompany \\"detective\\" work, some current happening in the case sparks Mr. Hunter's memory and he digresses to tell some amazing tale from his past. You'll just have to read the book to find out if they get their man.The last chapter was a marvelous account of a safari that he led for an Indian Maharajah.

However, it's very fun to read about our imminent destruction because of the illuminati and their control over the world. It's even very laughable when you read secret lists of people behind these conspiracies that only Mr. Marrs has access to. If you want to believe that we're all going to die soon and that the Great Tribulation is staring at us straight in the face, sure, read this book- you'll have fun and probably be convinced.

You must take the sizing in stride and realize what size you REALLY are. Make sure if the project calls for a fitted shirt it is in your size to start. Otherwise, a shirt at least one size bigger is smart.The directions are very easy to understand. A beginner will be able to follow right along. With help, even girls as young as 7-8 years old could make some of these designs.You could also use some of the directions and use all manner of fabric.

I know it says that you don't need one, but honestly, I'd be embarrassed to leave the house in the shirts I made. Yes, I'm not super-craftsy, but I gave it a good shot, and even hand-sewed a few things, yet I emerged quite disappointed. More emphasis needs to be given about the types of fabric you use - 100% cotton stretches out way too fast.

There is, however, something for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty neat, but not for everyone","review":"The most sewing I'd ever done before this was sewing buttons back onto shirts...but I found the instructions very clear and not at all intimidating. It does take a little practice to get the hang of cutting and fitting things just right, I recommend practicing on some old t-shirts you REALLY don't want. And it'd be a great deal easier with a sewing machine, which I don't have. (No wonder the Industrial Revolution kicked off with textiles...sewing by hand is VERY tedious).Like another reviewer said, many of the tops can't be worn with a bra, or will only look good/fit on gals who don't need bra support. I've pretty much given up on most of them, as I don't fall under that category.

Within maybe the first 5 minutes of opening this book and looking at all the different projects I started coming up with variation after variation in my head. So, if you have wanted to make your own clothes but havent had quite enough inspiration, this is an amazing book for you!

The premise is a good one: a redemption story set in the Christmas season. Unfortunately, the script is poor and predictable. The actors, including Mickey Rooney, did as much as one can expect with a mediocre screen play. I found myself feeling sorry for the actors trying to make this dud work--- rather than empathizing with their characters as the story played out.Don't buy this movie. Send me $3 for postage and I'd be glad to send you my copy. On second thought, don't do that. That would be like giving away that old junker car knowing the new owner would be better off without it.

I'm never putting this stuff in my hair again. Maybe I'll save it to prank somebody, because that's all I can think of to do with it.

He's inspired--musically by a great band, and lyrically by, well, all kinds of rants. The album is a melodic, hard-rocking affair that will have you stomping your feet. Hunter's words are alternatively tender and scathing. You'll never find a more honest lyricist than Ian. A great album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just a few more accolades for Mr. Hunter","review":"Being on a message board devoted to Ian & Mott the Hoople, I heard a lot about this CD (good and bad) before I was able to buy it. The first listen gave me an addiction to 'Wash Us Away' and 'Knees of My Heart'; the rest seemed ok. Now I can't seem to get it out of my player. I've listened to it so many times, I can sing it in my sleep, but it always seems as fresh as the first time. This album gets better with every listen. Do yourself a favor; if you are a fan of Hunter or Mott, or never heard of him before going to see Ringo's All Starr Band this time around (Ian plays guitar on the current tour), get this album. You won't regret it (except perhaps that all the rest of your CDs will gather dust.....)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Low Expectations","review":"I was browsing through the \\"used\\" bins at my local \\"record\\" store and stumbled upon this album. I hadn't bothered to follow what Ian Hunter has been up to for years, but thought I'd give this 2001 release a shot. What a surprise to find out that Ian can still write a catchy song, without being conventional about it. Like other reviewers, \\"Dead Man Walking\\" is the best cut on the disc, but ALL the other songs aren't that far behind. It's good to hear a high quality album from an artist who never got his due after \\"Mott the Hoople\\". If you've ever loved the music of the group or the man, buy this recording.

His band sound very tight. I've heard several fans describe Ian Hunter as \\"Still vital\\" and I agree. \\"Wash us Away\\" stood out as the best track, and \\"Death of a Nation\\" is very clever. The tracks have a very personal feel to them, like IH is sharing something important (a quality sorely lacking in many bands). Good Rock and Roll, and something more too."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great themes, poor music","review":"It's been a while since Mr. Hunter released a \\"real\\" album, so this disc contains a lot of fresh ideas, both in melody and lyrics.I've always perceived IH as a \\"rebel poet\\", and the man is back in true form. How unfortunate that the vocal delivery is somewhat weak: IH is and has never been a great singer, but he compensates with emotion and a real songwriting gift; too bad his voice sounds tired on most tracks. The lyrics are enclosed, and that's a real plus.But the musical arrangements are poor, and even if the roster of musicians includes some familiar names (if you're into people like Tom Petty, Bryan Adams, etc.), the performances are dull at best.Most IH albums have their ups and downs, at least to my ears. His latest happens to have more downs than usual, but there are still a few tracks above par."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ian Hunter continues to please","review":"This is what a rock and roll album should be. It is one of the best albums Ian Hunter has released in years. Ian who consistantly records great music and has yet to stray from his path has once again moved up the ladder to yet another level. The songs on rant are revealing, inventive, and have an honesty that rearely exists in todays world of heartless pop and teeny bopper music. Thanks to Ian we see that Rock is alive and well.I would not be surprised if this album skyrockets Ian back to the center of the public eye. This album is a must for anyone who really likes great rock music and appreciated true talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"RANT \\"Another cute little4 letter word\\"","review":"Ian Hunter does it again with \\"RANT\\".

This \\"RANT\\" CD is very well produced. Ian Hunter is again at his finest. His songwriting is still rock solid and his voice just seems to get better with age. It still blows me away that he is 63. The Rockers all rock and the Ballads are great! To hear this CD best please listen to it loud and in your house because the sound quality is sensational.

I bought it as part of a large kit of 18V tools so I really can't return it.First of all, I have the \\"auto off\\" feature. It can be sitting on a stable surface and POOF it goes out. Toggle the switch twice and back it comes. Will it stay on? Maybe, but don't trust it. (Not safe during Hurricane Irene!)Secondly, if you rotate the head while it is lit it can break the hot filament. Maybe this is \\"operator error\\" but once again I am plunged in to darkness. It took two bulbs to figure out what was killing them.Do yourself a favor, skip this light."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great flashlight","review":"Fits great in the hand and surprisingly lightweight, well balanced. I do like the included strap for hands free operation; with the swivel head you can point it where you need it while it is slung over your shoulder. For those who complained about the strap--don't attach it. Battery compatibility was not a problem either. My compact 18V 1.5 Ah Li-ion battery fit perfectly with no need to punch out an insert. It uses the A-90261 bulb, which is described as a Xenon bulb on Makita's web site. It produces an amazing amount of light. For $18.25 what a good value. Replacement bulbs are reasonable, $4.79 with free shipping from Northern Tool. Too soon to need bulbs, but good idea to be prepared. They will probably break if the flashlight is jarred or dropped during use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pricey, and not really sturdy.","review":"I expect more out of Makita. The swivel head has a lot of play in it, which gives it a flimsy feel. As much as this cost, and the Makita name, gave me some great expectations. This, however, didn't deliver.That said, it does put out quite a beam of light, and the 4 swivel angels are very handy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Happy Camper!!!","review":"This was purchased to replace one my husband has had for years. His old one finally bit the dust after many, many years of use. He is an extremely happy camper!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT AS ADVERTISED","review":"Not a horrible flashlight, but for $40 you could search for something better. I bought it because I had batteries and a charger already, however I now regret my purchase. The bulbs included are NOT XENON as advertised. I read the description so I understood that the battery wasn't included, but all the pictures show that the battery comes with. Just seems like a very misleading product description. The build is kinda cheap and not what I expected from a Makita product. Search for something else with better reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Flashlight","review":"This flashlight arrived in a cardboard without original packaging. Delivery time was good.

This is surprising to me since I have bought many Makita products over the years (just bought the new combo driver/drill pair) and have been very happy with their durability and reliability.

Other than that, it's not near the quality I expect with a Makita label and price. It just feels very flimsy for a $35 flashlight. If I didn't have several LXT tools and 6 batteries, I would probably have sent it back."},{"rating":"1","title":"very disappointing","review":"Wanted a good, bright rechargable flashlight. Already had these batteries and charger, so got the flashlight. Old fashioned and out-dated are the best words for it. Only has off-on switch, and a pivoting head, nothing more. Is an old-fashioned standard light bulb. Should have a focusable beam, it is not. Should have low, medium and bright, it is not. Should be LED or halogen or HID or any of the new high-intensity bulbs, it is not.

This book explains in simple language the rules used by Greek in the formation of words. Once one understands the rules, the language behaves VERY regular and in an understandable fashion. For example, one you realize the spelling changes are for the sake of pronunciation, they make sense! This book is well worth its weight in gold. You can use it as a stand-alone reference work, but it is designed to go with Mounce's Grammar and Lexicon. I can't encourage you enought to get this book if you want to understand the langauge instead of just memorizing a bunch of paradigms."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellant as a reference but don't get bogged down","review":"There is no doubt that this is an excellant resource and if you master it you will really know Greek. My experience was that I got bogged down in it. At some point I found reading and understanding the why more difficult than just memorizing it. It's intended as a reference tool and that is how it's best used early in your Greek - use occasionally but mostly just read the Greek and figure it out.

I think you have to pay to have Consumer Reports test your products so I wouldn't beleive them, I doubt if they really tested the tent beyond setting up and scratching their chins awhile.

I highly recommend it to all trainers who are working with teams, and suggest that you consider taking Heerman's Team Spirit Certification Training to further develop your skills in this area."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you want touchy-feely, this is your book!","review":"I was hoping to find fun, but relevant exercises. Instead, the book wants you to share your feelings, or connect nine dots (been there, done that back in high school!). This book is good if you want to share your feelings, and is not good if you are looking to hve fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed","review":"In purchasing this book I was looking for pragmatic exercises applicable to work teams in the U.K. Having read the book, and being an experienced and well respected trainer,I decided that there was little, if anything that would be acceptable to 'blue collar workers'. There is too much 'ivory tower theory' that would turn people off, rather than stimulating and inspiring them to become actively involved in either a training or team activity. For me it was a waste of money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This cd is one you can enjoy, but.......","review":"This is a nice Rosemary Clooney cd. Most the songs on it come from the early part of her career. Some of her hits i reallly adore, but others i will need to ignore.Rosie has a nice voice. It is one that you will not get tired of hearing day after day. I just wish for this project that there had been more of her songs that i truly like and enjoy listening to. I know it's hard to please everyone so there will always be someone that will be unhappy regardless of how a cd is made.I Can Not Recommend This Cd"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Compilation at a Great Price!","review":"I bought this CD in the early nineties when performers from this period were first coming out on CD. I've been pleased with it ever since. Since these songs were from the earlier part of Ms. Clooney's career, the sound quality won't match what we hear today. However, the remastering is very good, and the 'softness' is appropriate for the music and the period--it's especially fun to listen to in the car!This CD has most, if not all, of the hits that Rosie is remembered for. Though some people will want every recording from an artist, many want only their greatest hits--just like today. These people will be well satisfied with this CD.This CD is a great value at the price, buy and you won't regret it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Could have been better but not bad...","review":"This album was produced very nicely but falls short in terms of connecting with the listener. It reminds me of a hollywood film in which there is a high budget in the production, but there just isn't enough substance. The guitarwork is pretty good, it stays on time and the background instrumentals are nice as well, although some of the synth patches tries to mimic authentic instruments but do not fit well. You can definitely tell that there is some good musicianship in this CD, but being a good guitarist does not necessarily constitute for being a good songwriter. 2 stars... it could have been better but not bad for a beginning effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Product","review":"This is a great book. There is a wide variety of recipes for all ages. The recipes that are suggested for older children are also great for adults. I bought one for myself and one for a friend (who also loves it) and I have recommended it over and over again to other mothers. It suggests great (easy) recipes and food combinations for babies that I wouldn't have thought of. So far it's a hit and I'm looking forward to trying more of the recipes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Resource","review":"I love this book and refer to it on a weekly basis. The book is in an easy to follow stage-by-stage format. This book provides wonderful, easy, delicious, and healthy recipes for your baby. Most importantly, it provides useful instruction on how to begin making your own baby food. My nine month old son loves the \\"Cheesy Stars\\" and \\"Fruity Chicken\\" recipes. I have followed this book since the day my son began solids and it has been an indispensible resource. This book also has beautiful and demonstrative photographs, making cooking for your baby fun. I am proud to say that as a mom with a full time job outside the home AND with the help of this book, my baby has hardly eaten commercial baby food! (I also liked this book much better than Ruth Yaron's overly hyped \\"Super Baby Food.\\")"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as hard as it looks!","review":"This book is by a Cordon Bleu trained chef, and the illustrations look it. Gorgeous meals, but would I really cook this stuff? For the most part, yes. Most of the recipes are simple, though when the author whips out her food processor and grinds her own meat, I don't really think the typical busy mom will follow! There are some recipes with ingredients I don't pick up by habit at the market, but nothing that isn't readily available.Definitely buy this book for \\"party food\\", if you want gorgeous meals or snacks to tempt a toddler. It probably won't be your everyday cookbook, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"good ideas","review":"I like the pictures and the layout of the book. The recipes seem to be well accepted by my four and one and a half year old. Overall, I would have to say that I don't use it much because, for my kids, they don't like foods when I spend much effort on them. To them simple is best. I spent alot of time making those cute pizza muffins, and me and my husband ate them. At this age my kids like all their foods seperate and identifiable.But as far as what I have seen in Children's cookbooks I'd have to say this is the nicest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good recipes but inconsistent advice","review":"I agree with another reviewer who had reservations about the age at which she says you can feed certain foods. In fact, in one of the introductory pages she says you should not feed citrus or berries (especially strawberries) to children under the age of 1, but in the section for 6-9 months there are berry recipes and things including orange juice. She also mentions nuts and peanuts, but still uses them in recipes for children under a year. I plan to use the recipes, but read other sources on when to feed certain foods. I believe the American Academy of Pediatrics has a list of foods that should be fed at certain ages.While some of the recipes are too involved, I really enjoy cooking and I think I will really enjoy making many of these for my family."},{"rating":"1","title":"I barely have time to shower, let alone make these recipes!","review":"I am the mother of a 8 month old who insists on feeding himself. He won't use a spoon, only his hands, this book has recipes I would expect to find at a 5 star restaurant, but not in my kitchen. There are not many suggestions on easy to make, finger foods. Everything is very complex & really needs to be eaten with utensils. Yes this book is beautiful, but not realistic for me & my family."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste","review":"My kids have always had a healthy diet, but like variety. This book had so much variety, it seemed perfect. I stuck to this book for 3 weeks. I have made 12 of these recipes, so I feel I have given the book MORE than a fair shot. The kids hate the food and the preparation times take far longer than the guidelines suggest. Also, the recipes use many perishable ingredients in small amounts, so there is a lot wasted. My grocery bill went up and no one would even touch the food."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good could be imrpoved","review":"The recipes are very good and the information is also excellant (I would check with your peditrician about possible food allergies on some recipes). However the book could use an easier format and more pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not realistic","review":"This book flies in the face of most of the literature I've read about when to introduce foods to new eaters. It also is unrealistic, in my opinion. Not many moms will have time to cook like this for their baby.Maybe check it out from a library or flip through it on a store shelf before you decide to purchase, to see if it's right for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cute but useless.","review":"I loved the pictures in this book. I loved leafing through it and admiring all the hard work at presentation the photographer and author had obviously done in their dainty animal face pizzas and artistic food presentation. I hope their babies appreciated it. Mine doesnt give a hoot if his cheese looks like a star or a cow or a rocket or if I put little olive eyes on his smiling pizza face. Frankly, who has the time for this!I did find some nice recomendations in the infant feeding section on how to mix different veggies in purees and but most of the recipes had me going \\" who in the world is going to sit around doing that!\\" Kudos on the pretty pictures but if you are a harried mom trying to get food on the table for a screaming toddler, pass this one on."},{"rating":"1","title":"If you're already a gourmet cook...","review":"This cookbook has lots of neat ideas for meals and makes everything look delicious and appealing. However, if you are not the worlds greatest cook, you will have trouble tackling these recipes, especially in any reasonable amount of time. I am hoping to cook well for my kids, but not when it forces me to leave them screaming for an hour or more while I dice and chop and saute and fry, etc. Added to that some very unusual ingredients and this book is clearly not for the basic cook or the cook on a budget. Still, the pictures are appealing."},{"rating":"2","title":"so far . . . great recipes!","review":"I have a 10 month old and I bought this book about 3 weeks ago. So far we both love it! The recipes are very tasty and I'm looking forward to the \\"Family Meals\\" section coming in handy as our son ages. My only hesitation about the book - the recipes take longer than the estimates given. Nonetheless, I'm not an experienced cook, so maybe my speed will improve over time."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good for picky eaters","review":"I bought this book when my son was 18 months old. He is now 3 1/2 years old and has never even wanted to try any of the recipes I made using this book. The recipes are complicated and time consuming (not what you want when you are trying to look after a toddler) and too full of undisguised \\"weird\\" ingredients that fussy eaters won't even touch. I think it would only be useful for parents whose children are non-picky eaters from the start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great variety for baby","review":"One of the most challenging questions of being a new parent is - what do I feed this little person? This book gives some great ideas for adding variety to your baby's diet. Some of the recipes are a little over-the-top and, let's face it, I'm sticking with store-bought baby food rather than making purees at home (who has the time?). But when you have a baby that eats like a bottomless pit (like my 9-month-old) there are some great recipes that are appetizing and well-balanced. It's a great help when you want to make sure your baby is getting everything he/she needs in their diet."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fantastic and comprehensive book","review":"As a mother of 5, I can tell you I truly appreciate the variety of recipes and suggestions for feeding a baby. I am a gourmet cook and I spend a great deal of time preparing my family's meals. I look forward to using the many recipes and suggestions for my new daughter."},{"rating":"2","title":"parent friendly book","review":"The illustrations, advice, layout and general usefulness of this book make it a great tool for firstime parents.I'm just a regular mom and know that on occasions I will turn to commercial products as necessary, but I did want to make most of my daughters food. I initially bought Ruth Yaron's Super Baby Food book after many positive reviews from Amazon and elsewhere.. but I HATED IT because of all the cross referencing! This book however, is easy to read and my daughter is enjoying the food I prepare."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything has tasted good!","review":"I've made several of the recipes for my 10 month old. He has liked every one of them. They aren't too difficult to make, and the ingredients are simple. I can go to the store without a list, and generally remember what I need to get for a recipe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun, fast and healthy","review":"If you really are interested in preparing your children's food because you are sick to death of all the unhealthy garbage that proliferates prepackaged food then this book is for you. If you are just wanting something easy, then it probably isn't. Other reviewers scoffed at using semolina, etc but these ingredients are actually relatively easy to find. The trouble is most of us have just gotten so complacent that we don't move beyond our norm. Also, this kindsof ingredients are much healthier for your child & for me, at least, that was the whole purpose of making her baby food! You don't have to do all the \\"fancy\\" presentations the author use, but it certainly makes it fun for your toddler and they can also assist you in preparing the food. The whole point is to get our kids eating better and this book is a great tool for that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Food for your little one's imagination","review":"Beautiful photos, layout and quality--especially for the price. Includes the basics through more fanciful and creative dishes for feeding fertile little imaginations. Very inspiring--even if you don't have time to make all the more elaborate meals, this book has the right idea for engaging your child in the wonderful world of food. I definitely recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Photography, Bland recipes","review":"Sorry Annabel...nice pictures in this book, some fun shapes and interesting combos, but the ingredients!! Oh my! What child likes to eat smoked salmon and shallots? I have tried out 3 recipes for my 16 month old (and he is not a picky eater yet) and he spit them out and gave me a look like I was nuts! I bought this book for some fresh meal ideas. The animal shapes are fun and all but for a child who needs his food cut into bite sized shapes - whats the point? Perhaps this book is better suited to older toddlers who are a bit more finicky about their food?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Reference","review":"Okay, if you want a cookbook that tells you what you already know, what's the point? Yes, it's creative, yes there are unique choices, but that's what many people, who like to cook, are looking for in a cookbook. Yes, the pictures are remarkable, but would you prefer any less? Some of the \\"fancy\\" dishes, shapes, etc. are in a section for entertaining. Jello sailboats, for example, are not presented as weekday snack selections. Anyway, what a fun idea to spend a rainy day in the kitchen making something other than Tollhouse. Don't be put off by bad reviews. This book is a great reference, great starter to get one thinking about new combinations, ingredients, and textures. No, it doesn't take the place of pediatricians' suggestions or even a general child wellness text a la \\"What to Expect in the First Year,\\" but it is a good book to have in your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"MY GODSEND","review":"I found \\"First Meals\\" via an advertisement in one of my parenting magazines.My son was four months old and I was preparing to begin feeding him by spoon. His pediatrician had given me some tips on what to give him. My son HATED everything I tried to give him recommended by the pediatrician. Then I received \\"First Meals\\".Everything talked about in the book was exactly right (i.e., his reaction to the spoon, to certain veggies, to textures; even storing portions). My son LOVED everything I made him.The book takes you step by step in starting your child out by spoon. The meals are good, nutritious, and easy. The tips are great. The visuals are wonderful. And the meals change gradually as your child gets older. I have recommended this book to every new mommy I know!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great ideas to get started","review":"Previously bought the book \\"Super Baby Food\\" on the advice of my pediatrician and was very discouraged and overwhelmed. Then my mother in law brought over this book that she picked up in a garage sale - THANK GOD! Yes, it's short but that is a great thing when you just need a little inspiration. What parent has time to read more than 1 or 2 pages at a time anyway? Baby is hungry right now! :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Returned This Book!","review":"Although the illustrations were lovely and there appeared to be some good nutritional information, I felt that it offered suggestions that were unsafe; e.g., offering babies things like raw carrot sticks, which commonsense as well as my pediatrician says is a choking hazard. Additionally, I felt there was a little too much emphasis on presentation than is necessary for a baby. (I know my 9 month old really didn't care if the bread was cut into a star shape or square, although this would undoubtedly be of importance to an older toddler.) To me, the book just wasn't what I was looking for; i.e., easy, nutritious, safe and tasty recipes for my 9 month old."},{"rating":"2","title":"BEAUTIFUL & CREATIVE!!!","review":"This is a lovely book, full of beautiful photographs, creative recipes and lots of helpful information. My only concern is the \\"when your child is unwell\\" section on p. 67, where the author recommends milkshakes and hot chocolate! Sugar is a well-known immune suppressant, and should never be offered to a child who is sick (and should only be offered sparingly to a child who is well). Other than that, I think it's a great book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful presentation good ideas","review":"This is a very pretty book to look at and there are some interesting recipes. The pictures psyched me up for making my own baby food. But in the end I am not sure I ever followed a recipe from this book. It did give me good ideas about flavor combos though - like fruit with meat, etc.The author is British (I think) and some of the foods for the younger ages don't match recommendations you often see in the States. That might bother some people. But then who follows these child-rearing books to the letter anyway?"},{"rating":"1","title":"If you have an extra two hours a day and love to cook then...","review":"This book is for people who love to cook and have lots of time on their hands to do it. The book was not for me, too much work and not enough payoff.I found a few good idea's and yes, a few good recipes but beware before you buy it, it is not for beginners."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I order this book and I am very disappointed. I don't considered using vegetable oil or frying anything healthy. Also the recipes are time consuming. The pictures are nice and all of the shapes they make out of the food but lacking substance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Baby Food Cookbook out there!!!","review":"I used this cookbook for my first child and I loved the diversity of the menu!! I am just now beginning to use it again for my second and I love it even more!! The recipes are easy to follow, many options are given to make certain recipes a little different, and the combinations of food for the liitlest babies are unique. I never would have thought to put vegetables with fruit(i.e. mixing sweet potatoes with applesauce!)But both my kids love it!! Great Book!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I wouldn't buy this book if your child is past the pureed baby food stage. Much of the book is dedicated to that stage and the recipes for older babies and toddlers just aren't enough to make it worth the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"First Meals","review":"The book is quite colorful and offers a variety of options and suggestions, but I feel the recipes for toddlers are too complicated and time consuming, even for a stay at home mom. I do feel the recipes geared toward infants were great.What I did gain from the book was not to be afraid to introduce my child to a variety of foods, whether I like them or not. Exposing their palates to endless possibilities, at a young age, could perhaps deter the picky eater syndrome. Also, the additional information regarding your childs diet and the resources listed in the back is quite valuable information.With all that being said, I would still not make a recommendation to purchase this book if you're truly looking for recipes for your toddler."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book could have been better","review":"I bought this book so I could feed my baby healthy meals without resorting to canned baby foods. Unfortunately the recipes focused too much on presentation. My baby has allergies to milk and eggs,so some of the recipes I could not use.I also feel some of the suggestions were unsafe when it came to giving your child certain foods at certain stages due to serious choking hazards. But I did find the daily meal planner to be helpful in the back of the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A REAL waste","review":"I agree with \\"A reader from Boston\\" for the same reasons. Ms. Karmel is living in a fantasy world. My kid eats fruits, vegetables, and grains, but she won't touch this stuff. She's just over two years old and she won't come near the stuff Karmel expects a one-year old to eat. I was pretty dubious about it just reading the recipes but gave them a try. So anyone who wants my copy cheap please drop me a line."},{"rating":"1","title":"poor nutrition","review":"The author has no clue about the current AAP guidelies for feeding in the first year. She recommends eggs, whole milk, nuts and citrus at very early ages. As someone with food allergies, I am following the doctors guidelines carefully. This book has very little to no use for someone interested in following medical guidelines."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book!!!","review":"I try some of the receipts for my twins. They don't like it. I know that you should not feed baby under 12 months, leeks, onion, heavy butter cooking. If you follow the book, your baby may endup with choking hazard. Please watch out. Don't buy this book. The receipt is not good for the baby. They are not suppose to eat those food."},{"rating":"1","title":"IMPRACTICAL","review":"The Hard cover layout of this book makes it impractical to use in the kitchen where you need to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Fancy for Lil Ole Me","review":"This book is beautiful, but I'm not going to go out and buy a bunch of stuff I don't normally eat (like leeks) to feed my baby.

Well, I didn't like the first season all that much (especially comparing to the British version). However, the second season is amazing in my opinion. The characters are more real, human and likable (even Brian). There is just as much eye candy, sex and flashy cinematography, but the storylines are less sensationalistic and more thought-provoking. It seems that the writers of the show are getting better and better with every episode. Even acting is getting better. After watching the first season I was merely amused. After watching this season I feel like I can't wait to see more of these great characters. Get this season as soon as you can, you wont be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Queer as Folk - The Complete Second Season","review":"Got this after I completed watching season 1 and truly look forward to enjoying this as well-I'ts been several years since I've watched this show & it's good 2 be able 2 sit back & enjoy whenever I want."},{"rating":"2","title":"Surviving the Second Season, not as bad as I thought!","review":"Many would say the second season of QAF lacked much of the gusto of the first season. Some of the storylines in the beginning were just plain, um, how do I say...Boring?The second half of the second season sure did surprise me though. I wont give anything away, but the second season ended on a CLIFFHANGER, with a very cute surprise, and one shocking moment in the final frames...Im sure this DVD will make many a fan out of those who wish to view.

One: so all the closeted men and womyn out there can see that they're a)not alone & b)that it's ok to be who they are. Two: so all the tough guys/and girls out there who like to spill the ... word like water, can see that there are many of us out there, and many to come, and we aren't going anywhere anytime soon.

But the season finale was no big cliffhanger. We all knew justin and brian would get back together in the third season because the writers would never bring another character on the show full time to break up brian and justin. Even though brian never says he loves justin and the audience is angry that he never shows his affection for him, we all know how he truly feels about justin. No one wants them to break up.

Very, very POOR!!!","review":"I wish I could have awarded ZERO stars.An American friend of mine sent me this set and the first series DVDs.Compared to the British original series they are very dull. They lack the bite and drama. They are sanitised so as not to upset the American viewing audience. For example, how often does the US series show sexual action? The openiong of the UK series shows Nathan (the schoolboy) having sex - and it's THAT MOMENT that underpins the whole of the series. It never ceases to amaze me how a US network will buy the rights to a UK TV series and then proceed to butcher the whole concept.My suggestion?If you have a multi-region DVD player (or PAL compatable VCR) go to amazon.co.uk and buy the REAL THING, and not these watered-down, sanitised and dreary remakes.You may have to work a bit harder than you're used to with the accents and some of the settings, but that effort will be rewarded."},{"rating":"1","title":"VHS is un-viewable!!","review":"I ordered this set of vhs tapes from Sammy's books NW...It's simply worn out!

I can't believe I'm listening to music my parents listened to, but this is really good stuff. Ms. Page's voice is, no other word for it, sublime. The arrangements are very lush.

My 6 year old probaby does not understand the explanations, but s;he is being exposed to new ideas."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good one","review":"Lots of things to try and it is really good for a rainy day to keep busy. You might need to make sure you have the items needed before you start something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Everything you need to have fun...(and learn, too)","review":"This is a great book, chock-a-block w/ very accessible experiments. One of the best features is the way the experiments are grouped together: a 'theme' (say, Acids, in the Chemistry section) will have a group of experiments of varying degrees of complexity that together add up to a pretty good understanding of the concept. Also, most of the materials are readily at hand- for many of them we really did already have everything in the house. This is esp. gratifying for the kids, who of course want to do the experiment *right now*. I would imagine that home-schooling families would enjoy this, but our school-going kids enjoy doing these experiments after school & on weekends.p.s., one of the easiest experiments is also a real showstopper, though it takes a couple of days to complete: dissolving the eggshell of an egg, leaving the egg inside intact!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the Classroom","review":"There are a few books that I couldn't live without in my classroom, and this is one of them. The experiments can be adapted to a wide range of age groups, they're easy and very informative. Best of all is that they build on each other and the explanations are clear and concise. A great classroom resource."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for science introduction","review":"Perfect for science introduction. It contains quite a few fun experiments, easy to assemble at home, from wide range of disciplines. We use some of them for science expo at my daughter elementary school. It is good for kindergardeners through 5-th graders.The look is pretty poor, but other than that we can not complain."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feminism and colonialism","review":"Besides this being as readable as Jane Austen, this book is witty and intelligent. It raises thought provoking questions about gender roles and transgression that suggest that Edgeworth was not an ordinary woman. Unfortunately, like many other 18th C. novels, the book ends with all the usual conventions intact. The women who cross dress (and the man who cross-dresses!) are returned to their spheres and/or married. Don't get me wrong though, this book is quite innovative. I don't know of many literary women having duels and stepping in iron traps that cut up their legs. Also particularly interesting is Edgeworth's treatment of colonialism: there is a cross-racial marriage that is entirely sanctioned. And yet the thought of the heroine marrying a creole is not approved. It is much better for her to marry an Englishman in the parliament. This is a delightful book that would entertain romantics and scholars. I would like to think that I am both, though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Compulsively readable","review":"I picked up Belinda when I heard that it was similar to Jane Austen. While there are parallels to Austen's work, Edgeworth differs in that she was slightly more worldly than Austen was.In Belinda, we follow the story of a young woman of uncommon good sense, who, at the behest of her aunt, goes to stay with Lady Delacour in London. While there, Belinda meets Lady Delacour's protégé Clarence Hervey, with whom, of course, she falls in love. Mr. Hervey, however, may or may not be attached to another young lady. The book touches on colonialism when Mr. Vincent, a man with a deep secret, enters the picture and threatens to steal Belinda's heart.The novel is an 18th-century \\"will they or won't they?\\" and the plot unfolds neatly, albeit dramatically. For a novel published in 1803, Belinda is highly (and compulsively) readable. It's a must read for anyone who loves Jane Austen."},{"rating":"2","title":"school book","review":"This is one of the best books I have read in a long long time. Amazingly, I read it for a class! It has an intricate plot, engaging characters, and it was written, even more amazingly, in 1801! Edgeworth is a fantastic writer!"},{"rating":"1","title":"no Jane Austen...","review":"I read the book based on reader recommendations that equated 'Belinda' with Jane Austen's work. I had high expectations but struggled to read the book to the end. I found the writing at certain points more like an essay than a novel. Her character development seems forced, and there is little ambient description. Those interested in tracing literary associations of Jane Austen should probably read the book, but if you've read all of Austen's work and are desperately looking for something 'similar' to her style and quality, I would recommend you look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this book if you are visiting Boston any time in the near future","review":"It will be the very best visitor's guide you could read, even tho it is many years out of date. Trust me--it's timeless and beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun book that keeps their interest!","review":"After getting this at my local library for the second time, I decided to buy my own copy. It's the most requested story by my three year old and when he took it to story time at the school last week, the teacher and other kids in the class loved it! Nobody knew what a wombat was before that! I think all kids will enjoy this one. Great for further discussions on other animals that live in Australia."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fits and Works!","review":"It's the exact specifications of the product I was replacing, it fits, and now my lawnmower runs better with a new, clean filter.Amazon's packaging left a little to be desired, but the product was not damaged."},{"rating":"1","title":"after market muffler","review":"The muffler for my Stihl chainsaw was an \\"after market\\" muffler made in China, and would not fit my chainsaw without redrilling the mounting holes and other significant modifications."},{"rating":"2","title":"yeah it's pretty good","review":"hey i recently looked it up that this stuff has creatine in it, and i that's why it's so cheap because it's a cheap powder, it still does the job you will get bigger!!! but! it's less of a protein shake than a weight gainer shake...this is for those who train all day everyday..."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not waste your money","review":"i did not like this product at all i have tried every mascara out there and this was so bad i threw it away...it was really hard to remove and got all over my skin under my eyes, the ease of use was horrible and after removing it (whick took at least 5 eye makeup remover pads) it was still all over the next morning which took 2 additional pads to remove do not waste you money!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Bother","review":"This book sounded very interesting when I read the reviews. However, there's not a lot of substance once you get into it. Dozens of women are profiled (Ms. Hanson's 85 Broads) in a very superficial way. I didn't find much of anything new or interesting in any of the profiles. The jacket blurb for this book is overwritten and the book fails to deliver what's promised. Don't bother."},{"rating":"1","title":"I did not like it","review":"I had a hard time to make it past the first 10 pages, but after reading all the raving reviews I tried to stick it out and kept going for a few more pages...

Had I only studied this book, I do not think I would have passed. After reading and studying this book for a month, I was given a Cisco Press book, and I found I didn't know half of what I needed to. There are MANY things missing from this book, and they are constantly contradicting themselves. Very poor quality book. If you're studying for a Cisco test, buy a Cisco Press product. The Cisco Press book was much more clearly written, and there were few times in reading it that I was confused."},{"rating":"2","title":"Covers all you need","review":"I just walked out of my testing center a new CCNA, and I owe a lot of it to this book. After taking a course at my local training center, I spent a solid couple of weeks reviewing this book. It hits all the key objectives and material you need to know in order to pass this exam. Obviously the more hands on the better, but this book really fills in the details."},{"rating":"1","title":"Inferior product","review":"Ordered this postal scale in November to be used for Holiday mailing.

It seems they're always changing, but I won't be caught behind or too confused anymore, thanks to this easily programmable scale by Sunbeam. It covers all the different classes of postage, and makes the \\"sending mail\\" part of the office day move a whole lot quicker. Especially like the large envelope holder, which a lot of scales miss. Wish the battery would have come along though (because running for a battery doesn't save me any time).
