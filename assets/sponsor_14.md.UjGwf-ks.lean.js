It is a hard work out and it evolves around a lot of MLM.

This method is neither new or different."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't waste your time and money","review":"The book is so confusing and complicated. It will take me hours, maybe days, to read all the instructions for each move and learn the sequence. I have read many exercise books and this one is so awful. You really need the DVD for the Total Workout. The DVD costs $80 on her website. So ridiculously expensive!

The illustrations are at times confusing, as they more often illustrate poor postures rather the correct postures. It would appear that the author assumes that everyone is working at the same level of familiarity with the program. However, the argument of strengthening your core makes a lot of sense; hence, I decided to purchase the video to help me understand the moves better. The video was very helpful, though at times, the camera is not necessarily in sinc with what the trainer is trying to demonstrate.In sum, aside from the illustrations, I found the text informative and useful. Ms. Tapp's story is inspiring."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yes, there is something out there that really works.","review":"T-Tapping really works. I lost about 11 total inches in the first month.

This truly is the workout that works. I have lost over 60 inches off my body doing the T-Tapp Total Workout. The Total Workout is longer, but the basc 15-min. workout WILL give you results. I've lost weight, tons of inches, and gained strength I didn't know I had. My muscles are more defined now than they ever were with weightlifting.

The exercises are ridiculously detailed. I followed them word for word and ended up with piecing pain in my knees for three days and nights after just one try (15 minutes for one move). This woman either does something else to stay fit or has the knees of steel. After reading some of the other reviews especially the one about how people 'jumped' on anyone who had anything negative to say about this program the whole thing smells like a set up scam to me.

The exercises are explained in detail with pictures, but I find it hard to try to do them while having to look at the book frequently to make sure I am doing them correctly. I do better at watching the DVD I ordered, to learn the moves, and then duplicating them. Teresa Tapp is a very motivating personality and I would recommend people try out her plan, and reading the book first, is a great place to start before buying the DVDs.

But the results are amazing. No jumping or running, no weights, just you and your body. I've met several of the people on the website and the trainers and can honestly tell you that they have had great results. I will never be tempted to look at another diet or fitness book again.

Well...after flipping through the book it seems that they just took all the information off of the t-tapp website and put it in book form. Even the testimonials are all from the website it seems.

It's great to know what's going on underneath her signature moves, because sometimes it's hard to understand why they work so well. Don't wait too long before you try these exercises.

The form clarification I got from the book was such a help to me in using correct form during the DVD. I wasn't using proper form at first, that's why my results were minimal.

They were very narrow in the toe area and just didn't feel comfortable. They slipped on my heel when I walked but appeared to be the correct size as far as where my toe came in the shoe. I would not recommend these shoes to anyone. They were rather clunky looking on my feet and a really poor fit. I threw them out."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too little information; very small book for the price!","review":"For the price I figured I would get at least 200 pages of great interventions, not so. I got 165 pages (more or less) of stories, and humane philosophies about the chronically mentally ill. The key points found at the end of the chapter would be droll to the seasoned (over one year) therapist. It's an okay reader for the truly green. Authors could have done a much better job. Insight oriented therapy is extremely limited in this population, but was everywhere throughout the book.For someone looking for new and profound interventions and deeper thoughts, save your eighty some bucks for a couple of different therapy planners, or an on-line solution oriented course. Very disappointed in the content and the slim amount of reading. The steep and unfounded price left it with 2 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting but sometimes pedantic","review":"Interesting book that explores the ecologically unique world of the Klamath Mountains of northern California and southern Oregon. Author travels from one ecosystem to the next and moves from one taxon to another while exploring evolutionary theory. Wallace also discusses whether Sasquatch might exist, and why humans are so fascinated with the idea. Tone is rather pedantic at times. Sometimes one wonders how many of the ideas and theories expounded here are fairly well accepted in current (i.e. 1983) evolutionary thought, and how many are strictly those of the author's. However, he makes a good case for most of the ideas and seems to know his subject well. Overall an interesting read that makes you want to explore the area on your own...while looking over your shoulder for Sasquatch"},{"rating":"1","title":"Poorly explored book","review":"The book has a brief introduction in anatomy, physiology and surgical approaches for dealing with nasal bleeding.

The only criticism from this dermatopathologist is the lack of inclusion of the rarer dermatoses (some of which are not all that rare and of quite some significance, e.g. Langerhan's cell histiocytoses). However, such an inclusion would likely make the text too long and distract from actually reading and enjoying the book as it should be.

The strategies offered for avoiding long lines at the theme parks are spot-on. The book also gives descriptions and ratings of every ride and attraction at each park. The descriptions are almost too detailed (if you want any surprises) and their ratings are sometimes a bit generous. Still, the material is quite helpful in deciding which rides to make sure you see and what can be skipped if time is short.All in all this is an excellent book that was extremely helpful to me on my trips to Orlando.

I am at the edge of good radio reception and am on a satellite TV system. Consequently, this little radio doesn't always produce a clear audio output and, even with the full 8 second delay, I still have a lag between the announced play and its appearance on my TV screen. To be a useful radio for the rural sports fan, it needs a better antenna, tuner, and rf amp section and at least a 10 second maximum delay. Its better than nothing here in the Colorado outback, but still far from what I was hoping to get."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not enough delay","review":"I saw the disclaimer that said that there may not be enough delay in some instances.

If I could get about 5 to 8 more seconds delay I think it would work.

Talisse's Dewey is not the real, historical Dewey, but instead a prop set up to engage certain more recent issues in terms of categories and concerns foreign to Dewey's own work. Some of what the author says is interesting enough, but it serves as an introduction to Talisse, not Dewey. Persons wanting illuminating introductions and overviews of Dewey's philosophy should turn instead to those by, for example, Bernstein, Boisvert, Campbell, Stuhr (available in audiotape also), and Westbrook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dewey without context","review":"This book indeed is short and simple. The problem is that it is too simple--i.e., simplifying--and that it treats Dewey out of context and pretends that Dewey was somehow engaged in the kinds of things that now occupy professional philosophers who study so-called deliberative democracy, worry about neutrality and communitarianism, and believe they are constructing logically compelling arguments. This book does not really grasp Dewey's central understanding of the nature of experience, his commitment to experimentalism, and the interrelations between that experimentalism and democratic societies. In effect, this book is 'Dewey for Dummies.' Fine, but if you are not a dummy, you would do well either to read more Dewey or to read any number of the fine studies and analyses of Dewey's work by contemporary writers such as Alexander, Boisvert, Campbell, Dldridge, Hickman, Rockefeller, Sleeper, Stuhr, Sullivan, or Westbrook."},{"rating":"1","title":"WARNING.

I bought it to replace a 40-year old Bendix unit on a 1960's classic British car. HUGE mistake! It ran fine for about 50 miles and then failed, leaving the car stranded.

This is a very simple application, with the carb only 4 feet away and 6\\" above the tank. Well within the spec of this pump. I checked electrical and fuel connections very carefully and did not run the pump dry.The first time, I mounted the pump about level with the centerline of the tank (fuel flowed freely to the pump, as the tank was more than half full.) But it couldn't push it up the 6\\" to the carb. The second time, I mounted the pump below the tank. Fuel flowed freely through the pump both times, but didn't pump the 6\\" up to the carb.This vehicle had a second fuel pump for its Hunter gasoline heater, of very similar design except 20 years old and rusted (and not made in China). I used this pump as my sanity-check. It was in roughly the same location, and if I connected the power and fuel line to it instead, the car ran fine.

However, what we get is the opposite.Nothing seems to make sense, the motive is a mystery, how far the guy will go is an unknown, the couple's options are nil, and the times when they try to gain the upper hand don't pan out, and make even less sense.Each new turn in the film leaves you more and more desperate to figure out what in the heck is going on, just like the couple is feeling.Even when it's near the end, at the cabin, it's not over. Not until they reveal it completely does it all make sense, and even then, there's still a couple of parts that I haven't figure out yet, but it's not the kind of movie I could watch again. Not because it wasn't great; it's just one of those that I only watch once."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid thriller without gratuitous violence/sex, etc","review":"This movie is a solid thriller that has a message to it as well.

I too find it very difficult to watch a man's life systematically destroyed, no matter the motivation. It is not entertaining to me, even when well written (which this wasn't) or well acted (which this was). However, I am a fan of both Pierce Brosnan and Gerard Butler, so had to add the DVD to my collection. If you are a fan of Mr. Butler, I recommend you do not watch the commentary by the writer and director. Unflattering and snide remarks were made about Gerry's fan base, and many fans were offended - and this applies to many fans who are indeed \\"babes\\".

The mixing artist, Richard Grey, has taken 11 tracks or so and blended then PERFECTLY to create ONE peice of music. The flow is really just amazing. One climax after another. It gets better and better and you listen.Pop in the second disc, titled simply \\"Ambient CD\\". It immediately puts you in a better place.

It's the shiz."},{"rating":"1","title":"An Overrated Movie","review":"I guess for the time period of 1932 this movie was considered somewhat of a classic. I was disappointed. The movie plays loose with the facts as various characters play the rolls of Al Capone, Jim Colosimo, Johnny Torrio, Dean O'Banion, Hymie Weiss, Bugs Moran, and Machine Gun Jack McGurn. All the gangsters play their rolls to the hilt with the stereotypical cigarette dangling between their lips. I guess this movie illustrates how far movies have come since the 1930's. I enjoy James Cagney gangster movies such as \\"White Heat\\" and \\"Angels With Dirty Faces\\", but \\"Scarface\\" certainly won't have a permanent place in my library."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I Expected","review":"The idea of these toys is very cute. I thought I would buy them, sit them on my desk at work and have a conversation piece. The problem. They turn themselves off after ten minutes if you do not interact with them. I thought I could just sit them up and watch them interact with each other. I don't want to have to interact with them constantly. Besides the games really are very basic and do not hold your attention for long.

I am glad I previewed (ok, played with) them first. Some of the things these stick men do is not exactly G rated. They fart on each other, hit each other with fists and objects and then laugh as the other one falls down or crawls away, throw tantrums in their cubes, get hit in the groin and fall over...bascially you can't leave two of them alone together without a fight breaking out. One time a scantily pixeled girl popped out of a cake. While it is amazing what they can do with so few pixels, I am sending mine back. IMHO, their behavior is just too bad to be showing to small children."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly & Nonsensical","review":"This item is silly and nonsensical - and the kids love it. But as with most passive \\"toys,\\" once it is out of sight.... The toys really do interact with themselves and they do live up to their own hype of one figure entering the other figure's cube. However, the kids can watch for only so long before it becomes passe and for $20+ per set I'd rather get something that will keep them active and engaged. With TV, game consoles, portable games, and now cell phones to keep them \\"occupied\\" - this is just one more thing to put on the shelf (after the first 20 minutes)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great ideas for your home and special occassions","review":"This book is a little gem!

In addition to ideas for the home, this book offers great suggestions for effectively using ribbons in entertaining. I liked several of the ideas so much that I plan on incorporating them into my upcoming wedding! The last portion of the book gives clear, easy-to-follow instructions on how to make the bows and ribbon roses illustrated in the book.

If you think you can make a connection between your season 1 DVD with this season's DVD, don't hold your breath. It won't happen. Season 2 is a whole different show. A bad show.

The text goes quite well with the illustratons. The book is a true joy to read with the young ones, or one that the young ones like to read to them selves. Highly recommend this one and the other Franklin books in the series. This is good stuff here."},{"rating":"2","title":"Franklin's Thanksgiving","review":"This Book is one of my favorites. Franklin starts off in the beginning really upset because His grandparents couldn't make it for thanksgiving this year. It had always been a tradition for the family to get together and celebrate the holiday. So to make e Franklin happy his parents went out and invited other people in the town to come to dinner for a surprise. Not knowing Franklin invited his own people.

It was really cute and had great detailed pictures."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thankful for Franklin","review":"Thanksgiving often gets covered up with the rush for Christmas and we were looking for something to help us properly recognize this family holiday. Sharon Jennings gives us a warm story of Franklin's family that fits the bill. My 4 year old loves Franklin and this story is helping bridge the time between Halloween and Thanksgiving by giving us a family story worth sharing.The colors of fall jump off the page and engage both our children, even our 6 year old. If you enjoy Franklin you will want to add this to you child's holiday book collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deeply flawed account","review":"This book is presented as being a balanced account of thequestion of bombing in World War 2 but it is anything but.After reading the first few pages it is obvious the author believes the bombing of German and Japanese cities was immoral.As such, his defense of the bombing leaves much to be desired.A few examples:He glosses over the fact that Britain had no other means ofattacking Germany BUT by bombing until the D-Day invasion.He claims Britain should have developed a long-range fighterto allow daylight attacks but this was a problem not easily solved. The Mustang was not available until 1944 - what should they have done in the meantime?He thinks Bomber Command aircrew should have refused to flytheir missions! This is so ridiculous no comment is necessary.Finally, he compares the bombing in World War 2 to the 9/11 terrorist attacks. This is an insult to the men of the RAF and USAAF who fought and died for our freedom!I returned the book after reading that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing","review":"After reading this, I come away feeling that the writer feels that bombing places like London, Coventry, or Pearl Harbor is no big deal,but Berlin, Dresden, Hiroshima, Tokyo and the like are too pretty to bomb. He also seems to feel that atrocities committed against French, Russian, Belgium, Polish, Chinese and Phillipine civilians are not that serious. Here is an example: Germans subjected Russia to \\"cruel\\" treatment and Russia \\"unleashed a season of terror on their defeated enemies, in the form of a revenge orgy of brutality and rape\\"Balanced? Not in the least."},{"rating":"1","title":"Victor's guilt","review":"Another posturing academic who believes that American and British citizen-soldiers should have been willing to take more casualties in order to spare the peoples of Germany and Japan unnecessary suffering.

The author tries to make a case thatthe bombing of Germany and Japan was immoral but fails miserably.What were the Allies to do? Don't bomb because someone mightget hurt? This was a war that we could not afford to lose.Any and all methods HAD to be employed against the enemy.While it is true that bombing alone did not win the war,this was not known in 1943. There is no doubt that the bombingof Germany and Japan shortened the war.Whatever you think of this book, the author's attempt to equatethe bombing in World War 2 to the 9/11 attacks destroy any credibility the author may have had on the subject."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"A very disappointing effort from such a distinguished intellectual. I was expecting a hard-nosed, rigorous analysis on the order of Michael Walzer's \\"Just and Unjust Wars\\" (a work which, amazingly, does not appear in the bibliography).

Cesar Milan offers something unique to the typical teach your dog to stay with food of most of these. He teaches the psychology of dogs - you need to understand what they are understanding in order to have a peaceful coexistence in your home! We have been using many of his techniques with our two active and strong willed dogs and are enjoying them much more! We don't get the National Geographic Channel on which his show airs, so this DVD set is a great way to catch all of his episodes (commercial free!). The less than 1/2 hour episode may fool you into thinking there are quick fixes - there are not! It does take consistent work - I'm sure they edited a lot of the things he did with dogs with major problems to change their behaviors."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please watch this series","review":"I am a veterinarian and I see many behavioral problems. I have euthanized many animals that have taken control of their owners. I am also a college biology instructor and I can assure you that Cesar's methods are right on. Dogs are pack animals, all of them, from pekinese to border collie. They can never escape their genetic background as pack dominated social animals. Cesar uses that pack energy to establish order. The person who talks about pain and intimidation never watched the show. His methods are far more humane than prong collars and crates. I have used his techniques with my clients and have had great success. I thank him daily. Be the pack leader, watch this DVD"},{"rating":"2","title":"Creating the Perfect Canine Companion","review":"As with all of Cesar's DVD's and books, you can EASILY retrain your dog, ANY DOG, by retraining yourself.

Why use corrections if you can teach dogs things in a positive and non-threatening way.The Dutch association of Behavioral Therapists has officially protested against the broadcasting of Cesar's show.Cesar should watch Victoria Stilwell's show.

Hard to believe what I'd read, but these programs show the incredible power that Cesar has over dogs. He becomes a dog, and the leader of the pack, as you watch.

Can't wait to watch season 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Anyone considering getting a dog should watch this first.","review":"I had heard so much bluster about Cesar Millan that I was a little skeptical about his abilities and techniques, but I was very pleasantly surprised by what I saw on the DVD. He has an amazing touch with animals. If anything, anyone thinking about getting a dog should watch this before they make up their minds. Dogs are such complex animals (and capable of so much, good and bad!) that prospective owners must consider their responsiblities - to the dog, themselves, their families, and society at large. The shows are well done (although watching a whole bunch of them in a row can get a little repetitive), Cesar is clear with his explanations and delivers his message in a charming, positive way and is easy to understand. If anything, I wish they had been longer in length so that more detailed exploration for each of the problems could have been made. Nevertheless, a great series!"},{"rating":"1","title":"POOR QUALITY OF DISCS","review":"I was very disappointed.

Even aggression does not need to be treated with force and outdated training methods. Granted, the show is quite popular, but that doesn't mean the techniques are humane or should be done at home.The American Humane Association has written the following about his show:\\"The training tactics featured on Cesar Millan's \`Dog Whisperer' program are inhumane, outdated and improper.\\"Another excerpt about the \\"Dog Whisperer\\" TV show: \\"It also does a disservice to all the show's viewers by espousing an inaccurate message about what constitutes effective training and appropriate treatment of animals.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Terrible","review":"I was a fan of Cesar's until I bought this DVD set for a friend for Christmas.

This is a very special collection of songs that were WAY ahead of its time. If you played most of these songs for someone, and didn't tell them who it was, they would think it was a brand new song. Beat My Guest is just the best dang song. No wonder it has been covered as many times as it has. Nine Inch Nails covered \\"Physical\\" and \\"Redscab\\" two songs on this cd. Human Bondage Den is one of the greatest songs ever written. And let me tell you Mr \\"Goody Two Shoes\\" was NO Goody Two Shoes at all. He was a dirty boy! Heh heh!

The reason this set of DVDs is so cheap must be due to the mistakes made throughout. For example, there is a sequence where the narrator is describing the SBD Dauntless, arguably the most successful WWII naval dive bomber deployed by either side in the war, while continually displaying film of the SB2C Helldiver which was its (very troubled)successor. There are repeated instances where the narration describes one type of action ( a naval engagement) and illustrates with an entirely different activity (an air strike on a land base). Facts are frequently garbled. \\"By the end of 1945, the war in Europe was coming to an end.\\" May is not the end of the year. The same footage repeats over and over at different points in the narrative.

I really haven't used them in retail establishments that scan in the checks, except for the post office, and they just enter the information by hand when it doesn't scan.Of course, purchased pre-printed form checks would save time if you print these in 2 steps like I do, but doing it yourself really does save money.I have just seen on G7's website that they now offer the magnetic inkjet cartridges for HP printers.

If you are looking for a great, impossible-to-put-down political thriller, I highly recommend this book. Baer picks up all the loose ends that the 9/11 Commission ignored or dismissed and paints an alternative history of WHY 9/11 happened, not WHAT happened (i.e. he doesn't say that the WTC fell due to a controlled demolition or that the Pentagon was hit by a missile). Whether you consider Baer's explanation to be plausible or not, the book highlights the lack of understanding we still have about that day and the actors involved and their motives.

However, novel writing is a little different than non-fiction, especially when you are trying to write, based on solid experiences.This novel lacks action, it is dull, predictable, pedestrian, slow, and the charcters are wooden and un-interesting. Therefore, it is a forgettable story. I still remember the first James Bond book I read many years ago.

I called an electrician who told me the wall control was defective, and I contacted Minka Aire on March 24, 2011 online and via email, and again a few days later, with no reply whatsoever. I ended up purchasing a replacement part from my local Lamps Plus, along with new bulbs and the expense of a return visit from the electrician, which has cost me another few hundreds of dollars!

Well, in truth, they are not. Essential oils such as those contained in these products are toxic. Essential oils cause collagen breakdown in the skin, which leads to premature aging. They also are proven to cause cell death, photo-toxicity, and dermatitis, just to name a few harmful side effects of essential oils. Before I was informed of such hazards of using essential oils, I tried this line. Sure, my skin felt and looked great, but what about the hidden dangers that were going on with my skin. This product range also has a complete disregard for sun protection, which in fact is the only way to prevent aging and to retain your youthful appearance.

This DVD was a bit of a disappointment because it's a relatively mild workout when compared to some of the other Kari Anderson DVDs, such as \\"Center Floor\\" or \\"Reach\\". It lasts about 45 minutes and combines easy and intermediate pilates and yoga exercises. Though it wasn't what I expected, I think it would be a great start if you are a beginner. I would also recommend it for a \\"rest\\" day in between harder workouts because it does involve a lot of stretching, which is always good for sore muscles! Overall, I'll continue to use it, but not for when I need a higher impact workout."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Satisfied!","review":"I am not happy and although I would love to, I cannot send out a review on Burt's Bee Carrot Soap. This is the product I ordered but NOT the product I received, and I was not happy about it.

When it all boils down to it, I should have just ordered directly from Burt's Bees.

My son is 12y and he broke it 2 or 3 times, and he cannot be that strong!!!I think that the cord is too short, so the shot has a lot of power in a short distance, that's why it broke...Now I have to buy a new cord and I have to spend more money, even if I think I paid enough to have a more durable product.The corkscrew anchor is a very useful tool!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"The first time my 13 year old used it the elastic tether snapped.

It was well written, and she poured her soul into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a sweet treat for Valentine's Day","review":"While Rachel Gibson has always been one of my favortie contemporary romance novelists, this book is one to skip. The story is forced; it has no natural flow. Unlike others from her that have kept me up at night until finished, this one put me to sleep - several times before I finally completed it. Also, I read romance novels to escape the stress of a hectic worklife and the craziness of our country's current domestic and foreign policies that are destroying our international reputation and leading us to moral and financial bankruptcy. I do not want to read about a principal character using voting for the first Bush as a timeframe in her life. Please, I know the author is from Idaho, but can we skip the red state/blue state intrusion into what should be relaxing literature?"},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved this book","review":"I think this story was very touching and it really made me feel a deep connection with the characters. The best part of this book was the humor. I found myself inwardly giggling and several times bursted out in laughter.

Usually I am in agreement with the overall rating of the book but not this time.Understandably the hero has some flaws, formerly cheating on his ex-wife and completely commitment phobic...but I think it shows a true character. He previously led a very charmed life as a professional hockey player, where women habitually threw themselves at him. When he got his girlfriend pregnant, he married her and tried to make it work. It made him real to me. I think that to have his history and not come off the way he does would be unbelievable.What I love, what I love about Rachel Gibson books is the humor. She is an enjoyable read and this is no exception. It's a great read for the beach or on a lazy day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just to second many other reviewers....","review":"I sure hope Ms. Gibson (and other authors) read these reviews, and realize some major mistakes were made in this book so that they do not happen again. Others have stated them very well, so I will just add my support - adultery is never sexy, most of us don't like the fu manchu (or at least reading about it over and over ad nauseum) and terrible editing makes a terrible impression on the reader. It's a good thing this is not Gibson's first novel, or many of us might not bother reading her again. Luckily for us all, we know she can do much better, so she will get away with this less-than-stellar addition to her body of work. And I will go re-read \\"True Confessions\\" so that TwVD is not my last memory of Gospel."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT","review":"I loved this book! Rachel Gibson is one of MY favorite contemporary romance novel authors. I usually finish her books in 2 days. I highly recommend any of her books. NONE have disappointed me. The only disappointment is the libraries don't have enough variety of her books!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great book by Ms. Gibson","review":"I love anything by Rachel Gibson and this book is no different. Loved the story between Kate and Rob as I do with all of the main characters in Rachel Gibson's books. The only thing I don't like is that the stories have to end."},{"rating":"1","title":"an ok book, not much there","review":"I agree with the criticisms posted on this site. There wasn't much to the book -- the hero wasn't too likeable, and the heroine didn't have much substance. Two things that particularly annoyed me: the Fu Manchu mustache (not only is it unattractive, but the term is horribly culturally insensitive), and the fact that the name of Dylan Taber (from True Confessions) was spelled Dillon throughout this book. Shouldn't an editor be able to fix these types of mistakes?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as sweet at it sounds","review":"I have to agree with the reader that states: this book lacks the heart and emotion that her other books have, though I must say even after reading some of Mrs. Gibson's other books, none of them hold a flame to \\"Truly,Madly, Yours\\". That book, is by far, her best work, so if you're looking for a good read filled with heated chemistry, lots of heart, and a true page turner I highly recommend \\"Truly, Madly, Yours\\" as I already have in one of my other reviews. I must admit, while the fu muncha wasn't that much of a turn off for me as it was for others, the thing I couldn't get past was the disgusting 5 foot snake tatoo referred to throughout the novel a few times."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop with the facial hair!","review":"Yuck! I totally agree with the reviewers below, the FUMANCHU and the soul patch - what is going on? You think an owner of a HUMMER will have some money to buy a razor?

I'll go back to reader Gibson's earlier novels."},{"rating":"1","title":"occasionally amusing but lacks the heart and emotions","review":"if someone else had written this perhaps i would've enjoyed it better, or i should say on a lighter less thoughtful level because i wouldn't have had particular expectations going in. but Rachel Gibson can and has done much better than this in my opinion. Rob's past was very unsavory and i found myself really disliking how he opted for self-exile and self-pity over any kind of regular involvement in his daughter's life. he did see her for a chunk of time each year so it's not that he was completely awol or anything but i guess i wanted him to care more about her (Rachel Gibson's book True Confessions featured a single dad who stole my heart he was such a great father). i will say kate and rob's first sex scene was very sexy but other than that their romance didn't really hook my emotions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still A Good Read","review":"I have to put my two cents in. I almost didn't read this book because of the bad reviews, I'm glad I changed my mind! While this book is not Ms. Gibson's best, it is a worthwhile read.As to all the complaints about the fu mancho, get over it!! Is every male character suppose to be generic in looks? As to Rob's cheating, get over that as well. He's a flawed character who changed his ways. Is every hero suppose to be perfect? Sometimes characters disappoint us.Again, while this is not up to par with some Ms. Gibson's other works, it still is worth reading. I found it very enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Troouble with Valentines Dat","review":"Tommorrow my FLYERS dinally get to play and its been a long wait.

Now comes our romance with a girl that comes home to help her grandfather who lost his wife. The grocery store of course is right across the street from the sports store. Well the romance starts but the ending is a surprise.

This is her own character, for Pete's sake.There is no scene in this book memorable enough to stay in my memory. It's pretty much out flat like her previous book, \\"Daisy's Back in Town\\".

Once you have drilled a hole through the wall you push the bell wire through the hole in the bit, then pull the bit back to retrieve the wire.The pictoral instructions on the yellow plastic Dewalt sleeve the bit is packaged in demonstrate the process.The problem is THERE IS NO HOLE IN THE TIP OF THE BIT. There are no markings on the bit to indicate it actually is a Dewalt drill bit.Like many other reviewers have posted about many other products, it is questionable as to whether or not this is an actual Dewalt product, or a knockoff in a Dewalt sleeve.In any event, it's not a bellhanger bit. For the $10 I'll keep it, but caveat emptor when purchasing from BIC."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting ideas.","review":"I'm not going to be as wordy as the other reviews. I picked this up as I have a deep interest in astronomy. I learned some things, especially about the concept of quantum mechanics. I find it interesting that after having read his book, that I come to a completely different conclusion than the other, that being that there is a Creator somewhere who has set it all in motion. There are just too many coincidences for me to think otherwise.The author was able to express himself in a manner that was understandable, even when discussing difficult concepts. He didn't \\"write down\\" to the audience though, just put his words in such a way that a person could understand what he thought."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money! Watch FINDING NEVERLAND instead!","review":"Don't confuse this bare-boned \\"documentary\\" with anything you'd see on PBS.

Kevin Moore produces sounds comparible with Robert Johnson in class. Anyone who can bring tears to my eyes with his 'City Boy' deserves recognition. His song writing ability is also exceptional and almost every track is memorable. For pure guitar talent, listen to 'Am I Wrong', 'Come on in my kitchen'. For reflective blues, listen to 'Victims of comfort' and 'City Boy'. A blues classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best CD in the collection","review":"I got this CD back in 1994 and it just gets better with age. Keb' Mo' is able to mix acoustic and steel guitar with soulful pop and upbeat bluesy tunes. This CD is a must-have for anyone who has ever enjoyed a song by Robert Johnson or Taj Mahal.

Alex Webb is one of the best. The images in this book span 25 years and focus on the U.S.-Mexico border geographically but their impact is universal.Webb fills the frame with people and objects that make the viewer think and reflect about life and not just about life near the border. You will see Elvis, leather belts for sale, restaurants, the beach, a deserted bar, children playing, an elderly man on a bus, wrestlers, a father hugging his son, checker players and a wonderful image of Tijuana taken in 1999 that includes Santa Claus, the Backstreet Boys and other well known symbols of our time arranged beautifully in one image.

I purchased 8 bags, and put the remaining 7 in the trash.I have to say, also, the \\"8 oz\\" package size is the prepared weight, not like with dried pasta...so 8 ounces of this stuff goes only half as far as the real thing.If you don't mind chewing, go for it...they will taste like whatever you cook them in.

The smell is pretty bad but I could get past that; it's the fact that it would be easier to eat rubber that got to me. I tried one bite and spit it out. My husband tried it and it took him forever to chew up one bite, we threw the rest in the trash. Sounds good when you read about it, and I have a pretty tough stomach, but even this was just too much for me. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad texture and taste","review":"Granted I'm not a huge tofu fan but after reading the fabulous reviews on this site and at the Hungry Girl site, I thought I'd give it a shot. Tried them with marinara and like another reviewer said, the sauce just slid off. The texture was way too chewy--like squid. Fine if you are eating squid (which I like) but not if you want pasta. They taste nothing like pasta. Very disappointing. I will be giving my other 3 packages away. Perhaps they would be better in an Asian soup dish but they are definitely not a substitute for good old spaghetti."},{"rating":"1","title":"Delayed Delivery","review":"Gristedes forces the customer to pay for expedited shipping, yet it took me a month to get my order.

Whoever said it was like eating rubber bands was exactly on target, they are incredibly chewy and just don't taste that great either.

Afterall, I've discovered a lot of new reduced calorie options over the years that merit the trade-off. Unfortunately, these noodles were just not worth it. The texture alone kept me from wanting more than two bites. Still hopeful, I mixed them together with spaghetti sauce and grated parmesean cheese and let them sit overnight in the frig (as sometimes the flavors can make it better the second day).

I thought perhaps there was something here I hadn't yet seen, and I do have to admit that was true in a way.Nearly all of the ten minute footage consists of the Pacific Princess paddle wheel boat cruising Lake Mead. The few shots of the dam are brief, and mosty overexposed. However, we do get some nice views of people boarding the boat, sitting in deck chairs, and looking at the wildlife.

The store I purchased it from also sold the slightly smaller than average staples that it used, so I had taken their ease of access for granted. However, after moving away to college, I realised that smaller than average staples were not generally sold in college bookstores, or the average stationary store, so my poor, faithful old stapler sat unused for months until I realised I could buy the smaller staples online, a discovery we are only too happy to have made. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"Another release from the much loved Hillsong Worship team.

The Little Bugler was a hero, and this book is a winner; a modern classic for young adults."},{"rating":"1","title":"Compelling subject matter -- poorly written","review":"The subject matter is indeed compelling, but the writing of this story is extremely dull. The first rule of writing is to SHOW your reader what's happening, and if you're lucky, you'll evoke emotions in your readers and they'll grow attached to your characters. In this book, Styple tells (instead of shows) and then proceeds to tell you how to feel at the same time. There is some incredible civil war literature out there, including Cold Mountain by Charles Frazier and The Oldest Living Confederate Widow Tells All by Allan Gurganus. I recommend skipping this one, and reading another instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Pathchwork Planet","review":"This was the first book of A. Tyler's that I read.

These are just three of the unique tips I could found on Ctein's book and that made it worth its price but the whole book, from cover to cover, is superb reading material.Although the book is assembled from seemingly disconnect articles, it is an out of the ordinary collection of techniques focused on improving your darkroom work.A must for dedicated darkroom workers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent next step for experienced photo printers!","review":"Ctein's book on advanced photographic printing techniques is really excellent. It's particularly good for people who have been printing for a while and are starting to realize the limitations of their techniques and the materials. Ctein's presentation brings together lots of things most printers have noticed without recognizing their significance, and provides a firm analytical basis for understanding how your eye, the film, and the printing paper all see light. His own personal preferences are often clear, but they're stated as what they are, they do not masquerade as the only truth.The B&W illustrations are adequately reproduced, and the color plates in the back are very nicely reproduced; you can actually see the effects he's trying to demonstrate!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A darkroom technician's stream of thoughts","review":"The author has collected a number of articles he has written, many already published in various magazines over the years, and has reworked them with some new material. Since Ctein is an excellent technician, for readers who enjoy deep discussions for some of the more technical side of traditional drakroom work, the collected subject will be interesting, but this is not comprehesive in the way of a \\"how to do it\\" manual. Some parts, like the \\"this is my darkroom\\" chapter could have been omitted, but it's worthwhile on the whole. Note that this is about purely traditional photo printing techquiqes and related subjects - no digital. The author appears to have personally abandoned the subjects of this book to \\"go digital\\", based on his current output of publsihed artilces."},{"rating":"2","title":"DEAL OR NO DEAL","review":"I purchased this 4 player game & the handheld and they are both very entertaining.

I played it once and then took it back to Target.It's very lightweight plastic and it feels like you are going to break it when you have to turn the turntable 90 degrees to the next person when you are playing a multi-player game. It's difficult to turn, so you have to hold the unit with one hand, pinning the unit to the table while trying to give it just enough of a turn the right way to get it to move without breaking it.The LCD display on the unit doesn't light up, so it's very difficult to see any information on it and the display is very small and dark. They should have had it illuminated in green or something...very poorly designed. The dollar values barely light up/turn off on the gameboard and the sound effects are just plain cheesy.Don't buy this thing...it's pretty lame."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spend more & Get a better ball","review":"I just received this item today and when I attempted to inflate the ball, the included hand pump broke into pieces almost immediately! That would not have been completely tragic, except the infill 'valve' for the ball only works with the included pump, ie. you cannot use a bicycle pump or other pump. Also, assuming I could have inflated the ball to its proper pressure, the valve is such that you must try and wrangle a plug into the ball after detaching the pump without any of the air escaping-nearly impossible. To make matters worse, rather than being \\"tacky\\" to the touch (so that the it doesn't slip around) the ball is almost greasy, and left an unpleasant sort of residue on my hands.

The SH-SD65 gave me blisters across the top of my feet and from a temperature perspective, the 3 straps with more substantial side straps makes it more like a shoe with an open toe than a sandal. Therefore they aren't nearly as cool as the previous model. I recently purchased a cycling sandal from Lake (LXSDL) which is much more similar to the old Shimano sandal - extremely comfortable and no blisters after 6 rides!

My commute is short and most of my errands are 1-3 mile trips. But I liked the coolness of a sandal so much that I tried to use them on longer rides.I know so many people who swear by these things. They love them so much, they wear them year-round. I know an ultra-distance rider who wears them exclusively. How could I go wrong? I figured the redesigned upper would offer more support for long rides. It does. The problem is, the foot bed is miserably uncomfortable. It curves up steeply at mid-toe and pushes my toes backwards against their joints. After 45 minutes or so, my forefoot and toes begin to ache.

This book on the Dover School scandal, where a bunch of right-wing nutters tried to get creationism onto the curriculum under the disguise of intelligent design, is a chilling example of how a few bullies can damn-near subdue an entire population. Very lightly and amusingly written, and enlightening for those of use who aren't au fait with the US Constitution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Biologic Evolution is Science, Intelligent Design is Not","review":"Marvelous narrative of one of the ongoing skirmishes in the battle between Evolution and Intelligent Design. Mr. Chapman provides a clear and eloquent account of a trial in which certain parents in a small town in Pennsylvania sued the local school board over its policies regarding the teaching of Intelligent Design in a 9th-grade science class. The trial took place in 2005, and the outcome is well known. Nonetheless, Mr. Chapman's account provides great insights into the key players, their motivations and foibles. Readers with an interest in this topic will find 40 Days and 40 Nights to be interesting, informative and insightful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty and insightful views","review":"A great read that fleshes out the colorful personalities behind the key players in the Dover trial, and in his telling this case was far more entertaining than the cornball \\"Inherit the Wind\\".

I expected the ins and outs of the courts proceedings, insted I found over 25 protagonists and antagonists in the book from PTA members, to shool board members to court officers. Chapman describes each of these characters' personalities, professions, education, family background, etc., and by the time the reader reaches the fourth protagonists the reader tends to confuse everybodys background. Tedious is the right word for it. Sorry, I thought it was going to be a legal intrigue. It was a biogrphical essay of over 25 people."},{"rating":"2","title":"fink fan","review":"love this inside view on big daddy's legacy...this is kustom kulture's history & roots and a big part of today's hot rod scene.great documentary."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Daddy deserves better","review":"This Ed Roth bio is a total miscalculation from an otherwise fine documentarian, Ron Mann.

There's plenty of action and intrigue (a fake opal and an enormous diamond are featured in the plot: almost as much greed as The Treasure of the Sierra Madre). And then there are the pesky monsters to deal with (loved Barugon's rainbow effect).

It's more so geared toward the folks who just got of the bus, but it's also nice for people who've been out here awhile to know they are not alone in the struggle.You can tell the filmmaker didn't have a lot of money, but both the picture and sound are ultra clean. Although there wasn't much B-Roll the filmmaker goes out of his way to use black and white, borders, film scratches, and titles over black to break up the interview footage and give it more zing and spice.Any one of us could have been in this documentary.

The cliche \\"You get what you pay for\\" now comes to mind. I have owned at least six different USB drives over the last three years and this is by FAR the slowest of any of these many times over. 8MB is a lot of storage, but it takes FOREVER to write large files to this drive.

So I processed a return through Amazon and I NEVER got a replacement unit. I finally emailed Amazon and they said they were going to credit my credit card, I bought the item on sale and did not want my money back I wanted a working flash drive unit which seemed to be too hard for Amazon to give me.

The Court ordered that Trudeau cease all marketing of coral calcium and expressly reserved the right to impose additional remedial measures.In June 2003, the Federal Trade Commission charged that Trudeau and others made false and unsubstantiated claims in an infomercial that coral calcium cures or treats cancer and other diseases.Anybody that says this is a good book is most likely working for Trudeau."},{"rating":"2","title":"Natural Cures","review":"Every home should have this book on the shelf or in the Kindle.

If all the 5 star reviews were real, we'd be in real trouble. Can all you people be so gullible? He is doing the same thing as the drug companies are doing, ripping you off for his capitalistic pleasure. He is not dumb,he knows how to hook and reel in his victims.

I was just curious because I saw a news report on this guy and his troubles with the law. He is a real huckster. I looked at the first twenty people who gave him five star reviews; of those twenty only two had written reviews for other books. So what are the chances those reviews are genuine? You decide. The other thing you have to watch for is how they viciously attack the negative reviews. Me thinks they complain too much!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff but can be improved","review":"Look people you are veiwing this book all wrong. Did you honestly expect anything so simple as \\"eat an apple and you're cured of everything\\"? This book has alot of good info in it that is real. Things like eating organinc foods and installing a shower filter are good pieces of info and if you think that the FDA has your best interests at heart then you need to wake up. Look at things like Vioxx and Celebrex and come back and tell me that the FDA is all good. However since nothing is perfect there are a few things i would improve upon with this book. It can get a bit annoying that he refers to his website every other sentence. Perhaps if a free 2-week trial membership was included in the purchase price of the book or something like that. Bottom line is this. This is a good starter book if you are interested in living a healthier lifestyle."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"Most worthless book...ever.

I like the fact that he gets down on a level everyone can understand. I must admit I have tried reading certain books in this category and they went way over my head going on and on about all the scientific aspect of how they came up with their conclusions. I hope the doctors of this country take this book to heart and start reaching to get an understanding of a broader way to help people. With this book I think we could see a turning point and the doctors of the next generations will be doctors with an alternative approach."},{"rating":"1","title":".","review":"Cancer will never be cured because too many people make profits from cancer research.If this has shocked you this book is worth the read but those of us who wear tin foil hats can live without it. The funny thing is, the last half of the book is a lot like the diet books Trudeau spent the first half arguing against."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing to believe in this book","review":"I guess it is unwise to trust the star rating in Amazon. This book is just trash yet it has a high star rating. The book is mostly a continuous rant about some international conspiracy against natural cures. But every time I checked independent sources Trudeau was wrong. By page 100 the lies and exaggerations got so bad they were humorous. This book is only good for a laugh at silly ideas and notions and an education on how someone can tell one lie after another. I think the author could likely be classified as a pathological lier."},{"rating":"2","title":"Use the things in the book!","review":"The book lead me to a naturopath doctor and I am glad I read it. This doctor added much more to my visit, he really talked to me and didn't just ask a couple of questions and give me some pills. I was kinda surprised when he talked about my attitude and stress and how that needed some help to really get better and stay better just like in the book. The doc put me on a cleansing program like the book says because I work around a lot of chemicals and have for way too long. Now I thinking about a early retirement just to get away from it and try to make sure I live longer than a lot of the guys I've seen get really sick before they retire. Try one of these doctors out."},{"rating":"1","title":"False Advertising!","review":"I ordered this because it is advertised as a book about natural cures. All kinds of ailments are talked about in the advertisement. NOT ONE CURE IS IN THIS BOOK. NOT ONE. The guy must love to hear himself talk because for hundreds of pages all you read about is how smart he is and how he figured out BIG SECRETS but if he actually tells you --you know, as advertised-- he will be killed or something. It's very dramatic, and totally not useful. I am amazed this book has over 1000 positive reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Over the top - but good information","review":"I think the author goes a bit over the top trying to convince you that he has no agenda but to bring the truth to the world - he spends way top much time early in the book repeating the same thing over and over - the medical industry is all about the money (greed) and he is mad and going to do something about it. Get past his sanctimonious sounding early preaching and the information seems to be accurate and well presented. I think I will benefit from reading this book in the long run"},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive Advertising","review":"My niece purchased this book expecting it to guide her in making choices leading to a healthy lifestyle. What lies between the covers does not align with the promises from its author. The television informational promoting the book leads the viewer to believe it reveals useful alternatives to drugs and other medical treatments. There are no suggestions for the average person who does not want to resort to excessive high colonics and other well-known, but outlandish, treatments. I advised my niece to return the book and seek a refund because she had been duped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fraud and misleading public","review":"I bought the book, didn't find any thing helpful.

That's what Kevin says in his book several times. Yes, I agree, it's all about the money for Kevin!! This book is a scam.

Although I do agree that the state of our health as a country, is largely due to the products allowed into our food, water, air, medications, etc., the book fails to give any \\"cures\\". I'm so mad I wasted my time reading it, that it prompted me to write my first review. I read at least one book a week and I've never been so disappointed with a \\"best seller\\"!!

In many ways your responsible, don't depend 100% on anyone but yourself..then seek assistance for health care providers.

Sounds quite fishy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the free shipping","review":"This book isn't worth the Super Saver free shipping Amazon has to offer. Save that for other items. While I agree that the FDA and drug companies aren't telling us the whole story and only care about the money, Trudeau's book doesn't do much more than tell us that over and over. With every natural cure he mentions, he also refers to his pay-to-join website to get the details, or even a brand name for distilled water and vitamins! I did find some seemingly helpful suggestions, but overall, I felt ripped off. I suggest finding this information elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"lots of hype, where's the proof?","review":"A friend gave me this book to review, and unfortunately, I can't say a lot of good things about it.

For example, supermarkets- bad for you. Vitamins- bad for you. Tap water- bad for you. Electrical appliances- bad for you. Air conditioning- bad for you. Showers- bad for you. Deodorant- bad for you.

Can you believe that? I thought we had freedom of speech in the country.It makes me sad to read reviews from people who have limited ideas or no real solutions on what to do. We need to open our minds and hearts to changes. This book helps that - sometimes things have to be said over and over again to have them sink in.

You'll discover that he is a convicted felon who spent time in prison and has bought his way out of lots of trouble with through assorted settlements.

Notice changes in commercials? Notice articles in the paper... more drugs being pulled from the market after discovering how dangerous they are, hospitals closing due to abuse?

That is a lie. As long as you have a disclaimer, you can - and other books do.The author writes many stories about things that have happened to try to support his conspiracy theories, but provides NO footnotes or references. I have emailed him and his website about this but nobody will respond to me.The only thing he really says in the book is that you should eat healthy (which everybody knows) and eat organic food.

If it actually contained what it claimed (natural and easily available cures to diabetes, high blood pressure, cancer, and heart disease to name a few) it would certainly be worth $30. Unfortunately, it contains ZERO information you can't cut and paste from the internet. As a matter of fact, this scam is a classic. He keeps referring you back to his website (I signed up to see) which contains ineffectual or actually DANGEROUS remedies for these afflictions.

I suppose retailers can wait until the courts determine whether to add another felony to Mr. Trudeau's record, or to impose an injunction, or they can act in the interests of their customers by posting a \\"Black Box Warning\\".

If you're patient enough to wade through way too many rants against the government and big biz, you'll find some ideas that might help you become healthier. This book probably could've been written in 100 pages or less if Trudeau had stuck to the title's subject matter. Instead, it reads like the infomercial from hell.The reason I give it a 2-star rating is because there actually are some good ideas. Unfortunately, he doesn't cite any clinical medical studies to back up his opinions. There's not even an index in the back of the book. Trudeau also charges a pretty hefty fee on his web site while hiding behind the FTC in order to get what you thought you were going to get when you bought the book in the first place. Grrrrrrhhhhhh!

Trudeau offers none of the cures within-you have to join his online club to get them-because \\"they\\" won't let him publish them in book form. From nauseating grammar and sentence construction to ridiculous blanket statements without a shred of supporting evidence to an eonic list of Howard Hughes-esque/Bubble-Boy preventive measures to stay healthy, you can't escape the feeling of simply being had; and since the type of reader purchasing this book may very well have health concerns and problems, Trudeau's irresponsible and overpriced \\"book\\" borders on something criminal."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is all about the money","review":"You expect to get some useful health information.

You would think by the title that there would be a list of cures \\"they\\" don't want you to know about. There is no such list.

Once you do that, you'll find that there is still NO SUCH LIST. That section is \\"under construction\\". Who's the most corrupt here - the government or Trudeau?! On his site, Trudeau promises to personally respond to emails, but I have yet to receive any ackowledgement to my complaint. According to an automated response, he is temporarily away and unable to respond for a few weeks.

I spent about 10 minutes browsing through this book before I realized it was worthless and I had been ripped off and I repacked it, returned it and got my money back. It took about a month to get my money back. And I had to call them several times and bother them. Here is the whole book in few sentences. You've probably heard this before. The pharmaceutical companies are all conspiring together to supress natural and alternative medicine. Which may very well be true.

On top of that it educates you about why more of these things are not broadly accepted in the medical community. The main thing is doctors are not taught about anything but cutting and giving pills.

All the author does in this book is recycle the material he uses in his television \\"infomercial.\\" The infomercial suggests that the book will disclose many facts about natural remedies that the author is prevented by law from discussing on television. However, the book itself actually functions only as a kind of infomercial for the author's web site. At the web site, the reader is invited to become a member of some kind (for a fee!). Only then (we are led to believe) will any \\"cures\\" be revealed. It is plain that the whole affair is a hoax. The author is a fraud. This is snake-oil. I'm very sorry I wasted money on this piece of crap (which will soon be in my trash bin). Kevin Trudeau tells us virtually nothing valid about natural cures in this book that most of us did not already know."},{"rating":"1","title":"a scam","review":"the book goes on and on about Corperate and Government Conspiracy theories and then spends a small portion of the book on natural cures that we all alread know about, for instance his natural cure for weight loss is basically to stop eating so much and to drink Apple Cider Viniger ( I noticed he listed that as a natural cure for many other things ).If you are someone truely interested in natural cures doing a search in google will bring you much more and better results then this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kevin Trudeau is a Fraud","review":"This guy copped a plea with the Federal Trade Commission, and as a result of a history of misleading infomercials, the FTC decreed the following:Trudeau cannot make disease or health benefits claims for any type of product, service, or program in any advertising, including print, radio, Internet, television, and direct mail solicitations, regardless of the format and duration.And Trudeau ADMITTED to this, and paid a $2,000,000 fine. He is a FRAUD, and anyone who gives him money by buying his book is being duped."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very VERY Odd.....","review":"I Find it Very Odd how all these 5-Star Positive Reviews where written in the same day. I wish I had access to the actual times they were posted to see how close together they were done. I looked at this book's reviews just last month and almost everyone said to avoid it and don't waste Your Money. But today I look and almost all the Reviews are 5-Star and posted on the same day. You know what, I'm not buying it... in more ways than one. Here's a Hint, just click on the name of Every Reviewer that just gave it a 5-Star Rating in the last day and You will find that they all have one thing in common... this is the ONLY Book they have Reviewed - ever! It leaves Me to Strongly Believe that this mass of recent reviews is Totally Bogus, and I wouldn't be surprised it they all originated from the exact same IP Address. Think about it, and don't be a fool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Risibly bad","review":"A few weeks ago I briefly browsed this book while killing time in a bookstore. At one point the author describes an experiment carried out by some \\"researchers\\" where they determined the structure of a sample of DNA changed with the mood of said researchers. Of course, no references are given. As a doctoral candidate in chemistry I found this claim not only absurd, but offensive. The fact that this book has received any good reviews at all reflects the poor state of scientific literacy in this country. Do yourself a favor and stay away from this drivel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I read this book from cover to cover. He repeated himself so many times that it was getting obnoxious - what was he repeating? The fact that corporate america is out to take our money and make us unhealthy. In his book, he does not reveal any names of products or describes exactly how to do any of the systems he recommend - you need to go to his website. Once in the website, you need to pay for a membership of 120 a year. What a crock - save your money for this book and go see a doctor."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIP OFF! Do not buy!","review":"In short: this writer claims that this book will tell the reader natural remedies for various ailments (including cancer), when in fact all it does is apologize & claims that the FDA FORCES him to omit the info in this book. However, if you would like to subscribe to his on-line webzine for \\"x\\" dollars more *per month*, he promises to share it with you.I was never SO angry regarding the lack of content from a book in my life."},{"rating":"1","title":"How to get rich off of suckers","review":"Unfortunatily one of my dear friends was suckered into purchasing this ripoff of a book. He has cancer and thought that he might as well give this book a chance, once he was done with the book he was outraged that he spent money on a book that did not even give answers to the small questions. My interest was piqued and I decided to read this trash. After reading it I have decided that Kevin Trudeau is this centuries newest snake oil salesman. He will trick you while taking your money and laughing all of the way. The few secrets he does tell are either common sense or old facts. A waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Got bit on this one","review":"I am not a fan of big drug companies, FTC and the FDA, but boy did I get taken by this man Kevin Trudeau. I bought the book on CD's and listened to Kevin bitch for about 15 hours promising to get to the real information only to tell me in the last chapter that if he told me the truth he would go to jail and lose every thing he owned. He is the deceitful one here pretending to be selling information on natural cures and then delivering nothing but hot air. $54.00 wasted, no wonder he is the target of the FDA."},{"rating":"1","title":"Something like this should not be legal","review":"The amount of useful information on this book is probably 10 pages, and most likely you already know this information. This is a $30 dollars infomercial, it won't tell you anything unless you pay more money.There is a trend nowadays about living healthy, eating organic, exercising and so on. This is good and there is a lot of good info our there about it, but unfortunately it also spawns con artists like Trudeau that just want your money, and then they want more...Disgusting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book","review":"I can't believe how much information this author packs into this book. There's a lot of stuff that I could definitely do without, but overall there is so much good information here that I totally agree with. I was looking for a new book that would encourage me to do more healthy things and this is it. There's a lot to read and a lot to do, but it's well worth the time and can be taken one step at a time to full accomplishment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of Money","review":"Don't buy this book! It promises the world, but delivers nothing specific. It mainly directs you to a website where you pay a monthly fee to search for the answers you had hoped the book would provide. Rip off!

I love Your Miracle Brain."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Pores are Poison Free!","review":"Kevin, like you I was active in the Junior Clowns of America Organization, from the time I was 13 years old until I was 19. I work as a full time floor manager at our local Target now, but still moonlight as a clown at kids birthday parties on weekends. The chapter in your Natural Cures book about how the skin is our largest organ and we should never put anything on our skin that we would not eat or drink has made me re-evaluate using all the face paint and colored makeup that I used to use as a clown. I'm guessing that even though you were a former President of the Junior Clowns of America, you no longer put on the old clownface! When I clown around for kids now, I just use gag wigs and rubber noses, but no poisonous color dyed makeup. Thanks for opening my eyes.p.s. I'm always looking for new tips on clowning, so if you have any, please throw them my way;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is helpful ONLY if you know nothing about healthy living.","review":"I thankfully didn't purchase it but got it at the library. It was full of nothing new, and the promised title was never delivered because after forcing myself to read the entire book, I found nothing I didn't already know or of which I hadn't already heard. Nothing in the book told me anything that I could not find on the internet and in fact hadn't found already! And as all the other reviews said, you get no cures unless you become a prescriber,which I refused to do because Kevin already didn't come through with one promise so how can I expect him to do it again?One caveat though, this book may help someone who has no idea about how to live a healthy life. There is some good very basic information in the book about eating and exercising. If you truly have no clue, then get the book at your local lending library and read it and then go do internet research for what looks good to you."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rating should be -5","review":"This book is a bigger scam and rip off than all the drug companies, Quacks, and FDA combined. As noted by many of the other reviews this book mainly tells you that you have to check his web-site for the information you want. Once at the web-site you discover you have to sign up with your credit card at $9.95 per month, or $450. for a lifetime membership. If you make the mistake of joining this scam be careful. You might notice there is no mention of how to cancel this \\"membership\\" if you don't find it helpful. That is because there isn't anyway to cancel short of canceling your credit card. The web-site is another run around and scan just like the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money, he is full of it!","review":"This guy is nothing but a con artist. This book is the biggest piece of junk I have ever seen. There are about 10 pages of useful information in it. How does a convicted felon/car salesman know anything about \\"Natural Cures\\"?Save your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't judge a book by it's cover","review":"I was very disappointed in this book. The author spoke about exposing all and making cures known....Sure if you want to buy all the items he spoke about.I got the impression from all his promotions that he revealed it all in his book, I feel like I wasted my money buying it."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"NO\\" Natural Cures","review":"I purchased this book and soon returned it for a full refund---from a Wholesale House...Why---because there are no natural cures in this book unless you go to K.T.'s website and plunk down another wad of cash...There are so many things in this book I would not do...one example--given the times we live in--I would not go out without a sunscreen or sunglasses..Melanoma is on the uprise and Sunglasses with a UV rating have been shown to help to prevent Cataracts...Some of his notions are costly mistakes, so buyer beware...When in doubt use a search engine to read all that you can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"Trudeau gives readers a choice - they can give their money to corporate interests who only have profits in mind, or they can give it to Kevin Trudeau who obviously shares that motive. What Trudeau doles out in this book is either nothing new or is shaky pseudo-science at best. How he believes he is any better than the entities he decries is beyond me.This book is written in the style of those full page ads in newspapers taken out by crazed conspiracy theorists. It is a vanity publication in which you will find no table of contents, index, etc - just disorganized ramblings and the promise that, if you send him more money, he will finally sell you what he has promised to tell you in this book.As P.T. Barnum said, \\"There's a sucker born every minute.\\" Trudeau plans on cashing in on every one of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Natural Cures...that Scientology will provide!","review":"This book is quite literally just an advertisement for several different organizations. Nothing is addressed directly, and a listed \\"cure\\" for just about everything in it is to take up Scientology or Dianetics. I didn't know that Kevin Trudeau was a Scientologist, but apparently, clearing your body of thatens will not only cure cancer, but help you lose weight and think straight as well! This book is a joke. Don't buy it, unless you want to laugh."},{"rating":"2","title":"Natural cures are not magic bullets...","review":"While Trudeau may come off as a zealot, most critics miss his main point: that health is a function of our individual awareness and requires discipline in avoiding the toxins and stress that cause illness, and that these vary by individual. His \\"natural cures\\" are not like the instant \\"take a pill,\\" \\"have an operation,\\" solutions doctors define their practices on and that, in turn, end up causing damage longer term. The natural cures process takes time, and requires multiple approaches suited to the individual, because the sources of illness are multiple and specific to each person. When was the last time your medical doctor asked about your lifestyle, diet, habits and environment in treating you? If you believe there are instant magical cures, this book is not for you. If you want to expand your awareness of what you and your environment are subjecting your body to--and what to do about it--read with an open mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Insight into forces preventing the elimination of disease.","review":"Yes, this book definitely explains and demonstrates the principles and forces that are preventing the elimination disease, and the promotion of good health and prosperity for the general population. Even though the detail knowledge \\"cures\\" are not included they can be found all over the Internet if you search on the correct terms. This site http://www.intelegen.com/nutrients/index.htm is a good place to start if you're looking for detail and supporting research that you can provide doctors. They do not sell vitamins."},{"rating":"1","title":"KEVIN TRUDEAU GIVES HIMSELF 4 OR 5 STARS!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"This book is a fraud and a travesty and I suggest notbuying it if you are looking for cures or practical helplike the infomercial suggests it would.That's my opinionand you can take it as you like.If you want to hear rants about the FCC or FDA thenby all means buy it.With that being said,I feel that the reviewswritten by \\"E.Z.\\" and \\"Donna Isaac\\" are fake andfraudulent like the book and probably writtenby Trudeau or his croniesTHAT GOES FOR ALL THE 4 OR 5 STAR REVIEWS,ITHINK THEY WERE ALL WRITTEN BY TRUDEAU!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Worthless book, no information inside","review":"This book contains no information.

Big mistake on my part and I almost got stuck paying for a \\"free trial\\" newsletter as well as this ridiculous book. A lesson learned there!!I read a lot of health related books and how-to books. A third grader would write better than this guy. Incomplete thoughts and poor writing skills. And to top that off - no really useful info - I gave away the books. If you want to read it - I suggest that you go to a library and look through it first before you spend any money on it.Thank goodness for Amazon and these reviews - now I never buy a book without reading some of the best reviews and some of the worst reviews of each book so that I can get an overall picture of it before I buy. So far I've been happy with all my purchases here."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kevin's book is just another giant advertisement","review":"How silly of me not to have come and read all these reviews before I bought the book. Luckily for me the only refund they accept is on the book and I'm going to send it right back. At least I'll get $20 back. All he did was advertise a website that one must pay to get into to see any of these cures. He's so full of it and I'm ashamed that I fell for it without investigating first.The best thing would be for someone with the money to sign up temporarily on to the website, copy all the so called cures, purifiers, cleanse solutions, etc. and post them free for everyone else to see.I can bet that I've already read them in many of my other web searches or health books that I've previously purchased.Thanks to all who put a warning review. I have to agree. Kevin's book is a waste of time and money.Wish I'd thought about it first :o)Ciao all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive - False - Quackery","review":"This is a terrible book that has no redeeming merit whatsoever. It is aimed at the gullible who are looking for information about natural remedies. There aren't any in this book. Kevin Trudeau is charlatan who has been fined multiple times for false advertising and this book is a vivid example. It is filled with red flags and he repeatedly states that he has been charged and directed not to name names of products. This alone should be enough to convince the reader that the contents of the book are without any merit and quite probably false. At the base this book is simply a pitch for all of his products -- whatever they are - -but he constantly warns the reader to not buy any product manufactured by any reputable manfacturer. Only products that he (sells) recommends are valuable. There is not one fact or one ounce of truth in this entire book. This guy is a crook."},{"rating":"1","title":"Snake Oil salesman","review":"I guess it should be titled What you dont want to know about natural cures.

I never realized how much better they were. I have more energy and I can tell my body assimilates them better.

It is very illuminating."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thank You Kevin!","review":"Hi Everybody, I'm just writing in to tell you how pleased I am with this book.

Mr. Trudeau claims the media is in the pocket of both the medical and pharmecutical industry, resulting in supression of natural cures evidence.

Mr. Trudeau cites Decca records passing on the Beatles as proof that doctors don't know what they're doing.

Now I'm ready to yell it at the top of my lungs. I was absolutely appalled by the information that I read in this book. I knew that cigarette companies put a huge number of chemicals in their products to help cause addiction, but I had no idea that some food companies did the same things. These chemicals are very harmful to us. How can this be allowed? No wonder I feel sick after I eat and most of the time I'm not hungry and have no appetite. It's because my body does not want what I'm feeding it. It's poison, not nutrition. And that's just part of it. I could go on and on, but I think everyone should read this for themselves.I would suggest that anyone who is feeling ill should read this book over and over again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful Book","review":"I am very impressed with Kevin Trudeau. He certainly shows passion for what he believes in. It appears that he has battled a lot to get this information out to us.

Most of this book repetitively bashes the FDA, pharmaceutical companies and the medical community and only provides vague information regarding maintaining and regaining health. He lures his reader in to ultimately purchase a lifetime membership to his websitefor a fee of $499.00. Supposedly on this website one can find out all the information that he eludes to in his book. My advise would be to spend your money of Dr. Russell Blaylock's book, \\"Health and Nutrition Secrets That Can Save Your Life\\". Dr. Blaylock goes into much detail supporting his ideas. Of course, after reading it you come to your own conclusions.

In reality, most of this book is a rant about the US government and the practices of corporations, all on the theory that you need to be put into the mindset to receive the information that you bought the book for. There is very little truly useful information in this book itself, with the real advice being either on the website or advice you could have easily pursued without needing to read the book: go to a nutritionist and pursue other avenues of holistic medicine rather than rely on synthetic drugs and surgery, where possible. You could possibly fill up a pamphlet with the truly useful information given that there are references for other places to look, other people to contact, but the rest of the 572 pages of the book are basically just a rant used as filler."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wanna be sugar free","review":"I learned a lot from this book.

However, the whole book is an advertisement to get you to go on his website which has a $10/mo or $400/life membership fee.Also, look at him. If he believed in the stuff he does, he wouldn't look like that. He wouldn't put on make up or wear deodorant or put gel or creams in his hair. Crazy guy."},{"rating":"1","title":"rip-off","review":"In order to feel as if this book was the real thing, you would have to move to the country, with no one around you for miles, no electricity, phone, and city water.

That is the way that book made me feel.And when reading the book, it would get you to a certain place and in order to understand what it was talking about, you would have to go to his web-site and pay 9.95 a month to find out what he was talking about. His web-site was mentioned in every paragraph.He is making money hand over fist on our ignorance. Any one who buys into this deserves to lose their hard earned cash.

And then when I tried to load the website with the login NOTHING came up.I am SO disappointed and I hate to think of others that are not feeling well such as myself and get taken in by this book.

The tone of the author is rather insulting to anyone of average intelligence - his point is repeated in simple terms to ensure that the reader 'gets it'. This book attempts to do to the entire food industry what 'Fast Food Nation' did to the fast food restaurant chain.

I'm sure there's some truth to his claims about the various agencies, however, when he keeps saying \\"it's all about the money\\" it's abundantly clear that it's all about the money for him, as well. He isn't offering anything in the way of clear information about cures - he's trying to sell more of his products. Very sneaky way to promote all of his own stuff.

You have to pay almost $10 a month to become a member of his website to get that information. He makes an excuse that if he put his claims in the book the FDA would take action and seize all the books, etc. One question... What would stop the FDA from shuting down the website for listing that information?It's an \\"Okay\\" book but Mr. Trudeau's actions of trying to get more money out of the reader at his website gives me the strong impression that \\"It's all about the money\\".

As the book continues, I became quite tired of his \\"whinning\\" and obvious hatred for corporations and our government. The book as it relates to his health ideas and suggestions could have been written in about 100 pages or so, The remaining was ridiculous crying and fingerpointing.

Some of his advice will kill you young, like avoiding sunscreen. This guy should thank God for the First Amendment, although he doesn't deserve the protection. Think of him as human Vioxx, and ask yourself why this thing gets only two stars even with the suspicious glowing reviews. The book directs you to his pay website.

Even if they are strange, they could all be clinically tested. Why aren't they? Well I thought I knew about quacks and crackpots, but it seems the very people that say those things - are the quacks and crackpots themselves. Now that was a lesson I'll never forget either.

Notice any similarities to Tom Cruise's rant against antidepressants and Kevin Trudeau's similar rant against them on his numerous infomercials? Maybe it's because Kevin Trudeau is a Grand Thetan in The National Church of Scientology and is funneling the billions his products achieve in sales each year to the Church of Scientology.

Don't take OTC or prescription drugs, doctors are quacks (I happen to believe most are), you need to cleanse regularly, blah, blah, blah. No, and I repeat, no substantiation is provided anywhere between the covers. Having already stolen your money for this pile of cr@p he calls a book, he continually hawks his web site where you can pay even more money to learn the \\"secrets\\" he alludes to in the book.

Along with the book I got a few outdated newsletters printed on slick paper.I was supposed to get a CD with his new book on losing weight on it for free but it never arrived. I was so disappointed with the book that I didn't care about inquiring about the missing CD.Like someone mentioned earlier, for $400 you will get full access to his website of information (useless information that is, just like his books).

Not only can it interfere with the body's absorption of vital nutrients and minerals in the digestive process, but can abrade the walls of the large intestine. Follow this half-cocked advice at your own risk."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Complete Rip-off","review":"Kevin Trudeau is a reasonably successfful scam artist.I am embarrassed to say that I paid $30.00 for the privilege of being ripped off.Obviously,I should have read the Reviews before I bought it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't buy, just read the reviews!!","review":"Well i'll admit I didn't buy this book and I haven't read it.

Kevin Trudeau has extreme and elaborate schemes to \\"make you perfect\\". However, you would have to be filthy rich to be able to afford to stay on the program he wants to put you on because noone else could afford it! I guess I am frustrated with the impossible scenarios of this book. Some of the items that he wants you to ply your body with, well educated people have never even heard of!I'd be interested to see some totally factual research of REAL PEOPLE who have followed his program to a T and see how they are doing.

He doesn't even have a Phd in Medicine, but claims to know the cures for all types of cancer. Yeah right.

The author's history (and conviction) of criminal fraud is well-documented and is so extensive and unprincipled that any product associated with him is questionable. You won't see him selling his products on tv anymore, because he's been banned for life by the FCC for making false claims and lying to his customers about the legitimacy of his \\"cures\\". Hence he's found a loophole and has turned to books to sell his products. This is an infomercial in print. There are many excellent books about alternative medicine but this is not one of them.

Everybody should read this book. Our system is corrupt, people need to know whats going on. Kevin is simply a businessman using his resources & information he has, which truly benefit the consumer, as well as benefit himself from profits made. Clever-man more like it, not con-man which was stated in other reviews. Read this book you will learn who is conning millions, rather brainwashing.

This is just the tip of the iceberg."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not convinced to read this?","review":"This book is so valuable that there is a tremendous amount of opposition to it.

The author shows a lot of experience in what he is talking about. I for one find his opinions to be spot on and I am in total agreement with them. I learned a lot from this book. You will too. Be sure to look deeper to get the real meaning of what Kevin Trudeau is talking about."},{"rating":"1","title":"An excellent resource for idiots","review":"[...]2. Really dumb people. Not to be cruel, but this book is explicitly geared to people who aren't terribly bright.

I bought the book for the cures. What a joke, this guy is the one who is bogus. He is a \\"researcher\\", All he has done is take info from other people and tell you what other books to buy to get this info. The cures he has given are easily found on the internet or by your Doctor, such as acidophilis for good intestinal health. Thats been known for many years, who does not want us to know about that? It is sold in any store in America. Anyway dont waste your money, there is nothing in this book that you cant find out for free somewhere else."},{"rating":"1","title":"The FDA and Drug Companies are not Working Together","review":"The premise of this book is based on the ide that the FDA and Big Drug companies have somehow teamed up and have created a massive conspiracy to rip people off and keep worthwhile cures off the market and/or make them cost too much.However, this is complete bunk.The FDA and Drug Companies get along like Speeders and Traffic Cops...like Dogs and Mailmen. They are diametrically opposed to each other. They are mortal enemies.Drug companies want to get treatments out to the market as quickly and cheaply as possible.The FDA wants to do extensive testing on treatments to make sure they are safe, even if this costs money and takes time.

You would think he would at least give you a free 1 week trial to the web site if you bought the book. I wish I had read the reviews first! (but I am a nice girlfriend and didn't bother!)He says that Psychogists are a waste of time and money and recomends a book, which can't be bought unless it is a \\"special order\\" and then doesn't really TELL You why you shouldn't go to them anyway. He says he isn't in it for \\"the money\\" but yet he himself admits he lives a \\"VERY NICE lifestlye\\". If it isn't about the money, then how about giving some of his money back and charging LESS for his web site or nothign at all, and put his earnings to pay \\"the cost of running the web site\\".

Some supposedly went too long without real medical intervention and it was too late for them.Really, I think if I had a love one that got duped this way and died because of this kind of dishonesty, I would find where this Kevin guy hangs out and enact brutal retribution and make him suffer dearly.I can't undertand what kind of vile, heartless soul this man must truly be to be selling these devastating lies and I can't help but think of how many otherwise good people have been duped and frightened away from medicine by him and have died because of it.I would not be surprised in the least if I pick up a paper one day and read that someone has killed him because of what he's done.No doubt though it will be because the CIA/FDA police have taken him out, right?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who cares anyway?","review":"Who cares about this book that's about curing people.

What may be more damaging are free radicals that 'get into' us by means we can't control (ie, sun exposure). Oxygen gas is also deadly; that doesn't mean we should start manufacturing portable tanks of alternative gases to breathe (not to mention that we would have to remove the considerable quantity of oxygen that exists in our bodies). Maybe instead of attempting to instill fear into the American public in a negative way (who knows the doings of the government? Is it worth speculating about? If they're up to something really awful, isn't it our collective duty as citizens to vote in fresh voices?), a more positive approach could be used...although that probably wouldn't be as profitable."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a terrible book!","review":"I am kicking myself for buying this before I read the Amazon reviews. Kevin Trudeau spends most of the book accusing different organizations of fraud and conspiracy. He writes that all prescription and non-prescription drugs are poison. Keep in mind that Mr. Trudeau is a Scientologist, and has no medical training. He blames most of the death in Americans on doctors and recommends that patients should seek holistic healers for depression, cancer, and most other ailments. There are pages and pages of newspaper headlines to lure in and scare the public. I would love to see a book where Kevin Trudeau provides proof for his accusations and recommendations."},{"rating":"1","title":"Health was not on Trudeau's mind when he wrote this book.","review":"If you hope to get valuable information about prevention of illness and preservation of health by reading this book, save your money and keep looking elsewhere. The book, most of its 500-plus pages, rambles on repetitiously about how the big corporations are purposely trying to deceive the public and poison us with their products. You will not find any useful health-preserving information in the book, nor on Trudeau's website, to which he constantly refers you in the text. Once there, you are asked to subscribe to a newsletter!There are print errors and awkward word usage such as \\"miraculous miracle\\" throughout the book. Is there such a thing as non-miraculous miracle? Some of Trudeau's pronouncements are down right erroneous. You can get far more useful information by doing your research on the web.

At best, a muddled collection cobbled together from previously published and readily available remedies and recommendations, some good, some harmless, all recycled. At worst, unsubstantiated, unreliable, and totally speculative. In any case, one thing's for sure, Kevin Trudeau definitely knows how to sucker people into buying stuff; he must be making a bundle; a self-promoter in the guise of health crusader. Apparently suckers are still being born every minute."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money!","review":"After reading the first 1/3 of this book and being told of all the toxins everybody puts in their body by taking a shower and consuming all types of FDA approved foods, I was finally given some wonderful (???) ideas of how to rid myself of these poisons, but only after going to Trudeau's website where he will give me \\"all\\" the needed insights for only [...] per month.

If one had the time (I did ) to study the things this crook offers in the book you would see how his art of the con is done.There is little info..just places to go to spend money for nothing. His claims hold as little water as a screen placed over a bowl of toxic water.Kevin Trudeau is a rip off artist..and ex con..(has done time) and has learned how to use his false face to sell pure bull to the medically ignorant and the innocent.

Please..there will be enough of these in the used book stores..Do not waste your time or your money..on this piece of trash......"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lining His Pockets With Lies","review":"Another compilation of self-serving scams from the convict, Kevin Trudeau. He manages to just barely stay within the bounds of his recent fraud conviction in this book, but it is still unsubstantiated hogwash. Conveniently, only Kevin himself can provide you with the further information and treatments that have eluded thousands of physicians and researches from hundreds of nations. Funny. It is amazing how someone can be so totally discredited professionally and legally and still sell tons of copies of the same discredited lies to a public that doesn't want to hear the inconvenient fact that there is no miracle cure.Fortunately I was able to peruse this book at the store and didn't have to shell out any cash for it. Browse it yourself before buying and see if you don't feel the same way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Help for you","review":"I don't understand why people are upset about this book. I liked it. It reminded me of all the good apple cider vinegar does. The part that had the chart for the cures was good. Some of the things he says to use I had never heard of but I am going to see what else I can read about them. If this man is really being attacked by the government agencies like he says, well all I can say is shame on them. Mr. Trudeau is just trying to help people."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Re-Directory for information","review":"What little information this book tells you about those \\"natural cures\\" are already common knowledge. It goes on and on, ad nauseum, about corruption, and very little about the cures themselves. If you want more information about certain alleged cures, the book tells you to go to certain websites, and when you get there, you have to pay. He should be paying us to read this infomercial in book form, which is basically a variation of the old \\"bait and switch.\\" You are baited, and then misled to get into his and his associates' pay-up-front websites."},{"rating":"1","title":"Money making greed!","review":"It seems that this book was only written to make money. There is no real substance or material presented anywhere in the material. Even tho this book may make you think again about our government institutions, which is a good thing, it does not bring any hard evidence forward for the atrocities that he claims they have done.My only concern is the people that he may be hurting and have stopped using their medications because of reading this book. There are some serious possibilities that people could die if they read this and try to apply its philosophy to their lives. It should be read with skepticism.I would recommend getting at the library or borrowing this book before buying."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed with infomercials","review":"This book reads just like an infomercial sounds. Some of the information sounds credible and I have encountered it elsewhere, but some does not and NONE of it is substantiated in any way. By this I mean, he does not offer collateral resources for one to verify the data he put forth. Also some of his ideas & recommendations seems a little over the top to me. The book is VERY long but the essence of the contents could have been written in 100 to 125 pages. I was disappointed overall."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much better books out there, don't line this guy's pockets!","review":"If you're really interested in alternative cures, there are many much better books out there.The grand-daddy of them all is Prescription for Nutritional Healing by James and Phyllis Balch and available right here on Amazon.Kevin Trudeau is simply an opportunist and I surely wouldn't entrust my health to him.

And as far as the website goes and this book being a big advertisement for it, well, I guess he knows exactly what he is talking about with the drug companies because he appears to be using the same tactics.

Following his natural cures i resolved a number of serious problems including cancer, heart disease, high blood pressure, high cholesterol, and worst of all, hard stools. In terms of literary value, Trudeau seems to have been influenced most by Bill O'Reilly and General Schwarzkoff. There are traces of DH Lawrence and Henry James in his prose style, but they are rather faint. I regard this book, from purely a literary standpoint, as one of the greatest to emerge in the last twenty years. It makes for riveting reading, and the characters haunt you long after you finish it. This is the kind of book that makes you really think and feel deeply. It's the kind of book you'll want to reread at least several times, cover to cover, as I have. This book is a flat-out classic, the closest to the \\"great American non-novel\\" I've ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Out of the fast food lane!","review":"I wish I could say I was the last person on earth to think that you could actually feed yourself with fast food but I know I'm not ---- there are still lines at the drive thru.

It also says for more or a description how to treat cancer, go to his website. I did that and he wants more money to give a treatment for cancer. This book spends all but one chapter talking about how corrupt the government is and it says the same thing 50 different ways.

He would have a lot more crediblility if the web site was free.....not!!!! I would recommend that you do a websearch on this man before buying.

He does the same thing!His book was a big commercial for people to sign up for more \\"information\\" on his website.

But I only found out that this book leads to his website which does not give you any more information, but asks for more money.

It made me want to do every cleanse mentioned in the book.I have gone to the trouble to find a place where I can order organic meat and yes it costs more but if you lower the portion size which we all know we should do and increase our vegetables and grains and such there is not that much difference.

Lay was aware of his work and was retired from the FDA. He acknowledged Kevins work. He probably saw an early manuscript and in any case was completely aware of Trudeau's work.

Read reviews of his other books here on Amazon too. Any legitimate information provided in this book, or any of his books, can be easily found for FREE on the Internet. The rest of anything he prints reads like an Infomercial, with pages and pages of useless talk about how the government, pharmaceutical companies and credit card companies are ripping everyone off.

Our bodies are literally dying for good nutrition. By the time our food has been genetically altered, hormones and preservatives added, flavorings added because there is none left, radiated and colored, how can there be any food left. There isn't, just toxins that continue to promote cancer in our undernourished bodies.I've decided that I am not going to be another cancer statistic.I am going to change what I eat as much as I can.

Leads me to cast doubt upon all of it - if some of it I know is wrong - why should I trust what else he has to say?He gives us the debunked b-s that AIDS is not due to HIV. Gives Peter Duesburg as source on that. That idiot has been debunked over and over.

I only read a few pages at Barnes and Noble. The critics are only half right. There are plenty of suggestions in this book. The problem is, they are incredibly stupid. Don't use deodorant. Avoid bad news from TV and newspapers. Shower in purified water. I'd rather have diabetes, asthma, and high cholestrol than do the time and money consuming things on this list. I'm fat, but I dont blame Wendy's or KFC(as Mr. Trudeau does). Other than that, Mr. Trudeau goes on with mindless rambling about how greedy pharmecutical corporations are(as if we didn't know that already). Following Mr. Trudeau's advice will lead to paranoias and phobias of all sorts. Mr Trudeau and his followers belong in the same category as David Koresh and Jonestown. I'm really scared that these people have the right to vote."},{"rating":"1","title":"Natural Cures \\"They\\" Don't Want You To Know About","review":"I bought this book hoping to find some natural cures actually written on the pages of the book.

I have been practicing alternative health for the past 20 years, and folks, it is all about common sense. Here are some of his cures for all diseases: drink water, go out in the sun, walk, eat fresh organic foods, get plenty of sleep. Now, those are the ones that most of us can agree on and are not tell-all cures. Here are some of his other cures: stop taking ALL of your prescription and non-prescription medicine, ditch your microwave, wear an electromagnetic chaos eliminator (??!!), chelation therapy, 15 colonics in 30 days, and on and on and on with the quackery. On top of all that, you have to buy into his website to get the real cures.

He never tells you the whole story though. The hook isyou need to go to the website to learn the rest of the story.The book is just a huge ad for his pay website. It's a tease.There's a reason the government has sued him so often. He acon artist.

He is spreading the word about natural health like wildfire. This is so needed. Is this the best book I have ever read? No, but you can see he has 20 years of personal experiences and he references tons of books so you know he did his own research. He has hob knobbed with the big boys who are causing all the trouble with their greed in this country. He does have a lot of first hand knowledge. He puts himself on the line to expose big crimes to the people of this country. Great book, well worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is an advertisement for the author's website","review":"I don't understand how this book is so high on the bestseller's list.

What he says is not necessarily supported by any scientific data or other quantifiable research. Most disappointing, he doesn't have enough to say to warrant a whole book. I was expecting something really helpful on natural cures. Instead, I got the same old paranoid spiel about the FDA and the medical establishment. This guy's a phony and the book is a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge leaps of faith, false claims","review":"The thesis behind this book is that the drug companies are deliberately withholding cures to many diseases, because they can make more money by keeping us sick. But Trudeau totally overlooks so many details: First, there are MULTIPLE drug companies, competing against eachother for products that sell. A cure for arthritis, cancer, etc. would make Billions for the company that developed it. Secondly, many people HAVE been cured of diseases like cancer--because of the drug companies.The book may offer some general good advice on alternative medicine--but the conspiracy claims are just a total crock."},{"rating":"1","title":"hype","review":"I would rate 0 stars if available.

The people have spoken. That is why your book has received such a low starred rating. You can fool some of the people soem of the time, as the saying has it right; but you can't full all of them all of the time.These negative reviews are not written by \\"agents\\" for the industries that you try to project your motives on; rather they're from the very same people you are trying--but failing--to dupe and take advantage of.Get a real job now and stop trying to make money by selling your worthless lies and trying to deceive us.We're on to you Kevin--you looser!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Something to learn from this book>>>>","review":"On a recent trip abroad I was so surprised how little processed food there are in other countries.

Then I talked about this concept with a friend from another country and she sent over some tips on how you can make meals from scratch just as quickly as the processed stuff. This book opened my eyes to things I need to change."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another one to read!","review":"I have read many books about health and nutrition. But there is also some thing to be said about timing. For me this book was the right thing at the right time. I had not been feeling well for some time and tried other things I knew how to do to build my immune system. Not happy with how it was going I decided to read this book and give it a try.I read about the low quality of food we have, cleansing, vitamins, water, exercise nothing new to me. Then I came to the part about Naturopath Doctors (I have been to herbalists, chiropractors and homeopathic doctors). I found one and I found out my immune systems was great I had done well on that but there were several other key areas in my body that had to be addressed to bring me up to full vibrant health.He says it over and over again in the book get a practitioner to review to the whole picture of what is going on. Glad I read the book and was able to use it to get better."},{"rating":"1","title":"More left wing ranting and raving while saying nothing.","review":"One of the worst written books I've ever picked up. The repitition \\"I'm mad as hell...\\" if taken out would make the book half the size. Inconsistant. Example \\"If man made it don't consume it\\", however, distilled water is OK.Unfortunately, the subject needs to be addressed. The FTC and FDA along with many other government agencies that abuse their powers needs to be discussed. The problems with traditional medicine and drugs needs to be addressed. The unfortunate part is that this guy is the worng messenger. He rants and raves and gives little helpful information. I found the amount of time I invested in the book to be a waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"He writes books to make money","review":"I just saw him on an infomercial selling his new book, How to Make Money. Well, we sure know how he does that, and we don't even have to buy THAT book to know that he has figured out how to make lots of money by writing books with no credentials whatsoever. It's so sad, and he makes a mockery out of people who actually do health research and who actually care about people's health.I am writing this review to prevent people from buying a book from a man who wrote a health book to make money. Don't buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Scam","review":"Although this book has moderately useful info, it is a 95% scam. The author sets up a preface that doctors and the FDA are out to get everyone and that he is a martyr putting his reputation on the line to expose them. Well naturally if you fall for the notion that everyone is corrupt, then you will fall right in line with the rest of the book which is all sensationalistic non-sense. \\"If it is that shocking, it must be true!!\\". The author even mentions in the book that he smoked for 20 years!! Are you going to believe his advice not to take vitamins,drink milk, eat non-organic food, etc., when he smoked for 20 years!!? Yah I'll not where de-oderant because it'll give me breast cancer, but I'll smoke for 20 years. This book isn't worth the paper it is printed on, and if you are one of the fools who takes this book serious, give your head a shake."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth reading","review":"Here's what I'd like to write about this book. It has conspiracy, it has crimes, it has confessions and it has some darn good ideas. Some ideas I've already tried and found them to be very helpful. It may not be perfect and sometimes I don't agree, but can you ever get 2 people to agree 100% any time?I've tried all kinds of OTHER ideas and products from other people & sources that have not worked for me. What I know is no one thing works for everbody all the time. The book is under 20 bucks and 20 bucks is not too much to pay for ONE good idea. This book has many good ideas and suggestions. Check them out with your nutritionist and get a second opinion. Try them out yourself and give them time to take effect.This book is definitelly worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Natural Cures They Don't Want you toknow about Missed the Mark","review":"Basically I looked forward to getting his book as I read lots of holistic medical reviews and books. I was extremely disappointed and did not feel it provided concrete information to substantiate any claims. Statements in it were all generalized and of no real use to me. He points fingers and smears government agencies so much and is so argumentative, that you really need to wonder if he just has an axe to grind or just uses it for publicity effect. HIs book gives many examples of areas that makes you really want to know how MS or heart problems can be cured, but he falls short in giving you any real advice. I do not recommend his book."},{"rating":"1","title":"too bad I can't give it negative stars","review":"I consider this book a dangerous affront to medical science. This book could only become a best seller in a place like America where pseudo-science like Intelligent Design is considered a rational alternative to scientific research. You can't just make stuff up and give it the same weight as something that has been extensively studied in a controlled environment.Trudeau exploits the public's general belief that Big Drug Companies are evil. His arguement that \\"They\\" don't want you to know about cures (because they would lose money) is also flawed. If widely available, \\"natural\\" cures were really better, there would no reason for Big Drug Companies to spend millions developing and marketing less functional alternatives. Shareholders would not be forgiving of such reckless and stupid behavior."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks for the ammunition!","review":"I have been seperated from my husband for several years and we tend to get along very good except on one issue...what my daughter is allowed to eat and drink. In particular, I can't seem to convince him that gatorade is actually not good for you. We've gone over it over and over again and I still find it in her lunch box after he's had her. I guess the advertising campaigns work. All these amazing athletes sweating out the same color as the gatorade they are drinking must make it a healthy drink, right? I know better, but I can't get him to understand. After reading Kevin's book I know I have the ammunition to make him see that he needs to stop giving it to her. There are many other things I don't want him to feed her, but one product at a time. I just want to raise a healthy child and this book has helped me so much in accomplishing that goal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wise Advice said again","review":"Page 169 made me laugh!

It seemed to me that that author was paranoid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Xing out the toxins","review":"Health problems are as numerous as there are people. In this book the author gives so many suggestions to help one's self naturally, that any combination chosen would make some improvement in a person's health. This could be a very good reference for the start on a road to better health. The added references to other books, is a nice bonus. I do recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Aspartame and other poisons","review":"My son used to take tons of aspartame with his coffee thinking that it was better than taking sugar.

Thanks for the warning.","review":"I, too, gave the minimal score of one point...otherwise I'd give none. Thanks to all that wrote about their experiences with this book and website. I saw the infomercial and it sounded like an interesting, informative read. When researching where to buy this book, I came to Amazon, known for one of the best websites for reviews. Thanks to those reviews, I saved myself the cost of this $30 book. I agree with others, there are tons of books out there, written by honest authors, that describe herbs and foods and their natural medicinal purposes. The Federal Trade Commission website has additional info on this guy, as it seems he has made a career as a scam artist. Fortunately he's getting caught and paying the price, but unfortunately at the consumer's loss where I doubt most could afford to throw their money away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Schyster indeed","review":"The cover of the book says it \\"includes the natural cures for more than 50 specific diseases.\\" But after 355 pages, Trudeau writes: \\"It's important to know that people who are looking for a specific cure for a specific disease are missing the point of this book.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Dangle the carrot","review":"This book is a fish hook for fools and their money.

Go do some checking on your own."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old, reliable rule of thumb:","review":"Like any great salesperson, Mr. Trudeau makes good use of many pursuasion techniques. It is very enticing to buy into a good conspiracy theory. Especially if it involves demonizing the \\"establishment\\" or \\"leading experts\\" that you may already be frustrated with, or suspicious of. Always be cautious of an old formula employed in this book: play up the readers' emotions with negative, biased, and outrageous claims against commonly trusted authorities...then point out how \\"the salvation\\" can be offered through the author's \\"inside information\\" the average Joe has no clue about, or is too stupid to care.I always follow this old rule of thumb: Be wary of any book whose (sometimes hidden) goal is to demonstrate just how special the author is."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Money","review":"I was extremely disappointed with this book.

Kevin sites spending $20,000 for a mattress. The average person can't afford it.Another thing that really ticked me off is that he makes a constant reference to his web site for further information because the FTC won't let him give the information in the book.

Buy a book written by Kenneth Cohen, Honoring the Medicine, instead.Altho' I do agree that the drug industry is corrupt I do feel that this book is a sneaky way of trying to get more money out of a consumer.

He was the REAL DEAL!I have a cancer patient who was almost killed by excessive chemotherapy which destroyed her white blood cells. She went on a natural program and is cancer free over ten years later. People say natural healing doesn't work and they point to folks like Steve McQueen..

But you can educate yourself about health issues and be skeptical of typical medical advice without buying whatever some snake oil salesman with an infomercial is selling.If you're interested in natural medicine, do some research on your own. There is plenty of reputable info on the subject written by people with real knowledge and experience. Do not risk your health because you trusted the opinions of some guy with a website and a good marketing team.I wonder how many of those people who are rating this book 5 stars are paid spammers.

However, I was referred to a web sight that can only be accessed if you pay a membership fee.This book is FRAUD!!!!!. Trudeau complains (constantly) in the book that doctors and drug companys are only out for money. He has alot of room to talk. I got ripped off for $17.00 and change plus shipping and handling, I threw the book in the trash and that's too good of a place for it.Amazon should remove this book for sale or a least add a disclaimer that says Kevin Trudeau is a rich, pompous ass out for self financial gratification and has no interest in the well being of anyone but himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fraudulent claims","review":"I encourage anybody who is fooled by Kevin Trudeau to file a complaint with the FTC.

How can intelligent readers pursue such patooee!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another Trudeau Scam on the Public","review":"I have to agree with Vincent. There is nothing of substance in this book. What cures? He won't tell you. He names a few different cleanses that he says are crucial yet he won't tell you how to make them. He just refers you to his website, where for $9.50 a month you 'might' find the answers. I have my suspicions that he'll even charge you more after you've paid the monthly fee. It's all about the money.I'm sure the FTC will be looking at him for misrepresenting the contents of this book. It's nothing more than a huge infomercial that you're paying to read. If nothing else, this book shows everyone that Kevin's cares nothing about you, your health, or your well being. All Kevin wants is your Money and you get nothing of value in return.I would rate this book 'DO NOT BUY'"},{"rating":"1","title":"an infomercial in book form","review":"I saw the infomercial on TV so I was expecting information on Natural Cures in the book.

Instead, the author filled the pages with conspiracy theories, ranting, raving, and repetition. The version I read kept mentioning that he believes there is a natural cure for everything, but he did not mention any of these natural remedies. As the others have said, he is doing exactly what he accuses the drug companies and food companies of -- trying to make even more money.

He couldnt afford all the millions of dollars in fines for fraud so they confiscated his home in Ojai, Calif. and his expensive car to help pay the fines. Read here- http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2004/09/trudeaucoral.htmYikes, im glad I didnt buy this book. The courts have banned him from infomercials unless he had a truthfull product. Somehow someway his lawyers found a loophole to make this latest TV ad. This is why the censored CD. Cause in that CD is more fraud I suppose. Since it isnt revieled on TV then he is within the law. Oh yea and the fact that that old dried up lieing prune Tammy Faye is his sidekick doesnt help his charactor any either."},{"rating":"1","title":"He probably means well...","review":"This book came highly recommended, unfortunately, I would not recommend it. While he has some worthwhile information, it is mainly a replay of the accepted wisdom in the alternative health community. He is very vocal about everything, sort of a no gray area book. For instance he thinks everyone should have colonics, or colon hydrotherapy, (enemas) which are controversial and risky at best. He spends a huge amount of time ranting about how the FDA has mistreated him, without giving specific details so that we can make our own decision about his treatment. Then of course, he repeatedly plugs his website subscription with promises of secret information he cannot print in the book. I was bored by this point and didn't bother checking his website. He appears to have good intentions but..."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a surprise","review":"I remember back in the early 90's when Kevin Trudeau was a so called memory expert and sold audio tapes. I remember clearly wanting my money back. Now Kevin Trudeau is a pseudo doctor and claims the FDA and FTC are in bed with the Food companies. Is it really a surprise, that the government is not completely forthcoming? The truth is the Health Food companies don't have to spike their own products to keep consumers overweight, because the Health Food companies also own the Snack Food companies. So they will get your money on or off a diet. That's why real dietitians tell their patients to avoid sugary and fatty foods and exercise to lose weight.

There are NO CURES in this book. Kevin Trudeau is as unscrupulous as the \\"big pharmaceutical\\" companies he talks about. He wants you give even MORE of your money to him by subscribing to his website for the cures. My guess is they are not even on it either. If he was a \\"true crusader\\" for natural health and natural cures, he'd do everything possible to give the knowledge away. He's just out to make a buck.

I could barely bring myself to read the entire thing, but I did it to satisfy my 14 year old who is just learning that not everything you read is true. I would go so far as to say that there is not even a \\"grain\\" of truth in this book. Complete and utter propaganda. Pure anecdote. Nonscientific. Bull-loney. Dangerous.

I had just read Kevin's book so I begged her to read it before she made any decision. I had been telling her for years my viewpoints on what she should do with her son, but it fell on deaf ears. After reading this book, she promised me she would not let them drug her son and she is actively seeking out natural cures and reading other books on alternative solutions.

He writes that the FTC doesn't want him to make the \\"secrets\\" public. Well, that's sort of true -- as part of an agreeement he made with the FTC, he would stop making false claims.He also fails to mention having been brought to court many times for false advertising or having been convicted for credit card fraud and a few other things.

Trudeau offers some sharp arguments, that will- guaranteed- to raise some eye-brows, but unfortunately, he offers no evidence for his outlandish claims. For instance, he says that sun block AND NOT the sun causes cancer, and it's a huge conspiracy...why? Well just because he says so...sigh.

But my major concern is saying that all these food cures diseases. There are some medical problems that require medication and no food is going to change this. You need to take this book with a grain of salt. But I do admit that eating more healthy might allow you to lessen the medication you take. Also, I didn't like the way Kevin presented his book and arguement for why you should buy his book. He claims that the government and big business is evil. Well I can't argue that. However, Kevin has made over 2 BILLION Dollars in marketing his products.

We all went for a walk after dessert and it was such a soothing, peaceful happy day.Since reading this book several months ago, I changed everything we eat and a lot of the household cleaners. We installed a shower filter and got rid of our microwave. We all try and walk every day and get a lot of sun.I can honestly say that my family is healthier and that there is a sense of peaceful well-being in our household.

Perhaps there IS something wrong with the industry as this author points out so boldly. He talks about this scam and that conspiracy and how they don't want you to know. That could all be hogwash, and that may be where he author errs, but some of his ideas are darn good and should definitely be tried."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cancer Cure? Any Cures?..Yes, Scam","review":"For those people who are raving about this book, let's make a couple of key points:1. Dr. Lay died three years ago, so he could have never read or endorsed the book. It is not possible! Something that people who rate the book, constantly mention that he did..Clearly, Kevin is a master of the Oujia board.2. The \\"cure for cancer\\" that he mentions on his shop america informercial, and says by this doctor. What he fails to mention is that doctor was a zoologist and it was some serum that was NEVER proven to cure cancer by anybody.3. That people are told to stop taking medications etc. for some serious or potential serious diseases. In the 1960's there was a high rate of people dying from Lupus. Today, as a result of medical drug treatments, more than 90% lead a normal live."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yet Another Review","review":"Over 700 reviews and most of them bad ones. Yet people continue to buy the book and then write a nasty review as if they were shocked that the book didn't deliver what some infomercial promised. This book is a top seller, which means this scam artist is living nicely on money handed to him by foolish people who deserve to lose their cash for not taking the time to read a few reviews before buying the book in the first place! Kevin Trudeau ... a man living the American Dream. I just wish I had thought of it first!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Natural cures","review":"I suppose trudeau can include himself in the (they) that doesnt want you to no about these natural cures, there are some interesting points in this book but the more you read you get to here these points over and over on a regular basis but based on trudeaus past work maybe something other than him prvented this from becomeing what it should have been it seems censored or edited"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hot Damn!","review":"I positively had to write in to thank Mr. Trudeau for helping me tremendously with what is personally a very embarassing situation. I just turned 67 last April and I'm sad to say I've suffered from ED for the last 5 years. I think most of us know what that problem is. My wife has been very understanding and I even tried Viagra for a few months. Boy did it perk things up! Until my doctor warned me that with my prior heart condition that using this medication was not without risks. So not too long ago I bought Kevin's book, and right there on page 167, staring me in the face was the answer to all my problems. Now whenever me and the wife are looking for a little Hey-Hey, all I need to do is rub the liquid inside 3 organic vitamin E capsules on my ying yang, and viola! Thank you so much Mr. Trudeau for bringing back what I feared was a closed chapter in my life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally...somebody speaks up!","review":"I think it is time that someone is blowing the whistle! I don't understand the low ratings people have given Kevin on this book. Provided you understand that he can't give specific formulas for cures -he could be prosecuted and put in prison- he does give people the information that they can use themselves to find the specific information they need for their particular ailment. That's more than anyone else has done on this subject. And yes, he is an infomercial guru who has been greedy and money-hungry in the past, but he admits his mistakes and is very upfront with these issues in his book. Have any of you readers made mistakes?..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This book is not credible","review":"I was originally taken in by Trudeau's ad on TV. I don't have much faith in the FDA, so I bought this book. The next day, however, I learned that Trudeau has been in jail in the past for fraud. Guys like him generally don't change, in my experience. They just find a new way to sucker people in and take their money. The only reason he is able to publish this book is because of freedom of speech. When I received the book, I immediately went through it looking for references. As a psychology student, I know that any credible resource will list its references so the reader will know if the claims are bogus or not. I was unable to find any references. The only thing that could have been seen as references was a list of web links in the back of the book. Don't trust this book as far as you can throw it. In fact, don't get to the point where you can throw it. :) Just save your money and don't buy the book. I've returned this piece of garbage for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Con Job Posing as a Book","review":"The author continually makes unsubstantiated statements without the slightest reference, footnote or otherwise documenting his outlandish claims. At one point he asserts that chimpanzees in the wild live 3-4 times longer than humans. He is either lying, misquoting or knows of 240+ year-old chimps that no one else knows of. The book is an expensive rambling opinion most easily expressed in a single sentence, \\"Modern medicine is bad, join my website to learn the truth.\\"What is most alarming is not simply the number of positive reviews for this worthless book but the number of reviewers who attribute negative reviews to a conspiracy of \\"paid spammers\\", \\"paid Trudeau bashers\\", \\"a certain group of people (and/or agencies?) are stooping this low...\\", etc..."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOGUS!","review":"This book is GARBAGE, and Kevin Trudeau is a world-class SLEAZEBAG.

When a customer buys a book to get something out of it, it is very disappointing to find out that you have to buy more to get the complete package. There is some info that I found helpful but when I have to pay additional $ to join and find out what exactly was done to help, that is wrong. Maybe the Publishers, FTC and others should not keep the book from print but stop Kevin from scamming money from others after the sale. Then to not have anyway of contacting the author on the website after the fact is very deceiving. I think Amazon should ban the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Scam?","review":"I didn't buy the book here, I came just to read reviews on the book. So far what I'm seeing is consistant with what I know. I should not have bought the book. I did an internet search for the book after seeing the TV ad. One site stated they no longer sold the book, as it contained misleading information. I bought it anyhow because the auction I got if from had good ratings. I went back and read those ratings after I got the book and noticed that people were not saying the book was good, just that they got the book quickly. You do have to go to Kevin's website and pay to find the info you bought the book to learn. You can find the info without paying, by just doing a simple search for natural remedies on whatever illness, condition you want to cure for FREE. Or just buy on a book on herbs. They state what each one is good for. This book was a waste of money. I am very happy that Amazon let's people review books. I hope that this will help someone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Natural rip-off","review":"I was extremely disappointed in this book. I was hoping when I got this book it would be a manual/ encyclopedia of useful information, however it was a big infomercial; Basically to go to his website and spend more money, or spend money in order to read other books by other authors that may or may not be helpful to you. Not one time was a natural cure listed, nor what to take to cure yourself. He used people's fear of being/getting sick as a way to make money. Shame on him."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've seen him on TV before...","review":"I doubt he even wrote this book. I've been him on TV before advertising the Atkins diet when it was popular and some other thing to increase memory. I guess because he has an honest face, people pay him to do commericials for them.

Buyer Beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a crock!","review":"My wife and I bought this book thinking that we would get actual natural cures, but Trudeau just wants us to spend more money at his website. What did I pay for anyway? An advertisement to come in the mail?Trudeau was hawking the Atkins diet not too long ago, I guess he found another deal that made him more money. He's a crook in my opinion. Luckily, I was able to get a refund.DON'T BUY THIS BOOK! If you want a great book, get almost any of the books by Letha Hadady.

My advice to you is DON\\"T buy this book, if you are truly interested in what he has to say it won't tell you anything other than what he had to say in the infomercial, his opinion on the government and it's agencies, skip paying for the book and simply join the website of course even then will you actually learn anything? or will you simply walk away knowing the same things that you already knew and still have to head to the doctors office the next day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keeps changing his treatments","review":"When we attended this guy's seminars three years ago, just about all his cures involved hot towels and enemas.

It also talks about many alternative methods to improve the overall quality of living, and such as cleansing methods, meditation, music, electromagnetic contamination, resources and reasons why many deseases occur and what you can do to prevent or improve your condition. Some of his principles I already knew from very reputable sources; he struck me as a sincere individual with an agenda that is very simple: He is letting you know the truth from his point of view so you can make your own after careful analysis of the things that you see, read, feel and view from other sources.C.

The book arrived!I searched for the section regarding smoking and low and behold....it sent the reader to his website where obtaining a private membership would be required to access his cure. Silly me, I thought shelling out the money for the cost of the book plus shipping and handling were the keys to his kingdom of cures.

Speaking of rip offs... the website is another ploy to get more money from the consumer. Chapter 3's title, \\"It's All About the Money\\" says it best.

I would not buy any book on wellness until we wipe all of the above first and see what happens next. Yes, I get sick from the dirty air, especially. I asked my neigbor to stop using firewood, but he refused with a middle finger sticking out. America is so set up to be sick and keep the hospitals humming full blast out.

He wants you to visit his website and give HIM your credit card # to get his advice.Read my 1st sentence! I have read blogs where people foolish enough to do so found there is NOTHING, zero contect on his website. Do Not Waste Your Time and Money Making this Con Artist richer than he is. There are other legitimate books on this topic you can buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Cures Listed","review":"All this book does is references to 100 books that are on the market that have natural remedies, without even narrowing down to one particular book for the remedy you're looking for. Just go to the bookstore and research yourself, don't pay him $30.00."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS!!!","review":"I was suckered into buying this overgrown pamphlet by the very convincing infomercial for $40+ dollars. This book preaches of the importance of buying organic, omitting refined sugars from your diet, eating fish, and other common sense tips. I was hoping for a book like the bestseller from the 90's, \\"The Doctor's Book of Home Remedies\\" which actually listed symptoms with several over-the-counter & homeopathic treatments one can try, but \\"Natural Cures..\\" is just advice for lame brains who dine on Cheetos and Frosted Flakes. This doesn't even have an index! Save your money and spend it at Whole Foods."},{"rating":"1","title":"An advertisement for his web site","review":"This book is all about the why \\"they don't want you to know\\". Whenever there is a procedure suggested you are told to buy another book or visit the author's website which is a paid site and you can not obtain any information except how to order his books and cds. I feel this is a major rip off. You even have to pay for his newletter. Would not suggest this book to anyone unless you don't mind throwing away $30."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately disappionting","review":"This is new: info-mercials in book form.I purchased the book with hopes to find \\"natural cures\\" inside. Not even close.That will teach me to buy a book without looking up its Reviews on Amazon first.Quick Summery of the book: It's all about the Money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Support this Scam","review":"This has got to be one of the best thought-out money-making scams I've seen in a while. All of the other reviews are accurate. This guy is a scam genius."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why can't I select 0 stars?","review":"This book is written poorly, repetitive, and contains absolutely no citation or references to substantiate ANY of its claims. It is completely worthless in all respects. The author claims over and over that the FDA is evil and even \\"incestuous\\" because of their desire to make humans sick and amass more money. Well, this book makes me sick, and the author will only actually give you \\"natural cures\\" if you sign up for a monthly account on his website."},{"rating":"2","title":"A tremendous help","review":"Natural Cures is a great book. I'm a voracious reader of healthier lifestyle books and found this book to be of tremendous help. I've learned so much more about how to read food package labels which makes me a smarter shopper. As pointed out in the book, the difference in an organic package product and a conventional product is vast. Nothing but chemicals and additives in what General Mills turns out! Because of Natural Cures, I feel better educated on how to feed my family and keep them healthy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Opinions not Cures","review":"I was very diappointed with this book. It was more the Authors opinion. Throughout the book he referenced his website(that cost addditional money to get the information) as well as his bashing the FDA and medical Doctors. Basically, he shares to eliminate toxins and eat pure to stay healthy. He doesn't offer any cures back by any studies and never refrences any studies. One thing he does refrernce is he had a \\"severe Mitral Valve Prolapse\\" he refers to as being a severe heart problem. 1 in a 100 people have this condition. I'm one of them. It is common and treated very easily. I think he is a man out to make money on something he knows little about. I would not buy this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth the money","review":"If you have seen the infomercial for this book you already know what is in it. Some interesting nutritional information, and a scathing review of the FDA. Mostly it is a rant against the government. The FTC and the FDA are the agencies in the bullseye. These agencies may be deserving of the criticism, but the book never gets beyond that. The evidence is repeated over and over. A pamphlet or magazine article would have covered all the information adequately. Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Old Information, Re-Marketed for the Not-So-Hip Consumer","review":"Fortunately, I borrowed the book from some other \\"Sucker\\" who actually forked out the money for Mr. Trudeau's well marketed, heavily misadvertised book...There are plenty others out there with the same message... and they aren't as greedy as Kevin Trudeau.1.http://www.makersdiet.com/2.http://www.healthmasters.com/3.http://www.drcolbert.com/Check out these websites and go read their books free at the Library or your Favorite 'Chain' Bookstore, before buying anything!Why 2 Stars?Great Poker face for Mr. Trudeauand the small amount of useful information the consumer reads from this book is as I referred to earlier...\\"Old Information\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"book is a ripoff","review":"Save your money. I spent $30 to keep reading throughout this book that Trudeau cannot tell you the information that is supposed to be in the book because \\"the government will get me\\". But, he refers you to his website where he says he will tell you the information that you bought the book for, if you pay more money. I guess the government won't bother him if he prints it on the internet. A total con-artist. Don't fall for this scam, keep your money and buy some good quality vitamins instead folks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Kevin Trudeau banned by the FTC from producing health product infomercials...","review":"Look, I didn't read the book. But, you are crazy if you give the author any of your money. Kevin Trudeau, the author, has been banned by the FTC from \\"producing, or disseminating future infomercials that advertise any type of product, service, or program to the public.\\" Check out this link on the FTC Government website, and then you decide!http://www.ftc.gov/opa/2004/09/trudeaucoral.htm\\"This ban is meant to shut down an infomercial empire that has misled American consumers for years,\\" said Lydia Parnes, Acting Director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection. \\"Other habitual false advertisers should take a lesson; mend your ways or face serious consequences.\\"If after checking out the link, you still want to buy the book, read a couple of the other reviews on the site and go for it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Undetailed","review":"Poor info and insight into the cures of disease. I felt a bit scatter brained at times feeling very overwhelmed by all the disconnected, incomplete details. At some points it would seem like each paragraph would bounce from one thing to the next, making it hard to focus and tie it all together. Even Trudeau's transitions were weak, and the book was terrible and I highly don't recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"save your money","review":"Mr. Trudeau goes on and on about how the drug companies are greedy and how they revolve around money. I just wonder how he describes himself? This book is a MINUS 5 stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cures They Don't Want You to Know & I Won't Tell Either","review":"A worthless book..doesn't rate one star..don't fall for his line..he constantly promotes his web site, but it is impossible to log into it..probably nothing worthwhile there either.,if there is anything at all..Don't waste your money..Sad, to take advantge of people, who need help, or advice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Much Ado about Nothing (in this book)","review":"As another reviewer said -- Kevin Trudeau is a great promoter. I saw the infomercial on television one (early, early) morning and bought the book as a spur-of-the-moment decision. I wish I had taken the time to read the reviews provided by other gullible souls. This book is a rip-off -- very little new information when he DOES give you information. Which is rarely. The reader is repeatedly directed to his website where you have to pay (...)/month for a subscription that promises more detail. Needless to say, I did not sign up. Fool me once. shame on you; fool me twice, shame on me. Mr. Trudeau spends 2/3 of the book trashing the food producers and medical profession for their lack of truthful reporting of side effects of additives and pharmaceuticals. However, this book is a perfect example of a broken promise. Don't waste your time or money."},{"rating":"2","title":"A path to good nutrition","review":"Veering off this way and veering off that way has always been my approach to my personal health. I would follow this fad, then that fad. This diet then that diet without very much success. Then I came across this book and lays out an excellent path to good health and nutrition. No more veering. This book replaces everything else I've ever read. Top notch writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE PAIN! MAKE IT STOP!","review":"My husband bbought the audiobook for me. What a wretched waste of time. Kevin Trudeau needs:1. Proof, evidence, something besides repeating, yelling a statement 40 time, over and over.2. An editor. The CDs never ended. The PAIN!3. A dictionary (why say \\"voila!\\" if you can't even pronounce it?) And \\"dour\\" is NOT pronounced \\"doo-er.\\"4. Integrity. Instead, he refers people to his website, where he can make even more money.Really, I started with an open mind, but this was SOOOO painful, my husband should listen to it as punishment."},{"rating":"1","title":"I should have known better.","review":"The advertising for this book is very misleading. It's full of Mr. Trudeau's rants about conspiracy with very little to substantiate his allegations. My gut feeling is that they're true, but I don't know that from any information provided in the text. The book is peppered with references to his Web site, where you have to pay to get the specifics on the \\"cures\\" not detailed in the book. Good thing I brought it used on Amazon instead of paying full price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money","review":"This book is a waste of money. I have tried to post two negative reviews but they keep getting removed. If you heard the infomercial you have heard all that he has to say in this book. There just aren't any cures that are promised. There are references to \\"natural\\" things, but frankly that info is all common knowledge. He does give lot's of advice, but anyone who has looked around under natural healing will know that. This book does not deliver what it promises in the title."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"While there is a smidgen of useful information in this book - I found it to be a rambling rehash of his problems and it seemed like everything pointed to his paysite if you wanted any real information. I do not doubt that he has had problems with the government as he promotes things that are decidely against the corporate agenda but then just write a book about that and leave this to be about natural cures. ITS NOT WORTH THE MONEY unfortunately. IMHO."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thinking for our time that's needed","review":"This book is no exception to the rule that when a person comes along and goes against the norm they are put down and called names. The funny thing is Kevin Trudeau isn't the first person to talk about natural cures, they have been going on since the beginning of time, and you would think everyone would get this book and understand what he is saying. I highly enjoyed reading this book and think is important that this classic approach to healthy living is being read by masses. Thank goodness he came along to give the movement a big push in the right direction for acceptance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Carcinogenic oils in my food.","review":"I guess I have been pretending for years not to know what goes on in the back of Mc Donald's or any other fast food chain. I do not ever think I have thought about the oil that French fries are fried in going rancid once it has been cooked. I certainly did not know they use it for days on end. I once worked for an insurance company that had Mc Donald's for a client. They were the biggest client the company had and they had several people who only handled claims for big Mc D's. There were people breaking teeth biting into a hamburger with bones in it or finding cockroaches in their hamburgers. Needless to say I have not eaten at Mc D's since hearing all that stuff years ago. Still I feel for all the people that eat there all the time. They are fat and getting fatter. Too bad our country has come to this. Read this book to find out more."},{"rating":"2","title":"Trudeau should be applauded","review":"Trudeau should be applauded for his courage to standup and say somethings about the medical field that need correcting. Have you looked at the high costs of prescription drugs lately? Now we're into getting subsidies to help pay for these drugs from the Government. Guess what? Whether it's State or Federal subsidies, we ultimatley pay for them anyway with our tax dollars. But we end up not just pay for our own medications, we pay for everyone else's as well! Is that the way things should be?Trudeau sees a system that needs to be changed and he's not afraid to say so. We all need to know what happens with all the money that we pay for drugs - it goes right into the profits of the drug companies. They don't get paid when we are well, they get paid when we are sick! Think about it. Isn't that the truth? So do they have a vested interested in seeing that we stay sick? In my book, just as in Natural Cures, this is the real truth!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pick your battles.","review":"As a single mom I must pick the battles that are worth winning with my children. Getting them to eat better has been a long hard battle. I read this book several months ago but have been working on the kids for years. I finally see real progress. My kids ask for organic carrots and apples when it comes to snacks now, instead of chips or fast foods. Read this book it can help you in many small ways."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't get this!","review":"If you plan on buying this save your money!! Go to the library and get it!

Basically the book contains complaints about drug companies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where are the promised cures?","review":"After watching the infomercial several times and then ordering and reading the book, I still don't know what natural cures are available! The promises to give people the information they need to cure themselves aren't in the book. What is the cure for cancer? Not in the book! The cure for arthritis? Not in the book. I feel as if I've been a victim of bait and switch. I doubt the newsletter they push has any helpful information, either.Oh, and the customer service email address never responded. In fact the second request for information came back as undeliverable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Deceptive reviews","review":"This book has a lot of well known cures and a few that most don't know . This books repeats itself and points too many fingers.I think instead of 571 pages it should be maybe 215 pages."},{"rating":"1","title":"a waste ...","review":"I had ordered this book a couple of years ago ... I already am aware of many natural cures and I'm always looking for mre information ... However, this book talks mostly about the agencies and their lies ... DUH ... And if you want actual info on cures you have to join the website! Come on people ... don't spend your money on this & the sequel ... do a little research... talk to other people ... most of the answers are out there for free (Ex: I learned about taking baking soda to improve the pH level in the body ... I thought it might have a positive effect for me because I have gout (too much uric acid) .. and it did help ... I got this info for free)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's the proof for these so-called cures?","review":"Natural Cures says it has cures. But to be really cure, it should be well established and proven. Where's the documented cases? It's ridicuously to say you have a cure for a disease like cancer and the government is tying to suppress the information. Stop and think: if you or someone you knew was cured of cancer by a natural, easy remedy, you'd be shouting it from the mountains and be joined by a choir of others. The whole world would have known already.The ONLY thing this book will *surely* cure you of is about 20 bucks of your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have waited.","review":"Haven't completely read book but so far am very disappointed. Way too wordy. Have also learned more about Kevin Trudeau and have learned he is not what he claims to present himself to be. Would like to send the book back personally."},{"rating":"1","title":"I want my money back!","review":"This book is very, very poorly written and the advice is so impractical as to be impossible. He spends way too much time trying to convince the reader that something is toxic or wrong, yet NEVER cites anyone else who agrees with him or anyone who has done a research study. His excuse that he might be sued if he says anything to prove his theories is just, well, laughable! If you agree with him and want to make some changes in your life, the book is very unclear on how to get started. Don't buy it! You're wasting your money!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Trudeau Is on Meth","review":"Seriously, is this wack of a quack on drugs?Just flipping thought the TV channels and quickly surfing over hsi nightly infomerical that advertises this insane diatribe fills my room with the retched, fetid odor of its bull.I can only imagine how more fetid in quality the book must truly be.Next, he'll be selling a book claiming he's found the solution to world hunger and the impending energy crisis."},{"rating":"1","title":"What false pretense for information","review":"This book does not offer you any information but refers you to where the information is.

Author shows zero understanding of statistics, science, medicine or commerce. His reputation as a huckster seems well deserved. I threw this book away lest others read it inadvertently.

NO!","review":"I bought this book for my father, and he told me he didn't find any cures in it. I couldn't believe it so I read it myself, the book is nothing but a reference book for other websites or to go to his website and pay fees to become a member to PROBABLY get a cure!!! I couldn't believe it and of course I was VERY PISSED OFF!!! This book is crap and he is nothing but a scam artist!!! I hope the FDA really does shut him down unless of course they are behind this book!!!If I could I would give this book -5 stars!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I Was Ripped Off","review":"I ordered this book as a holistic reference, for which purpose it was a complete failure. I even bought the second book, \\"More Natural Cures Revealed: Previously Censored Brand Name Products That Cure Disease.\\" Not only was the book written poorly, it contains less real information than a supermarket rag. As if I were not defrauded enough, the book refers it's readers to a website (NaturalCures.com) where you can get the \\"Real, real\\" information not available in the book due to some kind of government regulations. So now I've paid $36 and change for two books which supposedly contain information on holistic cures, and do not, but they want to further defraud me to the tune of $9.95 a month to join the website in order to get the information which was supposed to be in the first two books in the first place. In my opinion this guy and his publishers should be in the San Quintin book of the month club for bilking sick people out of their money who are disparately seeking a cure."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doing something about it.","review":"This book inspired me to do something about it. I admit I used to be a couch potato. My niece gave me this book as a gift. I resented it at first but then after she asked me for the 20th time if I had read it yet, I finally just read the book. At first I thought it was just Kevin attacking the FTC etc... but I soon found plenty to think about and do to change things in my life that needed changing. Obviously my niece could see what I did not want to look at....Well now I am changing not only what I eat but I am getting some exercise too. Thank you Stacie for making me read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is a HUGE scam!","review":"I got this book after hearing about it on a local radio show. What a HUGE scam! In order to receive the book \\"free\\", I had to sign up for 2 separate newsletters, which are free for ONE month. After that, the newsletters are $19.95 per month. Obviously, they're hoping to make money on the fact that people \\"forget\\" to cancel their newsletter subscriptions.I told them INITIALLY that I didn't want to subscribe to their newsletters, but they signed me up any way.Now, I have to waste additional time, trying to cancel both of these newsletter subscriptions.Save yourself some headaches and DO NOT fall for this scam!If I were allowed to give ZERO stars, I would have!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Natural Cures the REALLY Don't want you to know about!!!","review":"I would NOT recommend this or any of his books to anyone!

I'm sure he makes alot of valid points but its hard to go 4 or 5 pages wihout really having said anything of value. He states most of the book is in his own words and was not edited. I think he should've had it edited. I'm not entirely sure I'll ever make it to the end of the book.

It's common sense-- if the cures found within worked, you wouldn't have to buy a book to know about them.

Disappointed extremely from the contents of this book. The information provided was not helpful. The book often referred you to other books, journals and reviews. If you have at least 730 days to read and research the reference material provided by the author, I guess it ok. There is no way I would recommend this book or any other book by Kevin Trudeau.I started to purchase Debt Cures they dont want you to know about. It was then I discovered the author was the same person who wrote: Natural Cures they dont want you to know about.

Hey bud, I just spent $30 dollars for the information. I lost all my respect for Kevin!!! Very, very slippery snakes salesman. He's a master of deception. Now I understand why there's so many law suits against him. He's already spent 2 years in prison. I think he needs to stop taking advantage of people's genuine hope for information.

It was a struggle just to get out of bed in the morning even after 8 hours of sleep. I work at a flower shop, where energy in sales efforts and customer interaction is pretty important. I was really at my wit's end about how to get out of my slump.Then I read what Kevin had to say about the personal energy people can get from the very simple act of wearing white clothing. I went straight out to Old Navy and bought 13 pure white outfits: white polos, white blouses, white pantsuits, etc. One week into my new look people are asking me how many cups of coffee I drink a day!

But not anymore.)I agree that drugs are being pushed too often in our society and many people are looking for an \\"easy\\" fix for everything by simply taking a pill. However, I do believe that there is a place for medicine. If possible we should be looking for natural cures first BUT DON'T LOOK FOR THEM IN THIS BOOK! In this book, Kevin Trudeau seems to be writing an endless infomercial for his website.(Which you have to pay to join) Not to mention he rambles on about the benefits of scientology.

This book reveals nothing new, just sales rhetoric to drive you to his website."},{"rating":"1","title":"This guy has to be stopped.","review":"I do not know how anyone with any sense of conscience can possibly purposely mislead people like Kevin Trudeau has. He claims that he is not trying to make a profit and just wants to help people become healthy.I beleive one of his claims is that making your body alkaline will CURE cancer. This is one of the dumbest things i've heard in my life. You cannot make your body alkaline, you canot change the ph of your blood. Anythign you eat will only change the ph in your urine. Anything that WOULD chenge the ph of your blood would probably KILL YOU.These claims he makes are not only false, but if anyone followed some of these, they could die. Mr. Trudeau has been arrested for fraudulent claims before, and im sure he will again. If you are unaware of his criminal activity in the past, look it up, you'll be surprised to find a few things about Kevin Trudeau that you wuold have never guessed.This man is a Con-man, a swindler, and a ex-con.

Kevin Trudeau is a total quack. He's selling snake oil and the truely sad thing is that so many people are buying it. He is selling a book now instead of various supplements and other products because the FTC has forbid him to sell the other junk. He has also been fined over $2 million by the FTC for false advertising. Do not give this man ANY of your money! His book is full of bogus quackery, as are his infomercials. Do some research and find out for yourself. I suggest taking a look at the Quackwatch website and search for his name."},{"rating":"1","title":"A sucker born every minute.","review":"Glad I saw these reviews first.

He continually spouts that \\"they\\" are all about the money, and in the last third or so of the book he continually spouts that you must join his website (it's not free) for any usable information. Throughout the book the reader is teased with this information and it is never given. This book was a total waste of my money.

I believe everything the author states in the book is true, for example, natural cures for cancer and other diseases do exist, goal of drug companies... The information in this book is essential to all, and makes the reader realise what type of \\"medical\\" world we live in. Unfortunately, he does NOT reveal any natural cures, stating that he will be prosecuted...so the title is misleading. This is why I gave it 4 stars. The natural cures are only accessible via the book's website for some fees. Still, a book that's very, very interesting."},{"rating":"2","title":"Made me change for the better","review":"Some of the precepts in the book are uncomfortable. I would love to say that I live a healthy live, okay I know I need to exercise more and eat out less often, but I'm not that different from my friends. As I read this book it got me to thinking about how as I looking a 50 in the face, I don't have as much energy, sitting on the couch at night feels like the best think to do. The aches and pains are more when I get up in the morning. However this book made me realize I could have a good 30+ years to live and didn't look so hot with the decline of my physical well being."},{"rating":"2","title":"Use the web site too","review":"Must say I was a little put off at first when I went to web site and found out I had to pay to get the information. I was complaining to my husband about it and he asked me if it cost hundreds of dollars a month. I said no. He them reminded me of what I spend each month for my unused gym membership and what about the magazines I buy each month.From reading the book I realized I needed to learn more about what he said. I am glad he gave a good section on other books to read and the web has proved helpful too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Long life ahead","review":"I appreciate a guy like Kevin caring enough to write this book let alone take all the heat he is sure to be getting from those nasty government people. I always thought there was something going on. There are too many people in this country getting fat. And my doctor is always trying to cram more pills down my throat. Well he ain't doin' it and I'm not taken them. Now I have mister Trudeau's book as back up. I might be old and cranky, but I can still tell a good book when I see one. And see... I even use the internet. I am going to live a good long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Literary junk food","review":"No wonder he couldn't find a respectable publisher for this extended rant. Not that he tells you anything, just fumes about drug companies and groceries. The few facts he does give are simply wrong: he says hypothyroidism is caused by fluoride in the water; my grandmother was diagnosed at 30, and she was in her 60s before fluoride came in. He says positively that HIV doesn't cause AIDS; surely the president of some benighted backward African country said the same thing not long ago,many thousands died, and it was an international scandal. He says 75% of Americans are fat; actually it's more like 60%.A giant waste of time & money - except for those who like to yell about drug companies and grocery stores."},{"rating":"1","title":"Natural Cures","review":"The author makes a few good general suggestions such as increase walking and eliminate fast food to control weight, and is accurate in regards to our nation's obsession with drugs and pills and the attempts by big business to profit from this. But he really doesn't provide any natural cures, and none of his claims have any facts behind them. The book is almost 600 pages, but could have been completed in about 75. Most of the book is just repeating the same advise."},{"rating":"2","title":"Diner","review":"Levinson's vivid, heartfelt ensemble comedy provided an outstanding showcase for up-and-comers Rourke, Stern, Guttenberg, Barkin, and Bacon. The script is funny and knowing, and the natural, often overlapping flow of dialogue gives off the authentic feel of improvisation. Levinson recreates the city of his youth with loving detail. A rich human comedy with a big heart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Top Notch Movie","review":"This is a terrific, classic movie. Well written, well acted, real and surreal all at once. The marriage trivia test is one of the best scenes in any movie.

A group of buddies tie up ends to their childhood and enter adulthood in the late 50's. Stars Daniel Sterns, Kevin Bacon, Paul Reiser, Ellen Barkin and many more."},{"rating":"1","title":"Far from excellent","review":"This is one of the top 100 comedies, according to the American Film Institute, but I hardly laughed at all. I enjoy many comedies, but this one had few funny moments. Plus, I could not stand Mickey Rourke; is he always this annoying? And the rest of the actors are far from great ones. Where did the idea of calling this a classic come from?The only reason I'm giving this 2 stars is because the film itself was made fairly well. It did have a 1950's atmosphere, but other than that, I was highly disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Collection is Complete Without One...","review":"Barry Levinson's Diner is a rich panoramic snapshot of a time, people and place that's treasured by those of us who lived through that period and had paralell experiences.

It seems to cover a time in a man's lives that is not covered much, the nervousness in getting married. The film takes place over a short amount of time but that does not detract from the film at all. This film is one of my ten favorite movies of all time. It is a non-violent man's movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite movie of all time","review":"I grew up in the 70s but could relate wholeheartedly with the story. This movie works on a multitude of facets. The characters are flawed but real, and the situations are sublime but believable.

Pathetic, selfish men trapped in marginal film."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE most BORING movie EVER!!!","review":"This is what happens when you buy movies that Amazon recommends; I consider my EXTREME boredom with this movie my PUNISHMENT for letting them recommend a movie for me to buy. Don't let the fantastic cast lure you; this movie is BORING!True, it is realistic in the sense that conversations among friends -- more often than not -- don't necessarily go anywhere, and oftentimes the texture of a movie is -- not in the conversations themselves -- but in the relationships that become evident within those conversations, but nevertheless DO NOT WASTE YOUR MONEY on this movie.Did I mention that it was BORING?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the right actors","review":"James Spader was supposed to be in the last season of DINER.

I've had two other deodorant stick for Curve for men and Polo Blue and those all had a pretty strong smell.

I am a great fan of Calvino but was put off by books description. The shtick of the viewer controlling and describing everything seemed more like a gimmick than a legit novel. Boy, was I wrong. I have never been more interested in viewing Saturn or seeing Starlings in Rome than after reading this. Please, do not get me wrong; I know it is about more than that. The thing is, like Invisible Cities, this book wraps itself around your psyche, hijacks your thoughts and informs your dreams. Calvino went out with a bang."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great buy!

I am very satisfied with this company's service."},{"rating":"2","title":"A shining work from a master","review":"This book is about the order of nature and human civilization, about the relationship between science and literature.

I really believe he was very successful in doing that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great description and narrative, but a little bored","review":"Well, Calvino's work in general is great, but this book is a little bit different of all other, is all Narrated and is a complete description of everything, it's about a man that watch everything wondering why everything goes on, and it bores the reader, if you like description well done so read it, if you like dialog don't read it you won't like it"},{"rating":"2","title":"Picture doesn't do the errings justice","review":"My girlfriend loves the errings, they are made of polished surgical steel and copper.

However, if you want to delve a little deeper into the back catalog of the band and have an open mind to their less \\"commercial\\" sounding material, this is a great CD for that, too. \\"Badman\\", \\"Birdland\\", and the highly unusual version of \\"Mack the Knife\\" are standout tracks among the fare that was not used for the albums, but everything here is good and quite a notch above similar compilations for lesser bands. The Shep Pettibone remix of \\"Shock\\" is one that begs for the radio to be turned up to 11. Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The ultimate teacher - the lonely friend","review":"This must be the most comprehensive, complete and correct work available. The layout is very neat and systematic with exceptional line drawings. However, the colour photo plates are located at the back of the book and make for unnecessary paging throught this thick book. It also lacks adequate photos and colour drawings of many species. Apart from this it is a monumental work and a solid base for any reference work. The common names are the most correct I have come across and the aditional detail makes for good reading. The printing quality is very good and the hard cover essential. If you consider yourself a serious fish watcher or itchtyologist and you haven't got this book ... think again ! Enjoy !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not to Shabby....","review":"This cd is pretty good. I enjoy listening to the Heavy Metal from differnt sources. If i had to cross refrence this band to other bands.Id say the music is like Trivum, the screams like Lyzaniia, and their taste in music is very verse eclectically like 30STM. But it all boils down to the solid guitar riffs and good screams with some melody mixed in.. I definately enjoy the music. And i will listen to this cd a few more times."},{"rating":"2","title":"It IS funny!","review":"This book is full of fun. Everyone I share it with doesn't want to give it back. The diskette included is a real bonus - when I want to share one of the entries with a friend, I don't have to type it in, I can just use the disk to find any entry I want and send it by email. Great for gifts - there is something in it for everyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What a rip-off","review":"After all the glowing reviews in major publications I was looking forward to this one. But save your money... only a fraction of the book is actually memoir, and it's pretty dry. The rest is stuff he wrote while he was young, and it's unreadable. I felt swindled.... 120 pages of bare-bones \\"chronicle\\" and at least twice that of filler. Give me a break, Auster."},{"rating":"1","title":"or 'How To Clean Out Your Desk and Make Money'","review":"My eye was caught by the pretty photo of the author on the cover. Now that I've read this stinker, I bet he lovingly searched for the best(old) photo of himself. I've never heard of him before but he joins the ranks of those who work hardest trying to avoid work. He's the Maynard G. Krebs (Work!) of Columbia, Class of 69'. Couldn't Paul Auster have had some nobility about taking good care of his wife and son? Oh, yeah, that would mean someone else coming first in his life. After I closed the cover I wondered what messed up this guy to never attach to anything. I looked him up on the internet and it's the old story-getting old, settling down, and finally growing up. And cleaning out his desk and diary and making a buck off it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this book, for the author's sake","review":"A major disappointment all the way (I'm happy I'm not the only one to have felt cheated on this one).

Auster's novels are interesting because he takes improbable caricatures (Mr. Vertigo) and makes them human. His memoir is all about taking humans and turning them into improbable caricatures. His descriptions of the inspiring working class folk who colored his youth are cloying and painfully cliched. Some of these memories seem contrived and over-dramatized-- did an ingrown toenail really foreshadow his death and alter his outlook forever? Maybe a pedicure would have saved us all $12, and the embarrassment of reading through this mess."},{"rating":"1","title":"The whine goes on--and on.","review":"A disappointing example of memoir-writing at its solipsistic worst, Hand to Mouth has no redeeming characteristics. The passage on the ingrown toenail is, quite simply, a howler. Like Barber/Effing's cave paintings, this work should be buried/sink out of sight."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite American author","review":"I'm in the fortunate position to have read all of Paul Auster's books within the last decade and look dearly forward to the books he's coming out with this fall, because it seems like a while since I read Hand to Mouth (last summer) and before then Timbuktu (the summer before that). I consider myself particularly lucky that I'll see him live on October 17 at the Herbst Theatre in downtown San Francisco. My favorite Auster books are New York Trilogy and Moon Palace."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Collection","review":"Paul gives us his first book under his new contract. The result: A short memior, some plays, a detective novel, and something about \\"Action Baseball (I can't figure it out). Everthing except the memior (Hand To Mouth) are from his early days. Nothing breathtaking, but it's Paul Auster, so that means it's good. Regarding his memior, I must say that Mr. Auster is a very lucky man. Look how long it took Kelman to win the Booker Prize. And, more importantly, what happened to him. Anyway, this is a good book for fans. New ones should read \\"The NY Triology\\" and maybe \\"Moon Palace.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Unusually honest and intimate look at becoming a writer","review":"The early, unending attempts of Paul Auster to become a writer, in both the wordly and literary sense. The monumental quantity of his failures is an example to all would-be artists, of any genre, of the need to persevere in one's creative efforts. He includes three samples of his early and unsuccessful attempts, and through these examples the reader sees Auster's beginning efforts at expressing themes which he later developed fully. Not too many people are willing to expose their awkward early attempts, but by including these early examples, it gives us the extraordinary chance to compare them to their later, final form in his published works. An unusually honest and intimate look at the struggle to create, and the mindboggling tenacity it requires."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a ripoff","review":"What I thought I was buying was a different a case of the single serve bowls. 3 emails and still no response when i requested an RMA.

I ran the shoes through the wash cycle on hot several times, and the camo upper still looks discolored from dirt.The shoes are too long for my daughter's feet, but they're vertically too tight in the toes, especially when she wears thicker or ribbed socks.

The video quality is really awful and looks like a unprofessional rip from a VHS or a 240p video at youtube. The original aspect ratio is widescreen, but the video is letterboxed, which means the image has black bars above and below it, just to fit a fullscreen TV. If you have a Widescreen TV, the image will suffer some distortion due to the stretching.Concerning the audio and subtitles, the DVD offers the following options:- Audio 5.1 portuguese and 2.0 spanish.- Subtitles in spanish and english.The show deserves 4 stars, however the video quality is just 1 star - considering the bad transfer and the unprofessional authoring.There are no featurettes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essa série é show!","review":"Great brazilian series produced by HBO but unfortunately we do not have it for sale in Brazil, funny isn't it? =/"},{"rating":"2","title":"Funk's First Family","review":"The Isley Brothers may be the most underappreciated group in R&B history.

He starts at the small end and doesn't stop until it's gone. I also like for the price the fact they are actual beef as I will not feed my dog rawhide which is bad for any animal. These treats are safe, healthy and speaking for my dog... He loves them. I will keep getting them as long as they are available."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS BOOK STINKS; THE TITLE IS ENTIRELY MISLEADING","review":"The actual title of this book should be \\"How My Cat Died.\\" This compilation of memoirs almost without exception describes the demise of the beloved cat, and the pain the owner went through in the process, which is not surprizing, as a great number of anecdotes are lifted from a cyberspace pet-loss grief site. If anyone has ever gone through the soul-wrenching agony of losing a loved pet, this book will do nothing but reawaken the grief and pain of that experience. As none of this is noted on the book's jacket, I felt this book was highly misleading and the publishers should be ashamed of themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 Stars","review":"My company recently switched to Domino and I needed to learn how to develop in this environment quickly, and I had absolutely zero Domino experience. A friend lent this book to me saying that although it is a bit old it is still the best resource his employees have used for learning Domino development, and he bought it based on his IBM sales rep's endorsement.The book brought me from nothing to being able to comfortably develop forms and views in only a few days. The author is witty (his name is Jon Stuart after all, maybe the same one from Comedy Central), easy to understand, does not make offensive assumptions, and is a Domino maven.I am presently searching ... trying to get more copies for some other developers at my company, but I am having an impossible time. Any help would be appreciated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great stuff but too pricey for what you get.","review":"The memory techniques definitely work! But unfortunately for me, I've already read Harry Lorayne's memory book. Many of the core concepts are identical but Memory Masterminds gives different twists to certain things...like how to memorize numbers, for example. Although great for people who would rather listen than read...Harry Lorayne's book is better bang for the buck! Also some of the lessons in Memory Masterminds could be shortened to 5 minutes but he takes an extra 15 minutes relating stories and hyping up his product...entertaining but not when you're short on time. Also the \\"Self Improvement\\" section isn't that \\"breakthrough.\\" If you've never read a memory help book before and you'd rather listen than read, AND you can afford and extra $50, then buy it. But you can get the same core principles from Harry Lorayne! Bottom line: great stuff but mostly the \\"same stuff,\\" only on tape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memory technics made practical","review":"Dave Farrow's book/ course Memory Mastermind makes use of old techniques in a novel manner. The technology of images which is the basis of the programme has been available for a while, but that which makes this course relevant and useful is the applications. He combines image technology with 'mind and confidence boosting' techniques and plain common sense to produce a motivational course helpful to anyone who wishes to remember any material whatsoever.The course is worthwhile to anyone who has never read or researched anything about memory techniques and who would like to improve his/her memory. It will certainly aid and increase retention and the capacity to study. In will also provide useful tips to anyone who does have a grounded knowledge of memory techniques.I found the course to be fun and enjoyable. Though the organization of the tapes could be better, the exercises are kept short and sweet and you can work through at your own time and at your own pace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh my","review":"I have to cover cds for my college newspaper. And I've read the other reviews on here. I'm listening to this cd right now. What kind of music do you people listen to? This sounds like so much crap, like everything else.

This is horribly trite crap."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?! This isn't rock!","review":"There are hard guitars but that suddenly stops and then whiney- oh the world is so hard- crap.

Then I listened to the rest of the CD. Words can't explain how bad it is. Cheesy rap-rock with over-used power chords is probably the best description. The songs all sound the same. The lyrics border on ridiculous. And to boot, they are even worst in concert. Most of the people sat and watched them act like kids on stage while a group of 5 high school kids banged their heads to the music. They have a dj who messes around with turn tables and tries to rap, with the keyword tries. He is the most pathetic want-a-be that I have ever seen. After 2 listens, I gave the cd to my little sister who loves Cold. This is a terrible band and a terrible release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Circling the drain","review":"I saw the video for the song Cold-what an original title-and I had to laugh. Here we where in 2005 and I'm still seeing dopey California-bred nu metallers with ESP guitars and 5-string Warwick basses singing bad jock \\"love anthems\\" to some random Calvin Klein model in their overproduced videos. I loved seeing the Sugar Ray-looking doofus with the spiked haircut(That's not cool anymore dude! You need a shaggy mop now, get with the times!)doing the majority of the crooning while the thuggish-looking \\"singer\\" only chimes in at the chorus.Bands like Crapsfade, Three Days Disgrace, and Banging Benjamin are the last stalwarts of the dead nu metal scene. Lets help them die a little easier and not purchase their music."},{"rating":"1","title":"THIS CD SUCKS BIG TIME","review":"What a joke! there are only 2 decent songs on here cold and Dead Skin. This band has a new single on the radio now and it actually sounds pretty good. Hopefully their new album will be better too. If you like the new song \\"Invinsible\\" That is from the upcoming album titled \\"Falling Away\\". Hopefully the band went into a studio this time to record their new album.

My point is THIS CD SUCKS AND SHOULD BE AVOIDED."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW, Music has really gone downhill.","review":"My roomate made me listen to this cd. It made me so angry I had to write a review. This cd is beyond bad. I would rather listen to hungry dogs barking than stuff like this. I grew up listening to grunge. This is an embarassment.

Im an avid hard rock listener, if you like Linkin Park, Lost Prophets, or Breaking Benjamin then you will love this CD. I guess everyone is entitled to their opinion as am I but man this is a good colaboration of powercords, melodic twists, and emotion. All I can say is that I can't wait to hear more from these guys cause they are coming up and be on the look out. Their single \\"cold\\" was a perfect choice to open up their follow up album. I really don't know how you can't give this a great review. Pick up a copy cause this 11 track album w/ the acoustic \\"cold\\" at the end is well worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"predictable","review":"This is one of those ok borderline albums, well ok in parts. I got this album after listening to bits of some of the better songs, but that is all that can be said really its ok in parts! The vocalist is really awkward to listen to, i mean, trying to rap with a voice like that is stupid, and most of these songs are too similar. Last but not least this album is so over produced its unreal its too damn crisp and clean which i personally think is never a good thing!

As it is Crossfades album is simply to big and dumb to be taken seriously."},{"rating":"2","title":"One Killer Song To Be Remembered","review":"\\"Cold\\" off of this new albumn is the absolute epitome of greatness. The lyrics are the best and the song itself just takes the listener to another world. To Chase-maybe you should listen to see if this reminds you of yourself...Crossfade may not be the highest ranked group yet, but with more hits like this they are sure to kick ass!!Before long they will contend with Staind, Cold, Nickelback, and Shinedown.

Over And Over","review":"I heard \\"Cold\\" on the radio not more than a couple months ago, and this CD contains those songs you have to listen to everyday and can still rock a smile onto your face! Crossfade flows into your ears hard and with ass-kicking rhythm with songs like \\"Starless\\" & \\"Cold\\" (which is on radio charts all over and knocking motorists off the road), to a relaxing, 'face in your hand contemplating' songs like \\"The Unknown\\" which give you a sense which the Deftones achieved in 'RX Queen', and Linkin Park in 'My December' (songs which force the listener to deeper listening.

It is a good, solid album for a young band. If you like Breaking Benjamin, Seether, Three Days Grace, Staind, etc., you should like Crossfade.

Please save your comments re the Series for the sports blogs.In this day and age, for Major League Baseball to produce a non-anamorphic DVD is absolutely pathetic. This DVD was made for a widescreen TV (16:9 ratio), but cannot take advantage of it, because it is non-anamorphic, meaning it will not take up the full widescreen. It has black bars on all four sides. They may as well have made it full screen instead, with a 4:3 ratio.Also, in its rush to make a lot of money by getting the DVD out quickly, they decided not to include footage from the season, to show nothing of the Tigers' play-off run, and to provide mostly filler with worthless interviews from players. (\\"Gee, was it exciting to be out on the mound!\\")I am an avid Cardinals fan, but this DVD was not worth the $14.99 I paid for it. Major League Baseball, as usual, cheats its fans.

Consistantly his lyrics and music touch us all again and again. The content is poiniant and real touching the strings of human nature and life. The music is compelling and user friendly. This tribute album does Mark Heard right! The Strongest Tracks are the cover song Strong hand of love by Bruce Cockburn (a consumate performer) and Nod Over Coffee performed by Pierce Pettis. One thing lacking from the CD that can be found on the tape and the Orphans of God CD is the rendering of Worry To Much by Boston Folk Duo Harrod And Funck. The only weak point on the album is Dan Russel's on contribution but even that is peasant to listen too.

The zip is very short and difficult even for me to pull up and down. Button is difficult as well. My daughter likes to do the buckles that snap together (like in her carseat and high chair) -- this one is like a belt buckle where you thread it through a loop. The snap and velcro are together on the same pocket and you really need to squeeze the whole leg to get the snap done.Maybe if she were a couple years older it would be \\"ok\\"...but definitely not appropriate for a 2 yr old."},{"rating":"1","title":"zipity hard to do","review":"I purchased this for my 19 month old daughter for her to begin practicing dressing skills. After reading the review I decided that even though the toy recieved a bad review from the previous parent that it is hard to manipulate, I bought it because My daughter liked it and picked it out. Needless to say I should have listened to the previous reviewer. The toy is hard to manipulate even for me. The zipper pulls but gets stuck at the top and the button and snap are hard for little hands to manipulate. They were even hard for me to manipulate. The shoes are the only part of the item that are easy. These toys were meant to be easy to manipulate for little hands but this one is NOT! There ARE better dolls out there for the learn to dress part. My daughter likes the doll and carries it with her but the educational value of being able to do with the doll what you are suppposed to do is very limited. I got her the Carters learn to dress doll on Ebay that seems to be better. We'll see."},{"rating":"2","title":"DO buy this one along with Shawn's earlier work!","review":"I am amazed to see an earlier 1 star review when the reviewer raves about 5 of the cuts! This album introduces you to the following writers: Tom Waits, Jimmy Webb, Sting, Willis Alan Ramsay, Greg Brown, Steve Earle, Bob Dylan, David Byrne, Robbie Robertson, J.Sill, and T. Littlefield. A few cuts are live. Some with a full band and others with Shawn and guitar. You can hear her smile while singing the live cuts! A duet with Mary Chapin Carpenter is great. And the liner notes are interesting to boot, which is something I miss with the advent of CD packaging. I found it fun to hear her rendition of songs I already knew and enlightnening to hear writers I never would have heard otherwise. I have not seen her live but from this album I would LOVE to see her in a small venue with just Shawn and her guitar. I think her guitar playing has been overlooked."},{"rating":"2","title":"Desert Island Disk","review":"I bought this disk in a pawn shop in Georgia after hearing her play at an arts festival. This is the perfect disk to pop in your headset when you are feeling small in a big world. Shawn somehow manages to sound strong and vulnerable at the same time. It is renewing. I wasn't ever interested in her billboard music, but this album is straight from the heart. Her covers of \\"You're going to make me lonesome when you go\\", and \\"Home\\" (the Talking Heads song). ARe especially good. Buy this album even if you have nothing like this in your CD collection, it will become a favorite."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never thought I cared much for G. Campbell or B.

The voice, the guitar and familiar lyrics make this a great album to put on while driving or doing work around the house. I have have all of Shawn's albums and this one keeps drawing me back. \\"Killing the Blues,\\" \\"Twilight,\\" and \\"This must be the place\\" are my personal favorites but there certainly isn't a song I skip on this album. And the best part about Shawn is that not only can she sing someone else's lyrics, but she does a fantastic job of writing her own. Check out the others by Colvin."},{"rating":"1","title":"Covers - some good, some so-so","review":"I am a big fan of Shawn Colvin's and have been for 10 years. But this is easily my least favorite of her albums.The main problem is that these covers are uneven. Some are great, some are decent, some are so-so. It isn't a bad album, but why listen to this when you can listen to some of Shawn's great originals?"},{"rating":"2","title":"New and Great Resource for Parents and Teachers","review":"This book has the clearest descriptions that I've seen for parents telling them how to engage their child with autism in play.

He was diagnosed when he was 2 1/2 years old and I wish I had bought this book right from the start. There are so many great ideas and it's pratical for a child that's anywhere on the spectrum.

This is a fantastic effort by the \\"master of funk\\", LarryGraham. It has all of the qualities that his first solo albumhas and a bit more. A bit more likeable than the Victory album,Fired Up has bits in it that take back to the Dance To The Musicvocal (the bum bum bum's in acapela). All in all, I would say it is a great CD to get in your collection. Worth the effort all the way, and if you're into dancing, this will get you FIRED UP!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfinished","review":"I couldn't believe this was how the series ended. I was a big fan of all the Magickers books, but this just doesn't finish the story. You want more and you never get it. I hate reading books that don't really wrap up the story for you.

Instead you feel as if there are at least a couple more books in here but it doesn't appear that there will ever be more."},{"rating":"1","title":"RIP OFF","review":"Please don't wasted $41 on this piece of crap. It's regular cheap $2 speaker wire that they put their plastic ends on and sell for $40. RIP OFF!!!!

I decided to bite the bullet and pick it up anyway as I new I would get tons of use out of it at work. Which I did for about six months. Around the 5 month mark I noticed that I'd have to push the buttons two or three times before they'd register the command. Then it started to not carry the sound through, I would have to unplug it and plug it back into the ipod. Finally, it just stopped working. A co-worker bought one a few months after I did and his stopped working about a month ago.I expect that kind of \\"craftsmanship\\" from a third party, knock off, company.

If you work in a similar environment, don't hesitate in getting this attachment if you want to add a radio to your iPod."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good when it works, but unreliable","review":"Works well when it works -- easy to use and pretty good reception compared to other low cost mp3 players I have owned. An integrated radio would be a much cleaner solution -- sometimes the cable length is a pain and things can get tangled with the remote -- but the volume and navigation controls on the remote can be handy at times. The remote has a clip that helps. It does drain the battery at a noticeably faster rate but for my moderate use this was never really a problem.My only real complaint is that, after a few months, the radio would sometimes just not work. The player would not recognize it when it was plugged in, despite repeated tries. Then, some time later, it would be fine. This problem got worse and worse until now, about a year after I bought the unit, I very rarely can get it to work. Enough people seem to have this problem that I cannot recommend the product. Disappointing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just what I needed","review":"Ipod 4G should come with a radio, but since it does not, this works fine. The cord is a bit long with my headphones.

The best!","review":"Is this giant too big for America to see ? I first read about it in an English magazine in a piece I think by Michael Moorcock or Martin Amis, who claimed Jacobs as one of America's funniest writers. Well it took the Brits to see Chandler, Faulkner, Welty and a dozen others before we did, so maybe I shouldn't be surprised. A prophet in his own land indeed! This is a superb, mordant, intelligent, clever and wonderfully funny novel which should be on every literary studies syllabus in America. I can't add much to the other reviewers -- except to join in the applause. Jacobs is a first rate writer. This is the first book I have read of his and I'm desperate for more.

It is filled with darling projects - in fact, a friend asked me to make the shell-edged shrug for her. Well, it started out fine, but about halfway up the first sleeve, the instructions went wacky. Realizing the book was first published in Great Britain and translated to American (the crochet terms are very similar, but a G.B. single crochet is a U.S. double crochet), I tried to work with it using the photo as a guide.When it was time to shape the shoulder, front, and back, however, the instructions became incoherent. I gave up at that point - it just wasn't worth the struggle.I've crocheted for many years, and it is rare that I find a pattern that stumps me so completely. Needless to say, I've found a different pattern with a similar finished look to make for my friend, and I won't attempt any of the other projects in the book. I don't have time for this!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware!!!!","review":"The patterns in this book look absolutely beautiful on the pages but the book was not originally published in the US. There are instructions for converting British Crochet to US Crochet online, but now that I have found this out I have given up on this book. Also the yarn that is used can only be found online for extremely high prices. If you don't want to do that you have to convert the yarn into what is available in the US. Just a note...the white cardigan that held my fancy when purchasing this book would cost over 100 dollars to make if you bought the comparable yarn in the US. I would stay away! (but the patterns look so pretty) Pretty..Yes...but are they worth the effort and money?"},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting designs","review":"I like the designs in this book. Unfortunately, only experienced crocheters should buy the book. I made the lacy sweater cardigan. It was going really well until one line of directions made no sense at all.

This book would also be OK if you had support from a yarn store to help rewrite a few lines of directions. I would buy this book again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so simple to crochet","review":"Most of the projects are quite involved lace style patterns. I am an experienced crocheter and would not attempt these projects, because I do not like to spend a year crocheting a poncho.

I don't know if this book was originally intended for the U.S. or if it was translated or from the U.K. There are some quirks in the patterns that will hopefully be ironed out w/newer editions. My other complaint is the use of high priced yarn, many I've never heard of, but substitution is always an option. Despite the quirks and yarn, I would recommend this book for anyone interested in high fashion crochet."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simple is right!","review":"The title is fitting. Most of the designs are pretty simple. Some seem more intricate because of the yarn choices, but that is one of my biggest problems with this book. A lot of the patterns would have been more appealing to me if they had been made with different yarns. The thick, bulky yarns in the cardigans and sweaters can only make most people look bulky and who needs to add on the pounds these days? The majority of the designs are simple 1980s through 1990s styles. Nothing unusual. Not very many would be worth making. I would have to make too many adjustments and hope that the styles still worked with other yarns. Even at this price it wasn't worth it for me. If you are skinny and like simple heavy designs then this book may be for you, otherwise, skip it."},{"rating":"2","title":"conversations to go","review":"With 4 elementary school children, it is sometimes hard to have a coherant conversation at mealtimes.

My children (ages 6 and 9) love going through the questions so much that they get this out when their friends are over and and take turns reaching in for a card and answer one question after another! Their friends seem to enjoy it equally as much. As a mom, I LOVE it because it has been a way to learn new things about my children and to gain insight into their hearts and brains. Not the most durable package but certainly novel and fun and a convenient size. The only thing that I did not like was the sticker placed over the flaps that you have to tear off; I don't like adhesive residue on a brand new product and I had to open it carefully in order to keep from tearing the flaps.

I wish I had gotten something else instead though, because this is terrible. I can't even watch a single DVD (there are 5) in one sitting because it is literally so boring that it puts me to sleep. The narrator's voice is extremely dull, the guy(s) they interview are dull, the graphics and pictures are \\"meh\\" at best, and the music is fairly soothing; which is a great combination to have you snoring within 20 minutes of putting this in.So, if you are having trouble sleeping at night, I would highly recommend getting this.

I've always known Ace T to have well put together music, and this entire album is the same way.

It was very easy to adjust the peeler part so that it worked well, following the instructions and I can process 20 apples in less than 15 minutes. I found that the suction cup feature worked great and it stayed put for an hour when I wetted the bottom. The only thing that takes time is when I spray the slices with lemon juice, (which will keep the slices from turning brown while drying) and then sprinkling the slices with a bit of cinnamon.

No one has one of these things its so cool when everyone comes over fascinated by this thing. Not only that, but I hate the skin more than anything in the world and I can peel it off really easy and make a cool twist out of the inside of the apple. The best part would be how it takes out the core, it's twisted and ready to eat, really it's a way cool invention.

I had a Pampered Chef apple peeler/corer for years and absolutely loved it. When parts of it finally wore out, I saw this model on amazon and gave it a try. Total waste of my time and money! The peeler peels only a fraction of the apple and the corer is not sharp enough to cut through the apple, leaving me with a mushy mess. I've tried lots of different apple varieties and it makes no difference. I am now back to preparing apples by hand. The only reason I give this 2 stars is because I did like the suction base that attached to the counter top."},{"rating":"1","title":"had to send it back!","review":"I had the same experience as those who posted the other bad reviews. I thought the adjustability would make this the perfect apple peeler, but even fine-tuning did not stop this thing from leaving the peel on half the apple and taking half the flesh off the other half -- it also mangled the cores, breaking them in half -- as one other reviewer noted, the spring seems very tight and does not follow the curve of the apples. I had another brand that wasn't expensive at all that worked beautifully until I wore it out. Not sure how this gets all the good reviews unless there is a problem with quality control..."},{"rating":"1","title":"not worth purchasing","review":"This product would work great if apples were all round. However, if your apples are not round, this will take off enough peel and apple to make it round.

You can change the placement of the blade but that leaves you with a 1/4 peeled potato.. and when you move it closer it takes off half of the potato.. i gave up after trying 3 or so and peeled them by hand..

And even though I don't use it all that often--just a few times per year when I make apple pies, cobblers, and the like--it is an indispensible piece of kitchen equipment. All you have to do is stick the apple on the prongs and turn the handle; as the apple spins, it is peeled by the sharp little blade, and as it passes through the little opening on the end, it is cored and sliced into a neat, even spiral. It's practically effortless! The suction cup is a nice added feature for holding the unit still as you are using it.

Cores the apple neatly, takes all the peel off and cuts it into a spiral which can either be eaten as is (my kid loves it that way) or cut into slices for baking.You can move the corer out of the way if you just want to peel (good or potatoes). The only unsatisfying thing about it is that the suction cup that supposed to hold it onto your surface is a little wonky; I can't get it to stay on half the time.

The peeling function works great. However the rubber suction cup that secures it to the counter will no longer produce enough suction to make the product stable enough to use. The item was not heavily used, perhaps once or twice per month. It was only used when my wife made apple pies since we never bother peeling potatoes.Now I am in the market for another peeler with a more durable mechanism for securing to a table top or counter. If you look at this item as disposable after 1 year, then go ahead and purchase.

Cut three 12\\" lengths, use two for legs, one for the top. Screw and glue together, attach the peeler and you're in the apple cutting business.

The suction cup does not hold it to the counter - just cranking the handle with no apple in it makes it move.

The problem is most potatoes are not completely round, so what ends up happening is some sides of the potato get deep gashes in them and other sides aren't touched by the peeler at all. The device is way too small for most medium to large potatoes, also. In addition, I found that the suction mechanism worked in the short term while I was trying to peel potatoes, but it doesn't stay suctioned to the counter (mine is formica, but I also tried it on stainless steel with the same result) long term.

My first time using the Peeler I used it for apples and discovered a few things that might help others who have bought this and or considering to buy it. Medium or Small sized apples work the best on this peeler. Do a test run on one apple to see if you need to adjust the peeling blade or the angle of the apple, make sure the apple is aligned so it does not wobble while turning as this will affect the spiral cutting and cause it to push the core thru the apple without a spiral cut. after working out the adjustments I discovered one other thing if you turn the apple too slow it will also cause the apple to core without peeling or cutting turn the crank at a decent speed as to avoid this from happening as often.

It is too outlandish (if that is possible). I guess it is what it is; marrying Gilbert's interest in fairy stories with his satire of Parliament. What an odd mind Gilbert must have had to write this libretto.Like anything else, though, if one loves G&S, this is a good CD to have in the collection; and the patter song in this opera is perhaps the hardest in the entire G&S inventory, finely done by Richard Suart as the Lord Chancellor.Excellent performances; the score is excellent."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Dialogue? -- No Thanks","review":"A G&S recording without dialogue is not worth buying -- it has the hallmarks of a quicky for the bargain-bin market. A critical part of G&S is Gilbert's witty and topical dialogue; without it a G&S performance becomes little more than a concert of pleasant Victorian ballads. The best voices in the world cannot redeem the act that you will be getting only half a performance. Would you go to a D'Oyly Carte performance that advertised \\"No Dialogue\\"? A handful might if it were half price, but I certainly wouldn't."},{"rating":"2","title":"every parent needs to read this ASAP!!","review":"Raising teens is not easy but this book is very helpful in understanding some of the intriques parents encounter along the way.

The 1984 Hammersmith live album is a very good one, heavy-metal sounded, fantastic recording (by the BBC), but it was taken during the worst years of the band - the years of \\"Under wraps\\". That one is from \\"Crest of a knave\\" years, and also was taken by the BBC that, as usual, made a great work. The quality is great, The album is good too, includes a good short version of \\"Thick as a brick\\" (better than the one in \\"Bursting out\\"), a nice (but not more) mix of \\"A new day yesterday\\" and \\"Bouree\\" (did i spell it right?), and not a very good mix of \\"Ministral in the galery\\" and \\"Crossed eye Mary\\".

In the first half, 2- 3 seconds was the max between cuts. Someone delivery a 15 second line would have five edits before the line was delivered. Usually this technique compensates for lack of actual content or action, making one feel there is more going on in a scene. I guess this is popular for generation ADD. I predict this film will end up in the dust bin of history. I have no desire to see it again, not usually the case with a great film. Maybe I haven't played enough video games to enjoy such a film.

The only \\"features\\" are trailers for other movies. Did anyone else notice this problem? Unless I missed a menu option, I'm thinking they're missing, and this is truly disappointing.Another problem is the subtitles. The DVD version retains the \\"boxed\\" English subtitles from the theatrical release, which are, of course, terribly small on a home TV.

Much of the 1st half of the movie uses subtitles and all of the gameshow questions are WAY too hard to read. Compounding the problem are the colored backgrounds on which the subtitles appear, some of which blend in with the background. Not to mention that you need to be a speed-reader to read all of the subtitles before they disappear from the screen.The story is great, the movie is great, but the makers of this DVD really dropped the ball.

Don't get me wrong Danny Boyle was one of my all time favorites before this Indian version of a Regis game show wide awake nightmare, but seriously what did this film have to offer? Charachter development that had all the structure and depth of one of those God awful 90's mentos commercials. Seriously this is the year that you walk away from the hype, choose for yourself.

This movie made me feel terrible. The only think that made me feel good was that the characters survived this movie, and it was finally over. I would have felt good if the character won the money and then did something great with it to change the slums. All the characters, save one, were black and white. As opposed to say, Gran Torino, the movie I think should have won, which had characters that were black, white,grey, good, bad, and changeable. Really depressing to me is that nothing has changed in the slums of Bombay(now Mumbai) since I was there 40 years ago, and nothing will until the culture changes. If you want to see how the people have survived with dignity and compassion those forty years watch a real movie live Patrick Swayze's City of Joy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SLUMDOG: DISAPPOINTING DVD VERSION!","review":"Having missed the theatrical release, I purchased a copy of Slumdog from the local Walmart on Tuesday, 31st March and watched the movie in the same evening. Sadly all the special features were missing on the dvd, one of the main reasons for my buying it to see old Bomaby again. If the blog on dvd tells the consumers that there are special features, they should have been there. In this case, evidently the first major error in dvd history, FOX used the greed bait, just like the GM and AIG. We all know what happened to them. I think it is the responsibility of FOX to send a free dvd to all who purchased the defective version.I took mine back for a refund."},{"rating":"1","title":"Total Waste of Time","review":"I usually wait to see movies after the hype dies down. That's because most of them do not live up their advertising budget. I started the movie last night and gave up after the first 20 minutes due to the constant and unnecessary bombardment of violence. I can see by the other reviews that I'm not missing anything except more of the same topped with a trite happy ending. This movie is for sadists or people that are unable to think for themselves and just say it's great because everybody else said it was great and it got awards, didn't it? Wake up everyone!! I would give this movie zero stars but Amazon is too generous. The fact that so many liked this film shows me that our civilization has not advanced very far indeed, not very far from the time that watching gladiators kill each other was the main form of public entertainment."},{"rating":"2","title":"It's OK!","review":"In these tough times, I applaud Fox for thinking outside the box. I think the rental vs. final purchase copy is a brilliant idea.I don't mind getting my disc exchanged. At least they fessed up and let us know RIGHT AWAY that there was an issue. Most of us have already seen the film - and are wanting to BUY it because it is a PHENOMENAL piece of art.I encourage EVERYONE here to purchase this legacy masterpiece.

This Movie was not very interesting and culturally it is so different in it's approach that most Americans will have a hard time watching it, unless of course you like Movies that break out into Song and Dance and Characters who almost never speak.What this movie's Oscar wins are all about is a an attempt by Hollywood to put out their right hand in a Gesture of acceptance to Bollywood so that they can finally get their left hands into there wallets!It's horrible that movies Like Batman, Frost Nixon and Benjamin Button get very little acknowledgement and movies like this Win everything. No wonder so many of us have stopped watching the Oscars.Save your money and buy a copy of Frost Nixon or Batman and let them know what you really think of the Oscars."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is Best Picture? Worst Oscars Ever...","review":"The film starts off well enough, when they were kids in the slums. In particular were some scenes on an Indian train that reminded me of some scenes in Gandhi. Seeing the evil people using kids to beg on the street really hit home with me, it's everywhere in China. And it's sick. There were also some good, funny moments during the interrogation scenes when Jamal stood up to his tormenters.But I don't think the romance worked at all. The relationship with his brother didn't feel real at all either, it felt very tacked on. And I found it hard to care about the main character, especially because he spends half his screen time mute, staring into space.Will he win the money and the girl or lose both. I didn't care at all one way or the other. I didn't find much fun in the film, and there's absolutely nothing there to think about.It really is the worst Oscars ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disc would not play on my dvd player.","review":"I had to return the movie because the disc would not play onmy dvd player."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a movie!","review":"Okay, I admit it: I hate Indian movies. Have always hated them, except a few old movies like Sangam or their non-musical/stupid movies from 70s. But this movie was great. To be honest, I wanted to stop watching it 15 mins into the movie. I thought to myself hey I have enough personal troubles to be watching this sad movie but I soldiered on and stayed to see the rest and it did not disappoint. I loved it once I was done with it. Great movie, great story line and good acting. It's a modern love story of the sort you can not see in Hollywood. It's a story about humanity and good vs evil. Still, you could have faith in good nature human beings like Jamal and Latika. Even Salim redeemed his soul by taking on his boss. I am happy seeing this movie and will recommend it to every one I know... Great movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent movie. Good quality","review":"SlumDog, an uplifting story about a poor boy's life and his quest to claim his destiny. The blu-Ray is excellent quality and well worth the money spent.

Be an individual, think for yourself. These pity votes for horrible movies that portray lives which we as a judgmental and undiscerning public consider lesser than our own need to stop. Crash was a bad movie, this is a bad movie. These are bad films, don't watch them. Please. There is so much good cinema in this world. The new batman wowed everyone, and I found no one to be aw-struck by this film. Benjamin Button was great. There are so many good movies with credible reviews naming them as such. An award show can make a lot of money for a movie, but that doesn't mean it's good."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best films of the year!","review":"This film is amazing. The acting. The direction. Everything is perfect! The story reminded me of \\"Oliver Twist\\". You all know the story by now, so I will not go into the details. I'll just tell you that if you have not seen it, do so, as soon as possible! The acting is top-notch, all around. The characters really come to life, and you want to see them succeed! Yes, there is a Hollywood ending. The good thing about this one is that it does not feel forced. The story ends perfectly.It's also a much needed dose of reality. The rough depiction of life in the slums is unforgettable. Danny Boyle has always been an amazing director, and I love his work. This film is no exception! This film does have it's critics, but I'd advise you to see the film and judge for yourself! Don't let anyone stop you from seeing it.Oh, and the soundtrack is amazing! Stay for the end credits.SEE IT!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too drawn out and slow, no real story","review":"I saw this with a friend and got nothing out of this. It starts with someone being tortured, and he has these flashbacks about his life. It was a dull stupid life. The torture made no sense, and at the end, it was like, what happened? I couldn't relate to the people, didn't feel anything for them. The only part that touched me at all, was fearing that boy would drop that baby if the little girl wouldn't take her.other than what, it was a waste of time.If you like these sort of odd love stories, flashbacks and whatever else, it may be good. But in all honestly, it was boring.I know, giving a \\"bad\\" review will have people swarm in, and say something to insult me or my review, go right ahead. Just know one thing, we have different taste. This may be a great movie for certain types of people. Just because I don't like it, doesn't mean it's a horrible film. I just think it could have been done a lot lot better."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Most Over-Rated Movie of the Decade","review":"Slum Dog Millionaire is the most over-rated film of the decade. If it hadn't been touted as the best film of the year or a feel-good movie, I would have said it was an okay film. But all this hype and all these awards? Deeply disturbing and violent, little to feel good about other than the superficial fairy-tale ending. The \\"feel good\\" label is a total misrepresentation. It's like saying The Reader (a much superior film) is about the importance of literacy. NOT."},{"rating":"1","title":"movie that was so depressing we could not get to the \\"uplifting part\\"","review":"After the rave reviews for this movie--as exhilirating, uplifting, etc, etc. , we were excited about watching it. Well, we simply were not able to get through the squalor (kid jumps in latrine); violence (electrocuting the contestant to get him to tell them how he knew the answers), random killings including a clubbing death of a young mother simply because she was a different religion, intentional blinding of a young boy in order to create a beggar--and that was just the first 20 minutes. We guessed the uplifting part came later but it is necessary to watch quite a bit of horror to get to it. We turned it off and threw it away. Did not know anyone else that we thought would be able to watch this either. We hope that it does not depict reality. Maybe we missed some great cinema but that is fine with us given the price for getting to that part."},{"rating":"2","title":"I expected something more epic","review":"But what we got were some very cute kids down on their luck, and a great performance by 'Jamal' in all three iterations. The little girl was great too. The actors really made this film. The ending was pure Bollywood, but I thought it was disrespectful to the dead Salim.Best picture? Worthy, indeed, and I am thrilled for Danny Boyle, but what is all the hype for, and forgive me for asking, but why is the American film industry having such a hard time winning their own Oscars?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too Exaggerated to be Believable","review":"The fact that soo much of the movie is exaggerated ruined it for me. The fact that soo many bad things happened to one small child was totally unbelievable.Just because a movie is \\"cultural\\" and it has a song in it does not necessarily make it good.I actually decided to go to the slums of Mumbai to see if this movie is actually realistic (wanted to volunteer). The people living in the slums of Mumbai are completely different from what is shown in the movie. I noticed that people had color TVs in their homes, stereo systems, running water, etc. And they were all happy to be living there as a community.This movie was too fake to be appreciated. Some scenes are totally disturbing and unnecessary (and unreal)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Poor Movie if You've Already Read the Book","review":"Not to sound cliche, but I probably would have enjoyed this movie more if I hadn't read the book (which is terrific). I think the movie mirrors some of the violence/horror of the book. However, the situations presented in the movie are TOTALLY different than the book and the characters portrayed in the movie are much less compelling."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-see movie, I waited too long to see","review":"I put it off and off and I shouldn't have. This movie was well worth seeing and it is one of those movies that stay with you long after the credits have rolled. It might even haunt you. I know the scenes of rampant poverty in India stayed with me. And yet the story, for as glum as it sometimes has to get, has an up-lifting ending with a little Bollywood dance number thrown in, to boot Excellent movie and a must-see."},{"rating":"1","title":"great movie; poor DVD package","review":"The movie is fantastic but don't waste any $ on this DVD release. It looks like one of those put out quickly to cash in on the Oscar buzz. There are zero extras on this. That's right--no commentary tracks, no deleted scenes, no making of's, etc.Come on! There is a huge goldmine of stuff they could have done as to how this movie even got made, a look at the actors who we know little of and a look at Mumbai itself.Shameful release really that shows almost no understanding of the DVD market."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feel good film--highly recommended","review":"I never felt compelled to see this film, but I saw it one night when nothing else was on HBO.

You will be glad you saw this one!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Blu-ray version ... no control for about 20 minutes of wasted time","review":"The movie was okay, but I doublt if I will watch it again.Note that if you plan on watching this movie say after dinner or whatever, be sure to start the movie BEFORE you start to eat.I have the blu-ray version and you are forced to watch about 20 minutes of movie reviews WITHOUT fast forward or remote control jump to disk menu.That's crazy. Can you imagine watching half of the movie and you lose power for a minute. There is no way to restart the movie without sitting thru those first 20 minutes LOCKED OUT of video control.This is for the blu-ray version ... could be the std version has a way of getting to the main menu using a remote button."},{"rating":"2","title":"I fell in love with this love story","review":"It is hard not feel for this young man who lives in the slums of Mumbai and whose grit and determination landed him in a pile of poop the first few minutes of the movie. I was pulled in immediately. The young Jamal was excellent in this role! His young squeaky voice yelling out \\"Amitabh Bachchan\\" was a cute as can be. And oh, the love he felt for Latika was heart wrenching. The more his mean-spirited brother Salim was determined to keep them apart, the more it seemed they were destined to be together. I loved this film so much I watched it 3 x the first week I bought it. It was so unexpected and I couldn't help it. This movie is right up there with my favorite love stories of all time: \\"Officer & a Gentlemen,\\" \\"Pretty Woman,\\" \\"Indecent Proposal,\\" and \\"The Titanic.\\" I loved this movie...I loved their story. I guess you could say I'm a romantic at heart. And I always root for the underdog. So three cheers and two thumbs up for the Slumdog of Mumbai!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A nice film but I wouldn't call it Oscar worthy","review":"Let's admit it: if it wasn't for all the hype that surrounded this film until the Oscars, no one would have seen it. While it certainly has an interesting storyline, it's not a film that I particularly remember long after I left the cinema. Dev Patel and Frieda Pinto do a nice job but the film only gets interesting (for me anyway) late in the second half. A bad film? No, far from it. Oscar-worthy? That's debatable especially since Frost/Nixon did a much better job conveying to the viewer the affect of the Richard Nixon years. This film will inspire debates for years to come on whether it was political liberal pandering or good storytelling that garnered awards. Still, I urge people to see the movie and judge for themselves. It's worth a rental anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated & overblown with an American type ending","review":"I reluctantly rented this movie last night. Being a fan of foreign films I was a little hesitant to rent it as I had suspicions about the movie. Sure enough. The movie was ok at best. But definately not good & much less great. OVerall it was pretty boring. But what really just threw it away for me was the the \\"American\\" style happy ending. The guy gets, the girl & the millions, & the bad guy brother kills the bad guy & of course martyrs himself to redeem himself. If you are serious about foreign movies pass on this load of bunk & rent a real one. This is a joke."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Academy finally got it right...[PLEASE REVIEW THE MOVIE AND NOT THE DEFECTIVE DVD!]","review":"Slumdog Millionaire is just about the best movie of 2008...the direction of Danny Boyle is impeccable, the screenwriting is flawless, and the story is moving, leaving me in tears at the end. I was very disappointed in last year's Best Picture winner, No Country For Old Men. This year, the Academy finally got it right. Okay, it isn't the most original movie ever made, but it's an amazing popcorn flick that is pure entertainment, and to be honest, I am sick of all the artsy-fartsy movies the Academy is nominating for Best Picture lately. It's about time we got an uplifting crowd-pleaser like Slumdog Millionaire. I give it my highest recommendation. Jai ho![And please, STOP REVIEWING THE DEFECTIVE DVDS!!!

That said, I researched on Google, and found that the movie does reflect the real India. The most brutal part was the blinding of homeless children, so they could make more money begging (money for their captors). I'll pass on my plans to travel there.

This movie is great. It keeps you interested the entire movie and you are at the edge of your seat by the end. This movie has such a sad and wonderful story about Jamil.

I have it pre-ordered and I cant wait to watch again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Glimpse of Another Society","review":"I cannot say that I ejoyed this film but I thought it was very good and allowed me to view how another society under a caste system treated its people in an American made media situation. It also caused me to reflect upon the virtues of the American way of life and to measure its imperfections against another countries way of life. The value for me in watching this movie was to remind me of how well we treat one another in America compared to a relatively poor country like India where the accepted behavior is to treat those of a lower class with distain and unworthiness. I could say much more about this film, but I think I have expressed its impact upon me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something everyone should see","review":"This is a great movie that everyone should see at some point.

The scenes in the slums of Bombay are such a contrast from what most of us in the United States are used to that they are hard to watch without wanting to do something to help those poor children.

I personally, think it is an extremely violent movie. I don't care if it really happens in other countries, the amount and feeling like there was no time to recover between everything left me emotionally and physically drained. So, what is the happy good feeling? Two bad guys are killed, guy gets girl and wins his money.

The recipes are very tasty and some a bit spicy but they reflect the taste of the island. Not only are the recipes great but the bits and pieces of info on Jamaica and her people the author reveals throughout this book gives the reader an inside view of daily life there. The book's photos and art are bright and colorful just like Jamaica. If you can't visit Jamaica in person, this cookbook gives you a chance to experience a little of Jamaica in your own home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful -- looks bad and doesn't teach you","review":"What a waste of money. This thing looks like it was written for DOS computers. (Most kids today have probably never seen or heard of DOS!) Not only is it awful to look at but it's method of \\"teaching\\" is to test you and then tell you what you did wrong. You can't choose what types of problems to work on, just general categories.

I have found it very difficult to keep myself interested in the course, because the homework assignments are so long and tedious. So, I purchased Excalibur hoping it would be entertaining while teaching me Physics at the same time. Well, it's not very entertaining and I find it very difficult to actually learn Physics from it. The program is good at covering the basic concepts, so you understand the rules being applied. As far as working with the Math, it is extremely lacking. If you are like me and get the general concepts, but have problems applying the math, then, this disc is not for you. Pencil, paper, a textbook, and maybe a solutions manual to verify you are headed in the right direction, are much more effective study tools."},{"rating":"2","title":"Matt Kandath loves Physics tutor","review":"My school offers a very tough physics course.

Compare these with the 2-star reviewers, most of whom have written other reviews and are also \\"Verified Purchasers\\". The 5-star reviews all have that breathless advertiser's recommendation quality, with only the highest praise for a flawless product.

I like the beats and the lyrics aren't bad, in fact, it's kind of nice to hear someone rap about everyday issues, instead of dropping caps and slanging crack.

I know his earlier releases are where he built his legend, but on this album there is not a single bad track. Slug and Ant's ability to work together shines throughout the album. Ant's beats are wonderful and Slug's rhyming is witty and clever as usual. From the first track \\"onemosphere\\" to the last track \\"Sharpnel\\" be prepared to be entertained by some amazing hip hop. My particular favorites are \\"Give Me\\" \\"Hair\\" \\"Blamegame\\" and \\"Vampires.\\" If you are a fan of atmosphere you already know this album is fantastic, but if you are looking to break into hip hop, this is a good albbum to start with."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Don't-- don't, don't-- Don't believe the hype!\\"","review":"Take it from Flava Flav, this album lacks the ingenuity and emotion of Slug's previous releases.

The heart of the movie is the Macauley family, not the war effort or America alone. Just because Homer Macauley (Mickey Rooney) chooses optimism over bitterness, it is not because of patriotism. Though the Macauley family has an older son away at war, their daily struggle is trying to get by without a father as fourteen-year-old Homer tries to support his family with a job as telegram boy. Though this proves difficult at times, Homer never complains and remains endearingly precocious, as displayed by his struggle in school with a snobby bully and his hopeless crush on a classmate. Overall, the movie is a good, solid effort, mostly due to Mickey Rooney's flawless performance as Homer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"I fell asleep 15 minutes into this DVD set and haven't watched it since.

The portability of this carseat is great, the washability of the fabric is perfect. When my son was firstborn it seemed as though the seat was somewhat too upright but I imagine this is a difficulty with any infant carrier in a Toyota Camry backseat. I have no complaints with it.

The canopy is also very noisy when adjusting it and it's too high---I have to put the canopy down when I take the seat in/out of the car or else it squishes up into the ceiling. No cushioning...my son has never been snug or comfortable in this hard, hard seat.

Even after I would push the button and pull some slack out on the left side when I went to tighten again only the left side would tighten. Any parent knows if you are trying to get out the door with an infant, having to fuss with the straps so that the child is safe in the car is a huge hassle.

Its that grocery stores are buying carts that have been restyled so they are to small for our carseats. They want us to use the one with the seats attached.(however they are not always so clean and I would never personally want to put my child in them)And as for the resturant high chairs they did not make them to hold carseats.

It is light weight, which new mothers tend to forget about lugging the car seat and child around. It is easy to install and get in and out of the craddle.

For all those who are looking into buying a stroller or car seat remember you will be lifting it in and out of your car and most of the strollers/carseats weigh a ton. So go babies r us and start lifting them up to see if you can handle the weight and remember that a 10-30lb child will be in it too...This was the lightest I found and it is truely saving my back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Problems","review":"I'm frustrated enough with this car seat to take the time to write a review. We carefully researched travel systems for their safety and convenience and chose the Graco Snugride Carseat in Colby and the matching MetroLite Stroller. The stroller is wonderful - lightweight and easy to handle - and we will probably enjoy it once our baby is out of the infant car seat. The car seat has two problems that continue to annoy us. First, the handle on the car seat gets stuck and is extremely difficult to adjust. Second, when our baby (now 3 1/2 months) is in the car seat, the angle is such that his head lolls forward when he is sleeping. I thought that the angle of the back seat in our car might be the problem, but this happens when the car seat is in the stroller as well. If I could do it over again, I would choose a different car seat, even if it meant forfeiting the economy of a full travel system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Music","review":"Heard Stef Burns played lead guitar for Huey Lewis and he sounded great.

It covers Irish history, Native American history, rape, race, forced slavery, sex slavery, alcohol depressions, government cover ups, and much more. It is written I found in a very adult manner, meaning that it is not afraid to discuss subjects that most dare not mention, and I would have thought a must for anyone taking a course in social issues, especially womens issues. I would say the book is a strange cross between Suite Francaise, The Kite Runners, the Da Vinci Code and a dark Victorian horror."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book","review":"This book was an easy read but with the details you need.

He has kindly agreed to run an HPLC assay to validate melatonin content claims of several brands (look up \\"HPLC comparison test\\" tag for other two products tested). The tablets appear to contain even 20% more melatonin that our 5mg capsules used as standard. So we believe the actual content matches the advertised amount of melatonin in this product. Of course, other ingredients may somewhat influence bioavailability of the drug but basically the good news is that here you do get what you pay for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very effective sleep aid","review":"I tried this even though skeptical, and I am happy to say that it works. For the past couple of nights I have had the most consecutive hours of sleep that I've had in months. Evidently, it is true that as you age, your body can lose its natural melatonin. I am 65 years old, and I've been trying to figure out what's wrong. I actually thought I might need a thyroidal adjustment.The only down-side to this product is that I found myself yawning all afternoon yesterday. Tonight I'll try cutting one of these 5 mg CR pills in half to see what happens. If I can consistently manage 7 hours of sleep on this amount, I'll be so happy! Perhaps the half-life is too long for me when taking the full dose. The only reason I am giving this product 4 stars rather than 5 is that I do not yet know if I can control the grogginess the next day by cutting them in half. Otherwise, I would give this product 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Wrong item description 3mg not 5mg!","review":"The title and description of this item says 5mg, but I actually received a 3mg bottle.

There should be NEGATIVE STARS available to choose.This product must contain some cheap fillers or something, because it caused me severe dehydration and dry mouth during sleep, which woke me up a few times during the night for water. It also caused me to LOSE so much water that I had to wake up costantly to urinate. So it kind of worked against itself and I ended up with LESS sleep than I would otherwise have had. This severe dehydration was also responsible for giving me a splitting headache by morning which woke me up early. I hardly felt any sleepy effects from the 5mg. I immediately turned around and bought NOW BRAND 5mg CAPSULES on Amazon.com. Don't waste your time on Natrol. I will avoid this BRAND entirely. Natrol = BAD.

I am glad that it has been available to our soldiers in the Gulf. (This is the hat that was standard during the First Gulf War.) This is a great value, and a very nice accessory for anyone who is going to spend a lot of time in the sun. This hat gives a lot of protection to one's entire face and neck, and is comfortable and cool to wear. The quality of construction is first-rate--it should last forever for the average civilian, as it is made to rugged military specifications. Plus, it just plain looks good. What's not to like?I wear mine when boating, hiking, or just plain bumming around in the sun.

This 'Savoy Opera' is the most popular of the 14 Savoy Opera canon and certainly the most widely quoted in the English speaking world. Many elements of this recording are worth the purchase, but my prefrence is for Susan Gorton as Katisha. Her interpretation of this role gives new impetus to what is usually an uninspired performance. Memories of the late Ann Drummond-Grant (1958 Decca, D'Oyly Carte recording) and the performance on stage by Christene Palmer (1960's-70's)are at last realised in a modern recording. The performer of the title role,is not that 'special' in fact, quite lack-lustre. to hear the best peformer of this role collect the recording with Donald Adams (1958, Decca or 1993, Telmarc) and/or Darrell Fancourt (1949, Decca - Ace of Clubs) Otherwise, enjoy this with recently found composer-autograph music sections, as a bonus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"This is the definitive Mikado, or at least as close as it gets. The voices are superb - Nanki-Poo in particular has a lovely strong tenor - the pacing excellent, and the diction clear. My only quibbles are the lack of dialogue and the \\"updating\\" of the list song. Although such modernization is usually tolerable in a live production, it is less forgivable in a recording. Verses about Walkmans may have been amusing in 1990, but in 2006 they are jarring rather than fresh. In a recording that will stand the test of time, I'd rather have the anachronisms of 1885 than 1985. (Minus the racism and anti-Semitism.) However, since most Mikados suffer from this flaw, it's best to overlook it here and focus on the rest of the songs, which are superbly executed."},{"rating":"1","title":"MODERN VERSION - Not original lyrics","review":"Well, the best thing about Amazon is the reviews posted for each item. I should've looked at the reviews before buying this one! It is a very well produced version/album, but I am a Gilbert & Sullivan purist and was displeased to see some of the lyrics changes. To find that \\"the Lady Novelist\\" had been taken of \\"The List\\" and replaced with someone else was horrifying! :)If you're not a purist like me and some of the others here, this version is great, but I miss the original lyrics and I don't reccomend this album to others like me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Better Than G&S?","review":"I sometimes wonder about those who think they know better than the composer and lyricist. Seems to me that Gilbert & Sullivan were pretty damned good at what they did. But here come the producers of this recording and they think that they should update and alter the original work. Music altered, lyrics made more \\"modern\\" and, in certain cases, words simply changed. Why? Who gave anyone the right to play God and rewrite the Mikado?I realize that the work is in the public domain. But that does not give these people ther ight to do what they did.

The error message indicates that the humidity level in the area I am using it is not adequate for it to function so I have adjusted the run time and have repositioned the machine to see it this helps.

It's MUCH louder than the LG model was. It's also much louder than the 2 my parents own. I'm sitting about 35 feet away from it now (it's in bedroom, I'm in living room) and I have to turn the TV way up just to hear over it. Don't even dream about being able to sleep with it operating.

First, let me say that I am not a medical doctor and I don't play one on TV. I have read a great deal about this subject, however.5-HTP is a precursor to seratonin and can transfer across the blood brain barrier easily. Melatonin is a downstream product of Seratonin, i.e it is made from Seratonin. So, if you take 5-HTP and Melatonin together, it's like filling up a bucket by pouring water into it and patching a leak in it at the same time.You'll sleep better and if you are mildly depressed it will help. If you are more than mildly depressed you might want to go to a medical doctor and have your thyroid checked out for hypothyroidism.It takes about a week for 5-HTP to build up in your body,if you aren't better after 5 to 7 days you might want to increase the dosage.It is better to take melatonin sublingually,put it under your tongue and let it melt.Gunner April,2007"},{"rating":"2","title":"Melatonin Works For Me!","review":"I find that when I take this I fall asleep within 15 or 20 minutes and I don't dream (or at least do not remember my dreams).

However, if I am unable to sleep because of pain -- I think the Tylenol PM is better.I have not encountered sleep problems bad enough to warrent taking a prescription sleep medicine so I cannot compare with products like Ambien or Lunesta.I believe the results of taking the Melatonin help to promote a regular sleep cycle for me.

I broke down and bought a bottle and here I am at 6 a.m., STILL awake and have to be up and getting ready for work at 11 a.m. It did make me sleepy in a short period of time, and I did fall asleep much earlier than usual, which is what I wanted, but I didn't stay asleep (which is the same problem with OTC sleep aids). I slept for 45 mnutes and have now been awake ever since. I awoke with aching, cramping feet and ankles, and my feet feel like they weigh twice as much as they usually do.

Today, this former troubled youth holds a doctorate and is an expert on resilient youth. Dr. Seita reflects on the process of reclaiming adult-wary, rebellious youth and provides a blueprint for success with these challenging young people. He writes this book with co-authors from Starr Commonwealth, the treatment program where John turned his life around. To those who propose that troubled youth should be discarded through policies of zero tolerance and harsh punishment, Seita's book speaks with pround moral authority. This book will be equally meaningful to any professional and lay readers who are open to the message that even our most troubled youth can be redeemed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid, truthful look at a community in crisis.","review":"Scott Cummings does an outstanding job here.

In the D50, I've finally found an affordable way to get that wonderful feel, balance, and even sound of a \\"real\\" SLR. The 18-55mm zoom lens which came with the camera is light and handy, although a bit weird with the way it zooms out then in. That's not natural! My old 35-135 zoom (now a 53-202) works seamlessly as a full auto lens. I started using my 500 (now 750!) f8 mirror lens with a handheld meter, but soon realized I could just make a decent guess, look at the screen, and adjust the speed or ISO. Be patient learning the many, many advanced features. The printed manual is amazingly readable. A book like \\"The Nikon D50 Field Guide,\\" with its practice pictures, is also helpful.

The manual is a tome but after you try and read it buy Nikon D50 Digital Field Guide (Paperback) by David D.

The problem with this one is that shooting in automatic mode produces poor images. I was hoping this camera would replace my point and shoot. I was wrong.Problems i ran into in full auto mode:1. When shooting outdoors colors are very pale (overexposed).2. Poor contrast outdoors.3. Sharpness is very low.Seems if you want good pics you need to go into settings and set every scene individually. Why include full auto mode when it delivers nothing but terrible results? I do not recommend this camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Camera!!!

For prospective buyers who are looking at the D50 as their first SLR I have an expectation to set.You do not get a preview before taking the shot in the 1.8 inch screen. On recieving my new camera I spent about 30 minutes reading the instructions back to front to see if I could get a preview of the picture I was about to take. All non-SLR cameras give you this facility as standard. It appears that this is either a limitation of digital SLRs or a feature not supported in the D50 camera.All said, I have no regrets buying this camera- it's easy to use and takes awesome shots."},{"rating":"2","title":"Digital Camera","review":"This camera was purchased for my 18 year old daughter and has been a great asset to her.

I chose the D50 and I am very happy with my choice.I just got it and was able to take great pictures at the local race track. Standing in the center of the track, not 20 feet from the passing cars, I was able to freeze the car as if sitting still. Clear and Crisp. I absolutely love this camera."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the thing","review":"I was looking for a digital camera that would not be outlandishly expensive, produced good quality images, had SLR design, reasonable battery life, did not have the very annoying noticeable lag between activating the shutter and acquiring an image, and provided the flexibility to be more than a \`point and shoot' camera. I found all those features and more in the Nikon D 50. In my opinion it is an excellent digital camera and certainly more than lives up to its Nikon badge. The battery life is unbelievable - I have taken several hundred images, downloaded them and accidentally left the camera on for over 24 hours and it is still going strong. So far I have not found anything about this camera that I do not like."},{"rating":"2","title":"The D50 is a great entry in to dSLR cameras","review":"This is my first digital SLR camera and I'm very pleased with it. The photos are terrific, the controls are mostly easy to learn and quick to access. My kit came with a 28-80mm lens instead of the standard 18-55, however. The battery lasts a long time and the screen is bright. Downsides: The LCD panel on top isn't back lit so if it's really dark you won't be able to see it. Also, the buttons you have to press to zoom in on a picture you just shot is kind of cumbersome. Other than that, I've shot over 800 photos with it so far and I'm in camera heaven."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent","review":"I also have a Nikon D-100 digital camera and the D50 is about equal in quality to the more expensive camera. I've also used a D-70 and the D-50 is equal to this one also. The more expensive cameras have a few bells and whistles that a professional or serious photographer would fine useful, but I've used these features rarely. The D-50 is more compact and slightly lighter in weight than the D-100 or D-70.One consideration is to get the D-50 body and buy a seperate lens of your choosing for the D-50. The lens that comes with the D-50 kit only goes to 55mm; a broader range might be a better choice.Besides Nikon, Sigma and Tamron make excellent lenses for Nikons at a reasonable price. For most of us this camera will do fine and is a joy to use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent camera","review":"Had the D50 for a month.The Good:- Has the same features to the more expensive D70s- More compact than the D70s- Excellent pics.- Fast USB 2.0 connection.- 18-55mm Kit lens is pretty good.- Nice 2 inch LCD.- Instant power up.- Excellent battery life.The Bad:- Menu navigation not well defined.The Ugly:- No night illumination for the data LCD panel!!!- Nikon Capture software is not free.Overall:An excellent entry level prosumer DSRL"},{"rating":"2","title":"Rock-solid after three years","review":"I bought a d50 just before Christmas 2006 and it's been a great, great camera.

(With any luck, prices will drop further with the introduction of the $999 D80 and the prices of the D70s dropping too. You can already buy a D50 for $550, which is scarcely more than many less sophisticated point-and-shoot cameras.The 6.1 megapixel resolution of this camera is more than sufficient for most photography, especially if you make prints no larger than 8 x 10 inches or compose tightly to eliminate the need for cropping. If you can get by without owning the latest and greatest camera, the D50 will serve you well at a bargain price."},{"rating":"2","title":"D50","review":"This camera takes great photographs, and after two years of taking it everywhere with me, I don't have a single complaint.

I listened to this album from beginning to end and could not grasp a decent hook, or catchy melody. The songs were considerably less upbeat, and then it struck me. Yellowcard is going \\"emo\\". The word that has plagued the punk/indie music world since its inception into the tweener generation. Yellowcard is writing \\"dark insightfull lyrics\\" and singing them over moody and uninspired melodies that ultimatly result in what people will undoubtadly call \\"maturity\\". Way to go the route of Blink-182... If you want something to listen to between slitting your wrists and going to the Hawthorne Heights concert, this piece of crap is probably for you"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lights and Sounds .","review":"FYI: I am not under 13, I just don't have an account. This follow-up to Ocean Avenue was a big success. Yellowcard has created an one of a kind record. There are a variety of songs on this album ranging from quiet songs like \\"How I Go\\" to louder songs like \\"Sure Thing Falling\\" and \\"Lights and Sounds\\". Although they have matured quite a bit, their lyrics and melodies are as catchy as ever. Lights and Sounds is a great CD and it is DEFINETLY worth your money!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome lyrics, original sound, great melodies..","review":"Hi!

It's one of my fave. record.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Correction on Editor's Note","review":"I am doing my best not to compare Lights + Sounds to Ocean Avenue. Yellowcard does sound much broader on this release, and their musical styhle has grown beautifully. Not all of the songs have stuck to me on the first listen, but I'm sure it will grow on me.But in a comment about the Editor's Note, Ocean Avenue was NOT Yellowcard's debut album. They've had three previously -- Where We Stand, The Underdog, and One for the Kids. The reason many may think Ocean Avenue was their first release is because that is the most well known. I would recommend checking out their other releases, as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"much better than ocean avenue","review":"Yeah, some songs are a bit slow but this cd is amazing.

Their album Ocean Avenue hit the shelves and shook people's hearts with their lyrics and music, with the rich flowwing guitars, drums, and not to mention the violin!!! :-) The album Lights and Sounds is a peaceful relaxing album after Yellowcard's breakthrough album Ocean Avenue. The songs Rough Landing Holly, Lights and Sounds, How I Go and Words, Hands, Hearts are my favourite... but I slowly listen to the songs, getting the lyrics stuck in my head!!! :-) Ryan's vocals just flow through the songs easily, letting the rhythm run smoothly through. The songs are excellent, not to mention the video clips they've produced!!! YELLOWCARD'S NO. 1 FAN!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lights And Sounds is not Ocean Avenue","review":"I've listened to the album once through, and so far my opinion is that, the album is decent. I like Ryan Key's voice. I think my favorite song is \\"Down On My Head\\". But, like what's been said before, Lights And Sounds doesn't have the same sound as Ocean Avenue. I'm not saying change is bad, because I really like this album. But I must say I like Ocean Avenue better (so far, let's see if it grows on me more after a few more listens). So, my advice, go out and buy the album. It's worth it, just don't except it to be an Ocean Avenue 2, cause it's not. But it's still good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't compare against Ocean Avenue","review":"This is a very good album, though as mentioned in other reviews, has a much different sound, darker and more mysterious, than what was featured in the carefree Ocean Avenue disc.

I'm sure this album is great to every one who listens to the radio and thinks that having a political view is a fad. Yellowcard used to be my favortie band and I was actually excited about this album. To be quite honest, this album is absolute garbage overall. There are a few bearable songs, but unfortunately, Yellowcard has followed in Green Day's footsteps (who is also garbage). I guess being a political band is the popular thing these days. Yellowcard is now one of those, and I will no longer be listening to them......Great job Ryan Key!!!! Used to be Great, now you're Terrible. Thanks a lot. I'd rather listen to P Diddy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yellow Card - Lights and Sounds","review":"I have to say, Ocean Avenue is an AMAZING album, and Lights and Sounds is nothing less than that either.I am very impressed with the use of the insruments on both albums - and i must say, Only Yellowcard can get away with using the violin with guitar and drums - Brilliant!The rhythms and tunes on thr Lights and Sounds are contrasting in every song and just brings the best out of Yellowcard.Again, Absolutly Amazing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pizza Slicer of the month","review":"This album and this band suck. I decided to try to listen to it and here was my overall reaction:1.Three Flights Up: A very boring instrumental, skipped it to the next song after 30 seconds.2.Lights And Sounds: Not really impressed or turned off at first, and then the singer opened his(?) mouth. The singing was so horrible I thought I was listening to the Used, but then I realized that this singer sounds even more like a girl than the Used's singer.

When a band decides that adult alternative top 40 success is more important than pleasing a core fanbase; they've 'matured'. When time has taken it's toll and a band's members are no longer able to jump around on stage and get excited about anything, well, that band (and it's members) have 'matured'. Sucks, huh. So for all the 5 star reviewers here, I have no anger or contempt. You're probably that same adult alternative top 40 listener yellowcard was aiming 'lights and sounds' at. Boring, stodgy and middle aged (god, i never want to get old). For those of us, though, who have ever moshed to the song 'sureshot' at a concert or gotten our copy of 'one for the kids' signed by ben harper (he left, btw), Lights and Sounds is a terrible disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"?????","review":"\\"Highly recommended for fans of Coldplay and Keane...\\"You see, this was supposed to be a punk band.

The punk rock tunes of Martin Sheen or JFK, Rough Landing Holly, and city of devils are rather boring and un-unique.Lights and sounds is good, but lacks the catchy feeling and violin of the previous ocean avenue and way away.How I Go is an interesting duet and I enjoyed it. The lyrics definitely sound more mature and grown-up. Same for the sad 'two weeks from twenty', but the tune too dull to be anywhere near the likes of 'believe', 'view from heaven' or 'gifts and curses' from spiderman 2.Overall, more mature, but less catchy, which is a small step down from ocean avenue. Hope the next album doesn't continue this trend.Lights and sounds is good, but not groundbreaking."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth the wait","review":"After waiting for some time for this album to come out, I ran right out and bought it. I am so glad that I was not disappointed, I love the way that Three Flights Up goes into Lights And Sounds....

This is a must have for 2006 and I predict that this album is gonna blow up huge like the last one did. A must have for the Yellowcard fan.....edited: After another few days with the album I have to say that it is going to be one of those timeless albums, you will get a thrill out of listening to it the first time and con't with that feeling well into your 100th listen...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spare Me the Emo if You Don't Mind","review":"I know this review will anger alot of people, but honestly all I can say is what happened? It's a sad day when the heaviest, fastest, most rocking song on your album is your MTV hit. All the descriptions for this album were wrong. For example, \\"the guitars are tougher\\" from this site. If you've heard Lights and Sounds or Rough Landing Holly then you know how much \\"tougher\\" this CD actually is.Even worse is this description I found on MusiCountry, \\"Lights and Sounds is a bigger, broader album that finds Yellowcard moving away from songs about breakups.\\" Sure Thing Falling is a song about an ex girlfriend if I ever heard one!It's not to say that this album is total crap, but the band promised us louder, rougher, tougher, and meaner, but instead we get this load of sad sappy panty-waste.It's ok if you guys don't want to write cheerful music like Ocean Avenue, but spare me the Emo if you don't mind."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best yet by far","review":"Like many fans, I fell in love with Yellowcard's awesome music with the release of their album, Ocean Avenue. Now with the follow-up, the newest (for now ;)) album from YC, Lights and Sounds is by far my favorite. There are plenty of good songs and NONE which I actually disliked. The thing is, I'm very picky when it comes to this kind of music, so that's saying something. My favorites have to be \\"Sure Thing Falling\\", \\"Rough Landing, Holly\\", \\"Waiting Game\\" and \\"Holly Wood Died\\". That's not all there is but you'll have to check it out for yourself!I have to disagree with one of the past reviews that mention this would be good for fans of Coldplay and/or Keane. I for one am a huge fan of Keane and I really like some of Coldplays music, but they are nothing like YC.If I were to compare to other bands, I might ssy fans of Simple Plan would probably like this, but all in all I think ANYONE would love YCs music when it comes down to it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yellowcard","review":"I dont know why everyone is giving this cd such good reviews. First off, it takes about 1 minute into the title track to realize two things. First, this cd is mixed way to rough, and it's lack of a clean mix really dosent benifit yellowcard for the type of music they play, they arent a hard egged rock band. Second, the title track lights and sounds, is pretty much the best track on the whole albumn, and even it's subpar at best. I wasnt expceting anything as good as ocean avenue, but this cd seems thrown together in a hurry, and all the songs lack the big hooks and catchy verses that made yellowcard good in the first place. Also, i wondered if they are going soft. There's a lot of pianoy balladesque songs on this record, and the rock songs have parts that just dont fit or sound really wierd.

I have been a huge yellowcard fan for the longest time, and I bought this the first day it came out because I was expecting something fantastic like all the other albums they have put out. What I got instead was worthless overproduced garbage. One of the major things I loved about yellowcard was being able to see myself singing all their songs as loud as i could at a concert or in my car. I dont see myself singing any one of these songs. Also I thought adding uber-liberal natalie maines on one of their tracks was a stupid move as well. I dont want to hear yellowcard's politcal views, just play the music that we have loved since you started. This cd is not maturity coming through, its yellowcard feeling the pressure of trying to fit into a genre that is big now (emo/pop punk) that wont be around too much longer anyways most likely. I guess you can just say that I'm disappointed in one of my favorite bands."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another New Crap Band","review":"In the long line of Greenday soundalikes: \\"Introducing Yellowcard\\".It's a horrible shame that this is the sound of new music.Ok let's not make comparisons to another hundred bands, let's just judge the music on it's own merits.There is nothing of any lasting interest in the melodies.Lyrically, these guys show absolutely no qualities to make them worth a second listen.

Frankly, much of the same information is available by a more recent printing in Hughes & Hayhoe's A Research Primer.Both books present essentially the same information though each volume emphasizes different points. The print size and smaller margins in MacNealy's text make it more difficult to use & note comments; H&H;'s volume is larger, easier to work with & notate, and has summaries at the end. That said, MacNealy does provide some more detailed discussions and examples than H&H.; However, if H&H; was supplemented by reading about 5-10 different and current research publications from your field, I suspect you'd be just fine.If MacNealy's publisher would update and/or reprint the volume so it was available for circa $40, it's worth it.

Sadly, this particular puzzle (and the dinosaur one) are not the same quality as other puzzles in the series. The older chunky puzzles have an image painted on each piece. Even the back and sides of each piece are painted in primary colors. The newer chunky puzzles are pressed wood cut outs with raw (and somewhat rough) edges and backsides with decals stuck on the front. My son is still teething and sticks everything in his mouth. Within five minutes of opening this puzzle the decals are already coming off. For a product that is supposedly hand made, it is shoddy. Be warned, this is not like the older version of this puzzle!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Do NOT buy this puzzle. Terrible quality.","review":"If you order this puzzle, you will not receive the one pictured. I know because we already have the one pictured, and I ordered another from Amazon as a backup. The puzzle I received from Amazon is made entirely of particle board and the pieces are only painted on the front so your child will be handling exposed particle board which is rough and unsafe for child play. The colors are faded and not nearly as bright as the picture above. The manufacturer even took shortcuts on cutting the truck shapes so now they are more blocky and have sharper edges. This puzzle is one of the worst quality toys I have ever seen, and I have doubts that the \\"crafted by hand\\" label is true any longer. I am so disappointed that Melissa and Doug took such shortcuts in their products."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good puzzle","review":"My only issue with the new Melissa & Doug puzzles is that they are no longer painting the face and the backs of the pieces. They were much nicer before! But I guess it saves in manufacturing costs...so it's not all bad for those of us trying to conserve. It's also less paint to worry about your child ingesting, though I wonder what chemicals are in the wood itself? :/Little ones love these puzzles, though! My daughter was really into them very early on, around 1 yr old, but my son didn't like them much until about 18 mos. So if you introduce these and they show little or no interest (other than chewing on the pieces!) then put them away for a while and bring them back out in a couple months! When children don't like or play with toys it's usually because they are not age-appropriate...so try again later!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great learning toy and they are one of the few toys that last through various ages and stages of development!","review":"My daughter LOVES this puzzle.

These puzzles are great learning \\"toys.\\" They work not only on fine motor skills but hand eye coordination and verbal skills. My daughter is just now figuring out how the pieces go in. Also, she loves to say \\"CAR\\" or \\"Vroom\\" every time she picks up one of the trucks. With the animal puzzle she picks them up and says the names of the animals and the sounds.

My neighbor's son(same age) liked it so much she bought theMelissa & Doug Large Shapes Jumbo Puzzlebut I have to say I prefer this puzzle.Note: I am not recommending all Melissa & Doug puzzles for younger children, since we did receive another puzzle and it does not seem as safe, so it is still not in use.

Linda"},{"rating":"1","title":"All Hype and No Help","review":"Most aggression in dogs is related to fear, not to your dog trying to take over your chair, your home, and rest of the country. The dominance theory that Cesar espouses has been disproved by scientific studies, and is no longer accepted as valid by professional behaviorists (you know, the ones with education and training). So, if you want, watch this for entertainment, but don't be misled, and don't try his techniques, most of which are seriously outdated, dangerous, and sometimes harmful. Read the AVSAB position statements on dominance and punishment if you don't believe me. THOSE are the REAL pro's that Cesar mentions in his show's disclaimer - which most of his cult follower morons ignore. Save your money.

However, if you are seeking advice and instruction on how to overcome aggression in your pet, this DVD will not be of much help. The DVD is really nothing but an infommercial praising Mr. Milan's talents. I seriously doubt that the dogs he works with in the DVD maintain their non-aggressive behavior after he leaves. The strategies he uses, such as having the aggressive dog walk beside his non-aggressive pack dog, are not practical for the average dog owner. If someone were going to hire Mr. Milan as a personal dog trainer, this item would certainly serve as a recommendation, but it is woefully lacking as step-by-step instruction on how to overcome aggression in a dog."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cesar Millan's Video-Aggression","review":"The service for the initial purchase was prompt and well received.

Would not recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun for the kids to use","review":"Fun for the kids to use when it is up. Other reviews complained about developing leaks, but ours did not after about 6 uses so far before the season ended. One observation is the maker did not seem to think their own product would last several seasons since 4 of the 7 air chambers do not have a quick release valve for deflating the slide & storing it. To put it away for the season (or wind storms) it takes about 1/2 hour of rolling around on it to get all the air out & store in a reasonable amount of space. All air chambers should have quick inflate/deflate valves on the next model."},{"rating":"1","title":"slide","review":"I should have read the reviews further on this slide.

The kids used it twice and LOVED it!!! During the second use the seam on the bottom left started to tear. The slide was still usable but along with that the water line on the inside must have had a leak because the entire bottom of the slide filled up with water causing it to be very heavy. It took my husband and I over an hour of VERY HEAVY lifting to get all the water out. When we plugged it in again, hoping it was a one time issue the waterline broke completly off. Now air is coming out the water hole making it impossible to use. I am very upset because the kids love it so much.

We took it into the pool to try to find where the leak was coming from, but could find no air bubbles.

It's held up to hundreds of all manners of kids slides and even a few drunken 200#+ adult forays, with no signs of damage.Inflates in minutes with one of those inexpensive hair dryer type inflators.

After inflating it for the first time my wife noticed that it had been patched on the left side of the slide (new???). After inflating the patch held very well. After the first day of use the ladder portion of the stairs seemed to have a slow leak. By the second day we located the leak in one of the step holes.

Luckily, we made it thru the parties and hopefully, it'll last the rest of the summer. But, we have definitely gotten our money's worth all ready and with the free shipping, it was a great deal.

I am repurchasing it because it was fun, inexpensive and we definitely got our money's worth. Did we follow the manufacturer's recommendations? Heck NO, we had people well over 200 pounds using it. Despite the abuse we gave it, we got two years out of it.. Two fun filled summers of kids and adults sliding down the slide head first, feet first on our backsides, tummies, etc... a run up the slide, bounce down, triple half gainer? Yeah we did it..it was fun and I have no regrets. Can't wait to do it all over again!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY! POOR QUALITY","review":"We blew it up so the kids could see it. We left it inflated and 3 days later it was standing outside partially inflated. I guess it sprung a leak from the expansion and contraction from the weather. We live in South Florida. The slide sat unusable for several months and when it warmed up I decided to try to fix it. I found 3 holes all in different chambers. One of the holes was at a place in the vinyl where it was clear there was a minor defect in the vinyl. It looked stretched, thin and discolored. REMEMBER - NO ONE HAD EVEN BEEN ON THE SLIDE!I patched the holes and the kids used the slide 3-4 times in the summer until the next hole started. This hole was not repairable. It grew to be larger than the size of a quarter and was right on a seam that formed a hard angle. I tried to repair it several times but I cannot get a patch to seal the hole.This product is not worth the cost. IT's a great idea, but do not buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Lots of fun, but does not last!!!","review":"I bought this for my grandsons, ages 7 and 10, to use with their above ground pool. It was a great hit! They loved it. But it lasted 4 days, even though the boys were always supervised and did not abuse the slide. It ripped in the seam at the top and then ripped where the ladder connects to the side. I tried to patch it with a kit from the pool store, but it would not hold as the leak is in the seam. Poor quality and design. It was not worth the $129!! Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality","review":"The slide is a great concept, but the quality simply is not there.

Needless to say, when he received it on his birthday he was so EXCITED. His dad put the slide together but by the morning after it had deflated - it had a small puncture in it that hadn't been noticed when it was assembled. As the slide was now totally waterlogged it was a little while until it could be returned - I doubt it would have been appreciated if it was returned as a dripping, soggy mess.When Amazon was contacted for a replacement we received the total run around and the final response was \\"too bad, so sad\\" and no replacement or refund was given. The fact that products can sometimes get damaged in transit is understandable but the the fact that no-one would assist in a replacement or refund, is totally beyond me.The service we received regarding this product was, quite simply, dreadful!I've been an amazon customer for years and never had an issue - but this time, the product and service was extremely poor."},{"rating":"1","title":"It lasted 2 days","review":"I should have taken the advice of the others that warned about this slide.

But I took the chance anyway for my little girl. The slide has a hose attachment area where you attach a hose so built-in sprinkler can wet the slide. After spending about 45 minutes blowing this up in the hot sun I was ready. Attached the hose, fired up the water and the sprinklers did their job. For all about 2 minutes - I kid you not. Then the water stopped shooting out and I could hear it filling up the side bladder of the slide so I quickly removed the hose. Then I heard massive amounts of air leaking out from where the hose attaches. There is no way to stop it coming out. No lid, nothing. Apparently the interior hose system was so poorly made that it came undone inside the bladder and now is part of the bladder area. So it will perpetually leak air.

The New Orleans jazz arrangements are full of energy and just make you want to tap your feet. However, having recently spent 10 days in New Orleans the joy of the music in this album is tempered by the reality that a great deal of the city outside the tourist areas is still a sea of storm debris, empty boarded up homes and businesses, and vacant lots. As I listened to the heart and soul in the music I couldn't help but remember how the heart and soul appears to have been ripped from so much of the city. The music also transported me to a previous visit when Christmas in New Orleans was a joyous time and the Christmas holiday served as a run up to Mardi Gras with the first hints of the riotousness of the coming New Year.

Also, if you are keeping pace with the people in the video, you may end up hyperventilating. In my understanding, you should have slow and steady breathing during a yoga practice.

For example you can sometimes get a Ryobi 18 volt One+ at home depot for $30, and I would have a lot more confidence in a Ryobi than this (plus, the Ryobi has two speeds and goes up to 1300 RPM, while the Powersmith is limited to 550 RPM). Sure, the Ryobi lacks a case and the drivers/bits included with the Powersmith, but this isn't much of a consideration given that the included drill bits are terrible; tried to use them to drill through very thin steel and the tip of the drill bit folded over on itself.

What I got was an awful awful cd of metallica worship, thought they do have some of there own elements I will admit. The melodies...dull, the production...way to dry, the vocals....ABSOLUTLY AWFUL.

The great thing about this band is you can't say that they sound like somebody. Sometimes they sound like In Flames, but as soon as they start sounding like them , they switch to something more like old Metallica or old school hard rock like Black Sabbath or Deep Purple. These guys are so damn inventive and will have you gasping for air with this album. Great buy and well worth the money.

Maybe I can just leave it at both. I honestly thought I would like this record. I was excited to go purchase it after I heard \\"weak and the wounded\\" which is a decent song. I soon realized shortly after I popped it in my CD player that this album was more rock n' roll than metal. There are some decent moments, but for the most part this singer almost tries to mimic the hetfield oooohhhh yeahahahaha's and it is just awful. I don't know why someone would have the balls to ripoff st. anger.(which is much worse than this record). I think maybe they were inspired by Metallica's crappy St. Anger to go out and write a good St. Anger, which still doesn' blow my skirt up too much.

The dialog at the beginning of each chapter makes the reader understand the topic fairly easily. The equations were added for a more scientific approach, but you don't have to understand them to understand the theories. This book is very good for readers interested in Black Holes, but not the physics of them. I would not suggest this book to people who have studied physics or astrophysics if they are looking for a mathematical explanation of Black Holes. It often repeats itself because it is guided towards people with an interest in the subject but are not really interested in the math and physics of it all.Overall it is an excellent overview of Black Holes, and a joy to read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Engrossing and Entertaining","review":"I enjoyed this book. It was easy to get into and hard to put down. Don't get discouraged by the equations. I skipped over the calculation as all that interested me was the concepts which the author did well to get across. There was perhaps only a couple of sections I re-read and mainly because I was trying refresh them in my mind to relate them to sections later in the book. As a bonus there's also a cheesy little sidestory that while not exactly rife with tiwsts and turns does well to get across basic concepts in an amusing manner before delving into the knitty gritty of it.

I love his duet \\"Scream\\" with his sister Janet. \\"Childhood\\" is a deeply personal song about Michael's lost childhood. This song is beautiful. \\"They Don't Really Care About Us\\" has such a great beat. I love the electric guitar playing on this track. \\"Smile\\" and \\"You Are Not Alone\\" are such peaceful songs.

A man that was killed by the harsh media and extortionist for money. So many of the media tortured MJ when he was alive and then the same people in the media are now worshipping him to get ratings and make headlines. May he get to rest in peace!I highly recommend this cd to all who adore Michael Jackson. All of his music will touch your heart. He had the voice of an Angel and heart of gold.

The first cd is just full of classic hits, end of story. The second cd is Michael's most confessional work, expressing his feelings towards, racism, politics, state of the world, and the media. He also expresses the longings of his childhood in \\"Childhood,\\" and how he must return to the roots of his past.

Take time to listen to the layers upon layers of musical sounds he incorporates into each song. He shrewdly employs gospel, rap, historical spoken recordings, street sounds, plain speech, electric sounds into absolutely amazing masterpieces - every single one of the \\"new\\" songs on this release fits into this category.

Michael changes from a family-friendly artist to a bitter, cursing, angry figure. The album has only one true love song, a great change from Michael's previous albums. The album also must be purchased with previously recorded material, which drives the price higher. The quality and sheer contagiousness of the tracks on HIStory makes it a notable album. The tracks do provide more insight into Michael's thinking and deal with real issues rather than issue the typical love-ballad feel. Even with it's minor drawbacks, HIStory is a must for the Michael Jackson fan."},{"rating":"2","title":"The past, present and future since Michael","review":"I bought the vinyl version.

But this film is not the innocent 1950s that Happy Days portrays. It is a straight, in-your-face look at the juvenile delinquent life--a day in the life of four guys in a gang called The Lords.These guys get together with girls, fight, disrupt the classroom, and ultimately realize that they eventually have to grow up (or at least Sylvester Stallone's character Stanley does).If you want a good juvenile delinquent film with familiar faces and cool nostalgia, then go to Flatbush with The Lords!"},{"rating":"1","title":"MC Jackets","review":"Amazon threw Flatbush in with a bunch of \\"Motorcycle\\" movies.

So I bought it, assuming it was an unabridged edition of the novel. I was wrong. As I started to read, it became apparent that it was in fact an abridged edition.

This abridgment was so reckless I had to buy and re-read the full version. Nowhere on the cover does it say that the novel is abridged. The introduction before the text seems to admit that the abridgment is made short to accommodate a modern audience (are modern readers really that dull?). In this case over half the original novel is either excluded or paraphrased. The unabridged version takes a lot of patience to read, but it makes Monte Cristo's intricate plotting of financial ruin easier to understand.

For a 600+ page abridgement, it leaves out quite a bit of the story which just should not be necessary, particularly as much of the more descriptive/unnecessary elements are left in. While those descriptions truly enhance the work in its entirety, if one must read an abridged version, perhaps they could be left out in order to tell a more full story. Even someone not familiar with the full work would probably pick up on this, as certain parts appear rushed or unresolved (the equivalent to a television show writing out a character by simply mentioning they died off camera and never bringing it up again).

But I am an electrical and electronic engineer with 25 years experience, I make wireless internet gear for a living and I'm an Extra class amateur radio operator, so I knew it not only wouldn't but couldn't work. Basically you can't stick something inside the case of a phone and expect it to improve the signal for an antenna it has no attachment to. In many phones, like the Motorola v60i and Krazr I tried, this thing is inserted between the metal back cover and the metal chassis of the phone, there is no way it can do anything to the signal.Laugh and move on.

Another thing that really bothers me is in Chapter 14 (entitled \\"Numbers to Change Your Destiny\\") when he ends this chapter by saying, \\"Pray to the numbers.\\" I refuse!

One could open this book at any page and become engrossed from the history and culture represented by each of the maps.With the physical dimensions and glossy pages of a coffee table books, \\"The Map Book\\" goes beyond most of the genre by being not only pleasing to the eye, but stimulating to the mind as well.

Since it arrived at my home I have researched other reviews at Amazon. You already have product reviews stating the same complaint. This is not an inexpensive toy and it does not work as promised.

The safe eats batteries (need to replace every 3-4 weeks) and when the batteries fail, the safe sends out an audible alarm.

While liberals will refuse to the death to give Reagan any credit for brining down the USSR, as they claim he was not responsible but rather just on the scene when it happened, anyone who reads this book can clearly see at the minimun he was a catalyst for the event, speeding it up by years!

Although the book obviously carries a bias, it never reaches the point of annoying, and all of the major pieces are impeccably researched and backed with objective facts.Overall, a very clear picture of Reagan's life, and a testament to the fact that you don't have to be able to perform analytical calculus proofs to understand basic underlying economic theories.My only criticism is that the author tends to gloss over the unfavorable aspects of Reagan's life/presidency.

This book is filled with good nuggets like Reagan carrying a gun in his acting days due to threats on his life, how his obsession with fighting communism cost him his first marriage, and how the North Koreans planned to kill him when he visited South Korea as president.

When you stopped the CD player and restarted it it would not queue up to the point at which it stopped - it would start over from the very beginning. Also, it would change the volume setting back to near minimum. Most of the time I found that unless it was held perfectly still and level, it would have problems actually getting the CD to start playing. And if it lost its tracking it would never recover. These \\"features\\" are pretty much antithetical to those you'd want for a CD player for a car.After a few weeks of fighting with it I chose to buy a low-end Sony Discman for about the same price, and that works far, far better.

The CD player itself is temperamental and inadequate.The cassette adapter, stereo ear buds, and cigarette lighter plug do indeed allow listeners to play CDs while on the road. We bought the player to avoid running a battery-operated CD player while in the car. The plug powers the CD player, and the listener can use the earbuds to listen to something other than the music on the main stereo system. That part works fine.The problem is that the CD player is unreliable. It doesn't always play. It requires a firm bang with the fist to get it going.Other CD players we looked at in this round cost about $10 or $15. This one ran us $25.

I am 6 feet tall with 15\\" calves, 8 1/2\\" ankles and 11 1/2 shoe size. I purchased the medium, closed toe. The fit is pretty good with just enough toe room for my shoe size. Not too hard to get on or off. I wear a cotton sock over them to extend the life and to eliminate odor issues.After 5 months of twice a week washing in hot water and air drying they are starting to come apart. The compression is also starting to wane in the ankle area. I own two other brands that have gone through several years of the same treatment with no issues."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money, a very poor read!!","review":"It is this reader's opinion that \\"Queen of Angels\\" is one of the worst Science Fiction books ever written. I could not get past chapter 11 without the urge to throw it out a window. Certainly not up to the standards of Greg Bear as displayed in \\"Eon\\", \\"Eternity\\", \\"Moving Mars\\" etc. The characters are thin uninteresting and nondescript. The plot is not self evident and the overabundance of miniscule data and non defined abreviations, attempting to outline a society of tomorrow falls short, leaves the reader with the felling that he has entirely missed points not clearly represented. A very bad read, regardless of the commercial reviews. Save your money on this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"When science fiction is at it's best, it usually is a social commentary of the future. This is such a book and it one of the best commentaries you will find any time soon. A poet in the near future commits a gruesome murder and from there the story plot turns. Three seperate methods are used to examine why he did the murder and Bear does a wonderfull job of exploring the underlying social standards that each represents. The book is full of technology that seems far out by todays standards. If you read carefully, the underlining story is not far off of what could happen. This is a story about crime, punishment, and rehabilitation. This book can be read two seperate ways. One way is a social commentary, the other is a whodunit. Both are legitimate. This is a fantastic read that you will not be able to put down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Took starting Slant to really get into this great book","review":"I picked this book up over a year and a half ago. It seemed a little distant and hard to grasp at first. Even though I found it interesting, I eventually put the book down. That was almost a year ago. A couple of weeks ago, I picked up Slant, and lo-and-behold, I recognized it as a follow up to Queen of Angels. This time around, it wasn't long before I found myself pulled into Bear's vision of the future. So, before making too much progress, I put down Slant to resume reading Queen of Angels. I was ready this time around. Queen of Angels was great, with many different layers, and a very interesting exploration into the _Country of the Mind_. If you like Bear as an author, and are ready for an intellectual roller-coaster, pick this one up. You will want to follow with Slant, too!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Probably the greatest sci-fi book ever written","review":"Like a lot of Bear's books, you'll need to read it twice to understand it but it Will be the best book you have ever read. I've read it 3 times now and look forward to the next time. This is a work by a master at his high point. If you like hard sci-fi, then you're home. Read this and then read Slant for a slightly less satisfying read but a continuation of M.Choy's journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Start Here","review":"I really liked this book. Unfortunately, I read it after reading Slant. If you can, read Queen of Angels first, followed by Slant, then Moving Mars. it'll make more sense."},{"rating":"2","title":"It might be better the 2nd time . . .","review":"I read this book several years ago and it seemed pretty good, but not that great. I recall it seeming to be a little too heavy, involved. I've since talked to several people who thought it was great, and have also read reviews saying the same, and it seems they all might have caught something in it that I didn't. Maybe I just wasn't paying attention. Since I'm a big Greg Bear fan, I'll have to read it again in the future. I think it's one of those books where you might not get it the first time around, but the 2nd time's a charm . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but with a weak ending","review":"The beginning's description of a swollen, dark, crowded LA in an age of omnipresent government surveillance is fascinating. The future portrayed is interesting, but Book 2 bogs down, and the quotes at the beginning of each chapter become annoying. Mary Choy's story dies at the end, with vodoun playing a pathetically tiny role. Also, Bear's minimalist style with which he starts the book, i.e., very few commas and lucid sentences, disappears. The ending and the depiction of Goldsmith's fate is weak. Martin Burke's story is the best in the middle and end, but is anticlimactic. The story has to jump around, so the exploration of Goldsmith's Country of the Mind has to all be in one chapter, near the middle. The terror of it is dampened by the rest of the book"},{"rating":"1","title":"just not there","review":"I could not get into this book. The characters did not draw me in and hold me. The language was sometimes confusing and you get these + signs that I never quite got. I read about 100 pages of this and put it down. It may finish stronger but to me it was not worth the time to get there."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poor, Shameless Attempt to Copy Neuromancer","review":"This was a very difficult read because of the unusual grammar and punctuation, bold use of undefined jargon, and numerous stream-of-consciousness interruptions. My library copy must have been subjected to unusual vibrations, because most of the commas had fallen out of it.A lot of history is vaguely referenced, but never completed. This attempt at creating mystery only results in confusion. There are three story lines, and two of them are remotely related. After investing a great deal in understanding the book, the reader is left completely unrewarded by the ending.Several hours after completing the book, I realized it copies William Gibson's influential classic, Neuromancer, in writing style, plot style, plot content, and countless other ways. This was a shock, because Greg Bear is better than that."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Future nightmare is not worth reading","review":"I am a tremendous fan of Greg Bear, but not this time. This book totally misses the mark. I don't care about anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"A story without a plot.","review":"i realy wanted to like this book when I checked it out from the library. But it tries so hard to be new, cutting edge and in your face I found myself not caring if any of the characters live or die. I finished it and the ending was \\"meh\\". Not a horible book, but a boring one."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the message?","review":"This story is told from the point of view of three characters; a police officer assigned to find a murderer, a friend of the murderer, and a therapist assigned to examine the murder. Another story line about a robot mission to a planet in another galaxy is thrown in. The stories are loosely connected but really go in different directions. It's really three short stories thrown together. The story about the police officer was the most interesting followed by the therapist's. The friend's story was the most boring. None of the stories really have much of a resolution. Overall, it seems Bear was trying to say something about the nature of sentiency. However, I wasn't able to determine exactly what he was trying to say about it. I can't recommend this book because the author's message seems to be lost and the stories are only moderately interesting in their own right."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't know what to say...","review":"I've read more than a few of Greg Bear's books but have come across no books of his that were anything like Queen of Angels. If I didn't know better I'd say there was a bug in his word processor that removed all the punctuation.I put this book down a dozen times an finally gave up on it. I never could get into it becuase I like to read one story at a time... not four. I also like sentences that are structured. I'm not sure what he was trying to accomplish with this but I don't recommend it at all. It will basically frustrate the crap out of you to try and read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two great stories.","review":"Driving on a long trip can get so boring.

We are using it all the time, it's compact, fits in a small camera case, and it's teaching him stewardship. He loves it and we do too.

The first person who reviewed this did so long before it was released and then went on to write a book about the episodes - obviously to bury any real reviews.The reality of this box set is that it was a HUGE disappointment for me. Over priced and very poor quality. Absolutely no time was taken to clean up the picture. Very grainy. I have a 53\\" television and can hardly stand to watch it because my eyes only go to the noise covering the picture.Season 1 was much better and I hope that enough people complain that they'll be sure to offer better quality for season 3."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hooray for the Beaver!","review":"You will NOT be disappointed with this season!

I read the reviews and they seem to be mixed. A few people commented about the poor quality of the DVD, but others said it was excellent and clear. I figured that the few negative comments were just sour grapes so I took a chance and paid almost $40.00 (with shipping) for one season. Now I wish I hadn't. The picture quality is not what I expected from a new release.Either some of the DVD's are defective or some people have better eye sight than others.I'm not saying you shouldn't buy this season. Leave it to Beaver is the all-time best classic show, but I do want to warn you that you may not be pleased with the picture.

The quality of the picutre and sound on this series is outstanding when considering it's age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brings back memories","review":"This series brought back so many memories of what television used to be, before all the violence, nudity, and foul language. Back when you could watch a program with your children and not have to change the channel due to content.

No, let's remember them as they were, and this great set gives us that to the tune of almost 20 hours of LITB.Also, people should stop posting episode lists. What a waste of time!

I absolutely fell in love with this show from the very first episode! I have Season One and Two and the second one is every bit as good as the first. I am losing my patience though waiting for season three. I think the fans have waited long enough so what's the holdup. I get sick of seeing shows that haven't even been on longer than a season already being put out on DVD and they can't even compare to the Beav. I find that the shows that were before my time are far more entertaining and are not offensive like tv nowadays. So my message to Universal Studios is to get the lead out and get going on future seasons of Leave It to Beaver!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheap at twice the price","review":"It all boils down to \\"I like it\\" or \\"I don't like it\\". And, ultimately, taste cannot be disputed. To me, the cello suites are addictive. I have more than a dozen versions of them and every artist cuts Bach's diamond differently. I cherish them all. I listen to them all so that I continue to hear the music afresh. Rudin's interpretation is so lovely that you are not immediately aware of his virtuosity. He never shows off. Well, maybe a bit in the Ciaccone from the 2nd Partita for violin. Or perhaps it's just the trancendant wonder of the piece. I'm listening to it as I write this.

Simple design, and no electrical glitches possible. I poured in the soap and pumped and nothing came out. I tried washing it and tried it again with soap thinned a bit by water. Still nothing. The cap and pump mechanisms by the way look cheap, less substantial than what you see in a $1.99 bottle of soap sold at the drugstore. It is barely worth the time to return a ten dollar item, but Amazon makes it easy, and they always stand behind their merchandise.

The one dollar disposable soap dispensers from the grocery store work better than this thing. Now I have to decide if it's worth draining it and mailing it back. I find it hard to believe that one of these would work for more than a few months - it's very cheaply made so even if it had initially worked I'd expect it to break pretty quickly.Also, the top and bottom of this are black plastic.

At first it worked perfectly. Then vertical splintering started in the clear acrylic, slowly at first.

After searching for the ideal (functional, one that won't rust in my Brisbane climate) soap dispenser, Amazon wins out with this reasonably-priced and durable soap dispenser. The previous reviews are right: the spout is wide enough to fill soap easily from a bottle, the base is flat and has a rubber non-stick rim, and the spout is long and thin and offers a good stream of soap. I wish it came in other colors to distinguish hand soap from dish soap, but otherwise, no complaints (so far) with this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Progressive International Soap Dispenser","review":"The Progressive International Soap Dispenser works very well for us.

It has been leaking since May. It is now wasting soap and very messy and I am going to toss it and buy something different. It is unfortunate because I like the design, the rubber base that keeps it in place on the enamel sink rim, the clear acrylic container and the long handled spout. However, I believe the design of the long handled spout is what led to it's demise either in design, during manufacture, or just plain old regular use.I would not recommend this soap dispenser for that reason."},{"rating":"1","title":"Spout will not stay in","review":"My only problem with this dispenser is that the spout will not stay in. It is apparently held in by nothing more than a tight fit, but the fit isn't tight enough, and the depth to which the spout is inserted isn't deep enough to prevent it from wiggling and falling out at the slightest disturbance. This is the only problem I've had so far, but it's a big problem that renders the dispenser virtually unusable, as I have the push the spout back in every 5 or 6 pumps. The price is reasonably cheap, and you usually get what you pay for, but the product should at least be minimally usable. Perhaps I just got a defective one, but I am not keen to go to the trouble of trying a second version of this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Failed and leaked the entire bottle after only 6 months!","review":"The dispenser was not great to begin with, but its complete failure earns it just one star.After a few months I find that it leaked its entire contents all over the counter.

So not only do you have soap come out the end but also under the pump head. Its just was not properly manufactured and joined in this area. I dont want to be cleaning off the pump housing and top of the bottle. A great disappointment for a nice bottle otherwise.Perhaps I got a bad lot, and you may want to take your own chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best soap dispenser I've ever purchased...","review":"What you see it what you get. The long nozzle is great for reaching over into the sink basin and the clear acrylic bottle seems pretty tough. It has a rubber \\"no slip\\" base while the rest of the black is plastic. Well, there is a bit of \\"no slip\\" rubber on the pump. The nozzle is stainless. I put in some \\"ultra\\" dish soap which was too viscous for the return spring, making the pump return slowly.

Over the last few months, after I pump it fully to wash a sink of dishes, I come back an hour later and the dispenser is dripping soap.

Should have know. Both of the bottles acquired a crack from top to bottom, allowing soap to leak out. Never again. This is obviously an inferior product. I really like the pump spout being long.

I don't know why it's so difficult to find a decent soap bottle, and I've been looking for a while but unfortunately this one was a bust.Even when it was working (the first day or two), the spout was so long that it was difficult to figure out where to place your hands. Anyway, not recommended at all. The only reason I give it 2 stars is because it's not terribly expensive, and it's kind of nice-looking, but yeah, not functional at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful dispencers","review":"I purchased the first one and was so happy with it I bought three more.

Most important, the pump is ready to go at the first push, whether or not it's been used in awhile. Good value."},{"rating":"1","title":"1 star because it wont let me leave 0 stars","review":"This thing is garbage, lasted just long enough that I could not return it. The sides crack and soap leaks out, I could fix this but the plunger device also spews soap all over the sides.Do not buy, spend a few extra bucks and get something better. It is too bad too because the big plunger head and long nozzle are awesome in ergonomics, but terrible in design apparently. Either it has no seals or it is so cheap it just breaks.I had read some other reviews that said this happen so I tried to be gentle with it, it did not work and finally I got so fed up with constantly refilling and cleaning the sides I threw it out. Total waste of money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bathroom soap dispenser","review":"I've had this dispenser in the bathroom for a couple of weeks and so far it hasn't cracked or broken like other reviewers said happened to them. The only bad thing that i've noticed is it does tend to leak out of the nozzle a little bit sometimes but i think this depends on what kind of liquid soap you use in this dispenser. Overall it's not bad for the price and the long nozzle is great."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broken on delivery","review":"I would have thought a simple soap dispenser would be a pretty easy purchase. But, this thing never worked. I don't know how a company can sell something so horribly broken.I filled it up with soap and tried to test it. After 10 minutes of trying to \\"fill\\" the tube that led up to the top, I gave up. There isn't anything wrong with it as far as I can tell. It simply has a flawed design and I am guessing they hope to just sell it to people that don't read reviews.At $11, it's almost worthless to try to send it back.

Based on previous reviews I checked the spring in the pump part before I filled it to be sure it wasn't damaged. It was not. I rinsed out the dispenser and filled it with dish washing liquid and it is on our sink. We've had this for a few weeks now and it works great. It does not clog or drip. It looks great and holds almost 10 oz. We buy the big 40 oz soap from Costco and we will only have to fill this a few times. It has a great long nozzel so no mess on the sink. I am very pleased with this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rusty spout","review":"I am not happy with this purchase at all. I bought this dispenser because I thought it would be more attractive on my counter-top instead of a bottle of dishwashing liquid, plus more convenient to use since I would not have to pick it up when I need to wash a dish by hand. Unfortunately, the metal tip of the spout started rusting within a week of my using it and it just kept getting worse and is very unattractive! I am currently looking for a replacement dispenser that will not do the same thing. Buyer beware!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Plunger sticks.","review":"I bought two of these based on their good looks, long spouts, and great reviews.Unfortunately, I've found that the plunger on each sticks and needs to be pulledback up after each squirt.

Worth the few extra bucks."},{"rating":"1","title":"It broke after one and half month","review":"This dispenser worked well at the beginning, five star!!!

You would have to pull it up to get the pump working again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad design","review":"This soap pump is badly designed.

The first fell into my sink and the body cracked so soap would continuously leak from the crack. So Sad. I liked the design with the narrow profile that fit perfectly on the corner of my sink and the long spout that squirt way into the sink that I ordered another. Well, guess what? The second one fell into the sink and the body was cracked again!! I swear I am not a klutz. Nor am I rough on things! This is just made of a seriously brittle material. I could see if I forcefully threw it onto concrete it should break, but, for pete's sake, it fell 6 inches into my sink? I am making a plea to the manufacturers: Use a more durable plastic for the body of this dispenser and you would have a real winner.

It looks nice on the back of the sink but I'll have to buy an alternative."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best I've found","review":"It's been a chore finding a decent soap dispenser for the kitchen. Tried out several, and they all seem to suffer from some type of problem, be it a reluctant pump mechanism, poor ergonomics, leaks or, in the case of the electronic ones, faulty electronics.This one seems to be the best of the bunch. While it is not as attractive as the stainless ones, it's not bad looking at all. It's rimmed in black with a chrome nozzle, so it blends in well. Easy to fill and very much appreciate having a longer nozzle - it's handy when you want to squirt soap right into the sink without having to pick up the dispenser. The non-skid base is also a nice touch, and works well.I'm not sure of the long-term durability, but so far it works well. Given that it's plastic it probably would not survive a drop. But, good value for the price."},{"rating":"1","title":"a bit messy","review":"It's just the right size that I wanted. It works great, but the pump always leaks soap out of the top and then it is messy. You are constantly wiping it. If it didn't leak, it would be great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it..but could be better quality","review":"I bought this over 2 years ago because I didn't want anything heavy sitting on my sink for fear that if it was dropped, it may chip my sink. I'm not sure how the crack got in the plastic, but it is cracked from the lid to the bottom and my dish soap is running out onto my sink. I need to buy another one, but I'm not sure if I will buy this one again. But overall, for the money, it is a good buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Works good then breaks too soon","review":"I was thrilled with this when I got it. It was great.

This isn't either of those. Musically, this CD sounds exactly the same as the original songs. This band just did a bunch of SOAD covers and threw them on a CD. But this band [stinks], yeah sure they play the songs pretty well, anyone can do that, they dont change anything at all. So basically what you got is a CD where the only thing that really sounds different is the vocalist, and not a good one at that.

Don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Ever Get Stuck In The Sky...","review":"Well, it looks (and sounds) as if some musicians who love System just as much as I do got together and decided to create a tribute to them. System Of A Down definitely deserves a tribute album; hell, ... has a tribute album, and they pretty much suck. Anyway, this CD is alright, the vocals could be better though, I guess no one can match Serj's trademarked screams and roars, but musically the songs are pretty true to the originals. It would have been neat to see some well-known groups make a tribute album to SOAD, but for now, we'll have to settle for this.

I have several copies of the Fury of Achilles (which is an excellent Sword and Sandal film) and figured I wouldn't mind having another at the bargain price to get Ali Baba.When I popped the disc in to my player I was very upset by what I saw. This release by Alpha video is absolutely awful. The picture is terrible. The transfer of Achilles is soft and very snowy(and appears to be missing 3 or 4 minutes). Its the worst version of the film I own. The transfer of Ali Baba is severely scratched and at times you actually can see cracks in the source print. Its watchable,but with other versions of both titles out at bargain prices, why would anyone want to release such poor looking transfers?Take my advice do take a look at these two good sword and sandal films, just do it in different editions."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good starter reeds","review":"I have always found Ricos to be acceptable beginner reeds for students in their first year or two playing. If switching from a smaller sax (alto or tenor), it would be a good idea to get comfortable on baritone with a Rico and then move to a more expensive reed. The reeds are fairly consistent, and the lower price means that breaking a reed is not too much of an expense for whomever is footing the bill for reeds (teacher, student, school, parent...). The provided plastic cases do a good job protecting the reed, as long as they are not pushed in too far. I usually move students to Rico Royal (or even Vandoran) after their first full year or two.Amazon does have excellent prices on reeds - definitely recommend buying here!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Spiderman doesn't save the music world from Chad Kroeger","review":"\\"Hero\\" is the generic superhero song for a superhero movie.

It sounds like the background of an aerobics video.Yet it's great fun to listen to. Almost every one of the songs is instantly recognizable; you've heard them in TV shows, movies and cartoons if not on more conventional classical recordings. Grouping songs together by composer (Bach, Mozart, Mendelssohn, etc.) on some tracks really lets you hear the similarities between the songs and pick up on the composers' favorite themes (like Bach's use of scales).Anyway, all of the tracks are incredibly hummable, and the Hooked on Romance track is downright beautiful... it would make a great track to dance to."},{"rating":"2","title":"Introduction to Classical Music","review":"I listened to Hooked on Classics on a 45 rpm record in 1982.

Death is a part of the natural order of things and is shown in glimpses here, but it's done compassionately without the sometimes brutal blood and gore.The British narrator does a good job; his voice is easy to listen to. A very young child might have difficulty with the adult level vocabulary used in the narration, however. The photography is entertaining as is watching and learning about the different types of penguins.Although I enjoyed watching this film, it's not unforgettable and doesn't have the awesome grandeur found in some other films. The listed length of this video is sixty minutes, but it was at least ten minutes shy of that mark.Like penguins and seals? You probably can't go wrong with this film. Just don't expect to be awed."},{"rating":"2","title":"fun and educational","review":"I really like thefact that you can hear the documentary in both spanish and english.

We know penguins have it rough, but that can easily be conveyed through narration rather than (repeatedly) showing them dying horrible deaths. Overall, a depressing film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"This is an amazing book. Really. A psychological study of a character you either hate or fear you're becoming(or perhaps cheer on, depending on your emotional makeup).

I admit, the character is at the extreme end of any social problem, but anybody certainly can relate to feeling anxieties about talking to a girl or someone they like, even if it is on a much smaller scale.

I'm so glad he did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Magnetic Read","review":"Six Days In January\\" is magnetic, powerful, provocative and filled with heart. The author goes where no man has ever gone before in the new age of literary fiction romance. Bold and gripping this debut novel isn't easy to discard. The main character, William doesn't want any trouble. All he wants is a reciprocating lover of faith, and believer in romance and love itself. What he gets is incessant heartache, and deceit. This is the anthem, simply encased in novel form, for under appreciated, men that dare to sincerely claim sensitivity. This is the story of a loving man who can't seem to find the woman deserving of his love. They seem to want the \\"bad boy.\\" However, you are who you are and while the character attempts to be hard, and edgy, he can't. He can't sour in the midst of heartache, but makes the sweetness of grapes instead, feeding on what is single parent mother taught him. Respect, love, pleasure only, for the woman he loves. This a wonderful read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Job","review":"I won this book through Ze'Divas Website. I haven't even heard of the book until, she informed me that I won.

The pace is extraordinarily slow, seeing it is like watching paint dry. The theme seems to be: life is dull, and then you die. We follow Schultze from his work as a miner, then retirement in Germany, finally on his trip to the American Delta region. All of it is painfully boring. When he gets to America, things are supposed to get better, but I really didn't notice much difference. We don't even get to see much of him playing his accordion.
