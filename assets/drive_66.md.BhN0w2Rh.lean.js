If you furry friend doesn't like it you out practically nothing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible overall idea","review":"I have two cats, one of whom (a ragdoll) has very furry paws and constantly flings litter when she walks out of the box. I've tried large boxes, hooded boxes, litter mats, etc., and nothing really worked until I got a deep pile throw rug to put under the box. Now when she steps out she has to walk two feet across this rug, and 99% of the litter gets trapped, and doesn't get tracked all over the house.This box, on the other hand, seems like just another gimmick, and a very bad idea for cats. Cats shouldn't have to contort themselves to jump down into their litterbox, and especially for older cats, this can be difficult and may encourage them to go to the bathroom elsewhere. Also, this box is simply not big enough for the average-sized cat to do it's business and not step in it when it's done.Overall, a very bad idea."},{"rating":"1","title":"product description","review":"Well, i am in the market for an innovative cat box, and saw this one, however the review talks about how well it will clean your dogs teeth. i am not sure if the dog chews on the plastic while the cat uses the box, but it was not helpful for me deciding whether i liked it or not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I have 2 cats. They are about 10 to 12 pounds, and will be 13 years old in October. They love to kick and dig, and litter ends up all over my floor. Living in a small apartment, this was becoming unbearable. I figured I'd give this box a shot, since I'd tried just about everything else.It took them about a day and a half to get used to it. At that point, I felt comfortable throwing out the old, standard litter box they'd been using. It's AMAZING how much less litter I have to sweep up. It's almost none now! I LOVE this litter box -- and luckily, so do my cats :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clean litter room!","review":"My 2 14-week old kittens took to this new litter box immediately. It has cut down on the amount of litter tracked out of the box. It also prevents my Jack Russell and Rat Terriers from munching on treats out of the litter box! I would definitely recommend it and the price is about 30% less on amazon than at local stores."},{"rating":"2","title":"Works great, but expensive.","review":"Don't get me wrong, I would buy this again because it works so great for our cat and keeps the dog out. It also keep the litter in the box where it belongs. I only wish it weren't so expensive. It really is just a rubbermaid box with a hole in it. I would probably buy it again, though!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Best litter box ever.","review":"This is the best litter box I've ever purchased. I have 5 cats and all of them transitioned to these boxes without missing a beat. No more peeing over the sides and virtually no litter scattered around the house. Also no more problems with dogs getting into the boxes for \\"snacks\\". Truly a great product. I just wish I'd thought of it first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Five stars!","review":"So glad I bought this product. Before I had to vacuum the floor because the kitty would kick and track litter all over the bathroom. Now, this litter box keeps my bathroom floor virtually litter free, greatly reducing the need to sweep up after my kitty. There is very little tracking because of the deep covered design and the grooves located on the lid that trap litter on the cat's feet. And my cat adapted to it instantly. Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"My clever cats tipped this litter box over","review":"This litter box didn't work for me. After about 2 minutes of sniffing around, my cat put her paws on top of the box, which immediately caused it to tip over -- it's not very stable and it's top heavy, so it didn't take much. Also, since the top doesn't really latch on, the litter went everywhere.In theory this could be a good product, but the Clevercat people have some refinement to do."},{"rating":"2","title":"good litter box for my kitty, still looking for the best","review":"pros: very well made, sturdy box + great designcons: warning: 22+ pounders might not fit in there... :) the lid is little hard to open (to deter curious dogs?)my skinny kitty (9 lbs) took a week to use this new box. I was happy to throw out her older litter box, which had the litter tracking problem. this box certainly helps a lot but i still need to vacuum and wipe down the area around the box every day to keep it spotless. there is a lot less litter on the floor.maybe, it's just my kitty, because she does everything super fast. she would jump out the box without wiping her paws on the top of the box."},{"rating":"2","title":"Decent litter box...","review":"I got two kittens and thought that this litter box would work well to keep the litter inside the box. I still need to go in the laundry room and sweep up the litter about once a month. Also, sometimes my cats step in their do-do and then track it on the floors. This also hold a lot of litter which can get expensive. I generally put a half of a 30 lb bag in the container once a week. I hoped that I would have been able to use less litter but it is a very large box. Otherwise, I think it is great. It is easy to clean and the cats don't seem to care."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for BIG cats","review":"I bought this as a 2nd choice because the box that I wanted was not in stock at the pet store. It's nice in that a lot of litter doesn't spill out BUT once I put the top on they peed and pooped on the top and not in the box. Plus you can only have a little litter in the box or they can't get in the hole, so you're filling up every few days, which is hard on the back. The big cats need lots of room to maneuver and this doesn't have it. The one I plan to go back and get is a larger style front opening litter box that has a plastic door over the opening much like a hole in the door for a dog. It was the same price as this and this is not worth the price. Now it might be okay if you had a small kitten and trained it from the get-go."},{"rating":"2","title":"The most amazing litterbox","review":"I have been a cat owner for my entire life.....and also dislike litter all over my floor. Domed, uncovered, high-sided boxes.....none of them did the trick. With this one, my home does not have a speck of litter anywhere, including right outside and around the box. The only litter not in the box is a little bit on the cover that comes off of their paws as they exit it. When their paws brush against the treaded top, the tiny amount of litter remaining comes right off. I have my litter box in my bathroom and I can, for the first time, walk barefoot before and after bathing with no fear of litter pressing into the soles of my feet and grossing me out. In addition, I used to have to keep the window partially open to keep the bathroom smelling fresh. No more!!!! I will never purchase another box unless it is this one which grows legs and arms and happens to walk the litter out to the trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a happy kitty","review":"I bought two of these for my 5 cats. They hated it because they had to crawl inside and then stick their head out before they could go. Instead of going in the box they went on the floor so I took the lid off and now 3 of 5 will use it. The walls are also too high for them to use comfortably. I finally bought a large box with a low end at one side and also a breeze box. They pee in the breeze box and poo in the other box with crystals. (highly recommend Tidy Cat crystals and their breeze box!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Skeptical to Satisfied","review":"I was not keen on shelling out $35 for a tupperware but did so hoping this would release me from extreme cat box despair. The item performs well WITH CLAY LITTER which is all I have used. My current housing situation leaves me nowhere to stow the box (e.g., a basement, a closet) that would keep the trail of Feline Pine sawdust and clumping litter from getting all over my bathroom floor, my bed linens, etc. Bottom line is if you're in a confined space I highly recommend using clay litter with this product because you will never see a spec of litter on the floor. My cat took to this box right away."},{"rating":"1","title":"no way!","review":"i know, i like this idea too, but my cat would not go near it. i brought it home and left it empty in the living room for a couple days so my skittish cat could investigate, get used to it. he didn't want to have anything to do with it. i then put litter in it (with a poor fitting litter bag), took his old litter box away and put the clevercat in it's palce. he would not use the clevercat and i had to put the old litter box back in place."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Concept but the cats did not like it","review":"I really like the concept of this cat litter. High sides to keep everything in and fairly easy to clean. However, it ultimately comes down to your cat. I have two cats, one cat would use it and the other cat would not and decided to pee outside of the box. I also experimented with a typical open kitty litter box and the Clevercat and about 95% of the time the cats would use the open litter box. I really wish they had liked it but after a couple months of trying, the two Clevercat litter boxes are now up for adoption."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great cat box","review":"We are going to travel the USA with the cat and needed a cat box that would work in our trailer. This is a great box, the cat took to it right away. We just unpacked it and left it on the floor without litter, of course he thought we had bought it just for him, like he does everything we get, but this time it was his. He loved just sitting in it peeking out. I am thinking of getting another one for him just to play in. He has no problem using the box for it's purpose."},{"rating":"2","title":"So simple yet so effective","review":"Pretty much the best litter box I've ever used, and the cats didn't need any training to get used to the top entry.When they're inside they can spray pee everywhere and throw litter as much as they want, and there is no leaks ever, because the sides are one solid piece. It might not seem like a big deal, but it's a massive improvement if you ever had regular litter box with messy cats.The top entry is suppose to keep the litter from getting everywhere, and it sort of works, if your cat climbs out the top. If your cat jumps out of the hole then it doesn't help much.I was going to order this on amazon, but ended up getting it from Petco since I needed it that night. It was about the same price, $36.99 + tax."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for any Cop Shoot Cop fan!","review":"An exceptional feast of chaos.

Each color has it's own thread and you have to thread the needle, then you go through 4 holes and have to change the color, go through 4 holes and change the color, go through 2 holes and change the color, etc. You spend more time changing the yarn color than actually doing the needlecraft.

I would imagine that this project would take far less time with an older child.Also, since this takes a bit of coordination, the activity takes quite a bit of supervision to make sure the child doesn't get off track.Overall, I am very pleased with finding this kit.

The Hundred Days is excellent, not perhaps as good as some of his earlier novels in the series, but still very worthwhile reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Farewell Jack and Stephen. This great series is history.","review":"Buy 'Master and Commander' through 'The Yellow Admiral' and read them over and again - they may well be the high point of your reading life.

If only POB and Norton had warned us."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT UP TO PAR","review":"This book does not meet the standards set by the rest of the series. It appears to have been rushed to the point that we lose the character interface that makes the other books so good. Hopefully the next book will go back to the pattern he established with all the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"spoilers here; but DONT read other reviews if you haven't read this book","review":"I have criticisms of many of the reviews here. Reviewers, type 'spoiler' for gosh sake. Have some decency; presumably review perveyors haven't read the damn thing. Anyway, to answer a few:Dianna's death was absolutely necessary. Cripes, it sets up the next novel. You can see her death coming books ago.I too have a problem with Bonden's death; I guess he felt the character tragic, and it was time to die. I think it was a stupid move. Bonden has as much right as Killick to continue on.I think from some researching that O'Brian WAS ill through much of this book. However, it is still eminently endorsable.The last two chapters I thought are very well done (O'Brian finishes a book better than anyone). And Jacob is a great character."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as exciting as its predecessors.","review":"As a true O'Brian fan who devoured the first 18 books in this series, I can tell you #19 was a disappointment. I was bored most of the time and couldn't get involved in the story at all. O'Brian's writing seemed perfunctory at best, and the cavalier way in which he did away with both Diana Villiers and Barrett Bonden shocked me. I'm not giving away any major plot twists here, because there weren't any -- they just died. I'm disappointed in Mr. O'Brian but will read #20, hoping he will return to true form. If not, maybe he should quit while he's still sort of ahead, so those of us who love the series will reread it fondly and treasure it forever without it being tarnished."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great reader; poor editing of material.","review":"We made the mistake of buying this ABRIDGED version of The Hundred Days, not noticing the FINE PRINT.

Having read the first 18 volumes, this one simply must of been ghost written.

Jack must first sail through the Adriatic ports and sink and destroy any one who plans to join Napoleon.I personally did not like the book. The book moved to slowly, and was about something that I'm not really interested in. However, people who are interested in war stories and sailors would enjoy this book. Someone who is excited by Napoleon might also like the book. With a little more action and a faster pace, this would be a great novel.

And we did not want the extra wiring to mess with. This has been a good choice for our family. The only thing that I am not pleased with, is the first few seconds when the TV is turned on, the color is more red than it should be. But it is only for a few seconds, and I am the only one that seems to notice. Everyone in the family can work the remote easily, this was a concern since the TV,VCR and DVD controls are all separate on the remote. Sharp has done a good job with the remote control displays."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than most","review":"This is a pretty good clipper guard. I really like how the metal clip is spring loaded so it can fit many different clipper blades. The plastic is also very hard, not flimsy like most guards out there. The only drawback is that the spring can be too weak at first causing the guard to detach from the blade. However, once the clipper blades form a slight groove in the plastic, that should solve that problem. All things considered, I am very satisfied with this product, and I have not seen a better replacement attachment after ordering several."},{"rating":"2","title":"It fits.","review":"I bought this for my Oster Golden A% for personal (not professional use).

I suspect one day he'll be singing them to his little one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shoot me in the head","review":"I understand that this music may have sentimental value to those out there that grew up on it, but for those of us that didn't, it's excruciating. My 18 month old son seems to like it and I like the values and lessons that Palmer conveys, so I didn't give this 1 star. Palmer sounds like he is stoned out of his mind and the songs are slow and repetitive. When a kid discovers music that he/she likes, they want to listen over and over and over again. The best children's music should be at least minimally palatable to parents. This is not, unless the parent has a sentimental attachment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hap Palmer","review":"Had one of these before and played it so much that many of the songs were skipping.

Using a pool frisbee myself, we acted out the motions cued in this song. There is a second circle song on this CD. We used that song with the pool frisbees, too. The kids LOVED this activity! So much fun! Construction paper circles would also work and be less expensive and more spontaneous. The song \\"Sammy\\" is another excellent participation song, which is dearly loved by the children. This song invites the children to imitate the way animals move. I haven't actually tried the other nine songs on this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music for preschoolers","review":"I have taught in early childhood ed for almost 30 years. Hap Palmer's music is some of the best that I have ever used. This particular CD is wonderful for the start of school. I just used it this week and the children really responded and enjoyed the music and actions. I do not see many out there that offer the same quality. I also bought 2 other Hap Palmer Cds and will be using all threee all year long. Definitely worth the money and I love Amazon's free shipping over $25.00.

Mostly stemming from classically trained artists with an art school aesthetic, the label featured artists who were experimenting with industrial/electronica sounding music.The label is now defunct as the founders have moved on to other pursuits, though Darrin Verhagen's website has most of the back catalogue available for purchase.Ignore the \\"trance\\" and \\"tribal\\" tags and all that has come to mean.

Once you start digging in, you'll want to go deeper.Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst Book That I Have Attempted to Read in a Long Time","review":"I read the prologue, and hated it. The prose was unintelligible and clumsily written. However, I decided that I should give the book more of a chance, and attempted to read the next several chapters. The novel only became more painful, both stylistically and with its utter lack of coherent plot.The \\"protaganist\\" is pleased that his betrothed is killed in a horrible accident, so he is free to pursue his \\"higher purpose\\" of being an artist. He also appears to view everything by color, which is described in horrendously bland articulation by Overall.This was absolutley the worst book that I have attempted to read since 'Lucrezia Borgia: A Novel' by John Faunce. In fact, it is possibly worse, as I could not even manage to get past the third chapter."},{"rating":"1","title":"COPS turned bounty hunters","review":"I knew Carradine was having trouble getting parts, but after watching this mess I think he really needs to give it up.

I'll admit, I was really expecting this product to do an excellent job, because I've seen other drain stoppers that would suddenly stop a whirlpool from forming, but here's the difference, the good ones I've seen in the past were made of RUBBER; this one is simply a thick, inflexible plastic cover that doesn't do its job. I tested this in my bathtub and instead of actually blocking out water, it was seeping some of the water in because the stopper wasn't fully sealing out the water. So, each time I have to use this, I have to keep putting my foot onto the \\"lid\\" so it'll stop draining.

The pin for the lid is cheap and the hing will likely break. The card (actual compass part that spins) wobbles a lot so it's difficult to get an exact bearing. It is like the oil in the compass is very thin. Also, the direction line lid spins easily, making it possible to take a bad reading. Ironically, this is the Silva weakness as well.If you need an inexpensive engineer style compass, consider the Silva. For a two more dollars, you get an aluminum case, a hinge that won't break and a card that doesn't wobble with the slightest hand movement."},{"rating":"2","title":"decent enough for a compass","review":"I must admit I like it. The compass is very precise and the brass case feels nicer to hold than a plastic case. Outside of that, the compass does and feels like it should.

Enough said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor quality construction","review":"The first time I used it the little magnifying lens in the eyepiece popped out without even touching it! Luckily I found it and managed to superglue it back into place. Also, the compass seems very slow to respond to positional changes, as if over dampened or under magnetized. Although it feels very sturdy with the nice metal case, I have a plastic compass that works better. This is more of a showpiece than something I would want to be relying on when lost in the woods."},{"rating":"2","title":"classic horror in the time when horror was the rage.","review":"People give this movie a hard time because the special effects dont compete with the ones of today.

While the short story had a building atmosphere of dread and horror, the movie had an atmosphere of pure cheeze. King's story was short (like 10-20 pages) and sweet, w/ sinister children and a mysterious god / monster in the cornfields. The movie has a town full of annoying brats and a cheap beasty that caused much eye-rolling and laughter. The running time is 90 minutes, including about an hour's worth of padding.

Steer as far away from this as possible!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Another King story trashed","review":"This film actually begins quite well, although the little kid narrating it kind of made it lose the creepy feeling you had in the opening credits. The movie is actually fairly entertaining until after our two main characers enter the house of our youthful narrator and his sister. Up until this sour turn in events, it's a fairly noble adaption. And then the story is wrecked, from the, al I can think of is: \\"toned down\\" ending, tothe lame interpretation of \\"He who walks Behind The rows\\". Why do screenplay writers feel they must always change the master of horror's story around? Everytime they do it trashes what could've been a promising film. I've seen it in Dreamcatcher and The Tommyknockers, although this sucked already anyway. It also brings to mind: Why did they feel inclined to make a sequel? Hollywood sickens me sometimes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your time, and read the short story!","review":"I admit when I was six years old, this movie was a little creepy and made me think twice before passing a cornfield. Now, I look at it and wonder how I even made it past the second scene without falling asleep. The only tense scene in this movie is when Joseph is running through the cornfield. Other then that, it's a movie to watch when you're bored and having nothing better to do. It's not scary, and Isaac's ranting and raving can get on your nerves after awhile. If you want good horror, then read the short story by Stephen King."},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably the worst of all the King adaptations!","review":"Riddle: What do you get when you cross stupid adults, illogical action, ridiculous dialogue with some of the worst acting done by kids in all of history? No it's not outtakes from \\"The Brady Bunch\\".If a person after reading this review actually wants to sit through this film, I won't give away the ending. Supposedly based on a short story by Stephen King (even he should disown this) it is one of the funniest since PLAN 9 FROM OUTER SPACE.A group of kids own a town through a \\"religious cult\\". A couple \\"wanders\\" into the town called Gatlin and the stupidity begins. The adults keep mentioning that they should go to Hemingsford and one keeps hoping they will. Take my advice-if you want to put up with this kind of trash, wath re-runs of \\"The A-Team\\". One of the funniest lines in this one is: \\"He was already dead when he stumbled out on the road\\". Don't bother!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too violent","review":"I did not finish this movie. Too much spattered blood.I thought it would be more creepy than violent. Recent news makes children and violence less tolerable than it used to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Silly attempt at horror","review":"Being a fan of Stephen King's works, I was willing to give this movie a try. I was severely letdown. This ranks as one of the worst horror movies I've ever seen.The story begins as all the kids in the town of Gatlin murder all the adults. Then two adults stumble across the town and soon find themselves stalked by the sickle-toting children.I found the movie impossible to be believe. This movie is just not scary. I can't seem to figure how Linda Hamilton got through this movie with a straight face.I read in Stephen King's biography that Stephen King declared this one of the worst movies ever made.Enough said."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Adaption","review":"The acting was terrible! There were so many holes in the plot. The character development in the short story was completely missing from the movie. I didn't care about the characters in the movie.

I was easily caught up in the two adult characters and their journey into this Nebraska town.Small surprises, funny lines, and interesting (yet oddly strange) villains create a memorable movie. It's not a movie to analyze, just a fun horror flick without much gratuitous nudity or language--refreshing these days."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not What I was looking For...","review":"I would not say this book is terrible-there is alot of good stuff in the last few chapters to educate all-I was just a little disappointed in what seemed to me the long drawn out story of Ms. Ross. I applaud her for her courage to reach out to those in need and share her experiences but, I think less of her story would have gotten the point across.Maybe someone who is in a situation similar to hers would find some comfort here.There is alot of information in the later chapters for therapists who are unfamiliar with suicide grief to benefit from and would greatly help those in need with such."},{"rating":"2","title":"FUNKY SOUL VERY RARE","review":"YEAH THIS IS ONE OF THEM HARD TO FIND CDS THE MUSIC SOUNDS LIKE SOME FUNKY FUNKY SOUL ROUGH SMOOTH AT TIMES JAZZY FEEL WHAT EVER HAPPEN TO THIS GROUP WHY DIDNT THEY NEVER REALLY MAKE IT TO THE BIG TIMES?A MUST HAVE IN YOUR CD OR LP COLLECTION"},{"rating":"1","title":"Maybe the most over-rated book of recent times.","review":"It's perhaps due to my limited knowledge of mythology, or maybe just bad timing, but this was a waste. Read in '92, I still wonder what I'm missing, given all the hype back then. Banters on and on, and probably written while in herringbone. Couldn't help but feel that taken by his own heightened self-importance. Premise is sterling. To me though, the execution was brutally boring and tautologous. I'm certain that we're all better-off reading the classics themselves"},{"rating":"1","title":"OK if read from the point of a passive observer","review":"I really enjoyed his analysis of the story, and the practical applications he made. Unfortunately, this gets drowned in long winded Joseph Campbellesque tangents (very long winded and tiring at times-like the several pages on hair...ok! we get it!). I used these sections to practice my speed reading.If he would have dwelled more upon the story in question and the direct application, making brief mention of mythological links when really needed, it would have been a much more powerful book.All such soul-searching books should, in my opinion, be read with a grain of salt (hence, the title of this review). A point that may be truly inspiring for one person could be stunting for another. If you want to read it, read it passively and then take away any points that inspire you-otherwise, realize that no poet, historian, mythologist, etc., is the master of your soul."},{"rating":"2","title":"The work of wisdom.","review":"most of our contemporary men are getting far from the elders.they think that old men are unaware of thier problems and psycological problems.Robert Bly is a very wise elder that addresses comprehensivly what matters the youngmen of the day.I advice evry young man to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why would a woman read a book about men?","review":"This book is about the sacredness of male development. The information herein is directly related to the Columbine shootings, the maryland sharpshooters and Omaha. These men, or boys, lacked a self that could only be expressed in violence. Bly says many times, violence is good. Violence is righteous when expressed in correct ways. The warrior mystique is something lacking in american soldiers who have been turned into murderers thanks to technology.I gave it four stars because segments of the book are filled with psychological mumbo jumbo. There are areas where Bly really stretches to connect the now with the mythology of the past."},{"rating":"1","title":"Garbage","review":"I'm not going to make this long. Summed up, this is a must read for me in a gender and politics class. I'm halfway through the second chapter and it is by far the worst book I have ever TRIED to read. I say tried because you have to be stephan hawking to understand the booring physchobable. This book is not interesting or even well written. While he makes good points about what I call the pussification of American men, he goes onto bable about stories about hairy men who live underwater. Simply put I will not resell this book, I will in fact destroy it after the semester so no one can blame me for wasting their time. If you have small man complex or are a mama's boy this may be the book for you. If you are a normal American man, stay away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Iron Pap","review":"Yet another guru of self-actualization selling a quick and easy way to manhood. Sorry, it takes more than sitting around a campfire with the guys and talking about your relationship with your father. Manhood is about growing up and taking responsibility for yourself and others and putting your family's interests above your own; no amount of silly ritual will substitute for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"In the end, it's just another fairy tale","review":"This book looked good, perhaps insightful, maybe even fascinating... until I got to the point where the guy started quoting Bruno Bettlehiem. While most people aren't going to be familiar with the name, Bettlehiem was an expert on folklore and mythology who tried to pass himself off as a reputable psychologist. He ruined the lives of millions of people by stating unequivocally, with nothing but a hunch and his collection of fairy-tails to back him up, that autism (a neurobiological condition present in-utero) was actually the result of bad mothering.It was then that I realized that maybe fairy tails, such as the fairy-tale of Iron John, can tell us something... but we shouldn't assume that just because something is old that it's Timeless Wisdom. This is especially true as the fairy tales and myths explored in this book are all the products of patriarchal cultures. Ultimately, although this book is \\"food for thought,\\" I wouldn't consider it a complete meal."},{"rating":"1","title":"A thinking man's chauvenism","review":"Bly's masturbatory rambling in Iron John is an utter waste of a reader's time. He makes some quasi-valid points about problems with male roles in society, but just when he approaches a solution, he slips into cryptic metaphor that is neither interesting nor useful. And, when glancing at the book's jacket, I wondered what qualifications a man who dresses like a Renaissance-era jester has to tell me how to be a man."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"This book is the victim of a stuffy psycho-babbling author, and gives no real credit to men in general and even less to woman. And it goes on about bizarre analogies that make no sense to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can't recommend this book highly enough","review":"I had started and stopped reading Iron John at least half a dozen times. It was recommended to me by a doctor many moons ago, but it wasn't till I started to go through a divorce that I finally put it back into my queue of books to read. I'm so glad that I did. This book is different. It isn't going to hold your hand and tell you what you need to do to become a \\"man\\", but at the same time it is. For me it was almost eerie reading some of the passages. Bly not only explains why you are the way you are, but he also gets into the age you can start seeing some of the impacts of events in your life. At least for me he was spot on. There are so many good reviews on this book already and I honestly doubt my ability to really do the book justice; so let me just say that Iron John is a book that I plan on reading again and again. It really is a different type of book, but it is also a book that will take you on a journey."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love this old book!","review":"Love this book which has been around for quite some time. It changed my thinking about men, masculinity and many things male."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought Provoking","review":"Bly finds in \\"Iron John\\" the universal themes of men and their development. A mans life is usually not pretty or just. He struggles throughout and endures much suffering. It almost appears that the rough trail defines a part of manhood. It seems harder today for men to honestly find a garden that hasn't been spoiled by politically correct thinking or bias. The Universities that once fostered free thinking have had to defend themselves for their openness. I find Adult Ed. courses to be the best, under the radar, classes for cultivating in a walled garden. It's ashame public education has become so out of touch with the needs of boys and young male adolescents. Bly taps into the buried psyche of men with his discussions about descent and grief, the King and the God-Woman. This book helps men understand their wounds better as well as their fathers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Book is an amalgamation of references and makes no point","review":"Most frustratingly, Bly really has nothing to recommend, that's the sad part. I think we all know how important a good Dad is, and hopefully that's all what Bob wanted to say... although he never stated it (i guess no one would buy a book with one sentence inside)"},{"rating":"2","title":"A review from a divorced man.","review":"Me and any other divorced man would insist that the responsible partner for the broken relation is the woman ,in fact,reading the painful lessons in the IRON JOHN journey would open the eyes into all the mistakes deeply present in the psyche of modern men.The book is the first step for the man to make the true change psychologically,the step for the right manhood."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent examination of the truth for men.","review":"The book is so comprehensive in it's examination for all the emotional conflicts suffered by men. Even if these wounds have serious impacts on the personality,knowing the cause is part of the cure.Evryman has to read the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must Read","review":"I met my father after 24 years and this was the first book he handed to me. With not having a father around when I was growing up this book gave me alot of in-site on what it is to have initations when you are growing up. This is a book that you must read where ever you are your journey."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh Myth, can you explain this to me?","review":"Robert Bly is a quirky poet whose work I have always enjoyed both for its personal vision and for its unflenching honesty. But this - Iron John: A Book About Men - has me totally puzzled. I read it. I don't get it. I really see no connection with what is dealt with in this book and my life as a 'man'. Certainly not in any way that is useful. If I worked really hard, maybe I could see some suggestions of something that would be personally meaningful, but nothing about the book prompts me to work that hard. A friend joked that this was 'Lord of the Flies for Adult Guys,' but I think even that is more cogent than the suggestive message of the book.I will continue to read Bly's poetry, but won't waste my time on any more of this male soul searching stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!!!","review":"This book helps you through many questions that come up on our thirties. Helps us understand the initiation process which many of Us don't have when we need it, and to understand why a single/divorced/widowed mother will never be a \\"Father-mother\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Men Read Iron John","review":"This book had been recommended to me for years. Finally, at the suggestion of my samuri sword teacher, I picked it up and read it in long sittings. What I like first and foremost about Iron John is that it combines memoir, translation, poetry, mythology and journalism all in one book and then delivers powerful messages about men's individuation from mother and journey into manhood. It not only provides a new vision of psychology and archetyping, but does so by dissecting the old, cross-culturally familiar \\"Wild Man.\\" It helped me to better understand men's psychology and their initiation and rituals into manhood. It also provided me with thematic ideas to explore in my own fiction."},{"rating":"2","title":"Iron John helps men identify the voids in their reality","review":"I am writing this 1/2 way through the book, but so far I am impressed with Bly's ability to tie the meaning behind ancient fairy tales and traditions which bound men and boys together with the social ills that result today from the lack of these ties. I found the book really struck a resounding chord for me, perhaps moreso because I was raised by my mother and grandmother in a fatherless household until the age of ten. The book helped me understand some things about myself that I had not realized and led to some productive self-reflection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helped me understand my relationship with my dad & my son.","review":"I tried to read Iron John a few years ago and found it much too heavy. However, I picked it up again last month (April 99) and I really enjoyed it. My dad is still alive at 85 and I have a son of almost 16. I had older mentors in my life, my maternal grandfather, a very old uncle and of course my Dad. I am now 47 and have mentored many people in work through the years, and I have been a sunday school teacher, a sports coach, and a youth group leader. I do believe mentoring is such an important part of 'growing up' and feel sad for those of us who have not had mentors in our lives. I can see more clearly now why some of the situations between my son and my wife happen .... I do so hope she reads Iron John. I have recommended Iron John to most of my male friends. Robert Bly makes this a very interesting read. Although,I found I had to re-read some sections to let the point sink in .... it IS quite a heavy book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Man Book","review":"This book is good for the mythological history that goes into the ceremony of becoming a man, and the lack of our own threshold in America to offer our young men. It is good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Filled With Metaphor and Meaning","review":"This book came out when men's groups were everywhere. The myths and metaphors in this book are very powerful but you don't have to be a seasoned member of a men's group to understand it. You do, however, need to possess a working knowledge of psychology in order to grasp the meaning. If you are a man who comes from a seriously dysfunctional family, you will benefit greatly from this book. It explores the emotional geography of being a man and dealing with the complex feelings that come from even the slightest abuses. It is a bit heavy on myth, though. I had Louise Hay to guide me...I wish there were a male equivalent of her for men."},{"rating":"2","title":"it's the true story of all contemporary men.","review":"it's difficult sometimes to face the truth,iron john tells the true facts about the psychology of all men in the recent times.The book will lead you to some dark feilds ,but concluding the truth at the end will make you feel healed and releived ,i advice every young man to read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huh?","review":"I may be the elephant in the room here, but quite frankly I found this book to be a crashing bore. Out of the thousands of books that I have read in my lifetime I can count on one hand those that I have not finished and this is one of them. I get the point that the author is trying to make and heartily agree with the plight of men and what our society has done to the concept of \\"manhood\\" but trying to get through this piece of literature was like being stuck in cement and waiting to be rescued."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pious Vision of Academia Elite","review":"I winced several times at the author's casual leftist remarks in the preface, but when he called Ronald \\"Reagan a sort of mummified version of a dogged type... underneath the charm and bluff there remains much isolation, deprivation, and passivity. Unless he has an enemy, he isn't sure he is alive,\\" Bly began to lose me. This incongruent insertion is on page one and things go downhill from there. Bly starts in that smug, elitist place Thomas Sowell writes about in his \\"annointed vision\\" books.

Hap Palmer is so child-friendly; his voice is pleasant, the tunes are singable for non-singers and, if you find yourself humming them, you won't be embarrassed (although if you start singing \\"my mommy comes back\\" out loud on the bus, don't blame me for the funny looks you get!)

The next 2 seemed to burn fine, then 1 failed to burn. Upon further investigation the 2 that seemed to burn fine would not play in my DVD player, in fact, they would no longer even work in my DVD burner. The last of the 7 dvd's burned fine (at least the dvd player recognizes the dvd, haven't watched it yet). So when its all said and done, of the 7 disks I purchased for $25cdn only 2 worked.

I play Battlefield 2 and that's mainly why I bought the G5 mouse. It is very smooth, but I have had plenty of problems.For starters, the mouse cord is braided, which makes it MUCH stiffer than any other mouse cord I have ever seen. It restricted movement so badly, I used a razor blade and cut off the braided sleeve. That solved the problem, but God only knows who ever thought it a good idea to make a stiff mouse cord.I still do not have the software working adequately. I cannot get the resolution to change properly in-game. Additionally, I was having terrible lag in-game when trying to utilize a thumb button as a keystroke command.The scroll wheel is harder to rotate than other mice. Plus, the wheel click requires you to push down with at least twice as much force as any other mouse I ever had.I do like the way the mouse feels in my hand, but I would never buy another and I cannot recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Mouse I've Ever Owned","review":"This is the first \\"high-end\\" mouse I've ever owned. It's hard to justify spending $50-ish for a mouse when you can get one for $10. So ten dollar mouses is what I'm comparing this to, and it totally justifies the price difference. The weight (adjustable, of course) feels great, the texture of the scroll wheel, the rubber sides, the way it fits your hand, everything about it is perfect, it's the mouse equivalent of a Lexus with all the options. I've found the adjustable resolution to be mostly a gimmick (and yes I play the exact type of games you would use it for, UT2K4, for example), but it doesn't do any harm to have it.

Mine was also unfortunately broken out of the box. Kudos to Amazon for their great and simple return policy. The main problem was that the mouse would cease to function and I would have to plug in and unplug again and again to get it to work again. After the second day the mouse stopped working altogether. The adjustable weight idea is an interesting concept, and the mouse is somewhat ergonomic (though to be honest I preferred the feel of my cheaper Microsoft Intellimouse Explorer 4.0).

They usually require a metallic surface to stand upright, but some balancing can be done to get them to stand on their own. Having magnetic hands makes it fun to have them hold objects like screws, nails, paper clips, to look like miniature swords, bows, instruments, or whatever your imagination wants.

They're so tight with the changes and the blistering speed of some of the songs makes one think they took massive amounts of speed to achieve such realms of metalness. Most of their other releases are a little blurred and lose their individuality after a while but all the songs on this are so different and don't lose their punch. Plus, you really can't beat the cover art."},{"rating":"1","title":"C'MON","review":"I can't beleive people on this site take this band's music seriously this is total noise.What the hell is wrong with you people.This band is sick and nasty for the sake of getting attention.The-y have nothing important to say or Growl about.The guitars areweak and annoying.The people that say this band have talent orjust as stupid this is nonsense,Barnes might as well speak inspanish,it's almost like these death bands are trying to make uptheir own languege.Now I don't have a problem with death metal.Ilike some.But this is annoying music with sadstic,nasty,perverselyrics that will only appear to stupid,pot-smokin,a**holes whodon't know what true metal is.Now as far as death metal that isactually good-Barnes later project Six Feet Under and Obituarythat is all.Listen to those bands don't waste time with this over-hyped band that are about as listenable as fingers down a chalkboard or even worse rap music(well maybe not that bad)."},{"rating":"1","title":"These Guys Are A Joke!!!","review":"Man, this cd and ALL of Cannibal Corpse's cds SUCK!

Now it's just sad. These 'duuuuudes' sound like they're foaming at the mouth or something. This isn't death metal. This isn't even music...If you really want death metal, check out Fear Factory, In Flames, Opeth, Sepultura, Gardenian, Soilwork, Entombed, even Eminem. He's more 'death metal' than this tripe. Who listens to this? Fear Factory's first album is death metal, too. It's intelligent, diverse, and to the point. Its lyrics are actually good, too. Oh, and it's heavier than this crap.

Yes its highly disturbing, fun, campy, over the top. Do you see where I am going with this?

When I think of death metal, Cannibal Corpse is the first name that comes to mind. I am sick of people saying \\"it's just noise and screaming\\" about death metal, or even just heavy metal. This is an art, wether it is an art of \\"noise\\" I dont know, but death metal is one of the most, if not THE most talented genre in the whole musical horizon. And to the author of the review \\" More Of The Same Garbage!\\": Maybe everybody can scream(this is not just screaming), but can anybody play blistering fast blast-beats with double bass going twice as fast behind it? Can anybody pull off the insanely fast guitar and bass lines featured on this album? No!

My favorite piece has to be the melodic part on Post Mortal Ejaculation starting from 2:05 and ending at 2:45; it's just absolutely great!Highlights: Hammer Smashed Face, I Cum Blood, Necropedophile."},{"rating":"2","title":"And people consider EMO and Nu Metal to be heavy......","review":"true death metal from the heart !!!a couple nice bass linesjust a great mosh fest"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great music for relieving stress!!","review":"I love the music that these guy's produce, and have been a fan of theirs since 1992. In my opinion this is their best album with their former vocalist Chris Barnes (currently in Six Feet Under, and Torture Killer). It has a clearer sound than it's previous album \\"Butchered at Birth\\", and is also faster. The vocals are the deepest ever produced on any Cannibal Corpse album. This is a great death metal album for anyone who may appreciate early brutal and gory death metal. I compare this stuff to a horror film (slasher/serial killer type), it's basically the same content."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite album by Cannibal Corpse","review":"This is my favorite album by Cannibal Corpse. The production is simply great. You even get alot of low end fidelity. The Bass is clearly recognizable and sounds great. Alex Webster is a beast on the bass guitar. Paul plays the drums very fast. The blast beats are varied and played at many numerous tempos. Bob Rusay and Jack Owen play heavy chunky riffs with lots of harmonics and squealing guitar solos. Chris Barnes does some of his best vocal work on this album. He even adds some nice screams to mix it up a bit. The lyrics are at their grossest. I feel that the lyrics are very creative though. Topics such as infanticide, disembowelment, cranial bludgonment, necrophilia and of course zombies. The cryptic stench is a nice surprise on the second half of the album. The lyrics are about vampireism! All in all this is one of those albums where every member contributes to the whole and a great classic album is made. It is one of my favorite albums of all time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Stuff","review":"When Tomb of the Mtilated came out, it sold like hotcakes, especilly in florida where most of these talented death metal acts come from. The album received so much recognition that they managed to appear in jim carrey's classic Ace Ventura Pet Detective which was filmed in florida. Cannibal Corpse can be seen on the film performing Hammer Smashed Face, the first track on this album. This is one of their best albums and should be in every death metal fans collection!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"3 stars, not 2!!","review":"This CD definitely lies directly on the line of being average. The instrumentals are okay, but nothing too technically complex. Barnes' vocals include a unique grindcore style and are actually sort of impressive at times.Still, though, the album gets to sound a bit too much alike when attempting to listen the whole way through. After awhile, it gets a bit dissappointing.I think with a bit more complexity given to the instrumentals and varation in songs, CC could've had a smash hit CD...but unfortunately, that's not how it went...so I give this album 3 STARS (once again, not two) for mediocrity and potential."},{"rating":"2","title":"thwe uncut version is frigin sweet!","review":"i cant belive ppl cry how dumb or gross this is its all fun music to me good heavy music with thunderpous drum beats and vocals and crazy album cobers very recomended great hewavy mu"},{"rating":"2","title":"THEIR SECOND BEST ALBUM.","review":"From start to finish this is one brutal and epic album.The songs are extremely heavy and well done.Chris barnes vocals are at their peak here and his songwriting is as sick as ever.There are alot of people who simply cant handle the heavyness or subject matter of this cd.Objectively,you cant deny that they are really talented artists who create extreme music for people who can think for themselves.GO OUT AND BUY THIS TODAY!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"This CD Is awesome but I only have 1 complaint.

Barnes rules. Definitely one of m favorite death vocalists. Jack Owen is absolutely incredible, and makes up for the [terrible] guitar presence of since departed other guitarist Bob Rusay. Alex Webster is bar none the most talented bassist in metal. Mazurkiewicz hs always been a bit sloppy with the blast beats, but he none the less rules at groove and double-bass, and groovy this album gets. The opening breakdown from \\"I Cum Blood\\" is crushingly heavy, and although some of the stuff has been sped up from the last two records, Cannibal's sound has definitely become tighter and smoother with each passing album. This, Butchered At Birth and Eaten Back To Life will stand as Cannibal's masterpieces, sorry Corpsegrinder."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"This CD Is awesome but I only have 1 complaint.

You should be locked up even for suggessting some of the stuff they sing about.

Not only does he sing about it, he does it so graphically that you wonder how truly demented this guy is. Almost all the songs involve the rape and torture of women and just horrid graphic content. And like most people complain about CC, their drumming sucks, the vocals are more like low rumble grunts and the 2 power chorde songs lack any types of musicianship. You should be ashamed to listen to this stuff. You are admitting that you are just as twisted as the people who sing it.

No offense, but I really don't like the growling as vocals. The lyrics are stupid but that's not even the problem. I'm not one of those people who says \\"Death metal is disgusting and is just noise\\". I definitely respect it as music. I guess death metal is just a bit too extreme for me, I really can't stand those vocals. I don't mean that theres no talent here, because there definitely is. There aren't any nu-metal 2 and 3 chord riffs here, the songs are complex and technical. These guys are great at what they do, which is to play death metal, it's just not my style.

Very fast, yes. Organized? No. It sounds like they walked into the studio, started playing random guitar chords, and had Paul beat the hell out of his drumset, and add Barnes' animalistic death growl.

But the fact remains, this album is terrible. With the exception of the awesome guitarwork in Hammer Smashed Face and the better production of the instruments, there are no positive aspects. The vocals are worse than on any album CC has done and sometimes don't even line up with the music, as if there was a major tracking error during recording. The solos are sloppy and the riffs in general are unrefined. The lyrics/song titles are at the peak of perversion, though it's impossible to understand them without a lyric sheet.

This particular cable did not see a lot of daily wear and tear, in fact nearly none, yet it failed after about 6 months. I suppose the nice thing about digital cabling is that they either work or don't. There's no in-between.

In it, Paul Little discusses several key points of Christianity, such as the rationality of God, and conflicts between science and Scripture. He uses logical and easily followed arguments in his defense of the Christian faith.The book is very well organized and Little does an exceptional job at defending Christianity at its core. He focuses on the most common questions he received while discussing Christianity at college campuses and they shape an excellent argument. Though it is a relatively short and basic book, Little effectively makes his points and includes many references to additional studies of each of the 12 major arguments in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book everyone should have","review":"This is a book I've had in my personal library for 25 years.

I had this stroller 6 months, it was so sad that when I tried selling it at a yard sale I only got 2 dollars for it.

Ran it out the window and pointed it in the direction of the station I was trying to pick up - not any better. The signal continually goes in and out every two to three minutes.

I tried the antenna on two FM receivers in two separate rooms of my New York City apartment.

Very clear and pics up all the stations in the area as it should. If you are looking for an FM antenna, buy this. AM, don't waste your money, this thing is a peice of crap.

While it was able to get some weaker analog signals in, the Terk Antenna did not pull in any HD radio stations, which was what it was advertised for. As my location could be a factor in the reception of these signals (26 miles away from the broadcast tower farm), it is surprising that the loop antenna provided by the manufacturer of the HD tuner was more effective in pulling in stations.

After 9-11-01 our country needs unity more than ever. However, there is a dedicated movement at work today which is seeking to divide our people more than any movement I have seen over the past fifty years, the racial reparations movement. As is our custom, we have always shunned movements and leaders who seek to make the children responsible for the sins of their fathers and mothers. Somehow some of us have forgotten this important principle when the subject of African-Americans became linked with the reparations idea. We must not forget our principles, and David Horowitz has taken up the task of arousing us to assert those principles once again in this important controversy!

Horowitz notes that the vast majority of non-black Americans today are not descended from slave owners; indeed, many are immigrants, or the children or grandchildren of immigrants, who became Americans long after the end of slavery. Furthermore, contemporary African-Americans as a whole are far wealthier than numerous Africans living in third-world countries today.

I almost fealt dirty as Horowitz time after time denegrates the African-American community, not for conduct, but for their actual identity. I began the book hoping for an indictment of liberal philosophy, but left feeling the taint of racist indignation.

Each book is simply a collection of recipes - often not very good ones - without a single word of explanation or information anywhere. What I can't understand is the popularity they seem to have in Britain. Every other bookshop's vegetarian cookery section is stacked with copies of the various titles. As they cost, if my memory serves me correctly, 5.99, I can only assume people buy them because they're cheap, but I don't think they would be worth having if they were being given away free."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't just buy one!

God recently set me free from the \\"orphan spirit\\" that I had struggled with for years and I didn't even know it even existed until I went to the Harvest Mission School that Iris Ministries runs in Mozambique last fall. This book is definitely a great timing for me to read because to shows you how to go from the orphan spirit of not knowing who you are in Christ to going into a new transformed life style of living as a son or daughter of the King and our Abba Father God. If you truly desire to know how God has always created you to live as His son or daughter then I definitely would like to encourage you to read this book.

So many people do not understand what he eloquently communicates. Other religions drive you to your knees and leave you there. Christianity has you bow your knee to accept the Lord, and then raises you up to stand for Him, adopted as sons and daughters of the King, royalty. What? Are you afraid people will become proud?

Understanding our identity in Christ is foundational in our faith walk & I haven't quite gotten there yet, but I do know that God used this book to help bring more revelation and understanding to me in this area. I am desperately desiring more & more to go from the prison to the palace, from a pauper to a princess!

It talks about our identity in Christ - we are no longer sinners, but saints, once we are born again. Although I have read and heard of many teachings about our identity in Christ, this book best illustrates the implications of truly believing that we are His children and how it not only affects our personal lives, but also the people around us. It is absolutely life changing and when a congregation truly catches the truths contained therein, will completely transform that church into a spiritual force to be reckoned with. It is especially noteworthy that the truths contained in this book are clearly not just theory, but have been distilled out after many years of living them out in community - it really works and is proven to be extremely powerful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing, insightful, life-changing.","review":"Knowing who you are is fundamental to how we live our lives in the world. While many books will exhort, cajole and send you on guilt trips to try to change our behavior, this one goes to root of the matter.However, it doesn't leave us comfortable in our new-found identity, as shown in illustrated by this quote from chapter 12: \\"We can always tell how much of our princely identity we are truly walking in by our response to injustice: either our spirits get provoked within us, driving us to act, or we run for cover.\\" Hard to read that and feel complacent, isn't it?This is indeed not a book to read lightly, although it is very easy reading, due to the author's simple, direct style.

I ended up using two at a time just to use them up. I can't imagine what would happen if someone whose dog wears bigger than a small diaper tried to use these. Ugh. My advice?

When I tried to resolve this with Amazon, they told me that this was the product listed on the order so there was nothing they could do except issue a refund. I feel that I was mis-lead when I purchased the item and that there was no effort to resolve THAT problem, so I am left with a compass that I cannot use for work and have to go through the process of returning it and ordering a new one.

Bottom line: I had high hopes for this unit, but it just sits in my \\"backup\\" box in case my every day compass gets lost/damaged.

Enter humans and their little solar system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Niven writes posthumanism!","review":"A lot of people are saying that this is aclassic of the Known Space series. That is true, but there are other reasons to read this novel. Niven deals with concepts here that aren't really picked up by other authors until the cyberpunk explosion in the 80's, that is, what it means to be human and what's the next step?Protector is about humanity, posthumanity, and the difference between the two. Niven shows the cost of a greater intelligence and strength, especially how the enhanced human is, simply, no longer human.In a way, Protector stands with Niven's assorted earlier Known Space works, especially Flatlander and A Gift From Earth, in that it not only is an enjoyable work of hard science fiction, but that it also leaves plenty of food for thought."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic of Known Space!","review":"What can you say about this tale to someone who hasn't read it? How about that if they want to get to know excellent science-fiction, or if they just want a story with crackling dialogue, pages bursting with ideas, and an essential part of an ongoing Future History, or an combination of the previous, then they don't have to look any further than this novel?I might even consider this book better than Ringworld, mostly because I can comprehend the ideas better and the plot was easier to follow than the other book. Also, this novel is one that most of the other Known Space stories refer to, making it a must for any Larry Niven fan.The story of the Pak Protectors is also essental to the Ringworld saga, as anyone who read The Ringworld Engineers would know. But I don't want to spoil the surprise, or the sheer joy of reading a classic novel for anyone. Just go out and buy the book, borrow it from the library, or steal it from a friend, already!

This audiobook implementation of Larry Niven's book exceeds a threshold of spits, clicks, and tits, that any non-ARM prisoner should be forced to listen too. Unfortunately, we are held in the cell while ARM agents cover us with grating irritating noises in our desire to experience the Known Space basics.An errant Protector finds earth and, much to his dismay, fails in either attempt to re-solve a new colony or eliminate a deviate one. Larry Niven integrates the science into the background when it should be and let's the human element guide the story. From the asteroid belts to the earth, we learn why we exist and what our place in the universe was supposed to be.As far as a read, it's clearly a 4, but this Blackstone audiobook only rates a 1."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential accessible yet erudite essays on zen","review":"I studied Buddhist philosophy in some detail as an undergraduate, but that was many years ago.

This is something of an amazing feat, given the subtleties involved in explaining Zen, a formidable exercise in itself, given that the entire philosophy is based on enigmatic sayings/practices employed by masters approaching their students.Suzuki was the first to truly explain Zen Buddhism to the Western world and it is a must read for anyone who seeks the root understanding of the subject.I give it the highest recommendation."},{"rating":"1","title":"quality is not good...","review":"My 1 1/2 yr old is half Chinese, so I was very excited about getting this DVD for him.

I worked up there several summers and it felt like I was back in one of the frontier towns that I remember fondly. This is pretty far into the Shugak series, but a librarian recommended that I start with this book. I found that I did not need to read any of Stabenow's other books in order to fall in love with Shugak and the series. Since then I have pretty much read them all and I would say that none of them quite matches this one. So if you have not read any Shugak mysteries yet, this might be a good place to start.What's so unusal about this book while comparing it to both others in the series as well as other mysteries, is that it pretty much doesnt have a mystery. Instead what makes this such a fun read is that you are lead on an excursion into the life of the protagonist that is well worth following along upon."},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY THIS","review":"This is the well known Metal Blade re-mixes of \\"Lightning To The Nations\\".

While there are one or two stinkers on here but strong songs such as Stop Talking and My Kind make up for it.

We act as if we have carte blanche with our emotions and though we say we want men to express theirs - we are SO unpracticed in the role of putting our emotions aside and being the supportive partner. Above all, this book illustrated this dynamic so clearly to me. I am still practicing being there for my partner, who I am so blessed to be able to say is in touch with his emotions.

There isn't much action - that is not what this film is about. It is a character study in micro and macro. It is both personal and systemic. The film score also plays a huge part in moving the film along. It is aurally stunning. Other reviews go into details about the film itself, so I will cut this short. I would also highly recommend reading the book on which this film is based, \\"The Seed and the Sower\\" by Sir Laurens van der Post. The book is one of the best reads you will ever have."},{"rating":"2","title":"An accurate presentation, within confines of an R rating","review":"This film presented in a fair manner the abhorrent mentality of the Japanese during the days of their Empire; depicting that reality on film would have required an X rating, because their treatment of non-Japanese humans was beyond atrocious. Things ended in August 1945 exactly as they should have."},{"rating":"1","title":"an awful film","review":"I'd been meaning to see this film for many years, so I was glad to finally get it out. What a disappointment! It's a badly made film: poor script, an awful sense of rhythm, visually ugly and frankly boring. The performances are quite often wooden, though that's because the characters are poorly written. Tom Conti is relaxed and natural, but the material is so thin there's not much he can do.The cinematography and staging are quite amateurish, though perhaps this is because the Japanese director was trying to make a Western-style film. I can only assume people who like this film do so because of the subject matter. If you're interested in Japanese prisoner of war stories, I would recommend 'River Kwai' or the Australian miniseries A Town Like Alice. Or even the English TV series Tenko. But skip this film."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT A DVD!","review":"The seller of this item failed to tell me (or anyone else) that the disc does NOT play in a standard DVD player and so can only be watched on a computer.

The casting is atrocious (e.g. Edward Everett Horton as a Russian Count), and the directing is awful. Oh, did I mention the script? It is the worst part of the film by far. In fact, Summer Storm may become a cult film. I felt especially sorry for Linda Darnell, hopelessly out of her depth in the role of a Russian peasant (flashy makeup and all). How George Sanders must have been amused when receiving his check.Why on earth would this film come out on DVD while so many classics are still unavailable? In any case, stay clear of Summer Smoke.

Otherwise, this 1944 movie would be included it many lists of the worst films ever made."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't bother","review":"I found his work confusing and not well-thought out.

I did not realize that this was several short stories (around 10 min each) and not a continuing story. I stopped watching after DUEL, then I decided to give it another try and the watercolors went to Japanese animation type, but still very basic. The stories were as basic as the animation and I never did finish the whole DVD. I got it on sale for $2 and feel I wasted my money.

I am fantasy and Manga artist and I am more than in agreement with artistic license, but there was so much of that in this flick that it took away what could have been decent stories. The visuals where at times confusing and totally unnecessary. It was like it was done by students who were allowed to spread their wings with colors and abstract shapes.

While Halo Legends features amazing animation from the start (except for the duel), the overall feeling that this gives me is that this was pretty much a cash in. Rather than have a bunch and mix of different directors with different styles they might have been safer choosing one style and director. Having read all the books when I finished watching this it made me think that the directors didn't have a feel for the games or the previous adventures and set out to do their own thing. The package had good animation but was just too corny and over the top. I skipped the duel and odd one out because as a fan of Halo I couldn't stand for how lame this was. If they ever attempt another try at this they need to make it a feature length film with a good plot, they should also keep to the japanese anime style used in prototype, babysitter and homecoming."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Halo here","review":"If you are a Halo fan this is probably is a good DVD but if you are looking for a good movie about warriors in suits try Bubblegum Crisis.I really think the animation could have been better.

Right from the start, experience forewarned me that when I get overbearing music and amateurish simplistic graphics that I'm in for a big disappointment. That was reinforced when I started to hear a never ending, line after line, high school sophomore level cliche ridden dialogue. Example for a line: \\"The galaxy is vast, it's wonders and beauty are almost unfathomable. But the galaxy also hides dark secrets.\\" Urghhhh! And, the topping on this miserable experience was a lack-of-story. In fact, more like a jumbled, doesn't make sense, lack-of-story. The fact that Microsoft is involved in producing this movie explains part of the problem. Maybe it was put together by their high school game development school."},{"rating":"1","title":"The only Halo fail","review":"I am a big fan of the halo games but I did not like this movie much at all.

I really like the books and the games, but this either didn't translate well to anime, or the creators just didn't get what makes the story great. If you're a fan of Halo it's hard to say not to buy it because there is SOME interesting stuff, but I can't see how this is good and I fully expect it to collect dust behind the rest of my watchable blu rays.

I think two guys, who happen to be MD's thought they could write a book to promote the Medical Treatment Model of High Blood Pressure. Get real! Like the cover, this book, and its paradigm of treatment, are in the 1950's, very outdated. Don't waste your time ordering this book, as I did.. or you will have to pay the cost to ship it back!

It has a flexible sensor pad that you place inside your child's underwear. This is, even when new, unreliable as it shifts and is very uncomfortable for my son. After it gets wet, it must completely dry before it will work again. It must be rinsed and laid out to dry in the middle of the night or it will smell in the morning If you wait to clean it, it won't be dry by the time you need it again. After you've used it a bit, it gets crinkled (or there is the smallest amount of moisture left in it) and you have constant \\"false alarms\\" where every time my son moved it would squeak and squeal.If this was in the $20 range, at least I would feel like I got what I paid for. I was so desparate for help for my son that I got what I could get quickest, assuming they're all basically the same. My son HATED this, it was a complete waste of money and I went out and spent another $100 on a Malem (which actually works)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your $$","review":"After a couple of nights of use the pad was all crinkled and wouldn't stay in place and was very uncomfortable. My son would move and it would send off a false alarm. For the amount of money you spend on this product you would think they would include more than just 2 sensors. One gets wet in the middle of the night you have to replace it with the second, hoping by the next evening the sensors are dry enough to use again. It has not stopped the bed wetting."},{"rating":"1","title":"alarm","review":"The alarm pads are too big so they bend easy.

Our pediatrician recommended the Nite Train-r, and our son was really excited about the idea of the alarm. He didn't have any problems or discomfort from the pad. We did have a couple of false alarms, but it just shows you how sensitive the pads are -- meaning that at the first dribble, the alarm will sound. It took less than 10 days and my son has been dry and wearing underwear every night since -- not one accident! The alarm only sounded probably 3 out of those 10 nights, and that's all it took for his sleeping brain to get it. I wish we would have known about this/tried this sooner! It does seem kind of expensive for what it is, but I figure that we have saved a bundle in pull-ups, and it can easily be re-used or re-sold as used. All you would need are the inexpensive replacement pads for either male or female.

Well thought out and well made. I have several feeders that are squirrel-resistant but some of them are filled with larger and more aggressive birds, like Blue Jays, Grackles, Northern Mockingbirds, European Starlings, etc. I wanted something just for the little guys.Where I live we get both the American Goldfinch (mostly passing through) and the Lesser Goldfinch. They, along with Purple and House Finches have the feeder pretty much to themselves (yesterday I saw a Painted Bunting at the feeder, WOW!). Bigger birds, like the ever present White Wing Dove (similar to Mourning Doves) attempt to sit on one of the perches and then they slide off when it \\"dips\\".My only complaint is that the perches seems a little TOO sensitive. Northern Cardinals can barely sit on one without it dipping, and then only with the help of a lot of wing-flapping. Still, I really like this feeder for finches and other small birds."},{"rating":"1","title":"score one for the squirrels","review":"The squirrels chewed off the perches on the Droll Yankee Dipper by snipping the cable that holds the perch to feeder, rendering the feeder unusable. They would do this by hanging off the top of the feeder and extending their bodies all the way down to where the perches were at the bottom of the feeder. Removing the perches really didn't help them....maybe they were just angry. Can't use feeder any more as they did this with all four ports."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad choice","review":"This feeder is not squirrel proof. They can hang on the bottom of the feeder and get to the holes. Second, the perches are way too sensitive. Larger birds slip and slide off, yes, however also other smaller birds have a hard time on it too. Nuthatches and Downy Woodpeckers can barely stay on it. The only birds that can stay on it comfortably at all are Finches, and Chickadees. That is when the birds do actually go to the feeder. Most of the time there's nothing on it, they don't even seem to really like it. Another problem with this feeder is the feeder ports. The seed does not flow to the feeder ports as intended, it gets stuck and you have to bang on the feeder to get it to go down into the holes. And even when it does go into the holes, when it rains, the food gets all wet and soggy. So all in all, don't buy this feeder. In fact, don't buy any of the Droll Yankees Squirrel Proof feeders. Go out to Wild Birds Unlimited and buy an Eliminator feeder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Birds did not arrive, not the best choice","review":"I bought this feeder and I put it up immediately. I put it in the exact same place as our old feeder, same food. Five days it sat with only one red finch that would land on it, push seed onto the ground and then the birds would eat from the ground. The birds never landed on it...they would attempt, but would be spooked when they approached. When I contacted Droll Yankee directly, they said it sometimes takes 6-8 weeks for birds to arrive...sorry, but if I pay THIS much for a feeder, I want results a little quicker.The best part? I returned the Dipper and got the FLIPPER. By the time I put it up and walked back to my deck to look back at it, the birds were on it. It wasn't 6-8 weeks...it was 3-4 seconds. I honestly think the birds like the larger round pirch much better than the small stick-like pirches on this feeder. It is squirrell proof for sure.

I've known several children (now adults) who've lived with these arrangements and have literally hated every minute. I'm not trashing shared custody--or this book, for that matter.

The only saving grace of the book is the incredible plot twists at the end but, by that time, you're so beaten into numbness by what comes before that it hardly matters. If only the author had spent as much time revising the rest of the book as he did figuring out the ending. And, while the ending is surprising, it's surprising in a not very satisfying way -- turns out you won't like any of the characters. Pass it by. How bad was this book? I left it on the plane the moment I finished it."},{"rating":"2","title":"My First Time But I'd Do It Again","review":"I found the novel a bit dis-jointed at the beginning. Perhaps it was just me. I had trouble figuring out how the characters were related to one another. But as the novel progressed, those relationships became clearer.I found the novel to be fairly fast-paced and not prone to getting bogged down in unessential details. A few unexpected twist and the surprise ending clerarly tells me that I would do it again (read) with this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"Twisted ending does not redeem lame book.","review":"The characters and plot of this book are so contrived it was difficult for me to finish it (fortunately it is fairly short). The ending truly is surprising, but so much so that it is unsatisfying. There was a very little bit of foreshadowing, but not enough to give the reader any clue as to what was coming. It would have been far more satisfying if there had been a hint that something was amiss. At least that would have kept the reader guessing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ending is a letdown","review":"Each of the characters are not developed fully, bythe end, you are disappointed in all the characters. Holly'scharacter is hard to buy by the end of the book as well as not believable. Without giving to much away, you could almost connect with Toby except for his behavior towards his mother was ridiculous. And the last page especially didn't make sense, why would Holly act that way, they explain her reason for action, but even if it would have worked, she still would not have gotten what she wanted."},{"rating":"1","title":"GOTHIC GARBAGE!","review":"I read the first 150 pages of this worthless novel and decided to stop. I have better stuff to do than read boring novels. I can almost always tell from the start if books are going to be good. This one started out real lame. Holly Smith/Randall or whatever her name is, discovers she is adopted and then she gets a phone call from her real great aunt. Then the aunt is later killed and Holly comes running to the family's house. She does not get along with a lot of the family members. She feels that the housekeepers son is strange and so on.

The singing sounds like it sung by a drunken hungover reveler. 99% of the songs sound like they were written by someone who was either high on crack or suffered severe head trauma. The guitar work and drumming is soooo sloppy and noisy. Don't get me wrong; I love the Goos. I bought this album when I was 17 or 18 and it was so bad that I through it out in the same bag that I scooped my cat's litter box out with. The 1% of good on this album is for the song James Dean and Down On the Corner. This has to be the worst Goo album I ever heard and I heard all of their albums except their debut album.

After heating up I noticed the point of this was starting to \\"melt\\" and bend to the side - on the third letter it broke off. Following the instructions I attempted to remove the base of the tip hot with pliers - the tip broke off leaving the threads blocked. I unplugged and let it cool down - there was no way without drilling and tapping to get the broken piece out so it was totally useless. Sad to see a good company like Weller go to making product in China and the quality go so bad!

This unit is very frustrating to use to the point of being worthless except for only very small, imprecise projects. The heat generated isn't very strong and once you start using it cools quickly. Which means you have to burn, stop, burn, stop, burn, stop... which creates obvious patterns in the wood where you don't want them. I'm sure for small things, easy hobbies, etc. this might be fine. But, if you are trying to burn anything 2 or 3 inches or larger be ready for frustration and about 4 hours.

Rhys Faucon is a strong admirable hero with solid, unwavering strength in character and his beliefs. What possessed him to like the heroine, Lyonesse, was beyond me. First, she wrongly captures him for a scum of a fiance and then cannot decide whether or not to trust him despite his oath to protect her in front of her people, his overall protection of her as an escort to her father's home despite his obvious attraction to her, and also her father's (whom she respects and loves) urging to trust him. Although the author states that the Rhys admires Lyonesse for her strength and uniqueness from other women of the time, I wish that the Lyonesse had actually possessed more admirable qualities. More show and less tell would've been nice. Had Lyonesse been less wishywashy and a better match for Rhys, I would've liked this book a great deal more.Recommended books:Heart of Gold,White Lion's Lady,Stealing Heaven"},{"rating":"2","title":"the most underrated slayer album","review":"and it is damn good! i put it on thinking i would be disappointed. the hell i was!!! this is a great metal masterpiece! i dont know what the people who bash it are thinking, but this is up there with \\"reign in blood\\" and \\"south of heaven\\". sure the lyrics arent very open-minded, but who cares? id be worried about my boys if they didn't write something simple! and the production? ive heard worse(carcass' \\"reek of putrefaction- ouch!!), and its easy to set aside. so please, ignore all who say this [stinks], and buy it, you wont be let down!"},{"rating":"2","title":"From the sulphur-streaked bowels of hell...","review":"This is where Slayers satanic influences manifested into something that was, at the time, downright scary. Show No Mercy, while completely bloody and satanic in its own right, does not sound as convincing as this LP does. You get some nice backmasking on the opening track (JOIN US JOIN US) and the band gets down to business on \\"Hell Awaits,\\" with some nice chugging riffage at the start. Kill Again and At Dawn They Sleep are some awesome songs here, and to tell the truth--the whole album is just oozes as much evil as it has memorable moments. Recommended purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"THE ONE STATED IT ALL","review":"Hell Awaits is the most evil album of its time. Sure there were bands around at the time, like Venom and Kreator that were powerful, but Slayer carried it to the next level with this one. Considering the time it was released (1985)it was way ahead of its time. I love every Slayer album, and the only one I would give less then 5stars is Seasons in the Abyss (its just such a big dissapointment for a follow up to SOuth of Heaven, and even today I am bitter about it, but they came back strong with Divine Intervention. If you are a metal fan, and you dont have this Slayer album in your collection, then it is a must! ENJOY"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not their best","review":"Only seven songs on this CD, but still a must-have for any Slayer fan. The music on this CD loses a little of the raw intensity of Show No Mercy, but offers more refinement. The songs seem to follow a pattern, with a slow lead-in building toward a roaring climax. The title song \\"Hell Awaits\\" and the following \\"Kill Again\\" are true Slayer classics."},{"rating":"1","title":"Atrocious Production","review":"The production on this album is I have to say quite poor. The guitars seem muddy and buried in the mix and lack the punch seen in later albums. The bass also seems way too loud, and Arayas vocals sound like they were recorded in someones bathroom at times (e.g. Hell Awaits - Maybe it was supposed to sound like that?).I have become a slayer fan only recently so I have not seen them play live. I dare say that if some of these songs were played live or were re-recorded they would sound absolutely killer, but I personally just find it near impossible to get past the horrible sound on this disc. The lyrics (Necrophiliac! Give me a break) and overlong songs don't help at times either.If you are new to slayer I would advise you not to make this your introduction to them, it might well put you off a truly talented and influential band. For starters pick up reign in blood, south of heaven, or seasons in the abyss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hell Awaits So Be Ready","review":"This is a great album!Slayer is the only 80's black metal band that I have heard with a sound like no other!The story of how I got into Slayer is one of my friends told me that they were good so I got Hell Awaits...

The pictures are black and white and clear. The book is expensive because it is a hardback and an import from Britian (with such words as Bonnet and Tyre).I will fault Amazon with the current wait time for this item.

Heck, they're basically the same thing. Having been caught up in The Strokes hype, and completely impressed by their debut full-length album IS THIS IT, I just had to buy this single so I could have the much-touted \\"best song off the whole friggin' album,\\" as most people claim it to be. It's obviously the most punk-like and aggressive song in their repertoire, but in my humble opinion it ain't the best. I'd vote THE MODERN AGE or SOMEDAY for that honor. I do hope at some point this is added back to the US release of IS THIS IT. I understand the reason behind keeping it off the album, but I think any intelligent person should be trusted to be able to differentiate between a young person's rebellious view of authority, and the truly heroic and selfless acts of the NYPD.

I don't know if it is because I can relate to the situation or because Betty Smith herself can write a book in such a way that you feel that you are part of the story. I didn't want the book to end. The power of love can do anything that this young couple set their minds to. I was speechless when Annie and Carl exchanged Christmas gifts and I felt Annie's fear when she thought she might be pregnant. This book is so emotional and insprational. While it may not be A Tree Grows in Brooklyn, I feel it is a wonderful novel of true love. They were able to accomplish the impossilbe. Annie is a wonderful character. She has such a zest for life.

Their website had the cd with extra tracks, i should've bought it when i had the chance. Anyway, it's all good. This cd was hard to find after they took off their website, thank god amazon.com knows how to bring it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enlightenment","review":"This book is great for describing what is enlightenment. There are many known writers and people who led many movements to their enlightenment. Only problem is that it's hard to follow.Good book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected, disappointing quality","review":"This is NOT highlights from a radio broadcast, it IS the radio broadcast - in its entirety - with commentary/introduction from the host. After the radio broadcast portion, the quality on some of the tracks is poor and crackly, and one is not even professionally recorded. It is noted on the program that it is not a professional recording, but the synopsis here by Amazon does NOT reflect any of this. This is NOT what I was expecting in format OR quality."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not Stanton Quality","review":"This is not what you expect to be. This is not Stanton Quality, or what it used to be. It still useful and has clean good working basic effects. But the construction is the cheapest. More plastic than any other. China Toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Mixed to Poor","review":"Nice style and appearance. Pretty god quality for price/package, good speakers. However some internal problems. You need to place it uphigh good clear view toward front edge of shelf- recieveer location on it for the remote signal is poor. I need a 2x2 inch block under front to elevate it to recieve remote signal. Programming it setting the time and radio stations/channels. Decent not greatest- but get used to doing this. It loses the time very frequently on me (and why unknown, no power outage nothing else in house needs reset). When time lost, mixed as to if it also loses station memory- not alway sbut frequent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Yeah !!!","review":"I love this album -- I saw the show in SF twice and recently in Detroit -- the album captures all of the wonderful score and the cast on the album is super -- although they made one curious recording faux pas as far as I am concerned -- why records a Randy Skinner tap dance show without including any of the tap on the recording? Still -- I listen to it constantly in the car -- it feels like Christmas year round!"},{"rating":"1","title":"SOME SPARKLE, NO STARS","review":"While it's always fun to listen to Irving Berlin tunes, and this show has a special nostalgic appeal for Boomers, what's missing on this album is what's missing in the show: stars. Films like \\"Easter Parade\\", \\"Holiday Inn\\", and \\"White Christmas\\" survive because they have high octane stars -- it takes talent of that caliber to put over these songs and the very thin stories that hold them together. On this album, only that veteran belter Karen Morrow (who is not playing the role on Broadway) hits the musical nail on the head, and when she's on hand the album takes off. But she's only on hand for two numbers. The four leads are so bland they barely register -- just standard issue Broadway voices, scrubbed clean of personality. Crosby, Clooney, Kaye and even Vera-Ellen, had star quality, and without them this is a blah Christmas, indeed."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Scrooge doesn't like \\"Christmas\\"","review":"I am a late-comer to this album, and appear to be a dissenting voice, alas. I found this album dull, the biggest problems being that the arrangements have no sparkle (maybe they were meant to capture that lush, and--dare I say--bloated 1950's sound) and the singers (with the exception of Karen Morrow) have no personality. When dealing with material this familiar, you have to bring something extra, and despite the obvious talent that went into this, it is just serviceable. The whole thing reminded me of a Lawrence Welk tribute to Berlin, or a big-budget cruise ship show."},{"rating":"2","title":"Plays","review":"My wife enjoys plays.

I strongly suggest it be added to any child's video library."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a Great Movie","review":"I am 16 almost 17 and I still love this movie.

You should get this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wee Sing ROCKS","review":"When I was little I used to watch this movie all the time. I was just watching The Best Christmas Ever, also by Wee Sing, and they had some other movies by Wee Sing at the end and I could remember some of them from when my mom got them for me at the library but I jumped out of my seat when Marvelous Musical Mansion came on. I used to watch it all the time but a couple of years ago my mom sold it at a yard sale. I was so happy to see it on Amazon."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good First Half, But Terrible Second Half!","review":"The first part of the video is great, but the mystery part just stinks!

We are both very happy with the purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goof for the Entire Family","review":"Although we have only seen other Wee Sing titles in preview, The Marvelous Musical Mansion is arguably the best in the series. The kids of course liked the songs. My wife, a music teacher, was also amazed by the musical concepts that was tought in the one-hour program, such as allegro, largo, and cadenza. Everyone in the house learned something watching this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thanks to Amazon.com I found Musical Mansion!","review":"About a year ago I checked out Musical Mansion from our library for my grandson, who was 5 at the time. We could only keep it for 3 days but he must have watched it 10 times. Every time we passed the library he asked me to get the video again. Since the videos are on a revolving schedule I didn't expect to find it for a while. I did finally ask the librarian if she could special order it for me. For some reason she couldn't find it county-wide on her computer, thinking it may have been damaged and removed from the collection. Just yesterday I asked her again and she commented that it must be good because many others had requested it. It was then I thought to see if Amazon. com had it and the rest has a happy ending. It's funny to think how much kids love this cute video."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wee Sing - The Marvelous Musical Mansion","review":"This tape brought us years of delight.

Especially Big Rock Candy Mountain and Wee Sing In Sillyville. I never knew what these movies were called when I was younger so being able to find it today and remember what they were just by looking at it..brought back tons of wonderful memories.Especially since I go around and ask people if they remember \\"little bunny foo foo.\\" Now I finally know what movie I was reffering too. :]"},{"rating":"1","title":"order placed 01-23-13, still have not receive my order...they don't respond to emails....shame on you!","review":"Bad business practice...I still have not receive my order...they don't respond to emails, or they just don't know how to handle a frustrated customer......Ripped off.....USA Nutra...... stay away from this company !!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An EP to remember","review":"I like to see progression in a band, especially a heavy metal band. Artists today pump out new albums that sound similar to old albums, with all the songs having the same feel. With Haunting the Chapel, Slayer began to shift their emphasis after only a single cd. Granted, the quality isn't the best and there are only four tracks, but it's a must-have for fans of the genre. \\"Chemical Warfare\\" delivers speed and power previously unheard of; \\"Captor of Sin\\" makes for a solo-infused musical thrill ride; the title track delivers an intense degree of lyrical maturity; and \\"Aggressive Perfector\\" ends this EP with speed and style similar to their first album. All in all, well worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing.","review":"This EP is the greatest EP i have ever heard. All the songs are classics and 2 are featured on the double live cd Decade Of Aggresion, and one is featured on the live \\"Live Undead\\" album.This Ep is incredible and includes a very epic slayer song \\"Chemical Warfare\\"1. Chemical Warfare - Excellent track, pretty much one of Slayer epics, also one of the greatest thrash metal songs ever! period!2. Captor Of Sin - Awesome opener solo, great song the whole way through. Amazing solos.3. Haunting The Chapel - This song is sooooooo good. The drums are like machine guns. Incredible solos, especially the one at the end.4. Aggresive Perfector - The first actuall Slayer song, a real classic. Amazing guitar work and an incredible song.Overall this cd is a thrahs metal masterpiece filled with ripping solos and pounding machine gun like drums."},{"rating":"2","title":"CLASSIC!","review":"That's enougth I don't need to say one more word about the classic SLAYER, they speak for themselves."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great old school Slayer EP","review":"Okay so it's an EP but it's still great just listen to Haunting the Chapel or Chemical Warfare if you don't believe me. This was back when Slayer were still influenced by Mercyful Fate and Venom and it clearly shows in the music and image. Slayer's first album was good but it lacked something and im not sure what it was but on Haunting The Chapel they went above and beyond Show No Mercy in their fast aggression and heir lyrics. Slayer didn't find their sound until Reign In Blood but that doesn't mean it's not good early Slayer to me is very good and is definitly worth checking out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great EP","review":"How the hell can the reviewer below me be serious. It is the only Slayer album worth owning? Hmmm....This is coming from a person that thinks Metallica's Black Album is a four Star effort. The Black album is exactly where Metallica started to sell the F**K out. I highly suggest that this \\"Genius\\" pick up Reign in Blood, Hell Awaits, and South of Heaven, as even though this EP is great, the orginal only contained three songs, and Agressive Professor was actual releaed on an Early Metal Blade Compitlation, then was released on the Show No Mercy Cassette version, and know it appears on Reign in Blood and this EP, but whatever its Slayer, anythign from them is cool, and even their worst effort \\"Seasons in The AByss\\" would still get 3 stars!"},{"rating":"1","title":"HAUNTING MY EARS !","review":"This CD did nothing but haunting my ears, with its noise, pollution, bad songwriting. Skip it if you can, because Slayer has nothing to offer you. They're after your money, that's all"},{"rating":"2","title":"SHORT BUT VERY SWEET.","review":"This is a very nice ep which does the band justice.It contains slayers old school sound of show no mercy and hell awaits.All the songs are great with the best being the title track.Pick this one up if you dont already have it.See you later."},{"rating":"2","title":"Its Worth Buying!","review":"Though this album only has four songs on it, it is definately worth buying. All the songs on this are great. Even \\"Aggressive Perfector\\" is a good song. Anyone who is truly into Slayer should know that they were best when on Metal Blade records. That is why I especially like this one. This album is so good that the only problem with it is the fact it is too short."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best...","review":"Best 3 song cd ever recorded.... chemical Warfare, Captor of Sin, Haunting the chapel, At least thats what it was when i bought it years and years ago. Love it.."},{"rating":"2","title":"4 examples of great thrash","review":"when i first saw this cd only had 4 songs on it, it really turned me away but i gave \\"chemical warfare\\" a listen anyway. WOW. this song is perfect. i love the subject, lyrics and music of it. classic slayer right here. its first riff is great and the chorus riff really supports the lyrics. \\"captor of sin\\" is another great track. its really heavy but i get it messed up with the title track a lot, they are a lot alike. so, if you are a slayer fan or a thrash fan, you need to pick it up. my only complaint with this would be that its so short. the sound quality isnt that great either but it was released in 1984. after listening to the whole thing, it really makes you want more. (which is why i got \\"show no mercy\\") if it had more tracks with the same quality of songs, it would pass \\"show no mercy\\" easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great way to learn what an inch is","review":"There's probably no more interesting way to teach a child what an inch is than this splendidly illustrated whimsical tale about an inch worm.As reviewed on my children's book recommendation site Books for Children (www.books-for-children.com)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Lucky Charms sabotage, an aging quarterback, and a physicist","review":"Only SEP is this original. This is my favorite in the 'Chicago Stars' series. I just love Cal. And Jane is the perfect woman for him to argue with! The story is VERY original. The book is full of wonderful characters, laugh-out-loud dialogue, and perfect lovers. It has SEP's trademark humor AND emotion. You will love it...it is absolutely her best work yet!

The heroine is Molly Sommerville from IT HAD TO BE YOU.)"},{"rating":"2","title":"CONTRIVED BUT FUNNY","review":"This book was so funny! If you took this book seriously, you would dislike both of them. If you hear the correct inflection, you will laugh out loud then look around to see if anyone heard you. The first meeting of Jane and Cal is preposterous, but go with it and just enjoy the author's sense of humor. There are a few life's lessons in there to make it poignant. Just the part where Jane's walks down the stairs when Cal gets home is hysterical!

Susan Elizabeth Phillips is wonderful. I have listened to several of her other books on tape and thoroughly enjoyed them too. Luckily, there are still some left and I look forward to all of them. I hope Dream A Little Dream is coming out soon on tape. Anna Fields is a terrific reader, putting emphasis just in the right place. Her male voices are the best I've heard yet!

But, this book is a little too much for me. I know that SEP likes the macho hero and the virginal 30 year old heroine, but this story takes that too far. Cal is an jerk and I can't even suspend disbelief to think that this senario is remotely plausible.I would read this book because the next book in the series \\"Dream a Little Dream\\" relies heavily on these characters (and might be my favorite SEP book of all!), but just know what you're in for."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring book","review":"What a boring book.

THIS BOOK IS HORRIBLE. The plot could have been a very sweet love story. BUT INSTEAD it was boring unbelievable and annoying. I hated Jane. and Her ramblings about being a freak and her child being a freak were stupid.

Anyways I love this book... The heroine is a genius and at the start of the book she thinks the Hero is just another dumb jock. The hero is getting older and he won't let himself think about what happens after football, so he dates young girls and tries to look younger through them. The play between the H/h is great I love how they fight; they both seem to enjoy it. And as always SEP writes a secondary story, I think this was one of her smaller ones, between the Hero's mother and father.

It works for me; and I'm not easy (which means that I really enjoyed it)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Work","review":"As usual, SEP's storyline was original and unique.

Definitely read this and the sequel Dream a Little Dream, which is just as good!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Five Star Winner all the way!","review":"A wonderful novel that kept me up all night to finish! The characters show remarkable intelligence and a humaness that many romance novelists don't infuse their key figures with. The urges to have a baby is a well known and documented fact, and to have it so amazingly combined in a story of opposites attracting, yet also aiding those around them into healing their own hurts is perfect. You've found a faithful reader in me!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm a Married Man and I Loved It","review":"Hard to believe I would like this book. I wanted a diversion and found this book as free book from a book club and said, why not, try it. On vacation with the kids I decided to read it (the first romance I ever read) and loved it. It was fun, pure escape. It's a better read than I thought and I will buy her other books. There's nothing wrong with some pure fun reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not waste your money","review":"I will preface this review by mentioning that I loved the first two books in this series. Unfortunately, the plot of this book made little to no sense. The truth of the matter is that if someone tricks or manipulates you so that they can get pregnant there is no way that you would ever forgive them let alone marry the person. These two had nothing on common and would not ordinarily be together. Its also not that simple tobe put in contact with professional athletes. The ridiculous plot doesn't end there: SEP never even addresses the fact that a woman with an IQ of 180 would a) seduce a man in that manner Oe b) think that her child would be of average intelligence because one parent is dumb. The book doesn't ever address the obvious self esteem/delusions of the heroine.I loved the first two books in this series so I will be reading the next one."},{"rating":"1","title":"What?","review":"Normally, I can really trust the customer reviews on Amazon, but I can not believe someone (let alone several people) rated this 4 and 5 stars. Was I reading the same book? I don't have a problem with the kind of far out story line (after all, it is a romance novel, so you can expect some of that) even though I can not imagine what intellegent woman would have the thought process the main character does.... (example: I'm so incredibly brilliant that I honestly believe sleeping with a stupid guy will produce a normal child... Really? I must have missed that little tidbit in biology class.) But mainly, this story was just boring. The characters were one dimentional. Even their huge personal problems were boring. Skip it or just check it out at the library, but don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"It wasn't that good","review":"I love Miss Phillips usually but this book really irritated me. The characters were extremely angry and barely had time to fall in love. I must say that this book was tortously slow. I don't especially recommend to anyone by Phillips fans otherwise newscomers will not see the true genius of Miss. Phillips"},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely NOT 5 stars","review":"I cannot believe how loosely people use the 5 stars. This book was okay but nothing to write home about. The story is NOTHING deep -- but that seems to be the way people like them nowadays. Some nice scenes but it is SO tiresome to read about a hero who is \\"damned mad\\" all the time. Isn't that just plain childish?? Someone who can't control their temper? Give me a REAL hero any day! And not one who is threatening to \\"Tear you apart limb from limb\\" Actual quotes.Oh Brother."},{"rating":"1","title":"absurd bordering on insulting","review":"I have not read much of the author's work before, but I am into romance novels, so I thought I would try this out on a friend's recommendation. I have hardly ever been so disappointed with a book. The heroine (others have described her as flawed in a good way) is quite possibly one of the most grating characters I've ever encountered in fiction. Her plan (if it can be dignified with such a word) to have a stupid or average child is not only irrational and absurd, but demeaning!

By the end of most of her novels, the reader really cares what happens to them. This one didn't lack in that, but it took a while to get there. It was hard to get past the heroine's dishonesty (to put it kindly) in the beginning of the book and sympathize with her dilemma. Once I got past that, the pacing, tension, and usual sizzle between the hero and heroine was a little off, making the book lag. It ended up being worth the read, and had a good ending (with the usual grovel scene), but it wasn't one of her best, in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great one by SEP!","review":"Of all of SEP's Chicago Stars books, I connected the least with this one.

Many of my general thoughts are already well said in other reviews, so I want to add an offbeat one. Bingo also tells a story about a woman's love for her career, newspapering, and how that career is endangered by the sale of \\"her\\" paper to a big company. Brown nails that part of the story -- her descriptions of how it feels when the \\"big guy\\" arrives on the doorstep of the little paper are dead on. I lived through that same situation, with less happy results, and Nickel's reactions ring very true. In this era of mergers and buyouts, that's another reason to read Bingo.

I found not a whole lot to really like and cheer for in Nick. She seems flat and one dimensional.It seems the characters were used to advance a cause. I felt as though I was being preached to. The women in Six of One were gay and they lived their robust, colorful lives in the book with out any comentary on what we should feel about them. I loved them because they were real and and reachable. They just were what they were. They were a part of the beautiful woven fabric of Six of One.

The hero and heroine just fall into bed... of course she's a virgin. But... I did manage to re-write it in my head... and I liked the book much better once I'd done this.The book was funny, the characters likeable and fairly well fleshed out. Before the first love scene I was so HAPPY at how good the book was... I went and bought the first book in the series, The Prisoner.

The reader can truly feel sorrow, joy, disgust with each action of Francis, all through the excellent writing of Mr. kennedy. The book is a sad look on a depressing era, but it is also a novel that demonstrates the love and bond of family and the tenacity of human nature to hold on.

I will say that the warranty from HP has proven to be absolutely worthless. Our efforts to get either a working computer or (preferably!) our money back have proven to be useless.

James's fascinating, Marxist account of the Haiti slave revolt, \\"Black Jacobins\\", I was excited to learn of a literate, fictional account of the same subject. Now that I've read it, I agree it is literate, but it is more an exploration of the depths of race hatred than a treatment of the Haiti uprising. Most telling is Bell's decision to develop the character of Toussaint only slightly, preferring instead to focus mostly on a fictional white doctor. How Toussaint and his illiterate allies accomplished one of the greatest miliary and political upsets in history is of little interest to Bell. The goal of the book seems to be to impress upon the reader to what appalling depths mankind, black and white, will stoop when a conflict is racial. Although Bell paints many shockingly violent scenes, he didn't convince me that racial forms of hatred are uniquely virulent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unnecessarily Gruesome","review":"I suppose I can understand how others could have enjoyed this book - its subject matter is interesting, and it is descriptive and evocative. However, I found all of this atmosphere to be at the cost of character and plot. If you want page-long descriptions of flaying scenes, this is the book for you. If you're more interested in character development and engaging storylines, you'll need to look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"lots of words","review":"If you like the tease of adultery and fornication, mutiliation from excessive torture in every third chapter then this is the book for you. Bell knows how to stimulate the reader and does so often. The other reviewers have captured his ability to poignantly describe the atmosphere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hardest book I ever read","review":"And not just because of the frequent French, either. This was a difficult read, containing some of the most shocking descriptions of cruelty I have ever read. That said, it was worth the effort. Madison Smartt Bell's sentences shimmer and his characters come alive. Bell's use of the rebel slave who eventually abandons the rebellion for the bush and the unrepentant plantation owner well make his point that violence, as practiced by white or black, is senseless. So why the preachy epilogue? After suffering, to Bell's credit, through chapter after chapter of human sacrifice and dismemberment, I didn't need to be told that race hate is a bad thing. Still, if you quit before you get to the italicized words, you'll have an important and worthwhile read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic tale of the birth of Haiti.","review":"I read this book because of \\"Ten Indians\\" and because I am a history buff. It is nothing like \\"Ten Indians\\", except that many scenes are described from the differing viewpoints of several characters. This is a fine historical novel. I learned a lot of new and interesting facts about Haiti's history and people. It was a little slow going at first because of the necessity to look up French words and phrases (in the dictionary provided). If you read French, I think you can get more out of the book. Also, it would have been nice to have a map for orientation as to where events occurred. Overall, a good book and worth the time. I recommend it"},{"rating":"2","title":"She Never Stopped!!!!","review":"I bought this CD the first time I had it in my hand.

The ballads are outstanding and her version of \\"Going In Circles\\" is undoubtedly best in the CD and probaly the best version of its many recordings! It woke me up for the first time of its beauty in words and harmony. All the songs are good dance songs, fantastic mellow ballads, and a wonderful surprise with Martha's old song!!No one can be dissapointed with this CD and it will be in my personal collection as look as I have a collection!

Another problem is not completing started examples. For example, the book talks about SELECT statements and uses a simple SELECT statement such as, SELECT * from TABLE. But then the book gets around to talking about getting the data from a SELECT statement, it switches the SELECT statement to SELECT name, address, number from TABLE. They do not explain how to grab the data from the previous SELECT statment, something that is quite fundamental if you are generating a report. As it stands, it looks like one has to specify every field in the table the SELECT statement is issued against.

The authors should have included examples other than Oracle, and I did not notice any treatment of areas that are different between databases, such as date/time fields. But, the examples included should be quite helpful.Eventhough I am returning my copy back to the book sellers, I would still recommend it for O'Reilly groupies, or people who can not print out the CPAN documentation, or if your job situation requires you to use DBI and you're starting from ground zero.

About 1/3 is a DBI reference, which you can get free from the distribution. About 1/5 of the book (in the beginning), it describes Berkeley's dbm (and thus why DBI is necessary). So, what we have left is mere 130 pages to describe DBI features. The author uses these pages to explain only very simple things like: How to connect to the database, and execut very simple queries like \\"SELECT name FROM employee\\", get the result set, and so forth. The book never describes more complex real world problems, such as how you would execute stored procedures (for example, in Oracle, PL/SQL packages) get the result back through arguments, and other intricate problems. If you want to learn the very fundamentals of how to connect, execute, and get the results for very simple SQL queries, this book will help you. But then you can visit free web sites that offer such things. If you want to solve real world problems using DBI, this book offers NOTHING !"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth it if you are serious about Perl DBI","review":"The man pages and perl doc just do not cover the details in depth enough for professional use of the perl DBI.

The man pages are plenty. But if you really care about performance, and how to write programs that make the most of the facilities at hand, this book gives the details that aren't in the man pages.For Perl programmers the Perl DBI is one of the most important facilities in the language. Understanding it depth is one of the requisities of Perl guru-dom."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"I really appreciate having this book around. Sure, there is much material on the internet on how to use the DBI, but I prefer it all in book form.

The DBI is quite a portable, flexible, and powerful system that I have come to love :)If there was one thing I would add/change to this book, I would have added more real life examples. Not much was focused on using databases for web sites, but that's ok, I guess, since it's not that much different.If a 16 year old like myself can follow and understand most of the stuff in this book, there's no reason why anyone else shouldn't be able to :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Try \`man DBI\`","review":"The only thing I learned from this book is what region in the UK where some popular megalyths are and how I should act while visiting them.

I am okay with that. There is still space for 30 pairs of shoes. 10 for my hubby and 20 for me. LOL It fits perfectly in my hallway and adds such character!!! I am thrilled!!!

One of the strongest groups defending the Jews and hiding Jews was the French Catholic conference of bishops. The author seems to have a problem admitting this. She blithely ignores the pastoral letters denouncing racism and anti-Semitism. She also ignores the turning point in the relationship between the Vichy regime and the bishops. It was precisely the anti-Semitic laws of 1942 which moved the bulk of French bishops from cautious support of the Vichy regime to clear opposition to a racist government which they found appalling.

While he doesn't have any of the neat gadgets Mr. Bond always has handy, Sammy Tippit does seem to be in the right place at the right time. He is an evangelist to nations in crisis. What a gripping book! Told with humility, this is an account of the amazing hand of Our Lord on the life of a regular guy. But this regular guy is compelled to tell others about his best friend and how this friend changed his life and can changes their's too.

I spend 10 minutes everytime trying to wrestle it into the right position, only to have it get messed up each time my cat uses the box.Why oh why did Clevercat change their liners?To make a bigger profit. The bags are now of poor, thin quality, and they charge more for them.I don't mind paying more money for quality liners. The liners are a great idea!

It's nearly impossible for me to scoop the clumped litter out of the ends of the litterbox; the only place my cat pees. Frustrating.

That's a good thing because:The Clever Cat bags don't fit the Clever Cat boxes very well: as another reviewer noted, they don't fit down into the corners - and they aren't deep enough to fit securely over the rim to be held down by the lid. I'm on my fourth liner/try: the cats don't scratch through the liner, they just pull it down, bury it in the litter and pee on it.

First of all, once you put the litter in the box it barely goes over the top edge so I have to hold the liner in place while putting the lid on. The liners need to be a little bigger. Second of all, they shred very easily so you need to use at least 2 at a time. Third, people said previously that using regular garbage bags was a better idea because they are cheaper, stronger and fit better. They are absolutely right. I stupidly bought 3 boxes of these so I had to keep using them until they were gone. What a waste of money and plastic. I have also decided to use regular black garbage bags that fit much better and do the job better overall.

I can never inflate it till its hard, some air is bound to escape when you try to seal the cap after pumping it. The seal could have been much smaller then it would take forever to fill it, then they could have provided a better pump....it goes on. For this price, I answered myself, this is what we get :) The pump is run on batteries and not any AC power supply. It takes a while to completely deflate it and roll it back. Now I have a leak/punch on it and I just threw it away in garage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaks... and can not find it.","review":"This product worked just fine for about two nights.

A while back I put in Show No Mercy and couldin't believe that all these years I discarded this as an ok album. Im tempted to say it is my favorite from Slayer. It is a great Trash Album that helped start the whole thrash movement. Highlights Include; Antichrist, Die By The Sword and Black Magic"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best Thrash album ever","review":"This is the best slayer album in my opinion. Better then \\"Reign in Blood\\" since SNM presented a raw guitar tone consisting of heavy & fast musical riffs with out the over the top distortion that Reign in blood and all the proceeding Slayer albums had. SNM best represented the essence of SLayer which is to convey the Evil we deal with in this world.With songs like Black Magic, Crionics, Fight Till Death, Slayer managed to create a mood that is a cross between a horror movie and a war cry.A trully great album with outstanding music. Not meaningless noise like we hear from the Fake metal bands that are out today."},{"rating":"2","title":"thrash classic","review":"Slayer's \\"Show No Mercy\\" is one of the greatest thrash metal albums ever!

Similar in sound to Judas Priest and similar in pure energy to Metallica(Kill 'em All), Show no Mercy exhibits a sound that would never be heard again by Slayer or by any other thrash band of the decade. The lead work is brilliant, the vocals are dynamic, and the lyrics are a prime example of the band's Satanesque gimmick. I wish that the rating system would allow for a 4.5 star rating, because that is what I would officially give this album. Songs like \\"Die by the Sword\\" and \\"Crionics\\" are powerful while \\"The Antichrist\\" and \\"The Final Command\\" are blazing fast. The album is well rounded and welldone. It can't be recommended for everyone; opinions are relative, but any fan of Slayer or thrash metal in general will find this one to be worth hours of listening."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE","review":"SLayer appeared in the musical scenario along with Metallica, Mercyful fate and others.

Sure 'Reign in Blood' a great album but doesn't come close to 'Show No Mercy'. This album sort of sounds like early Metallica but better!(in my opinion) A personal favorite is 'Crionics'.

Whereas Venom's Welcome To Hell was a poorly-recorded debut full of metallers who could not play to save their lives, Slayer's Show No Mercy is a poorly recorded debut of metallers who could play. That doesn't change the fact that this album is not one of the great debuts of metal but like Venom's debut it is an album that does carry some merit and enjoyment. Not the essential first purchase but not a waste of time or money either."},{"rating":"1","title":"not good debut....","review":"the drum sounds is so thin , cant compare it to metallica or megadeth debut album which are much betterits not really brutal either compare to their later releasemetal storm is best track on my opinionthis is shoulb be 3 or 4 star if better production"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as everyone says it is. Slayer got much better","review":"2.5 stars. There are a few classic songs on this album, such as \\"The Antichrist\\" and \\"Black Magic\\", but this is only the begining of how great Slayer were about to become. The guitarwork isn't that great, and the lyrics are much more tough to take seriously, both of which were completely changed on their later albums. Diehard fans will enjoy this, but you'd be much better off buying \\"Reign In Blood\\", \\"South of Heaven\\", or \\"Seasons In the Abyss\\", three of metal's finest documents.

They are what you expect for the price. The price is irresistible.If you expect high torque, good cartridges, don't bother buying. The Staton 30's have enough torque for the beginners but not for the pros.I give the Stanton 30b's a 2.5/5 on torque, they could've made it alot better. If you need more torque look at the Stanton 80's or Numark TTX's for the pros.This is great for starting and you will enjoy them for along time just like I have.

Then it tries to follow how the lives of certain Americans would have turned out diffently in the USSA and does it most uncovincingly. Finally it just seems to give up and tries to be cutesy after a while. I wanted to like this book but it just never got off the ground for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time And Money","review":"This book was one of the worst books I have ever read. From a historical perspective, other than the fact that the Socialist/Communist revolution takes place in the USA instead of Russia, it is an exact recap of our 20th century timeline. In addition, the authors have an annoying habit of throwing famous real (Colonel Van Damme) and fictional names (the Blues Brothers and President JR Ewing) into the stories for no apparent reason. On the positive side, the book does start out promising. The first three stories are rather interesting, but for the rest of the book, the authors seem to have run out of ideas and simply filled pages to complete the novel. In short, don't waste your time and money on this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent story for Young Children","review":"My youngest daughter loved the story.

They were very thin and rough. I contacted Amazon for a refund. They told me they would send me a return shipping label. After two weeks i didnt hear anything back from them. I needed some sheets bad so i decided to wash them to see if they would soften up. WWRROONNGGG!!!!! They now feal like a newspaper that has been washed then dryed.

Many weren't certain if this new album would be lackluster considering Andy Duncan (guitarist) left the band to be replaced by newcomer to the music scene Andy Ross.

I just want to say that I played this CD nonstop for four hours while cleaning my room (yeah, it was pretty messy) and didn't stop dancing. It's just good. Usually there's a few not-so-inspired songs on an album that you skip over to get to the good ones, but I very much enjoyed each and every track.Ok Go brings out the \\"born to dance\\" part in all of us."},{"rating":"2","title":"Spectactular!","review":"The second I turned on this CD, I needed to dance! It starts off with the incredible \\"Invicible\\", to \\"Do What You Want\\", \\"Here It Goes Again\\", all too good to be true! These songs are all upbeat, catchy, and fun! They are all amazing! I went to their concert yesterday and they just blew me away, I can't stop thinking about it! This CD is a must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"The demon's in the design/ a good idea at the time","review":"This is only OK Go's second CD, but you'd never know it. Both guitars and vocals are confident--even ambitious. And despite the cute video, \\"Here It Goes Again\\" certainly isn't the best here. The best is fast and clever: the power track \\"Invincible\\" , the vicious beat of \\"A Good Idea At the Time\\", its segue into the lovely \\"Oh Lately It's So Quiet\\". They wrestle with their influences--\\"No Sign of Life\\" is almost as good as \\"Where Is My Mind\\", the Pixies song it resembles. And \\"Maybe This Time\\"'s acerbic understatement highlights their lyrical sophistication. I'm impressed. These guys are in it for the long haul, and they're definitely more than the sum of their treadmills. Their second CD of engaging and artful pop delivers--unexpectedly--much more than it promises."},{"rating":"2","title":"More than just the treadmill song","review":"This album contains more than just the treadmill song.

They liked it too.OK GO is a creative band with talent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy it, mmk?","review":"My username is CuriousSymptoms on JC, first of all. Although quite different from their first full length album, OK Go, which in the words of lead singer Damian Kulash was delibreatly over produced, this one is amazing and wonderful and omfg, just listen to it, okay? Each one of the songs could be your favorite, this isn't a crap album with two standouts and 12 fillers. It's wonderful. They're gorgeous. They're funny. They're talented. They have sweet moves.

Not so much better than the self titled album but you can feel that the band are getting to know their own style so much better now. OK Go could not have done any better than this. The album has an amazing range of tracks that suit any mood you could be in.My favourite tracks are 'Television Television' and 'It's A Disaster'. They're full of cool and energy you can't find anywhere but with these guys. You can't help but dance the moves to 'Million Ways' in your head as it sounds through your body. Damien Kulash's voice is perfect for Dan, Andy and Tim's amazing instrumental work. I can't believe that they could follow up such a perfect debut album with an even more perfect second, but they have. 10/10. An album for anyone with a mind!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh ...","review":"While OK Go still is a little to concerned with their fashion and try a little too hard, they have managed to produces a fairly satifying album that was much better than their first (nothing was as good as Get Over It though).You want proof this band is trying too hard? Whats their favorite word? ... \\"Hey!!!\\" hopefully you recognized it. While the songs are often catchy, after extensive listening this album wares on my nerves; 'Do What You Want' went from my favorite song on the album to one of my least favorites in about a month.Overall - 7/10 This is probably worth buying, definitely more than its predecessor."},{"rating":"2","title":"Come on, come on, do what you want, buy this album!!","review":"This is one of the best albums I have heard. OK Go returns for a second round. This music is very fun and will be stuck in your head for days, I can say from experience. If you liked OK Go, you will for sure enjoy Oh No. All of the songs are different, yet the same. They all have a different feel, but are the OK Go style. All of it is easy to listen to, of course. Dan rocks out on the drums, Damian's vocals and guitar is amazing, Andy conquers the guitar and keyboards, and of course, Tim is the best bass player ever! Remember, mediocre people do exceptional things all the time!p.s. my juggling club name is hobbitfoot"},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh lately it's so quiet.","review":"That is, until I bought this album.

Good wholesome fun for the whole family, greatly suggested for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I think that this CD is really good, but it's no where near as amazing as seeing them in concert.

Try listening to the first three songs and not having them stuck in your head all day long. I think this is an improvement on their debut- it's not as poppy, not quite as slick. There are still those dazzling harmonies, but less keyboard. More straight guitar. Just pretty good music to dance to-or rock out to.The slower songs are not as strong as the full-force-ahead ones, with the exception of 'Oh Lately It's So Quiet.' Damian Kulash has a beautiful voice- as well as being possibly one of the most gorgeous people in existance. (**sigh**in love**)The only reason I took off the one star is because of the ridiculous thirty minutes of ambient noise at the end of the album. Um. Sorry, guys, but that's just a little pretentious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Return Of The Spitz {4 Stars}","review":"Count Bass D's latest effort picks up where his last effort, Begborrowsteel, left off. The Nashville, Tennessee native is a triple threat in the sense that he produces, writes, and scratches everything on the album with the exception of two songs. While it's normally a bad thing, Count keeping the same vibe from his last album release is actually a good thing because his particular style of off the wall rhymes mixed with hard beats makes for a great listening experience.

My youngest has Down Syndrome and is 16 now. He has earned money to collect all nine Wee Sing DVD's and enjoys them a lot. The Big Rock Candy Mountain is his current favorite but he doesn't communicate well enough for me to know why he likes it. In my opinion, too much time is given to the Little Bunny Foo Foo story woven between the songs. The story was fine; it just took up too much time-- we could have had more great songs! The video downplays the glories of all the good things to eat in the Big Rock Candy Mountain, which is nice for parents but takes away some of the magic the name of the video promises. All of the Wee Sing videos do moralize but others do it less obtrusively. Under the Sea is the worst, Marvelous Musical Mansion is best in this regard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this movie when I was a kid.","review":"The Wee Sing videos are great.

My little one gets so excited when she sees the box and knows I'm going to play the disc for her.

People who like their sound, thinking that \\"death metal\\" is really radical, different and non-commercial, should think different. This band is more commercial than Madonna, Michael Jackson or Back Street Kids. Although they make much less money than the stars I quoted, they don't play nothing! Under the cover of \\"having an attitude\\", they maintain a public without composing good songs, without at least improving in their own musical style and entire songs with only three or for accords. Who is more commercial?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Bad!","review":"It's not like I hate Black Metal and Death Metal but I think this album is very low class garbage that is put out to attract the \\"freaks\\". The \\"freaks\\" try to scare everyone by liking bands with messages that your mother would shun. It's all for shock and attention. I bought this cd for 7 dollars from a street side vendor and I think it really isn't good. The one high pitched screaming person is really annoying and adds nothing to the song except laughability.

Right, this record is not as far extreme as the early works, but it's just better because it's slowly, yeah more slowly and filled with part in which instrument sound so clearly. U can be violent, extreme, but in this case, CC shows how to do it with some good taste for the production.

I don't think that this is the greatest thing I ever heard, but it isn't as bad as some people say either. Many of the songs on this album are really good, and even catchy, but I wouldn't say \\"trendy\\". Some of the songs do seem like a gimmic because of how sick they are, but I don't let it bother me. The one thing that bothers me most is when Chris Barnes does that annoying whiney voice, which he really doesn't even do all the time. The songs I like most on this one are \\"Staring Through The Eyes Of The Dead\\" and \\"Stripped, Raped, And Strangled\\". Even though I like \\"Eaten Back To Life\\" better, I still would recomend this one to those who really like Cannibal Corpse."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disgusting and cruel... in other words, Perfect!","review":"It's amazing how Barnes manages to come up with increasingly vile and sick minded lyrics.

Sure, I thought their last album was terrific, but The Bleeding is from way back when Chris Barnes was still in the band. While his growls are still very cool (unlike his current garbage band), the music on this disc is typical, generic early \`90s death metal with some of the most immature lyrics ever layed down on paper.

I bought it and usually even my favorite albums had to grow on me before I fell in love with them but this album took 2 songs before I realized that \\"The Bleeding\\" was by far the greatest death metal album ever made.

This album is best known for the infamous track F**ked With A Knife. Chris's growls on here are a lot more clear, you can understand what he is saying thanks to the good production. It's also the first album to introduce former Malevolent Creation guitarist Rob Barret, as he and Jack Owen together throw some really good riffs.

There is no dearth of books on Hitler, of course. Fest's accomplishment here is that each section on Hitler is straddled by a section describing other events in the world and Germany, always giving the reader a larger context in which Hitler's activities can be placed.I'm a little dismayed by [people] who suggest that Hitler was merely a sufferer of post-traumatic-stress syndrome after his experience in the trenches of WWI, and that Fest does a disservice (to Hitler?) by leaving this information out. But many people have suffered in the trenches in many wars without later moving on to attempt world domination and genocide.In any case, Fest's biography omits nothing. It is written in a clear, beautiful language, and will leave you with an entirely new understanding of Hitler, Germans and Germany."},{"rating":"2","title":"A fairly good biography","review":"The life story of Adolf Hitler is so compelling that it is hard to imagine a book about it ever being boring. Fest's account is thoroughly researched and and meticulously detailed and was a best sellerin West Germany before being published in the U.S. Though not as readabled as Robert Payne's superior \\"The Life and Death of Adolf Hitler,\\" it still paints a fairly complete portrait of the man. If the book has any drawback, it is that it does not spend enough time on Hitler's pre-World War I activities. Payne much more thoroughly documents the humiliation and disappointment in Vienna that searled Hitler's soul and helped turn him into a monster. Nevertheless, Fest's \\"Hitler\\" remains one of the defining biographies of the 20th century's most evil figure."},{"rating":"2","title":"really good read","review":"A great involved narrative whose read is as fast and pleasurable as a summer romance.

Yes, I could get it replaced again, but since that means that I have a dance studio for one day at least w/o a CD player, I am switching brands now.The play button stops being responsive, its not stuck, but the intructor have to hardpress it several times to get it to play, and after a while (based on 2 previous failures), even that won't trigger a response anymore.Can't say anything about cue or any other features, as we don't use them.

The book actually covers more than just the day of Jesus' birth, giving attention to the circumstances surrounding that important event, such as Mary's pregnancy, the trip to Bethlehem, the visit of the shepherds and the Magi, and the trip to Egypt.Bishop takes a few liberties in his interpretation of the biblical story, but maintains the crucial elements in his narrative. He explains some of the customs of the day, including those of marriage and the process of giving birth.With only two of the four gospels giving any details about the birth of Jesus, Bishop has attempted to supply the missing details, weaving in material from various ancient historical and archeological sources. He doesn't tamper with the facts, but merely enhances them with a creative dialogue and description that makes the book an enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Solid Treatment of a Solemn Event","review":"Jim Bishop was the foremost practitioner of the \\"Day\\" historical documentary chronicles.

The text includes descriptions of conditions which women should be aware of (e.g., breast cancer, depression) as well as treatment options. In addition the text includes sections on women's mental health and on environmental sources of health problems (job, stress, cleaning solutions). One very nice feature of _The New Our Bodies, Ourselves_ is that each chapter ends with a listing of resources. If, in reading a chapter, you find something on which you would like more information, several sources will be listed at the end of the chapter. I have used this text in my \\"Psychology of Gender\\" course and the female students have all reacted _very_ positively to the book.

The stitching is not perfect, it is actually pretty flawed, but it will work (unless you pull a string, then the seam splits).

His characterizations have depth and honesty. Much of this novel is compelling and intriguing. Only occasionally does his writing style come off as overly verbose or inherently awkward.Unfortunately he forgot to tell a story. The Quiet Pools is little more than the build up to a sequel that was never written and quite probably never intended. One is forever waiting for this glorious Starship to set sail so that the characters Kube has so vividly painted can be challenged by the dangers of the cosmos and an adventurous undertaking.The entire book however, is just the build up BEFORE the ship launches. Perhaps I've missed the point.

It's a friggin action movie, what in this genre ever presupposed you shouldn't have to suspend belief or wait out this or that thirty second scene, especially when the crew is experimenting with new ways to make scenes better? The cinematography is very good, the dialogue is good, the action is inventive and engaging, the acting is good. Considering the thousands and thousands of action movies that have been made and the hundreds us junkies have watched I rate this near the top, in the top hundred certainly and probably in the top forty.

I gave up about a quarter to a third of the way into the movie.

This time out, Doughty is obviously grooving. And yes, Dave Matthews comes on board for a song. Careful not to let your friends find out! They might not think you're indie anymore.The haze of nostalgia has clouded many reviewers of this album, as they have been caught up in the fact that listening to Soul Coughing had finally given them a chance to be considered cool by someone other than their mothers.

I had been expecting the album to go in the direction of the songs on Rockity Roll. Something with an electro feel and new wave sensibility. I was amazed at what I got while listening to Haughty Melodic. It's great to hear these songs finished as they must have sounded to Doughty while he was writing them! If I had one complaint it would be that on some songs the effects on his voice kind of take off some of the haunting clarity that his voice possesses.

Also, the song \\"His Truth is Marching On\\" is really an interesting and deep song.

Not even my cats were scared by this thing.Overall, this was a complete and utter waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uhhhh...","review":"Well, a few days back, I got this \\"robot\\" along with mini robosapien. I opened Robosapien first, and excitedly popped in the batteries and turned it on, but all it did was march forward until it crashed into something. Lame. Next, I tried this guy, but he didn't do much more. In a nutshell, he walks in circles, and swivels his head and tail. He can move his arms and open his mouth, but that isn't quite how it sounds. You have to move his arms manually, and opening his mouth requires pushing a button on his chin. it may be fun for a few minutes, but compared to the true Roboraptor, he's just a toy.

Arch's screaming voice is ridiculous, the songs have no identity at all. FATES WARNING first work to be taken seriously was AWAKEN THE GUARDIAN. Their first two albums are useless pieces of copies of hundreds of much better heavy metal albums. And, even with AWAKEN THE GUARDIAN, it was their change of cocnept (going more progressive) that really made them to be around until today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! Possibly the best Fates Warning CD!","review":"I just recently completed my Fates Warning collection--I now have everything---every CD. This was actually the last one I bought, but I have to say, it is perhaps my favorite. The first song, \\"Traveler in Time\\", is just brilliant. It opens with 8 simple (but powerful) chords, repeated twice, that just stick in my head. I love it. There's not really a weak track on this CD. My own personal favorites are tracks 1 and 3, but they're all excellent. This album is, to me, by far the most Iron Maidenesque of their CDs. If you like Iron Maiden, you'll like the music and vocals on Spectre. This, along with \\"No Exit\\", \\"A Pleasant Shade of Gray\\", and \\"Awaken the Guardian\\" are my own personal picks for the best of Fates Warning."},{"rating":"2","title":"A piece of metal history","review":"This is a good album and in my opinion an album that was ahead of it's time. Some of the people reviewing this album negatively were probably not even born when this album came out. It is unfair to compare Korn with Fates Warning- there is decade of differance between the two. Fates were pioneers of metal (like tons of the 80s'bands that get zero credit). Metal was a new world in the 80s'- bands like Fates Warning laid the groundwork for bands like Korn etc. Have a little respect for your elders and listen to this stuff with a sense of perspective. Compare Spectre Within to other titles that were around at the time (1985) and I believe you will see that Fates Warning were breaking new ground."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skimmed through most of it","review":"Fairytale (Fairies of Rush)I skimmed through most of this book.

What we did know was rehashed and rehashed. Very little of the book was spent progressing the story. Just their endless speculating about the other. Then when we finally got back to the story.

As a nurse (and I also read it the first time while in nursing school) I know that every story in this book is absolutely true. I think anyone wanting an inside look into hospitals will find this enjoyable and informative. It proves that in medicine, truth is much stranger--and far more interesting--than fiction. Of the many authors whose books I have enjoyed, Echo Heron is the one I would most like to meet. From the intimate look she gives us into her life, it is easy to tell that this is a bright, funny, and incredibly caring woman."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read for any nurse, new or old, student or teacher!","review":"This book had me re-experiencing all those feelings a student nurse goes through as she begins her career! I found myself saying more often than not...\\"Hey, I did that!\\" or \\"Yeah, I know just how you mean!\\" Her beginning as a student, rocky, frightened, and her adventures through the ER sound so familiar.

I cared about them and what happened. Several times I cried and smiled. This book was written years ago and still it resonates today with relevant, timeless \\"everyman\\" struggles with life, death, happiness, children.... you name it.

Women are not being informed of alternative treatments and are not being told of the potential problems or life altering consequences of this surgery. For those of us who have already had surgery, this book has given validation to the problems we are now facing and explains in detailed, easy to understand medical terms what has happened to our bodies. To those of you who are possibly facing surgery for non-life threatening conditions, this book will empower you to make a truly informed decision as to whether to not to proceed with surgery. Just the footnotes alone (over 500), will reveal vital information and indicate how thoroughly the book was researched. You will find yourself reading the book from cover to cover and thanking Ms. Plourde for having the courage to tell us the real truth about hysterectomy and ovarian removal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Avoid, avoid","review":"Once again, we have another sensationalist tome on hysterectomy that is light on information and long on emotionalism. If Ms. Plourde felt that she needed to write this in order to resolve her own negative feelings about her hysterectomy, she should have kept it in a private journal, not published it and done such a disservice to so many women. I read this as a curiosity--the title itself completely turned me off. I have spoken to many other women who have hysterectomies as well, and believe me, the idea that we have been 'raped' is ludicrous and repugnant to us. It is very important to be very-well informed before undergoing any major surgical procedure, and I'm sorry to say that this book is decidedly unhelpful in that regard."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible Book","review":"After reading the \\"glowing\\"reviews about this book, I made the mistake of buying it.

There are over 600 pictures that will take you back to the 60's and 70's as the group became a cohesive force in the music industry and as the world became fascinated with the four men from Liverpool and their private lives. There are some great pictures of the Beatles as a group and solo pictures with their spouses or girlfriends.

He devotes one chapter to books he brings with him when going on a long-distance fishing trip---books that can help fill the time when stuck in the airport or at a motel when the weather precludes going outside. He mentioned reading books by James Crumley---an author I had not previously known. So, I grabbed this book, and thoroughly enjoyed it. The book has that hard-boiled, Raymmond Chandler tenor about it---alot of cursing and \\"tough talk\\", but the story was surprisingly (to me) and interestingly involved. It was a good read that kept me turning the pages at a rapid rate. I'll certainly pick up some more of Crumley's stuff.

Crumley's vivid detail, down-and-out characters and brief bursts of violence make his story as vivid as a Hank Williams tune. His hero, C.W. Sughrue (\\"Sugh\\" as in \\"sugar\\" and rue as in \\"rue the goddamned day\\") is everything a hardboiled detective ought to be; alcoholic, rebellious, cynical and beholden to no code of honor but his own. The mystery itself unfolds in a bizarre and complex manner, leading to a payoff that you know won't be pretty. It may take Crumley a bit too long to get there, but its a fun trip while it lasts.Overall, a flawed but classic novel that fans of Andrew Vachss, George P. Pelecanos, Jonathan Valin and John D.

The purple is a dull lavender, I was hoping it would be a little more vibrant in color. The color I could overlook, but it's so thin and small that there's no point in having it. With a coupon I can get a yard of nice minky fabric in the color I want for less than $10 and make my own nice thick minky dot changing pad cover.

However, the material seems kind of cheap and the terry tends to pick if you catch velcro - from a diaper tab or swaddle blanket - on it.

This is not a quality product and Medelco carries no spare parts."},{"rating":"1","title":"denture cleaning kitthe","review":"the powder was hard as a rock and i couldn't get any to pour out of the bottle. called customer service and they never got back to me so l sent it back"},{"rating":"1","title":"ultrasonic denture cleaner kit by medelco","review":"I originally gave this product a good review in spite of negatives from other buyers.

One of the worst books I have EVER read. Norman goes horribly wrong in this book with an endless stream of drivel about how women are really not women nor are they truly happy until they are raped repeatedly by big strong manly types who carry swords and spears. He goes on to suggest that us earthly man types are weak because we \\"allow\\" our women freedom instead of making them slaves, which leads to everyone on earth being unhappy. Avoid this book if at all possible. It adds only one minor plot point to the overall series which is revealed in the first few pages of the next book, so you will not miss anything by skipping this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best sf/fantasy I've ever read.","review":"I found a used copy of an early 80s printing of Captive of Gor. I had not read any of the previous Gor novels, but my father used to read them when I was young. Since this was all I had, I started in on volume 7 without having read any of the previous volumes. Although I probably would have had a better appreciation of the context if I had started with volume 1, that was not necessary to be able to understand the story.I'll admit it, I bought this book because the version I have has a very sexy cover. And yes this book is kind of a guilty pleasure for me in the sexual and anti-feminist aspects of it. But frankly this is just bad writing. The story is ok. The wold is well-developed. The protagonist is someone you love to hate. The book is just badly written. The author keeps repeating himself and coud have probably cut the length of this book to 1/3. WIth that in mind I will cut short my review before I start repeating myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not my type of fiction.","review":"I haven't read it. Based on reading another book in the series, I probably won't read it. The writer is hateful toward women, and writes long demeaning sex scenes where the woman is called an \\"animal\\" and Gorean men are glorius."},{"rating":"1","title":"same old, same old","review":"Yes, folks, it's yet another over-hyped gravelly-voiced singer-songwriter from Texas. (Boy, those Brits will fall for anything with a twang nowadays) You've all heard this stuff before from countless other coffeehouse troubadours.

The story revolves around best friends Mahogany and Shanice, childhood chums who have been thick and thin together. Now as college-aged adults, they're dealing with such issues as love, fidelity (or lack thereof), bisexualty, marriage, and parenthood. The novel then ties in a web of intrigue wherein Mahogany is being stalked.The plot could have been decent, but overall it was just cheesy. Read for yourself, though ... maybe you like cheese."},{"rating":"2","title":"wonderful Natalie Wood movie","review":"This is a great Natalie Wood movie. She was around 9 or 10 when she made this movie. And she is at her best. It also has a good story line. It is good from beginning to end.

A timeless classic, you will still be listening to this, when all the rest of your pop collection has been filed in the bin. And then youll realise why. in a word quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"He does it again","review":"George does it again. I don't care what people say about him personally, (I think he's cute as hell) but he's as talented as they come. He say's alot about life in general and his life through his music. And I can connect with it. It was as expected and better. I know he has a partner and I wish them a long and happy life together. I hope it gives him many more oppertunities and material for creating music. This CD moved me like I hadn't been moved by a piece of music in a long while."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does George Michael even understand the themes of his songs?","review":"The music is very fresh his voice is nearly perfect, but you have to have an iq of over 200 or peronally know this man to understand what he is talking about. Amazing is about Jesus I got that. Then one song is about his uncle. Then their is a song about the world coming to and end and he is just on drugs. Then there is a song about sex, then there is a song about his boyfriend. Then there are two songs aimed to capture a gay club scene thing. At the end of this thing I'm thinking man this is kind of cool but i'm no sexual freeek. You got to admit his videos kick ass and their almost as funny as eminems. I think overall this is probably his best album ever."},{"rating":"1","title":"I tried to be Patient with \\"Patience\\"","review":"After my first listen to GM's new CD I totally hated it. It sounds nothing like the GM that I'm used to from past CD's. All of the songs have NO connection and there isn't even ONE big single among them. I thought if I listened to \\"Patience\\" a few more times that I would at least be able to pick out a favorite song, but that has not been the case. GM needs to go back into the studio and create music and songs from his heyday of the late 1980's and 1990's. Then - maybe - he will have some more hits on his hands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Legalized Dope!!!","review":"Unlike previous releases by George, this one takes a few listens to hit you just right, but when it does this album is deep, smooth and silky. Lyrical content is first rate, fun and also deeply personal, everything you would come to expect from George. When it comes to \\"Patience\\", as a true fan, I would wait at long as it took, as this is one artist that truly does it for the love of the music, a rarity these days. If you are diggin' this, you need to check out the SEAL IV cd as well, you will not be dissapointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"SOLID and WORTH BUYING! - Glad you are back George!!","review":"George Michael's unique style shines though. The CD has some wonderfully deep, emotional songs (Patience, My Mother Had a Brother...) as well as catchy tunes (Amazing, Cars and Trains, Please Find Me Someone) and 'Flawless' is a techno style/dance song. One thing I really noticed on this CD - he has an incredible voice and the album delivers a little bit of everything. It's my favorite CD in the car right now!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Defiantly worth the wait","review":"This CD will move you in more than one way.....his ballads are absolutely beautiful and soulful. George Michaels voice is so rich and full of emotion when he sings.......\\"My mother's brother\\" and \\"Through\\"...... he sounds absolutely amazing. The faster songs such as \\"Amazing\\", \\"Flawless\\" and \\"Freeek\\" are wonderful dance tracks. I couldn't be happier with my purchase there isn't a song on here that I can not fully appreciate ......this is a remarkable CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Where are all the reviews??","review":"Apparently everyone wrote a review for the IMPORT version of \\"Patience\\"....I KNEW I should have gotten the import!! Anyways, this album is great! The man has one of THE best voices in pop music ever. His voice is so clear and pure that it's an injustice to not listen to him sing. Standout songs for me on this album are \\"Patience\\", \\"Amazing\\", \\"John and Elvis are Dead\\", \\"Cars and Trains\\", \\"Flawless\\", and \\"Freek\\". But THE best song has got to be \\"My Mother Had a Brother\\". Oh my word...He was singing that song!! \\"Through\\" is another huge highlight showcasing George's vocal talents and the emotion he puts in a song. Well, be sure to check this album out. Maybe with enough sales George Michael will think about touring in the US again! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Would Have Waited Another Eight Years...","review":"for the pop music genious George Michael. Excellent composed music with beautifully written lyrics."},{"rating":"1","title":"If Patience is A Virtue, Colour Me Discomposed","review":"In his first CD of originals since 1996s listless 'Older', we find George Michael reading through his journals - he's happily in love with his Texas beau, he mourns the suicide of his gay uncle at an unfortunate time in gay-history, and he appears to have passed the humiliation of that little Will Rogers Memorial Park men's room incident. While we are happy for his love life [and we could assume he'll be okay after his recent drug arrest] and to just hear him croon again, we could have - should have - expected anything more current sounding than the cornball confessionals, drippy ballads and narcoleptic mid-tempo dance ditties he's pumped out for almost 2 decades. Welcome to the millennium, George. Long live 1987. My grade: C+"},{"rating":"2","title":"George is back and worth it!","review":"I am not going to say much except that this is a great blend of uptempo songs (AMAZING, FLAWLESS) and great ballads (JOHN AND ELVIS ARE DEAD, THROUGH).....it blends his 80's sound with his modern day more introspective type material and succeeds.......my only complaint is I wish he had included a few more uptempo tracks and less ballads.....he really works his voice when it is in a dance type setting....sexy!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal","review":"I believe the title explains it all. Don't waste your time with any other garbage out there-Get this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL!!!!","review":"From the liner notes, George states that this album took 5 years to complete. I think they should have put another 5 more into it. The songs are boring, they go nowhere, and the music never really gels into anything cohesive or coherent. I feel like I'm listening to the past 10 years of his therapy sessions. And they are as BORING as hell."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was mislead!!!","review":"This review is late, but I had to put it out there. After waiting so, so, so long for new George Michael, I was very disappointed. I read all the reviews, got hyped up and pre-ordered the CD. I didn't like it. I didn't expect him to pick up right where he left off but PATIENCE was a total 360. I didn't like it. Don't think I even finished listening to the enitre thing. I decided to include my review simply because I purchased it on the strength of other reviews. I love George Michael and am always in his corner, but I couldn't get behind Patience."},{"rating":"1","title":"Patience with fans nerves...................","review":"George Michael didn't put his best foot forward on this album,yet it reminds me of how much he thinks he trying to give his fans something worthwhile. We all are mostly disappointed in this half-hearted effort from a very talented man,George stop relaxing and get to work. Avoid this album if possible."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patience is flawless","review":"It's better to wait than never. It's a very personal album fromGeorge Michael. A great collection of songs with diversity anddepth of expression. A album that is going to be a landmark. I like every song in this album for its differencefrom his previous albums. Although this album is overdued in time, the design concept of this album has made up for his fansand is full of surprises both for its song tracks and its cover design. \\"Flawless\\" catches you on your first listening without a doubt will hit #1 and so will the many other tracks in this album can become top hit singles. Well-done, George, congratulation !-Steve Liu"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointing comeback","review":"i ran out to buy this cd after having heard the single \\"amazing\\" which i immediately fell in love with and expected to hear more great songs on george michael's comeback album. boy, was i disappointed! \\"patience\\" is an apt title for this cd because you're going to need alot of it to get through these songs. after \\"amazing\\" it's downhill all the way. i listened to the cd all the way through twice and was still unable to single out one other song that was in any was memorable or stood out among all the others. they all blended into a big boring mess! getting through this cd was an effort and i'll probably never listen to it again. of course, george michael's voice is still the same wonderful instrument it always was, but unfortunately it's not enough to carry this dreary assortment of songs.i want the old george michael back."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great voice, but where's the rhythm?","review":"I've been a pretty loyal fan of George, but this album, well, it lacks the groove of his other work. Amazing is okay, but Shoot the Dog and Freek are the best...still, he lost his zip. Listen without Prejudice was far better...better beats, better vocals, better groove. I 'm very disappointed....don't spend $ on the import."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wham! Bam! Thank U Ma'am!","review":"I always loved George Michael from the days he wore those big ol' hula hoop earrings in Wham! George and I have several things in common: we're beautiful and talented gay men who have a lot to offer. I love this record. It is so \\"amazing.\\" You go, George!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Fantastic","review":"I have owned every record George Michael has made, including Wham! records. In my opinion this is the best album he has made to date. I've been walking around in a daze since I first heard this. I haven't purchased any records in ages. This is definitely a record that gaps that bridge successfully. Brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not his best but still great album!","review":"One might say that \\"Patience\\" is not enough after so many years of waiting. THis cd takes few good spins before you find the gems. This album was not intended to produce countless of remix singles. This album is a personal collection of singers life experiences and observations over the past years. Fan of quality music will definitely not be dissapointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Listened w/out Prejudice - Didn't like it.","review":"I agree with other reviews regarding this CD and how it's a bit disappointing. I think if you're a real huge GM fan, including his ballads and singing approach, you'll probably dig this album. If, on the other hand, you're looking for a full CD of songs like Flawless (Go to the City), you'll be HUGELY disappointed. (BTW, a group called The Ones are responsible for the music behind that song - go find their CD if you want a \\"flawless\\" purchase...heh.) Anyways, aside from that song, the only other song that comes close to it is Amazing, and even that pales in comparison. Listen to an Internet stream from m1live.com - they play a mixed version of Amazing that puts some life into it... but I digress...if you want dance/upbeat, look elsewhere. If you're a diehard fan, chances are you'll be satisfied with this one. In all cases though, don't compare this to his other stuff...from another time, my friends..."},{"rating":"2","title":"George at his best","review":"I was really afraid that this album was going to be boring, jazz crap like \\"Older\\" was. On first listen, I was afraid I was right, but after several listens not only did it start to grow on me but I became downright addicted to it. Those who say the songs lack \\"groove\\" must need their hearing checked. Those who say it's not as \\"lyrically satisfying\\" as his other CDs have not listened to it more than once. It takes a while for all the layers to reveal themselves to you. George has so much going on in background it's almost mindboggling how his genius works.My opinion is that this is the best overall GM CD since Faith. And the best part is that he left all of the jazzy crap totally off this one!Oh, and I just don't get those who don't like Shoot The Dog. Put the headphones on and listen to the world he's created in that one song - - amazing stuff. Like I said....the whole CD takes repeated listening for it to sink in. But it's well worth it when it does!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Patiently Bad","review":"Man this is not the George Michael who I have really liked before. It seem like he just turned his recorder on in his living room when he was feeling mello and decided to make up a tune as he played. It would be OK for background dinner music or something to put the kids asleep to but thats it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply fabulous","review":"Although the title of this CD refers to his appreciation for his die-hard fans who've stuck with him through his absence, this CD is for EVERYONE! Whether you're a long-time fan, or have never listened to his past recordings, you owe it to yourself to \\"listen without prejudice\\" (pun intended, but absolutely literal). From the mournful tones of \\"John and Elvis are dead\\" to the fun sexiness of \\"Freek '04\\", this has something for everyone! As long as you can appreciate real music and true talent, you'll wonder how you ever survived without this in your music collection. Bravo!, and thanks George!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Even Older","review":"George Michael titled his 1996 album Older. He should have titled this Even Older for the album consistes mostly of ballads, which really isn't a bad thing actually, for he has a penchant with good emotive slow songs.Opening the album is the brooding title track which brings to the current single, Amazing with its laid back and engaging mood. No worries, though there are only a few uptempo, they are pretty good. Flawless Go City is hail-back to disco 70's ala high-brow OTT Pet Shop Boys. Cars and Trains is a funky song with an infectious backing track. Freeek! 04 is a self-reminder of the toilet episode but still comes off as being a good dance track.Great to see Michael back on form."},{"rating":"2","title":"Patience","review":"This is an awesome CD.It was worth the wait. I hope this is not his last. If you love George Michael as I do then buy this CD and tell all your friends too!The ballads truly show off his incredible voice. And the dance tunes keep you moving in your seat. He really poured his heart and soul into the lyrics."},{"rating":"2","title":"Grammy Folks Don't Miss This One!!!","review":"Patience is just BRILLIANT!!! The songs,the singing, production,and overall styling of the music. Keep it up \\"George\\" we allneed the truth coming out of artists lives right now. If you needan opening act just email me.Love To All Great Artists,Jean McClain(Pepper Mashay)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring George - But I Still Have Faith","review":"This is arguably George Michael's most personal offering to date where he sings of love (American Angel), the Past (Round Here) and death (Mother Had A Brother)...All tracks that tick along quite nicely. But that is the problem. For an artist so talented, he really needs to be pushing boundaries and not producing background lounge music !! He lifts the pace somewhat with the best track 'Amazing', 'Flawless' - with it's pumping disco beat, and the political 'Shoot The Dog' (not available on all CD's as the song was pulled off the American version)..But it is not enough to recover the uneventfulness of this collection...What you do get for your money is at max 4 decent tracks, George's beautiful voice and perfect production...not sure if that is enough to pay the asking price!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not creative enough","review":"The world knows that George Michael is one of the best songwritters of this age and he has proved that to us since Wham! up until his \\"Greatest Hits\\" compilation. This album missed the greatness of his work. Only a few tracks stand out such as \\"Amazing\\" ,\\"Flawless (Go to the City)\\", and \\"Freeek '04.\\" Others are just too dry and boring. This album took too long to make and the whole sound is not integrated. This album is a disappointment."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the wait","review":"This album is fantastic. I am a fan since the Wham days, and this album does not disappoint. Even friends that are not into him have said that the songs are great and that his voice sounds AMAZING. Welcome back, George! If we could now just convince him to not stop making albums!!!! Btw, saw him on Oprah and have to say that he is a real sweetheart. It is refreshing to see a celeb that is so open and honest."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well Worth The Wait","review":"Just give it a listen. If you don't find yourself singing along or swinging your hips then you probably don't like Pop music. The music is fundamentally awesome from fragile ballads to back breaking beats. The lyrics are classic George Michael. At times his angelic voice distracts from his haunting message. \\"My Mother Had A Brother\\" brings a happy tear to my eyes. I have the import, with all the lovely tracks, just in time for summer driving with the top down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disagree If You Must ...","review":"... but George Michael still got it. The sign of true talent is a skill which does not deteriorate with age or infrequent use. George Michael, in my opinion, has real talent. I loved this album; heard Cars and Trains on Rhaposody and made my move. Unfortunatley, some artists suffer because even though they have the talent, the material they get or the production suffers. Overall, I don't think this happened to GM this time out. I recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely PERFECT","review":"The more I listen to this CD, the more I love it. A great combination of upbeat songs and ballads. George Michael writes his music from the heart, he sings from his heart and thats what shines through. To me it seems that he is sharing his experiences as a true artist does, not trying to be some type of phony commercial success like so many of today's pop stars. His voice and his music are the real thing. I am so glad he's back. Thank you George!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you've missed George Michael you won't be disappointed","review":"Yes, if you've simply missed just hearing George Michael's unmistakable voice, you will enjoy this CD. It's what you would expect from him and as a fan, that was all I needed to know. Some ballads, some soul searching, some interesting lyrics and something to get you moving. I'm keeping my fingers crossed that he makes a sexy video out of \\"Flawless\\" that can be blasted across the screens at my favorite alternative clubs. It's good to hear him again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautifull, moving, intelligent and rewarding","review":"Remove the singles shoot-t-dog and freek, and you are left with an amazing album. Not as initially 'catchy' as some of his previous work, yet for those that will allow more time to appreciate and understand this album, the rewards are outstanding. Initially I was doubtfull, but after a few listens, the songs are getting stronger and stronger. Some of his strongest lyrics and emotions are captured on this record, and I would recomend it to anyone who appreciates outstanding talent, and can listen with an open mind and heart. Absolutley beautifull, this is not an album to miss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply the Best","review":"This CD stunned me when I heard it. There is so much there, so much being said it is hard to put into a review.The song many reviewers are talking about \\"My Mother Had a Brother\\" is so touching. I hope as many people as possible hear it.George's voice is absolutely at his best. The music is the best I've ever heard him do. My favorite CD \\"Faith\\" has been replaced.From the last song and from what I've heard, this is his last CD. Like another reviewer said,\\"What a way to go.\\" But from the heartwrentching lyrics of the last song it's time for George to do what makes George happy. He's given us the gift of his music. Hopefully, he will come out of retirement from time to time.Buy this one. You will love it!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The best pop CD In at least 2 years!","review":"This CD is by far, with out a doubt, the best pop CD to come out in at least two years. I am a CD addict. I buy CDs as they are released and am rarely satisfied with the CD as a whole, only listening to one or two songs. Patience is the exception! This is the first CD is have purchased since 2001 that I can listen to from beginning to end and back again. Amazing is an Amazing track. American Angel and Please Send Me Someone are touching. Precious Box and Flawless are, well, Flawless. This CD screams \\"Welcome to 2004!!!!!!\\" What else can I say? This album is one of the very very few pop albums with orginal style and music. It has been well worth the wait. I hope this album brings George back to the spotlight and convinces him to record a couple more. Buy it! It's a definite classic!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It Takes a lot of Patience to sit through this","review":"Been looking forward to George's new album for years. While the fast tracks are decent and competent, I expected more from his slower tracks (which used to be his forte). George Michael in an interview once said his goal was to write songs which would \\"Stand the test of time\\" - but in this case I doubt it. Ballads are meandering, overlong and almost tuneless, compounded by the sin of trying to squeeze in sententious and pretentious lyrics into a melodic line."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Ok","review":"Save your money and download the two best songs from this cd. Amazing and Flawless. The rest is all garbage. I dont like any of the slow songs. I think he could do better. Sorry George Faith will always be your best."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull dull dull - he's lost his edge","review":"I've been a George Michael fan for years. I've been particularly impressed with his recent stuff - the balads, re-makes, and fun dance tunes from the last couple of years have an originality not usually found with pop music. So I was excited about this new CD and sprung for it, even though it's an expensive import. What a mistake. Boring. Dull. Cliche. Self-involved. He's lost his edge. Wait for a used copy - it'll be in the discount rack in no time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best I heard","review":"I will more than likely see messages shooting down my review, however, this is not the best cd from george michael. Fortunately, I did not pay for this. There was only one song that I actually liked and that is Round Here. The rest just didn't measure. Even the music to rock your body to proved to be 'empty'. Sorry, George but I will continue to stick with 'Listen Without Prejudice'. It's really the best you've done. The sad part is this is cd that caused you so much distress with the music industry."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapoinment - because of BLAND MELODIES","review":"Although a personal album, beautiful lyrically, and beautiful in its careful and perfectionist production and arrangements, the melodies lack originality and are catchy in a forgettable and bland way. Most of them are reminiscent of other songs. Nothing is impressive or fresh, unlike in Listen Without Prejudice and Older. I know that many songwriters loose their songwriting spark after a while. George Michael has definitely lost it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No patience...BAD","review":"This CD should be named after the MJ classic Bad! The only thing about that statement is that it is true!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Pass the toilet paper","review":"This Greek Goddess needs to cruise new rest areas for fresh ideas! It's starting to stink the CD player. The singles that did not fair so well on the charts and went by US soil unnoticed, even by the DJ's (remixes were bad too!), GM should take some more time off and come back with his best!. Or maybe we have seen his best and there's no way up for him. I'm sure he will do well in Europe, because Europeans are familiar with Eurotrash. So what ever possesed him to write an uninteresting song about Elvis and John?"},{"rating":"1","title":"IT SUCKS!","review":"This is one of the worst cds I have ever bought, it was not worth $12.99.

It was a book we read and discussed together. I found the book to be insightful, so I gave it as a gift to a church friend for a Christmas gift.

Having read the book before, I recognized this. Sometimes letters and words were left out, while other pages were fine. I contact Amazon for a return, sent the book back, and my payment was returned.

I was given only 25 minutes to write a detailed essay on rewarding career choices. I do not have the life experience to write a successful essay on this topic without research.

This book is riddled with errors. The practice tests are horrible. You have to flip pages to get from the passage to the questions. There are countless errors in the book. For example, in the grammar, it said that this was gramatically correct \\"Eventually, Wang did attempt to move into personal computers, but by that time\\". That is blatantly wrong and there are tons more of errors like that in the book.

It is not an easy read, but not every beautiful thing in life is supposed to be easy.If you're looking for a cliff notes version of the story, purchase this edition.

I first read Pyle's Robin Hood at a pretty early age - about ten. It was challenging but absolutely magnetic, the appeal much enhanced by Pyle's own beautiful illustrations.

I understand that it's adventure and that the speed of the narrator should reflect this, but this is just too fast. I was quite surprised, as we've listened to a lot of books on tape and have never had this problem before. After listening to only a few minutes I feel as if I'm going to get a headache. The only reason I gave it 2 stars instead of 1 star is that my seven year old listens to it without complaint."},{"rating":"2","title":"a hard hitting truthful book","review":"A lot of books tell you how to be rich, but they rarely work.

The book is not titled \\"how to become rich\\" since that isn't its focus, and contains Getty's advice about the sort of person you should be, if you are rich or to be rich. Intelligently written, it presents the gritty reality of Getty's accomplishments, and the good and bad sides of being successful in business.

I'm comparing this \\"classic\\" to some other classics like \\" Think and grow rich\\" and \\"Science of Getting Rich\\", there is no comparison. Napoleon Hill and Wallace Wattles are in a league of their own. I know Getty made the money but even compared to Andrew Carnegie (who obviously made his own money) there really isn't any advice that was close to the value of the above mentioned. In summary, he's an interesting man, not always the most \\"conventional\\" way of living, and somewhat a pioneer in his time. He kinda reminds me of Donald Trump. It's a fast read and it can't hurt absorbing some of his insights."},{"rating":"2","title":"wow wisdom always transcends","review":"this book was written a bit ago now 60s and while mostly written for male readers (just have to look over that part as a sign of the times) but it is extremely relavant and wonderfully helpful to get into the pulse of a very powerful man. my favorite parts were how he de-mystifies his lifestyle- saying it isn't always dreamy and what the drawbacks were to having so much wealth and also how he wished he had figured out how to succeed in marriage as he did with using and appreciating money. i appreciated his humility and his very straightforward style. I also loved the way that he really stresses the importance and the responsibility that wealth holds and how when you get more you are responsible for giving back more and helping more. I am so grateful for him as the trips to both Getty museums were so wonderful and I am so appreciative of all of his passionate extensions of giving back to the arts and the public at large."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"Good read for someone looking to improve their wealth without having to hit the lotto.

When I got his CD, I was not disappointed in the least. His vocals are awesome and moving, but almost all of his tracks had an eerie familiarity to them. Here's to you Wil.

And no, I did NOT run these next to power wires, they ran down the middle of my cabin where there are no wires to interfere with.

If you've never thought of trombone as an instrument to take the lead in melody and rhythm, take a listen to this album. For some reason this was about his only album that was a successful release in the US. I think it's a superior album to \\"Colors\\" which you can still find in print in the US, except for the piece \\"New Love (Canco do Nosso Amor),\\" on which de Souza tries to sing. His solos are more innovative and flowing on Lucy than on Colors. The CD was just re-released by Capitol Records in Japan (2011) and I was able to pick up a copy. It may make it to the US eventually, but if you search for a Japanese distributor, you may find it."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"GREAT ACTING PERFORMANCE OF MARTIN SHEEN!\\"","review":"Martin Sheen presents Excellent acting as he plays a Priest who loves movies. His Inspiration takes him to different levels of drama as he contemplates on opening a Cinema in an Irish village.

This film portrays passion, emotion, and inspiration. Very Entertaining and Enjoyable from start to finish. Highly Recommended!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A film with depth - excellent performance from Martin Sheen!","review":"I expected a decent film, given that it starred Martin Sheen, but Stella Days is a period piece with more depth and story than I even imagined! Having a priest wanting to buck the system back in the 1950s is unique, but Sheen pulls it off with a character that will have you rooting for his originality and constant frustration with the religious system. And Stephen Rea, as Sheen's nemesis, is the guy you will love to hate.

This book was fantastic at helping me draw my conclusions about if and when to give my son vaccinations.The authors also explain the terms they use and I never felt like I was going to fall asleep, nor did I get frustrated, as information about this topic is usually so difficult and technical.My congratulations go out to these authors and deep thanks to them too."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT INFO, a little dated","review":"I just had a baby and wanted to learn more about vaccinations. This book provided a great foundation of knowledge. The only down side was since the book has been written many of the vaccinations have done away with thermosal (mercury)- which is great. My Ped. said the alternative schedule was fine, but dated.Overall, glad I read it but wish it was written with the most current vaccine info."},{"rating":"1","title":"Useful for balance, although at times seems hyperbolic","review":"I bought this book because i was genuinely concerned about the harm vaccines might do to my sweet baby. While the book contained some useful information, the evidence she cites doesn't fulfill the promise of the title. The most useful thing about this book was the message that it's okay to ask questions and that parents have choices. I felt better about giving my child most of the recommended vaccines because I was making an informed choice after looking at both sides of the issue."},{"rating":"2","title":"Need to know information","review":"This book will scare you about vaccines and the whole industry. It is exactly what I was looking for. I'd been doing research on my own on the internet and old medical journals and had copies and clippings all over the place. If you are concerned about the safety and effectivness of immunizations and your childs Doctor and other moms for that matter make you feel like a paranoid conspiricy theorist then this book gathers in one place information from another Doctor and many studies that supported my concerns. There is also a very helpful section on steps you can take to make immunizations more safe for your child. As well as what you can do legally to avoid them altogether if you choose. Nothing fires me up more than the goverment or anyone trying to force me to do something for my own good. Give me the facts and let me make a decision. That's what this book does."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I just finished reading this book and I thought it was great. I am now pregnant and I wanted to be more informed about the current vaccines."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read for every parent and care-giver","review":"Dr. Cave's presentation on vaccinations is excellent. While she is not wholly opposed to vaccines, as so many of the \\"quacks\\" out there are, she presents the information as it is: she realizes that most vaccines have serious problems and that some are almost completely pointless. It is wonderful that so many doctors and experts are calling for parental education and higher standards for the vaccine manufacturers and the federal government. This book helps us make educated decisions on which vaccines are best for our children and which ones might cause them harm."},{"rating":"1","title":"Out of Date","review":"This book is so out of date that I don't think any pediatricians use the vaccines or techniques ( such as stacking vaccines) they warn you about. All this book did was scare me. I did learn a few things about vaccines and were to get the latest information. Overall not worth the time and the scare."},{"rating":"2","title":"I wish I had known this book existed before I made the mistake of vaccianting my boys","review":"This is an EXCELLENT book. My son was a perfectly NORMAL, beautiful little boy until he received his MMR vaccine. Within 24 hours he had all the hallmark symptoms of autism. He and his little brother are close in age, so my younger son received vaccines for the first 6 months of his life. The result? AUTISM AND PDD-NOS!!! If I had read this book, my boys, myself, and the rest of my family would not be suffering the way they are now, and our lives would be totally different. This should be REQUIRED reading for any new parent!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you only buy 1 book on the subject THIS is the one to buy","review":"I can't say it any better then the readers before me. Read their reviews. They are accurate. I have been researching this subject for 2 years +. Dr. Cave's book gives you an honest and responsible view from the medical side. Believe me, that is very different from what your childs doctor will give you! I had to shop long and hard to find a doctor that will let me pick and choose the vaccinations I want my daughter to have or not have.This is the most important book I have EVER owned."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Reccomend","review":"While this book does provide some valuable information, it also provides a lot of scare tactic type advice. I don't like when Dr's try and convince people to vaccinate by using scare tactics and I don't like when opponents of vaccinations use scare tactics to prove vaccinations are dangerous. There are dangers with vaccinations, as well as many benefits. Parents need to know about the diseases, the ingredients in vaccines, and they need to make decisions themselves. Repeated examples of the one in 250,000 kids who gets a life threatening illness as either a result of not vaccinating or a result of a vaccination isn't helpful at all. This book is full of the latter, which, in my opinion makes it useless in helping with decision making. Scare tactics are an attempt to make the decision for you, and I want to make my own decisions regarding my children's health. Facts are what are needed."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better books out there.","review":"This book is fine if you need a medical opinion but it does not go far enough reporting on the hazards of vaccination.

Really unconscionable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well organized","review":"This is a very well organized, easy to read, parent friendly book. It really does tell you all of the thigns your doctore may not tell you, most likely out of ignorance, and gives very easy to follow warnings and guidelines.

I did not know that vaccinating a child was an option until the year 2000 when my sister refussed to vaccinate her first daughter. It caused me to really think and I decided to begin research when I became pregnant in 2003. Thanks to this book I did not vaccinte my newborn and was able to make an EDUCATED dicision about this issue, not assume I had to do what the government says. I have gotten a lot of flack for this decision but it is mine to make. Thanks to Stephanie Cave my child will not have to be subject to unresearched \\"testing\\". My child is not a lab rat. Please be advised that I suggest you use a back up method for your childs immune safety, such as Young Living Essential Oil produts. Do not send your child into the world unprotected. Let's make this world a better and safer place to be :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"good book good start but not an end","review":"This is a good book for parents who want simple facts that are easy to understand. It is a good start to researching the pro's and con's of vaccinations but should not be the end. The book has many good facts, and some opinions. She covers almost all subjects of concern but not all thoroughly. I would definitely recommend this book as a starting place. If you want a book of scientific facts, studies and medical information then you probably want Vaccines: Are They Really Safe and Effective? By Neil Z. Miller. His book is full of scientific facts on BOTH sides, with point and counter point information referencing medical journals, scientific studies and other documented facts. If you choose to read a few books on the subject then be sure to pick up What Your Doctor May Not Tell You About Children's Vaccinations. by Stephanie Cave, but if you only read one get Vaccines: Are They Really Safe and Effective? By Neil Z. Miller."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Very Valuable Tool","review":"I gave it four stars instead of 5 because the info is outdated. The book is great but needs to be updated-errors changed and re-released. The author gives a suggested alternate vaccination schedule to follow which is what I chose to do for my child.Mercury may not still be in vaccines in an amount like they used to be but other chemicals are. I would suggest that the author include these things. Such examples are; MSG and formaldahyde. She touches on Aluminum but doesn't mention that vaccines are made in the tissues of other animals like Monkey Kidney tissue. She doesn't explore the problem of this DNA and RNA of these animals sitting dormat in the human body until they are ready to reap havock on our immune system."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fair Objective Book","review":"I found this book to be informative because it gave 2 sides to the story. The fact that the it was written by an MD I feel gives additional credibility to the book. If you are looking for alternatives to the traditional \\"medical model\\" of vaccine administration, I feel this is great book to read."},{"rating":"1","title":"There Are Better Books Out There","review":"This book is fine if you need a medical opinion but it does not go far enough reporting on the hazards of vaccination. Also, the author advocates selective MMR (individual measles, mumps and rubella shots) but this option does not exist. Therefore, many parents are still left wondering what to do.

I am originally from St.Louis and planning a second trip to London.

The main problem with this film is that it is so dated that it is almost unbearable to watch. It is just one of those movies that just didn't age well with time. If anything, this movie is worth watching ONLY for the historical perspective, being that it is the first Hollywood movie musical and the first talky picture to have won an academy award. Otherwise, the plot leaves very little to be desired, the acting is far too melodramatic even for the standards of the time, and the music is, well, not catchy. The only thing I particularly liked about Broadway Melody is that it is just SO 1920's, a time when women were naturally curvy and naturally beautiful and the fashion was just so cute and adorable. At the end of the day though, this movie is just not worth watching for anything more than just the historical background."},{"rating":"2","title":"Huge!","review":"Absolutely killer collection of hard bop, guaranteed to rock ANY dancefloor.

To do this, however, the scriptwriters had to chop and move important parts of the text. To make it modern, rock music plays behind the machine-gun scenes. To make it sexy, the witches are transformed into nubile schoolgirls with unlimited libidos. To give it gravitas, nearly all the male parts are played with sullen indifference, off-looks, and head nods.Besides all this, there's the problem of understanding Australian English, with its flat A's; and keeping track of which actor is playing which character, or who just gunned down whom.I found it amusing that Cawdor was transformed into a big rock club for druggies, of which Macbeth becomes thane. There's no possibility of nobility in the Cawdor club......hmmm......it's hard to play Shakespearean tragedy with an anti-hero motif."},{"rating":"2","title":"21century Shakespearian","review":"This was good... I never read Macbeth, but it was still awsome. Im basically writing this review to say to the other reviewers, this was not as sexually explicit as it was led to believe. Macbeth had sex with the weird sisters, but you dont see anything that you dont see EVERYWHERE on commercials, billboards...hell walking down the street. For those of you who want to know, (because I know you are out there) NO Sam Worthington was not nude in this movie. There was one scene when we came close, damnit, but no he was all covered up. It was still a good movie, I plan to read the original Macbeth, by the great William Shakespeare. It is dark, guns blazing, blood pouring, violent violent violent... HELLO it is Macbeth. They use the original shakespearian language which I think is wonderful."},{"rating":"2","title":"What you see it what you get... but no subtitles.","review":"It should be obvious from the promotions, reviews, and the cover graphics that this is intended to be a modernized adapatation of Shakespeare's Macbeth. If you liked the Romeo+Juliet movie with L.DeCaprio/Claire Dannes, and the Ethan Hawke/Julia Styles version of Hamlet, well this is the latest installment along those lines. I found the physical action in this Macbeth too distracting to enjoy the artistry of the dialogue. In that respect, Romeo+Juliet did a much better job.Also, be forewarned: there are no English subtitles for the hearing impaired available on this disc."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful twist on Shakespeare","review":"I have to admit that I came upon this particular version of Macbeth quite by accident. I had a dear friend bring it over one night to watch since we both have a love of quirky interpretations of classical works. I was half expecting a lame attempt to jump on the bandwagon, but I was most pleasantly surprised once the video started. Sam Worthington (before Avatar) was dark and brooding, the whole cast was aptly cast and very believable. I loved the Macbeth twist to almost a Mafia type \\"King\\", and this truly made the movie. I think my friend described it best as The Godfather meets Shakespeare, because that is exactly what you get. It's dark, it's violent and it's gripping. The director captures the dark theme of the original play so wonderfully that you hardly realize they are speaking old English. By 15 minutes you'll be so engrossed you won't want the story to end. A wonderful adaptation, and you certainly won't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"I bought this thinking that I could show it to my high school students--maybe a new twist on the text. However, not only was it poorly done, it was completely inappropriate for high school students. It seemed as if every time Lady Macbeth spoke, she needed to do a line of cocaine. In addition, Macbeth receives the witches' prophecies while having an orgy with them. So ridiculous. It was overacted and had tons of gratuitous violence. Yes, Macbeth is a violent play, but did they need to make the murder of Lady MacDuff sexually gratifying to her murderer? It just seemed way too over the top."},{"rating":"2","title":"Appeals to a more youthful audience","review":"I am an English teacher, and I have always found Macbeth a tough sell with high school students. This modern take on the classic is the only film version available that appeals to a younger generation, and it uses the original text fairly effectively (albeit with many cuts). Think of this as the Macbeth equivalent of Baz Luhrmann's Romeo and Juliet, but without Luhrmann's visual sense of humor.Yes, this Macbeth has its drawbacks, namely gratuitous nudity and an inexplicable orgy with Macbeth and the witches (I skip over these parts with my students). Overall, though, this film captures the violence of the play in a more contemporary context and, through visual cues, actually provides plausible motivations for the characters (e.g. Lady Macbeth is a suicidal drug user after the death of a son). Worth a look, but not for purists."},{"rating":"1","title":"not for high school students","review":"As an English teacher, I am always looking for new things to spark my students' interests. I purchased this movie thinking that it could be a new twist on the play to watch after finishing the play. While watching this movie, I was horrified. It was sick, twisted, and poorly done. Is there a particular reason why Macbeth has to receive his predictions from the witches during an orgy? There is just no point. If you are a teacher, this is definitely not a school appropriate video! Just a heads up!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A nice modern view","review":"This version of Macbeth provides a modern take on the Shakespearean tragedy while maintaining a majority of the original script. While I would still prefer the Polanski version, I found that this version works well at introducing newcomers to Shakespeare. With the proper juggling of permission slips and/or editing (a few scenes containing nudity), this modern Macbeth can become a useful tool in a senior English classes."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOT FOR HIGH SCHOOL ENGLISH CLASS","review":"Initially, I thought it did a great job of using modern-day with Shakespearean language.

Well, Stout wrote some other detective novels featuring Tecumseh Fox (3 novels, all okay) and Dol Bonner-- this novel, \\"The Hand in the Glove,\\" is the only full-length Bonner, and it's very good. She also shows up in some of Nero Wolfe's adventures, doing work for the Great Man when Archie Goodwin is too busy or the wrong sex to do the job.The plot is fine and the writing is up to Stout's usual sterling standards, and Inspector Cramer, Wolfe's red-faced nemesis, even shows up late in the book.

Initially, I thought that the jet airplane noise recorded with the birdsong was just an unusual plane flying overhead, but realized with the third loop that it was on the CD itself. You'd think that when Mr. Davis reviewed the ambience soundtrack prior to releasing it, that he would have noted this. It feels sloppy, somehow, as if someone left machines to record in a bird-filled wooded area and then just transferred the recording to CD without checking the quality.

After all, three years is a long time, so they may have improved. Nope. Initially, the player worked fine. The picture seemed somewhat fuzzy, but it played back accurately. However, after I tested two DVDs, the third showed a VERY distorted image. It looked like a camera negative! I shut off the player and tried again - same thing.

In the middle of his set, one of the Ortofon stylus' came completely off. (This has never happened to my 500's\\") I had to give him one of my 500's to use. The sound was bigger whenever he mixed over to my 500. This could have been attributed to many factors. I just know that in the heat of battle the Stanton 500 clobbered the pretty boy. I love how many audiophiles are out there today. Especially considering the fact that none of them even own an amplifier. Your iPod is not Hi-Fi.

This replacement is reasonably priced, but you got what you paid for. For me the major drawback is that to lock the legs into the prop-up position, you have to push them pretty hard into those locking tabs--I have to put them down on their side on the ground and use both hands to push them in.Another thing is that the basket is held together with screws (you have to put them together yourselves with those screws, so some DIY involved). I don't mind the self-assembly part--many products do these days. The issue is that there are no locking washers included--two of the screws already become loose and I have to tighten them again. I am afraid that one of these days they will become loose again and be lost (my wife and kids also use it, and they may not pay attention to these details)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Catastrophe","review":"Buy everything but not this Wilson basket.

However, time has caught up with Judy's voice. She sounds frail and wobbly frequently. If she'd recorded this album 20 years ago with a stronger voice, it might have been a great album. As is, however, it's sometimes difficult to listen to. Her cover of Train's huge hit \\"Drops of Jupiter\\" is particularly painful. And using a synthesizer to fill in for an entire orchestra on Copland's \\"Lincoln Portrait\\" is just wrong. This album is for hardcore Collins' fans only.

The arrangements are superb and that voice delivers as sure as a spring breeze on a warm day. Standouts include the very touching \\"I Can't Cry Hard Enough\\" and a rollicking and folksy \\"Sally Go 'Round the Roses\\".

Was delivered in time but ever since it is having convergence problem. I have tried to fix it through menu but it keeps getting corrupt on it own, anytime it feels like. Amazon does not want to take ownership of this TV, being too big. Apex customer service says contact our service center and service center says they are waiting for an approval! Can anyone imagine that Apex customer service phone is down for past two days? I guess I have to live with this. But now, I can NEVER suggest anyone to buy anything from APEX ever again. Also, read amazon's return policy before buying such items. I made a mistake I did not read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"defective","review":"I hate this unit, or maybe I'm biased because it came defective.

Also, the panel in front of the tv is very hard to close. Push, and it opens, push again and it's supposed to close, but it doesnt, then u realize you have to push harder to close it.

They are destined to go out of business. Sure, delivery was great... the first three months were great... but then, all of a sudden, the color in the picture totally distorts making it impossible to watch. I have been dealing with customer support now for TWO MONTHS!!! This is the honest to God truth! I wouldn't take time to write a review otherwise. I was nice to them for so long, and they just became more and more rude over time. I shouldn't have a problem like this so soon after purchase, but even so, being under manufacture warranty, THIS PROBLEM SHOULD BE CORRECTED BY NOW! I have told their customer service (ha!) that I am going to spread the word all over the Internet that APEX is ripping off consumers and should be put out of business.

Trying to find customer service number, took forever, but finally find it somewhere hidden. Called, took forever, and got one of local authorized repair center to pick up the tv. After 2 weeks of repair, got it back. Ever since, I have little problem here and there, but still exceptable, afterall, I only pay less than $600 for this. I would not buy another Apex tv.

Got it for 588 on a supersale last Nov, the black friday weekend. Got it delivered a few times because the first two sets weren't good. After that fiasco I was pleased with a large cheap tv with a great picture quality. Now a year has gone by and the convergence has suddenly been all messed up. Based upon reviews of these tvs, this will happen on just about all of them after 6 months to a year. If it lasts more than that, you got the needle in the haystack. Get the warranty, you will need it. Expect your tv to break on a moments notice. Honestly, KNOWING that the tv will break, you are probably better off investing in a better unit. Or buy this one cheap, get a warranty and expect to fix it every few months. Your choice."},{"rating":"1","title":"APEX - Low $$$, Big Problems - Convergence Good Luck","review":"Okay, I bit the bullet and saved the $$$ ($627 at Sears but I had a $600 credit voucher from my MC so it cost me $27).

I ordered this set from Amazon back in Auguest of 2003 and have just now gotten Apex to refund my money. During the 7 months that I've owned the TV, it's been in the shop for 6 1/2 months. The repair shop told me that they replaced 'just about every board there is in the set' and just can't get it to work. They also conveyed their frustration in getting APEX parts which can take a month or two to get sometimes.

After the first month we had to call Apex for service, well none of their contracted centers would come to our area. So finally after a couple of weeks of back and forth and hours on hold the the store we purchased from replaced our set with an identical model. Then about 10 months after the new set will turn itself off and back on again - for no apparant reason! We did get a technician out this time, but after replacing the whole circuit board it is worse than before. Now it just turns off, and you have to turn it back on yourself!

This product definitely delivers! They results was more than what I was expecting. Although this products claims that you can apply the polish in the sunlight I would HIGHLY recommend that you do it in the shade because this products dry extremely fast and you will find yourself rubbing extensively to remove it. What I did:1. Wash car (obviously)2. Find a shaded area3. Use a damp clothe to apply a thin coating(helps it to spread)4. Wait for 5 to 7 seconds and thoroughly wipe ofEven after I buffed the area I was polished I continued to buff it another 30 seconds or so to insure that the product absorbs properly to avoid the 2nd day white mist that some people experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love it; it covers scratches well","review":"My white car had many light scratches, as well as stains from parking under a tree, which I couldn't get out with soap and water.

I finally found a way to make my black car shine like new - really. If you clean your car well (I've begun using Green Earth Technologies G Wash) and apply Nu Finish (following the directions on Nu Finish bottle - apply again within 30 days), you car will shine. After two applications of Nu Finish, apply Meguars Gold Class wax, and your car will have an amazing deep shine. I bought a buffer for $20 and swear that this regimen makes my car shine longer than any car wash or even professional detail (I paid for one once - this saves you at least $300 - $400 and I got better results)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will actually last for a year. Stay away from plastic/rubber trim.","review":"This polish has some \\"cleaner\\" properties which will take out light water spots and will dissolve fresh sap, tar, bug etc. Very easy and convenient but because of the cleaner properties I have stayed away from clear coat finishes just as a personal rule. Don't go crazy with the amount you apply, just more work to buff off. Stay away from plastic and rubber trim, pretty sure it says so on the bottle, I have not yet been able to get the white haze off of a Honda Pilot bumper trim but that was my fault. In the right circumstance there is nothing cheaper, easier and more effective. Note: I had a bottle for a couple years and the polish turned to a light tan color rather than pure white and the liquid seemed to separate.

In a matter of days both areas began to develop a milky white look that was impossible to wash off. The rest of the truck was ok where I dint apply the polish. I contacted their headquarters and explained what was happening. They told me they dont recommend this product on black finishes! What??? And what I was seeing was heavy oxidation. They told me I had to use rubbing compound to remove the damage. I ended up taking my truck to a detail shop and $300 bucks to restore the finish. There should be a warning on the bottle for dark finishes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy, Affordable, Durable","review":"Car waxes seem to come with sizzle and hype.

I gave a bottle to my Father years ago and he still uses it. Same with my Husband. Dad and Hubby are car fanatics. You can't go wrong no matter what if you buy this.

I thought it had to be too old school, too antiquated to be a good product in this era of technology. But I was impressed with the results. My stepdad told me it did wonders for his Lexus and Mercedes. I wasn't sure I wanted this touching my car, but he offered to polish and wax my car with Nu Finish, so I agreed. The results are great. My car has a great shine, is repelling rain with ease and I don't think it's looked this good for a long time.So thanks to my stepdad's sweat and effort and thanks to Nu Finish for a lasting shine.(I did use Meguiar's clay before polishing)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product! Wonderful price!","review":"My favorite feature is that you can apply in sunshine, although I try not to but I have a life, you know. Anyway, it protects well, lasts a very long time (I'm not sure about one year - maybe if the car is kept in a garage), and it leaves a great polished look.I suggest using a clay bar, or the likes of one, to fully clean the paint before applying Nu Finish. You don't have to do that but I'm just stubborn like that - if you're gonna spend a lot of time doing something good you might as well go the whole nine yards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't work for me...","review":"I've used this polish on my black Nissan. Honestly, there was no difference between the polished and unpolished side. Most likely it is becuase my car at the time was 4 years old and the paint was not in great shape. A previous poster says that the website for the makers of the polish says to use oxidation remover. Maybe that is why the results were not so great. It is correct that it does say to use oxidation remover on the bottle (the main reason why I rated it so low).On a side not, POLISH and WAX are not the same thing. Those words should not be used interchangably. A lot of reviews mix those words up horribly. Wax is what you do to your car AFTER you polish it. The description of the Nu Finish Polish even says that there is no wax in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard time getting it off!","review":"Applied in garage (in shade) after washing 08 BMW 328i Coupe.

It left a deep wet shine. I was completely sold for the new car. I tried it on my 10 year old car with good paint. It did an equally great job there to!

Over a year ago we adopted a puppy who appears to be a labradoodle. Due to my allergies and asthma we wanted a poodle mix. Well it wasn't long before I realized I was breathing better away from home than at home, so clearly I'm still at least somewhat allergic to this dog. We'd heard of Allerpet but couldn't find it in stores. We tried the Simple Solutions wipes and it's amazing. My pet allergies are fine for a week or two and then they'll gradually start to be problematic but if we wipe her down again, I'm fine. I didn't believe such a miracle wipe really existed until I tried it myself. Try it, I think they're even guaranteed.

The band is really amazing, and anyone who likes Doom or HEAVY Metal should check this out.It is true the band is Christian, but the lyrics reflect their personalities, beliefs, values, ideas, etc., and are not meant to convert anyone. At times the band can be very morbid and depressing, and the easiest way to describe their lyrical philosophy is \\"hope in a world of despair.\\" It actually makes for some compelling songs.My top picks would be \\"Born in a Prison\\", \\"The Misery Shows\\" and \\"Peace of Mind\\". Highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Almost turned it off","review":"Normally I like KS. I just could not get in to this movie however.

Other times you watch expecting something great only to get bla.....I expected more from this but got bla instead....Others may love it, tho.Such is how the movie biz goes..."},{"rating":"1","title":"0 stars if able","review":"This film is a mockery of the aviation field. A very small percentage of the phraseology is correct, even the plot itself is severely flawed. First off, being an air traffic controller, I know first hand that you can't go and work at some facility you haven't worked at for a while, until you get evaluated to make sure you can work safely. Second of all, you can't move from your position(sector if you will) and start working at another while leaving the previous position unmonitored. If you are using this movie to learn about air traffic, then please do not apply for a job. The movies will not teach you about the job. It takes anywhere between 2-4 years to get rated at an ATC center. You can't just come in and take a position. When a movie comes out that is realistic to air traffic, I will put my stamp of approval on it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Happy....","review":"I am completely unhappy with the service and responce, or lack there of, I have received concerning this product.

Ground Control? That wasn't even a part of the movie.

Jack Harris, is called back to duty after 5 years, when an old friend needs help. Can he pull the job off?I found this film to start off ok, then move into slow gear for awhile while giving the viewer an idea about what Jack Harris is thinking and going through. The whole, I want to be doing this, but having the fate of hundreds of people on your shoulders holding you down. Then the film drags you for a climatic, finale."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 star edition of above 5 star record.","review":"For those who haven't heard this record, this is one of the best metal records of all time and also one of the first progressive metal albums(released in 86, years before Dream Theater's 1st). If you like the genre, get it.The CD has been re-mastered and it sounds way better than the original release. The bonus cd has 3 demos and 6 live tracks. You can probably guess the quality of demos but the live tracks are beyond bad. It sounds like your downstair neighbor playing it and you're listening with your ears on the floor. Turning up the volume only makes it worse.The dvd is no better, home video footage with mostly still cam shots. At one point the image gets invisible and worst of all it happens during \\"Prelude to ruin\\", the best song on this album(IMO)So unless you are a die-hard fan of FW and collecting every single stuff of the band, get a regular re-mastered version(I believe there is)."},{"rating":"2","title":"mandatory listening for metal-prog fans","review":"This release proved to be one of the first metal-progressive masterpieces.

The rest of the stories in the book similarly are a mix of the completely mundane and usual and the mythical and extraordinary. Like the Greek myths updated for our time. On one hand the stories are about single mothers, college students, divorcees, troubled teens, hookers, orphans, nannies, office workers, best friends, and hapless husbands. But on the other they are stories of Eos, Artemis, Selene, mermaids, Nereids, Ra, Hades, and Helios.

One company said they had 25 APEX tv's waiting on parts and was not recommending APEX anylonger. It has now been 3 weeks since I originally called and no response.

I have have the best house because it is here and I am enjoying it. I have the best car for the same reason.

This is based on the Gov. ruling that 80% of households must have an HDTV before HDTV becomes the true standard. Also, the standard is not decided on yet. This means anyone who purchases an HDTV now will most likely have to buy an upgrade or a brand new model when the standard is decided on.

I know that I should move them to a place alittle further from the set but hasn't affected picture quality yet due to jamming from other electronics. Picture quality is just as good as the Rica senium and Samsung and all other sets I looked at. HDTV picture is awesome! I was worried about picture quality from a 65 inch set.

Back then it was the heaviest thing I'd ever heard. I swore I'd never hear anything heavier. Of course the next year Celtic Frost came out with Morbid Tales, but that's another story. Anyway The Skull was a complete success. I didn't think they had any shot but they came very close to matching the brilliance of Psalm 9. Crushingly heavy (for the time) with the same feel, but the songs were unique and not copies of Psalm 9.

I think it is really good, great lyrics, riffs, and as well as some humor in it. I would suggest this to any Goldfinger fan or not. The key tracks are: Radio, January, FTN and Going Home. I had this cd for a while now and I still listen to it whenever I can. It says it comes with 2 bonus tracks and that is correct one is them doing just prank calls on people and the other is a really stupid and boring song about Wayne Gretzky."},{"rating":"2","title":"Goldfinger is still one of the best!!","review":"Goldfinger continues to be one of my all time favorite bands! They combine a great mixture of punk, ska, and hard rock in just the right proportions. Also, every song is very distinct, unlike a lot of blink182 songs and such. My only complaint with the cd is that it is too short! The music is still awesome, though. This is probably not their best cd, but any goldfinger fan should have it. Most of the stuff is more melodic than stomping ground, but there is still some harder stuff in 'Open your eyes.' This cd is best compared to 'Hangups'. I still think stomping ground is their best work, followed by their self-titled album. Anyways, I hope this review is helpful! Have a great day!"},{"rating":"2","title":"another great goldfinger cd!","review":"another great goldfinger cd! if you liked self-titled, stomping ground, or hang-ups you'll love this! a little short, but all goldfinger cds are. i'm not complaining, this is worth the money plus more!

The first cd was and still is one of my favorites of all time, HangUps was pretty good too, Stomping Grounds was eh, but Open Your Eyes just plain [not good]. Charle left for \\"musical differences\\"? Excuse the pun, but I guess he opened his eyes and relized what a horrible album they were putting out and left. I don't know how any true Goldfinger fan can listen to this and think its any good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Music is okay, message is too preachy","review":"Goldfinger took a risk and made an album exclusively for vegetarians. It was difficult/impossible for me to enjoy this CD because it was so anti-meat. How can you enjoy a song when it's basically criticizing you? While a lot of them felt like previous poppy, sing-along Goldfinger songs, it made the critical lyrics stick out that much more. Example from the title track: \\"A shot to the head, so you can be fed. Won't you wake up wake up. Whoahhhhh. Open your Eyes.\\" I love the vocals and music on this, but how do you sing along and not feel like a hypocrite? I don't blame them for making the album. More power to anyone who sings about something they feel, but you risk alienating some listeners, especially with the crap in the liner notes. It certainly doesn't help that this album was worse musically than their previous albums. The song \\"Dad\\" is so unbelievably bad. Put it this way, this was the only Goldfinger CD I've traded away."},{"rating":"2","title":"Helllzz yea","review":"i got the cd today...it was spozed to get to me round like april 25th,,!,,^_^,,!,, i got it round april 4th w00t!!!yea... its in great condition :)so .. im happy1) Great CD2) Great condition3) Got it sooner then I thougtw00t!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Goldfinger-Open your eyes","review":"When i first heard this CD was coming out i thought it would be a little more metal, but not at all. It is pop punk, or punk rock. They took the whole vegitarian thing a little too far, but it doesnt effect how good the music is. Its definatly official, goldfinger has no ska left in them, which kinda sucks. The Best songs are spokesman, descision, tell me, radio, and FTN. FTN is a really funny song that cusses about 50 times in a minute. Id say if you like any other goldfinger you'd like this too, even tho its slighty changed. You will also like this if you like Offspring, Green Day, or good charlotte. Overall this is a good, more mature sounding goldfinger CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened?","review":"After picking up their ST cd after hearing my buddies copy a million times I picked up Stomping Ground. Both were totally awsome discs. Then I picked up Hang-Ups after falling in love with Superman while playing Tony Hawk. Then I pick OYE.

The effects are still spectacular and the story is still intensely played out to the viewer.

But this one is different. Rather than using CGI to make things hyper-real, the approach here was to achieve an artistic vision. The \\"look\\" of the film is difficult to describe, and previous attempts to do so fail to explain how it perfectly suits the historical setting. Unlike many recent films, the CGI in 300 doesn't give the impression that it was used as an \\"easy way out\\". Far from it, the fabulous environment couldn't have been done any other way.

The Graininess is out of control, the Color Bleed is off the wall, the Black Levels are beyond fixing with ANY HD Plasma, HD LCD, HD Processor, or Blu-Ray Disc Player video settings COMBINED. The video looks worse than an old VHS taped movie. The graininess is soooooooooo bad, the best way to understand it is to do the following - Watch a TV with it set to Over the Air setting without an antenna (simple). I enjoyed watching the TV snow on my 25 year old 20\\" tube TV then watching 300 Blu-Ray on my 65\\" 1080p Plasma and my reference Blu-Ray Disc Player.If you can get past the discusting video quality (which is hard to do), it is a decent movie with nice special effects."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sweet....","review":"wow awesome.... i can rent the movie... ok fine but o wait I use a Mac.

Pretty boys. Almost as pretty girls. Historical farce very loosley based on the delaying action fought at Thermopylae. The almost 70 year old Leonides is portrayed by a 30 something bodybuilder. He gets his wifes permissoin to make her decisions. This is a Hollywierd romance. Nothing more.There is some good gore in the fight choreography. Sadly, even these are poorly done. Great graphics as is expected of american films today. By the way, were rhinoceri and elephants and giants used by the Iranians(Persians) at Thermopylae? And are Iranians Negroes? I ask because they are in this film.If you're looking for a more accurate and yet entertaining account of Thermopylae and the Spartans read \\"Gates of Fire\\" by Steven Pressfield.Avoid this movie or save your money for renting it."},{"rating":"1","title":"2nd Crappiest movie of all times.","review":"Great service and shipping by amazon...movie couldn't have been worse.

King Leonidas takes 300 of the best warriors to fight the Persians supposedly against the wishes of the Oracle.There is no character arc and little story at all. It's war with lots of visual and sound effects of slicing, dicing, and blood splatter.

I watched both of these movies in the same day. There is also a very good documentary about the 300, which I saw a few months ago (Sorry forget the name of it). While I thought some parts of the 1962 version were dated and cheesy. This version which I had high hopes for was horrible. It was kind of like they took lord of the rings and merged it with a historical story, sorry best way I can describe the look, feel, music and storyline. The results were a very poor movie. The strange radioactive mutant creatures that fought the Spartans were never explained, and very un-historical. Why were they in the movie? Also, king Xerxes looked like he was a Villain from a \\"Mad Max\\" movie rather than a Persian King. And the story line was laughable, stupid and very lame. It looks like Very little research was done on the setting, costumes, period music and much more."},{"rating":"1","title":"ehh","review":"over rated, homo erotic hollywood drivel, I was not impressed. really a fantasy piece that takes a shit from a high place onto history."},{"rating":"1","title":"Legendary battle.

Well, I don't think it was meant to be a documentary. I think the movie was meant to be told as heroic folklore, a legend, or tall tale. Everything was exaggerated on purpose! i.e. Chiseled to perfection warriors who embark on a journey with nothing more than their shields and spears, foes who were giant and never ending and an enemy leader who was quite exocentric to say the least.

If you are looking to learn the Details for a Historical Event, pick up a book. What has happened that EVERY single movie has to be 100 percent historically accurate? What happened to the magic of movies? Don't we immerse ourselves in movies to be entertained? While 300 is by no means a historical account of the epic battle of Persians v Greeks, it is great fun! It is without a doubt the most violent (yet oddly the most beautiful) movie I have ever seen. I settled in and was spellbound by this movie. I loved every gory vibrant scene.

Second of all the movie it self SUCKS big time. Very simple, basic right down dumb story line. You can accurately predict the whole movie along with the ending after the first 10 minutes of it. The movie has absolutely no historical or mythological values what so ever (like The Gladiator or Troy for example).

There is so much CG that the whole thing really does have more the look of a drawing than a photo.The thing the viewer needs to understand that this story is being told by the narrator, Dilios, and that much of it is obviously embellished or exaggerated. Knowing that gives one the perspective to value the story and the visuals for what they are. I have never seen the book.I hoped that the second disc would have more interesting features.

The movie is not complicated to understand. Sparta is being threatened by Persian King Xerces and his army for its land. Leonidis, King of Sparta will not bow to the tyrant king, but cannot declare war and send all of its army into battle(total bull****). Instead he and 300 committed spartan warriors travel to meet the enourmous persian army to stand in its way of taking control of Sparta. Battle scenes are some of the best out there. Although there wasnt CGI in ancient times, it makes for a lot of fun battles. Five out of five hands down."},{"rating":"1","title":"not a combo dvd","review":"i bought this because it was supposed to be a combo dvd, it wasn't!

The video looks grainy most of the time on a 50\\" 1080i plasma. I would think a movie using a lot of computer generated effects should look pretty good in theory. The video transfer seems not on par with most of the other WB blu-rays.

The martial art was not convincing, the fact was horribly far from the truth, the plot was forceful and inapproriate... Ok, tell me how a guy who had just killed several hundred Persians could not hear a horse racing toward him! Duh?The thing that really got people seems to be the over-saturated yellow-cast high contrast color effect of the movie. Trust me, cheap effect! Many, me included, can produce. That's why I compare it to The Last Samurai, its spectacular lighting, and the use of color are unmatched!I knew the movie was based on a fiction, and I'm fine with that. But please dont take it as history. I will laugh my *** off if this movie wins any award... Oh wait, may be (cheap) effect!Btw, for those of you who cant watch the movie, try to turn off your firewall for the movie to load, when it's done you can (should) turn it back on.

Not the cutesy gay the latents who made it project on Xerxes, but the leather bar, fisting is more fun if they don't want it, suck my pects, homophobic gay of locker rooms and, yes, manly men, Sparta, where the social strata was divided into packers and packed. \\"Women for babies, boys for fun.\\" I've had the misfortune to see it twice, trying to enjoy a cigar in a store lounge, and cigar store not withstanding, the most vigorous sucking was on the screen.Watching this movie, I am reminded of the nasty-minded sociologists who wondered about Batman living with a cute boy. And it was no surprise that Frank Miller's Dark Knight was altogether too interested in Robin's tush.Homosexuals come in huge variety, and most of the types are interesting human beings, as Brokeback Mountain and Philadelphia demonstrated. But the hate-filled, self-loathing bone worship of the 300 culture is just ugly. Gun fellators."},{"rating":"2","title":"Movie is great - HD-DVD is smoke and mirrors","review":"Buy this movie for what it is, a great movie.

The movie has an overwhelming surrealness about it, due largely to the green-screen effects of the movie, perhaps; but once you've accepted it, it doesn't get in the way. Gerard Butler and the rest of the cast do a great job. The narrator (also a character in the film) grew on me as time went by. And whatever Gerard Butler does with his jaw and teeth throughout the movie is fascinating. An entertaining diversion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad Blu-Ray Quality","review":"Really liked the movie, but this Blu-Ray is awful.

I could not fall asleep during this huge waste of time. I got this one expecting to be entertained, but I was bored almost to death. It was so bad, and so overdone that is was amusing, not entertaining. The characters were cartoonish, and a waste of creative energy. Anyway, avoid this horrid thing, please. There are many better things to do with your time, like mow the grass, wash your shoes, count the flowers on the wall, or play solitare with a deck of 51. You will be distracted by many of the special effects and brought to the threshold of a migrane. It simply fails to live up to the expectations that have surrounded the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Entertaining, but.........","review":"This is an entertaining movie to a point. Yes, it's based on fact, but I'm not knowledgeable enough to say just how much. I was expecting to see a regular historical movie but was very disappointed in the fact that it had \\"supernatural\\" occurances and creatures. Also, I'm not deaf in the least, but I and my husband had a lot of trouble understanding some of the dialog. Would I recommend this movie...no."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth the Hype","review":"After some amazing trailers and about a years worth of hype I finally witnessed 300 this morning. It was about what I expected. Great action, gore, music, and a just total blast. Gerard Butler sheds The Phantom of the Opera mask and unleashes a powerhouse performance. Sure it didn't show that much range, but he made me believe he could beat the snot out of Maximus any day of the week. The film is visually beautiful to look at and should earn some Oscar nominations next year in the technical department. If you liked Gladiator and Sin City, you will love this movie, for it is roughly a combination of the two. I have just read it made 28 million dollars on friday alone. What a start for a hopefully long run at the box office."},{"rating":"1","title":"For the few, the loud who do not go beyond the realm of Cliff Notes","review":"Having seen the 1962 film,\\"300 Spartans\\",and though a comic book admirer, this newer, graphic comic-take on the last stand satisfies only modestly. Both films share a fictional rendition, though \\"300\\" has a unique visual stamp to its efforts. Adding gratuitous sexcapades for the modern porn-inclined audience was degrading to its dramatic efforts, including the British accents and preposterous \\"M-lords\\" scattered throughout.Yet the most inventive use of slo-motion in action film to date allowed the viewer to savor the synchronized movements of the brave lads as a unit or separately to absorb the weaponry tailored for the daring close combat.The acting was superior to the daytime soap screenplay;and despite the autodesk re-created Pompeiian town in detail, the film never makes an attempt to wrap the action in historicity. The History channel's \\"Last Stand of the 300\\" is the real take on this incident."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS IS....","review":"an awesome action movie with outstanding movie effects. If you just want a movie with the good guy and bad guy going at it for 2+ hours then this is a movie for you. Insane amount of action and a nice lil twist in the plot near the end of the movie just leaves you going, \\"Wow!\\" Probably not a movie for the too serious. Its not a complicated movie to follow, and its a nice kick back movie that doesn't involve you having to piece together tidbits here and there to make sure your understanding it right. Like I mentioned before, just a nice solid action movie, can't really go wrong with it if you enjoy a bit of arse kicking."},{"rating":"2","title":"The one-disk version is enough","review":"Fantastic \\"blue background\\" cinema-- taking real actors and making them inhabit \\"bodies to die for\\".

The product was of very good quality and I enjoyed watching it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overkill...literally","review":"I admit, I really didn't care for this movie. It's based on a \\"graphic novel\\", which I know can be a legitimate literary form (\\"Road to Perdition\\" was excellent), but this is more like a comic book for grown-ups; all posturing, stiff dialogue (\\"We are SPARTANS!\\" Yeah, okay, I get it), cartoony gore, and a seemingly endless running time.I guess the director was aiming for something on a mythic scale, but it...just...didn't...work for me. Still, I know this movie has its fans. No accounting for taste, I guess.Rated R for gore, not nearly enough nude women to be interesting, and generally over-the-top everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"A \\"show off what my blu-ray can do\\" movie","review":"I have to think that people who moan and groan and give movies one star because they don't think it looks good on blu-ray are using substandard equipment.

By no fault of the movie itself though. Wicked movie. Snyder is great, and I'm looking forward to Watchmen. But this disc... I had terrible strobing / white dots popping in the image. This was in the background / areas of high grain / and areas with subtle gradients. This is a problem some people seem to have and not have. I guess I got unlucky with this disc. I have seen this image distortion on the Planet Earth BRD, but only for a few shots. For 300, this was happening throughout the whole film, making it almost unbearable to watch. I'm assuming it's a manufacturing issue. A damn shame too, considering the work that goes into a movie like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Movie","review":"300 is a spectacular motion picture, especially on Blu-ray.

Fantastic movie all around. I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cool movie and format","review":"Since here in Mexico HD format is difficult and expensive to get i decided to get this movie from amazon.Though not an outstanding film, 300 delivers a visual feast of coolness and beauty. Some may argue that everything is CG, so what! Nowadays i'd consider CGI a form of new art. This is the kind of movie to have and see in HD. The extras are okay, they give you a broader picture of the production and a little bit of facts and legend about the spartans, pretty cool! There's also a strategy game where you play the role of Leonidas. Just a couple of drawbacks (no big deal, though), first there's a \\"behind the scenes\\" section, but it is in 6X motion! bad idea... you can't see a thing and it has an annoying background song; second, the double format, i don't like double sided cd's since you have to be two times more careful with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another misrepresentation of history?","review":"I really thought I would like this but sadly did not.If it was not a film about something that suppose to of happened it might of been better,say a film of fantasy?No it was still flat.No character development,I did not have any feeling toward anyone in the film.Truth turned into myth,yes.I have to disagree with another reviewer,in that I liked Braveheart a lot better.At least it brought out my emotions more.This would make a good video game,that is about it.Maybe I just wasn\\"t in the right mood at the time?Heck-I liked King Arthur with Clive Owen better than this.This is only my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"i want my 20 dollars back!","review":"wow this was with out a doubt the single most boring film of the year.bad story, bad fights (too much Cgi blood), predictable ending. they should have cut about 30 minutes of the movie cuz it just drags on and on.if you dont have a brain and you like movies that will make you fall asleep check out this one"},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy the History Channel DVD","review":"If you like history this ain't it.

This is one of the most visually amazing movies I have ever seen. Where else do a group of Spartan soldiers hide behind a massive wall of bodies, simply to send it tumbling onto their enemy as they approach. It is a bold action film with minimal plot, but outstanding visual effects and action sequences that keep you gripped to the very end. The determination of the Spartans is a little unsettling as they face unbelievable perils while chuckling, but surprisingly, this adds to (if not drives) the enjoyment of the film.This is a must see for everyone who loves action and wants to know where the future of action movies is headed. Two words: green screen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disengage brain and enjoy!","review":"I was pre-warned that as long as I didn't expect a clever plot or storyline that I would enjoy this gorefest. That being said my expectation was lowered (always a good thing) and 'lo and behold I loved every second of this wonderful movie. Similarly styled to Sin City (and in my opinion Sin City had more style than content) but full of fantastic action scenes that make it worth every cent. There is a storyline and its engaging enough.As my title suggests, disengage your brain and I dare you not to enjoy this flick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor SD DVD Transfer","review":"What really lets this film down for me is the poor quality of the film transfer onto DVD. The movie is shot in a very gloomy sepia style atmosphere. It doesn't look very good on my HDTV, even using a superb SD upscaler. I didn't like the immersion at all - it just looked like junk film work that is better for art festivals. This is an art experiment, not a movie and it doesn't break any new ground.

However that makes it far from being a poor cinematic piece. The Spartans have been fabled as some of the best strategic and well trained soldiers in all of Greek history.To bottom-line it, this really brings you into their way of life. They live to die essentially, you will see how brutal Spartans are and how even against enormous odds their life-training is really what helps them fight against a massive force of Persians.Anyways should you get this movie?- If you like to watch dramatized historic events captured on screen. Then Yes.- If you don't like mild to moderate gore. Then no.- If you're expecting something that will just blow you away with superb acting, deep characters and a thick and juicy plot. Look else-where.In short, this is a very energetic revival of the fabled Spartans with a lot of help from 21st century technology."},{"rating":"2","title":"300 Praises","review":"I'm sure I could come up with 300 great reasons to own this classic. This movie was one I was skeptical about when I saw the previews. I thought it could be a huge hit or be unwatchable. It was the former. A great adaptation of a comic story based on one of the world's most historic events. You will not be disappointed or be able to take your eyes off the screen. It has hypnotic sights and sounds including a fantastic score. Buy this movie and add it to your DVD library right now. In a year where I couldn't wait for Spidey 3, Transformers, and Pirates 3, it was 300 that soared to the top of my list as best movie of the year. An instant classic."},{"rating":"2","title":"300 Stars","review":"One of the best action film adaptations ever. Certainly of the 21st Century. Excellent casting, plot, cinematography, CGI etc. I highly recommend taking a look at the special features to see what these guys went through to train for the film. I was convinced that their muscles where digitally enhanced or supplemented by a suit of some sort. Not the case... they are actually ripped and did their own stunts/fighting. My wife (who normally isn't interested in any kind of gory action flick) was genuinely entertained. Even if the history is exaggerated (that history being hundreds of years of oral history before being captured in print), what an inspiring story."},{"rating":"2","title":"300 gorgeous topless men in hi-def, nuff said!","review":"I love Zack Snyder's surreal special effects on all his movies. The movie is very entertaining, the soundtrack by Tyler Bates goes great with every scene, and Gerard Butler is great, but this is where I fell in love with Michael Fassbender. Many of the graphic novel elements are kept, as well as some historical facts. Not much is known about the spartans, and this is not an historically correct movie either, but some facts are kept, some are changed, either way, I really enjoyed this movie, and now I can enjoy it in amazingly high-definition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Visually stunning and good action, but not for everyone","review":"This is not, and was never meant to be, a historically accurate version of the 300 Spartans. While it is based on an actual event, it is an adaptation of a graphic novel version of the story. If you are looking for accuracy or a documentary this is not it. If you are looking for an action movie with great visuals, good fight sequences, and good (but certainly not great) acting, you will probably find this to be entertaining. Personally I think the best performances in the movie come from Dominic West and Lena Headey. If you are looking for movie that is an accurate representation of the Battle of Thermopylae pass this by, but if you are looking for a good action movie that looks and sounds great on Blu Ray, then this will be a good addition to your collection."},{"rating":"2","title":"Neat movie","review":"I really liked this movie when it came out.

I was dragged to see it in the theatre and emerged feeling as though I had been beaten about the head and shoulders with a heavy stick.

The distortions will remain in the minds of those who are unwilling to read accounts of the Greek-Persian Wars. As the youth view the \\"heroic\\" battle, they would be unaware that the actions of Xerxes was very similar to President Bush in Iraq. The Greeks had acted as terrorists and even burnt a Persian city. The Persians were reacting in defense of their own homeland. But, fact is not what the young audiences of today want.

This movie is for maybe 12 year olds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thanks to those of you who don't fall for the hype","review":"Thanks for this heads-up. I don't hold out much hope for these Hollywood fake historical dramas. They are just pumped up good guy-bad guy Axis-of-Evil propaganda imposed on ancient history, which is completely ridiculous. The last decent Greek epic Hollywood ever made was \\"Clash of the Titans\\" back around 1980. I just stopped paying attention to all the hype."},{"rating":"1","title":"Should have left well enough alone....","review":"When I first saw a Promo for this movie in the theatre 6 months ago I couldn't wait for it come out. Being familiar with the true story of the actual battle I hoped it would be realistic and gritty and stick to the facts, leave well enough alone, instead it's glitzy, overblown and exaggerated in every direction. The real story would make a tremedous movie, done in a \\"Saving Private Ryan\\" type of realism or \\"Gladiator\\" treatment. The 300 however is done more in \\"comic book\\" fashion. More \\"professional wrestling\\" goofiness than Ali/Frazier realism. As much as I love the story, this treatment of it makes it look silly and cotton candy like and I won't be buying it when it comes out."},{"rating":"2","title":"300 on BD is simply amazing!","review":"I could not wait to get this BD to my home! After weeks of waiting till release day, it has finally arrived! Picture and sound are extraordinary and is something that every blu-ray enthusiast, heck even PS3 owners that don't watch movies on BD should own.

The main character - Leonidas - is the same throughout. Whereas, Maximus in Gladiator, for example, goes through changes, Leonidas does not. There's fighting, there's more fighting, and still more fighting. Which doesn't give the viewer any opportunity for emotional involvement. Or watching the character develop as the story progresses. The characters are flat and one-dimensional and that is my biggest complaint. But the visuals will blow you away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Movie! Pathetic BRD","review":"The movie was amazing. Unfortunately the Blu-Ray was NOT. My DVD version of 300 looks 10 times better than this garbage which is no exaggeration. The moment I received it in the mail I popped it into my not yet one month old blu-ray replacement player and was overly disappointed. If it weren't for the fact that I'd have to pay return shipping I'd send it back and tell them to give it to their dog as a chew-toy. It just isn't worth purchasing so go ahead and get the regular DVD which has the better picture. I've noticed that the BR of 300 was incorporated with the grainy/nastiness and if this is the case it was an epic fail. Other than the quality of the disk the movie itself was awesome but then again Gerard Butler is a spectacular actor and I've loved nearly all of his movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"300 Movie","review":"Having read the book that the movie was based on I was very disappointed with the screen version. All the \\"special effects\\" tended to distract from the actual story which in my opinion is one of the greatest stories of a small group overcoming insurmountable odds in the history of this planet. The film turned it into a bloodfest of epic proportions - which it certainly was - but it was also a triumph of a small group who held a pass long enough for the main army to get settled and eventually kick some Persian butt. So if you have read the book do not have high expectations of the movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Special Edition\\" is theft...","review":"...of your money!Warner Bros should be ashamed of putting out such a bare bones \\"special edition\\" and spreading it out over 2 discs (they easily could have fit these tiny \\"making of\\" episodes onto one disc.The commentary track is full of silence and the \\"making of\\" and \\"webisodes\\" are a few minutes a piece and do not go in depth nor do they go deep into the technical aspects of how they made 300.

More like Alexander. Bad acting, lots and lots of shouting dialogue over nothing, the voices of some of the actors were modified and sounded like they were being done by Frank Oz, a boy being stalked by a cartoon wolf, Xerxes looking (and sounding) like a drag queen, heavy metal music added to the soundtrack to keep up the drama level in the interest of post pubescent males, lots of bloodshed but never any blood splattering and staying on the actors since it was digital blood,. Cinematography? What cinematography? The entire movie was shot against a green screen. You could have dropped a dance club background in and the movie would have looked like West Hollywood on Halloween."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"Great prices and received fast.

I had read the graphic novel, and it was amusing I suppose, Not a big fan of Miller or the movies based on his works.300 really made my evening, seriously, I havent laughed that hard at a movie in years, well laughed that hard at a movie that isnt supposed to be funny. I get that its not supposed to be \\"realistic\\" in either looks or acting or backround but it quite campy and super simplistic and seriously over the top. Xerxes, oh how i wish i could just put him in my closet and open it up and make him talk to me, maybe sing a showtune or two!!!I love Gerard, but he doesnt make the best choices when it comes to roles. I will forgive him for this one, perhaps he just needed to get into shape."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shallow story, amazing action","review":"\\"300\\" will not go down in history as a movie with a great plot. In many ways, it was just another \\"cut up lots of people with swords, stick many of them with spears, and have the heroes die screaming\\" type movie.EXCEPT...- the casting and costumes were great.- the fight scenes, and cinematic style (normal speed, slow speed, normal speed, slow speed, et cetera) were bloody but phenomenal.- the computer generated blood splatterings oozed the horror of close combat sword fighting.- the beginning really explained why the Spartans were in such excellent physical shape.I didn't like the fake wolf with the glowing eyes, and the oracle attendants with their leprosy were too fake. Spartans just wouldn't put up with that crap!Rated R for slight nudity and gore galore.

Engaged in homosexual relationships with one another. The thought being, if the man fighting next to you was not only your friend - but your lover as well, you'd be more likely to fight along him.

It was like going back to a restaurant with a big reputation because the first dinner you had there *couldn't* be that bad... but it was. And this movie blows gas...I gave up about half-way through. The director and his crew must have combed every available history book for any and all quotes to insert as dialogue. What a stinker of a movie. It reminds me of the old serial TV westerns, with their focus on action, (remember the countless 10-minute bar fights in those old westerns?--this is more of that same, except with swords and macho one-liners spaced between the fights).

Take Sin City for example, Robert Rodriguez took the source material and made it exactly look like the graphic novel, and along with that he gave us interesting characters with awesome action to go along with it (without slow-motion). the only reason I gave it a one star is because I am saddened of the lack potential the movie could have had, but it was ruined by a lack character development and the overabundance of slow motion"},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Terrible","review":"It may do well by the graphic novel it is based on, but for anything else---well it is simply terrible.

It is pure trash for the mind and the soul as well as an insult to everyone that lived during that historic battle. Those were real human beings who deserve to be represented with some degree of fidelity. 300 is an advanced \\"Triumph of the Will\\" with special effects to dazzle the audience into a frenzy of hatred. I think that if any ethnic group in the United States were misrepresented as the Persians are in this movie it would be grounds for defamation if not labeled a hate crime.

I didn't care for the artifical CG sky, and some of the monstrosities were so repulsive that I couldn't stand looking at them.

I've come to expect some historical inaccuracies in movies, which is fine as long as they are not too eggregious and the story is good, but this movie had them in spades. The movie \\"Gladiator\\" was flawed but was vastly superior and far more enjoyable than this flick. I was pleased that they got the Spartan training right, yet what was up with this film? Am I watching the re-telling of a true historical event or a cheap knock-off of the \\"Lord of the Rings\\" trilogy? Every bad character was depicted as some kind of demon and there were monsters in this. Say what?!? The real story of the Battle of Thermopylae is one of the greatest from the ancient world, with real characters that still inspire people to this day.

Even if you don't like the plot, you'll enjoy the slick effects (CG done right for a change) and wicked action. It's gory, so send the kids to bed early. If you own a Blu-ray player, this is why you bought it.In response to previous reviews, I saw no flickering or other problems. I thought the image and sound quality were excellent. The only complaint I can really give about the overall product is the bare-bones feel of the case. I'm used to getting a nicely polished package (double-printed label with an image on the inside of the case) and some sort of insert/chapter list. None of that on this one. It feels thrown together. It's nit-picky, but I appreciate the little things like that. The Blu-Ray disc itself is excellent. The bonus features are fine."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining!","review":"Filmed in similar fashion to Sin City but in my view this is a far far better film.

It feels like a giant comic book, which, I guess, was what it was supposed to be. Visual and shallow.The film starts out interesting enough with the rough warrior childhood details, then veers into some silliness with religious elders (who, in accordance with traditional Hollywood perception of religion, are all corrupt perverts), then gets into non-stop battle footage, with occasional lapses back to a disinteresting sub-plot in Sparta.The battle footage looks like non-stop video game cutscenes (and even the 300 video game, advertised at the beginning of the dvd, looked like scenes taken from the film.)The spartan warriors seem more like WWE stars that ancient warlords (are they wearing tights and a cape?)Just silly.

The 2nd dvd is loaded with extras. We both enjoyed the movie in the theatre so I know he would love it. Amazon was great. If you have seen this movie, it's worth getting it to add to any home collection. If you haven't seen it yet, it is a really great gladiator style movie that men will love. The price was fantastic. The only thing I do recommend is if you are ordering before Christmas, make sure you do so well in advance, because they ship USPS and they are much slower than UPS or FedEx. I ordered on 12/10 and estimated arrival date was supposed to be the 12/14, and I didn't get it till the package till 12/22.

A thrilling story of a heroic band of warriors taking on invaders to their homeland. That's all there is to it.

In fact 300 freely borrows its soundtrack, dramatic presence and iconic imagery from that film. Gladiator is recent enough in moviegoers minds that the blatant ripoffs are truly lazy and cheesy. The other flaw is a cringe worthy script that in light of current headlines are so simplistic and aggrandizing as to make one wonder if comic books are all the filmakers read(apart from Gladiator that is)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whats with the quality???","review":"Ive just received this blu ray disc.

They keep saying that \\"300\\" is historically inaccurate, and that it's either for or against homosexuality (due to the excessive violence, the physical appearance of the Spartans, and Xerxes in particular). Oh, come on, people! This is a MOVIE!!! It's not supposed to be 100% accurate. And it isn't trying to spread racist, homoerotic, or homophobic messages. What it's really trying to do is re-enact the battle between the Spartans and the Persians, through Frank Miller's stunning vision. It's all about the action and the fantastic visuals, so it's basically a visual feast. Sure, it might look like that it parallels many events in the present (like the War in Iraq, or California's Proposition 8), but that's not what it's about.

They are available from Amazon and are much better. Spartans were very proud fighters and were extremely proud of their armor. They didn't fight half naked without their breastplates. Zerkes didn't have a bunch of pearls and such hanging off his face and didn't go around half naked either. The Greeks and Persians were proud people.

To organize my discussion, I suggest that we take one step back in the causal chain and embark on a new path towards change. What I mean to say is that I have a tendency to report the more sensational things that 300 is up to, the more shocking things, things like how it wants to call evil good and good evil. And I realize the difficulty that the average person has in coming to grips with that, but while it insists that we have no reason to be fearful about the criminally violent trends in our society today and over the past ten to fifteen years, reality dictates otherwise. Actually, if you want a real dose of reality, look at how as far as being namby-pamby is concerned, none of 300's devotees holds a candle to it. Do I blame society for this?

So much grain is on screen that it is completely distracting. I am pretty disappointed because after about 20 minutes I lost interest and no longer cared to watch it.

I'm a big fan of the HBO series Rome, and i have studied the history as well. What this movie brings to light is the sad loss of virtue, integrity, trust and doing something, a cause, that would leave you to the ultimate cost - one's life. And to do so for something higher than one's self and for the belief in your country, family and friendship. This movie with the deep thoughts of the war on terror we face today.

I didn't care about any grainy scenes on this blu-ray disc since I didn't like the movie anyway. Save your money. Rent or borrow it."},{"rating":"1","title":"bad disk","review":"Loved the movie, problem is that my new sony 550 BD system, 1 out 10 wont read the this Blue-ray dvd.

When the king of Sparta wishes to defend his land, and his people against overwhelming odds of the incoming Persian army. He is avised that he cannot send the Spartan Army, so he \\"Goes for a stroll, with 300 bodyguards.\\" In order to defend all that is at their core, to the death if that is what it takes. Breathtakingly stunning visual effects, and some cool as hell battle sequences that are on par with special effects like the matrix. Extraordinary! On this edition, the only special feature is commentary if that is your thing, if you want more, seek out another version, like the 2 disc sp edition. Otherwise this is one fantastic movie, that goes on my list as a best, favorite!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For What it's Worth...","review":"I'm sure this will be lost in the sea of other positive reviews for \\"300\\" (which I'm not complaining about) but I'll throw in my two sorry cents.Thus far in 2007 I've been to the theater 5 times. \\"Spiderman 3\\", \\"Pirates 3\\", \\"Shrek 3\\", \\"Die Hard 4\\", and \\"300\\".This movie was the only experience that actually astonished and excited me. And don't be mistaken...I'm a fanboy among fanboys...and I'm sure I'll love all of the aforementioned films on DVD.But as a theatrical experience that harkened back to my childhood---staring up at the screen with speechless incredulity at what passes before my eyes...\\"300\\" was everything and more.BUY THIS MOVIE!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Movie Terrible Transfer Quality","review":"First this is a pretty good movie, especially if you like action movies with a fare amount of gore. My low review of this film comes not from the quality of the movie but rather from the poor quality of the encoding and transfer to Blu-ray. This is NOT how blue ray is supposed to look. The clarity is very poor and barely above DVD quality. Unfortunately many Blue-ray and HD-DVD movies are like this and I am getting very tired of paying $10-20 bucks more for a movie that is only marginally better visually.

The violence here is unlike any other movie I've seen. It's not incredibly disturbing, just gory and unneccessary. Having a ton of scenes in slow motion does not make a movie epic. The story is OK but not unlike many other movies about the same time period. The actors are good. I don't buy the hype though."},{"rating":"1","title":"300 blu ray","review":"The film is good at reflecting what is basically a comic book version of a war supposedly fought a long time ago between the Greeks and the Persians. The story is based on a deranged comic book writer who views history from an us versus them point of view and somehow decides that Greek culture is western culture.Anyway coming back to the movie, the whole movie is made up in the studio and shows it with the graphics very unreal and the images blurry and dull. The movie is very gory and is just an exercise in sword and spear piercing of the human flesh.It is basically a comic book made into a film and should appeal to those who view death and destruction as a past-time to be enjoyed.The quality of the film as a blu ray movie is not fantastic nor is the sound track."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enough with the historical inaccuracy comments","review":"300 is visually stunning if not completely factually accurate. I think it's unfair to judge movies that are supposed to be solely for entertainment value on the basis of their historical accuracy. 300 isn't claiming to be like Braveheart or Gladiator and instead is based on a graphic novel which is based on historical fact. I think it's too easy to find fault with movies that should be enjoyed solely for their ability to captivate and entertain just because you want to quote history books. If that's the case you won't like this film. But if you want to see some fast-paced action with an incredible story behind it that will keep you interested and entertained from start to finish, 300 will work for you.Also, I should mention that I think this movie might just be the perfect date film. Men will be entertained by the story of guts, glory, and honor, and women will be entertained by the man candy around every turn. It's the best of both worlds."},{"rating":"1","title":"Xerxes Persia - Question about movie","review":"Quilmiense's comment belowrefers to Xerxes' Persiaas Islamic... this is nottrue...

Surrounded by 300 Spartans, who have been trained from an early age to fight, he heads out to stop the enemy, and uphold tradition. Encountering several other groups who are willing to fight (with not the same skills, but a lot of heart), King Leonidas faces characters that have different agendas and beliefs. There are greedy men, lots of deception, bloody battles, the refusal to surrender, betrayal (by those he trusts, loves and respects), and a \\"gigantic\\" bad guy in a cool costume. As the fate of Leonidas and his 300 Spartians is decided, you will be entertained by the plot, cool costumes and great special effects, which all lead to a decent and entertaining movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"This rating system is a joke","review":"This rating system is so stupid. Half of the people are rating this movie a 1 just because they are HD-DVD fanboys and are mad because HD-DVD is on its last leg and on its way out.

Disappointed on both counts. Blu-ray technology is not much ahead of regular dvd if at all. The movie itself was not impressive. Gladiator + Lord of the Rings + God of War. That's a formula which should've been cool but managed to be nothing special. Why do some people think this is brilliant? I never got excited though I really hoped I would. A summary of this movie would be: clouds and sunlight, abs of steel, slow motion stabbing and blood, some CGI critters. If you can get more out of it than that, you must be a genius. 300 isn't nearly as creative as some people imagine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazon's false advertising","review":"I wasted 10 minutes trying to find the HD Tivo-ready Unbox verson of this movie.Amazon is currently advertising this movie on the front of it's web site.

Couching dialog in hip modern terms that a younger audience can quickly understand and relate to is not HISTORY, it is HISTORY-LIKE.The armor is an invention of Hollywood prop suppliers and not authentic. The depiction of battles deteriorates into bedlam and street fighting techniques.Various characters were given dialog and action not consistent with historical facts.I watched it once and relegated it to the dumpster, where it belongs with all of the other modern Hollywood political propaganda."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Hate Affair","review":"Quick movie synopsis: A bunch of angry, alpha male, insecure and inadequate white boys who weren't hugged enough by their mothers hating life and eachother, spreading their germ of hate across the world for some quick power and ego boosting.

Yes, this movie is not for the weak stomach,sqeamish,or narrow minded. I've enjoyed the movie's special effects and fight scenes. No movie is like this movie so that makes it a good release for movie lovers to see something different, soo gritty and barbaric at the same time. This movie has alot of macho to satisfy a helpless man in need of a ego. There's chaotic battles and some violent images you will find guilty entertaining. So, be brave as the SPARTA'S and see 300 with a open mind, then you either can become one of the two viewers which is those who \\"get it\\" or those who don't. Take this film unique style for what it's worth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bluray300","review":"Okay, this is a review on the Bluray version of the movie. The film itself was spectacular, that's why I got it in what was supposed to be the best presentation. I am severally disappointed with WB for this pathetic excuse for an HD presentation of 300. A film which is supposed to be visually stunning and made after HD technology and yet producing garbage that is ultra grainy and flickers in 1080p resolution!? I have played B movies in Bluray that have a better presentation than this sinkhole of cash. WB needs to issue a public apology for this and replace any of these literally broken Blurays.

The lore and story behind the battle of Thermopolae is already amazing enough... But the movie makers really capture and accentuate everything visually. On Blu-Ray, this movie is really a treat for the eyesYou first have to realize this movie is being told to the viewer by one of the 300 soldiers. It's his take on a historic event. Of course not everything that happened in the movie happened in real life. But you have to realize this is a tale people have been telling for centuries and centuries. There are obvious embellishments (which are obvious to the viewer, such as the elephants, the rhino, etc) but I think these are true to what a storyteller in that period would tell his audience to captivate them.The audio commentary is great, the extras are great, and the movie itself is wonderful.

It places numbers into perspective, showing 300 elite trained spartans \\"best of the best\\" battling with thousands and thousands of persians.

The finish is good and the looks are decent. The clock synchronized with the atomic clock easily. Runs on one battery and that is in some sense good since power outages do not reflect time. During the past few days the power has been out for few moments due to windy conditions and sometimes because of the heavy load (when it is too cold). The only thing that prevented me from giving it a 5 stars is the depth of the clock which is about 5.5 inches and seems kind of big when using it on a table/desk. Given that the mechanism is not more than 1.5 inches deep there is a lot of space at the back. The cover comes of easily and so one could store something there but I am not sure if that was the intention. Overall a nice looking clock."},{"rating":"1","title":"Price seem to good to be true?

The picture goes in and out on a weekly basis.My wife got in touch with customer service on the first call (amazing, considering what the other reviews said).

But do come back when your done a non-annotated version (or even audio); travel down the river again with the annotations by your side, here as lengthy as the book over again, a whole new magical worlds awaits in the margins; you will discover the hidden depths and meanings of one of the most important literary works about America ever written.

I thought it was one of those types of book that goes through one ear, and out the other. It was the type of that went into too much detail. The only chapters that I liked were the ones with Lucy Washborne in it. The chapters were drawn out, and I would not reconmend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for peolpe who love civil war novels","review":"Rifles for watie is about a young man who is living in thecivil war era. The best thing about this book is it gives us a lookinto both sides of the war and is very informative about the ideas andfeelings that were going on at the time of the civil war. It is a goodbook for both young and old. I first read it in the seventh grade andas a junior in college I find my self still reading through thechapters when ever I get the chance."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rifles for Watie","review":"I loved the book!!! It's about Jefferson Davis Bussey joining the Union Army and fighting the Civil War. Jeff is a intfantry man,a cavalry man, and a spy. On his spy mission, he falls in love with a pretty rebel girl named Lucy Washborne. He is probably the only soldier to fight the Civil War and understand the South and the North sides."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is the BEST CivilWar book, one of the best books ever","review":"\\"Rifles For Watie\\" surprised me by being much more interesting than I thought it would. I had to read it for school, and my literature teacher usually picks boring books, but \\"Rifles for Watie\\" was great throughout. It tells the story of Jeff Bussey, a Kansas kid, who enlists in the Union army to defeat the enemy Cherokee Indians and their leader Stand Watie. Jeff quickly dislikes the rough life in the army, but learns to appreciate it. Soon, he is sent by his captain to go to the rebel side as a spy and gather information and bring it back to the captain. I don't want to give away too much, but it is an exciting book. Some parts are a little slow, but about 95% of it, I thought, was exciting. Read it, definitely."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great adventure for any child who loves history!","review":"We purchased this for our son who loves historical fiction and it was a wonderful story based on a true story. It was fast paced and very detailed. I would highly recommend this for your personal library as well as for your school library."},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVED IT!!!!!","review":"When Jeff Bussey joins the Union Army in 1861, he isn't thinking to free slaves, he just wants to rid his home of the bushwackers who raid his neighbors and tried to kill his father. Rifles for Watie goes deeper into history than any other book I've read. I never realized that there was more to the Civil War that fighting over slavery. In this book, you get to see what life was like on both sides of the battle grounds, when Jeff fights for both the Union and the Confederacy, as a Union spy. Besides being wonderfully researched, this book also has a great collection of lifelike characters. I would recommend this book to anyone who likes historical fiction, and even those who don't. You will definately get something out of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a really good book","review":"This is a really great book. I love reading about the civil war, and I just finished a book from the perspective of a rebel (With Every Drop Of Blood by James Lincoln Collier and Christopher Collier) and so I wanted one from a Yankee perspective. This book is really great. About Jeff Bussey and his life as a Union Solider, Trooper, then even a member of the Confederate Army! You can never predict what is going to happen next, it really is exciting. I hated to put this book down when I was reading it. Strongly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book rules!!!","review":"Rifles for Watie was a superb book about young Jefferson Davis Bussey of the Union Army and his enemy, the evil Captain Clardy.There were very vivid details and well described characters.I recommend this book to anyone who likes a good story. I also believe it would be a good idea for children under ten reading this book with an adult. This book could be considered slow at some places, but believe me that if you like history, Civil War, or maybe just a good book, you've got the right one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rifles For Watie","review":"Rifles for WatieRifles is written by Harold Keith. Rifles is an good made up story of the life of a solider during the Civil War. It reads fast and will decently fill you up with some CivilWar facts, but not too many. Jeff, our main character,r is a boy of 17 and joins up with the North after bushwhackers attack his home. Kansas, 1861 is the setting for this book and it covers all of the Civil War. Jeff has some trouble with his commanding officer. Good for kids 10 and up. If you want a good adventure story, this is the way to go."},{"rating":"2","title":"Got Rifles","review":"Rifles for Watie is about Jeff Bussey a sixteen year old farm boy from Kansas. This story takes place in the Ozarks region(Kansas, Missouri, Olkahoma, and Arkansas). Jeff's family gets \\"bushwacked\\" by Confederate bushwackers and because of it Jeff joins the Union Army. Jeff thinks war would be fun so he's excited to be in his first battle. But when friends die in the battle Jeff changes his thoughts about war. He finds out that war means destruction and killing. I think Rifles for Watie deserves a five because I think it was well written, took place in a very important American historical event, and it has a wonderful plot. I compare this book to War in the Ozarks. It takes place in the same region as Rifles for Watie, and it has about the same plot. Rifles for Watie was a extremely exciting and excellent book."},{"rating":"2","title":"best nail treatment","review":"Develop 10 is the only nail product I have found to help my paper thin apliting nails grow.

You have people who are using a Vocoder for there talkbox effect. Roger Troutman never used a Vocoder effec when he recorded. The songs are ok but, you have to ask yourself, \\"Did these people really listen to Roger Troutman?\\" Why would WolfPac put an unreleased track that features Roger Troutman on a tribute album that is for him? Makes no sense at all. If he is sampled, that is different but, to put him as an artist with an unreleased track is kind of stupid. Of course, this is in my own personal opinion. WolfPac, no more please! You guys kind of damaged yourselves with this album in so many ways that I hardly play my copy. I'm sorry Roger that they used vocoders instead of the real sound you used through out your career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't listen to Bozo Pedroza","review":"This is a great cd.

She does not seem to grasp even some of the basic concepts of the people's work she denigrates. Maslow's hierarchy of needs is one example. I have spent a great deal pf time studding humanistic psychology and writings. I have had the pleasure of being trained in group therapy with Carl Rogers, and William Coulson as instructors. Any one who really studies these writers will see how bad a job Ms Milton did presenting them. She should have let her anger subside before she wrote the book. Her bias is extreme and obvious. So consider this when reading the book. No doubt Ms Milton will have a new career appearing on the conservative religious programs. I am sure Pat Robinson and Jerry Falwell have or will book her to speak out against the evils of humanistic psychology."},{"rating":"2","title":"Review of Malpsychia","review":"The author captures very well the ambience of the \`50s, \`60s and \`70s.

In fact, there were a couple songs where I expected Ozzy Osbourne to start in with his banshee wailing. To tell the truth, it would have been welcome given that the lead singer of Trouble is easily the weakest link. However, there are long stretches of music in which he does no singing whatsoever. It is during these stretches that this band shines the brightest. They have a few moments where they sound like Doom Metal, but overall this is straight Heavy Metal with a serious case of Black Sabbath worship. I don't mean to sound like I don't enjoy the album because it is good, except for the vocals. All in all, this is a solid Heavy Metal album with some infectious guitar grooves and a worthy cover of Cream's \\"Tales of Brave Ulysses.\\" Later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where oh where is that figure again....?","review":"This book, although covering all the basics, does it in a jumbled way.

I could never get this song out of my mind and when I began ordering CDs and ebooks from Amazon, I took a chance and ran a search and located the CD and bought it.The CD is great with other songs I've heard Kellie Coffey sing over the radio and this will always be one of my favorite CDs.

It's 99.5% Celine Dion-esque fluff pop and 0.5% country. That 0.5% is once again the appearence of a steel guitar (always used in an uninteresting way on things like this). It seems that anybody who wants to test the commercial waters of \\"country music\\" just tacks on the rudementary steel guitar topping so it can earn the name-yet they never seem to notice that the spirit's not there.

I'm not crazy about every track --- there a few snoozers on here, but overall this is another fun collection of tunes inspired by movie themes from the 60s and 70s. All the tracks on here were recorded during that era, too, the one exception being \\"Down Here on the Ground\\" in which Diane Reeves stuck her vocals in 1996 on a much older Grant Green track. There are also vocals from Nancy Wilson and Marlena Shaw, but the rest of the album consists of instrumentals, some slow and mellow, others upbeat and funky. Frankly, I found the mix of styles on here more annoying than pleasing, but then again it shows the diversity of artists that were recording for Blue Note at the time."},{"rating":"1","title":"a big letdown","review":"I bought the ebook version of this and was disappointed. It is a workbook format which presents a understanding of why plantar fasciitis occurs -the tendons and ligaments are strained because they are doing work meant to be done by muscles. The \\"foot arch muscle\\" gets weak and so the foot arch collapses causing plantar faciitis and other conditons. So you strengthen the \\"foot arch muscle\\". The \\"foot arch muscle\\" is not in the foot but in the calf and you are supposed to keep it tense and \\"walk the right way\\" - toes pointing straight ahead. oh and you can do calf raises - up on your toes and down. that's about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"2 burned out picture tubes!!","review":"Two bad tubes within 25 months.

Hardy starts by constructing the real numbers & then doing all the calculus you'd ever want to know, and with a bunch of math 'trivia' that can't be found anywhere. I can't add much to what the other reviewers have said, except this book has some evil integrals from old Cambridge Tripos exams that would make some Putnam problems look easy. lol At least, if you're only allowed to use real variables (& not complex variables & residues).

I enjoyed this video very much and when and if more Wallander DVDs become available I will be purchasing them. I had seen Wallander mysteries on PBS and found this detective one of the best. I always watch the PBS mysteries. I'm sure that anyone who enjoys British mysteries will also find Wallander most interesting. It is difficult to determine sometimes with British and Wallalnder mysteries who the killers are until the end. A little more difficult than Mrs. Marple!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The dark side of investigating","review":"Already this series is being compared to other BBC productions. So I will also and say the there is a lot in common with Midsomer Murders (1997 TV series) that spends as much time on the family as it does on the investigation. However it is much darker in content, not bloodier but psychologically darker.Kurt Wallander (Kenneth Branagh) must solve seemingly unsolvable crimes. This is today and not a period piece.Right after Branagh it was surprising to see how well David Warner played Kurt's father, Povel (1 episode, 2008).Midsomer Murders - Set One"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unhappy","review":"Thanks AmazonI spent $35 buying this wonderful Wallander DVD, only to find that it is in the US format and cannot be played in Australia.Thanks Heaps"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dreadful","review":"The series is filled with utter depression-ennui is too cheerful a term in this context.

Not at all entertaining."},{"rating":"2","title":"WALLANDAR IS GREAT","review":"I haven't seent the series but have read all the Wallander books and they are the best of Scandanavian mysteries. With Braubaugh playing the brooding Swedish detective, I can hardly wait for this release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sweden is not this depressing","review":"I had high hopes for these three videos, having read the books. The camera work is truly beautiful. But they are way on the depressing side, and Kenneth Branagh, an actor I enjoy and respect, has decided to play Wallander as a kind of caricature, a sleepwalking incompetent whose bad decisions get people killed, or almost killed, in the case of his daughter (whose every line, it seems, begins with \\"Oh Daddy. . .\\"). How do characters like Wallander and House achieve one- or two-day-old beard stubble every day of the week? The way Wallander is played here, you think that perhaps if he got one week's worth of good sleep, his IQ would rise by perhaps 20 points and he could solve his cases much faster. In my opinion, if you haven't read the books you will have a hard time following some parts of the videos, because so many details have been left out. I so wish I could watch the Swedish versions of these."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning, Kenneth Branagh ahead. Ripe ham alert!","review":"Based on the wonderful Henning Mankell stories this series could have been really good. It is NOT awful and certainly watchable. The production values are high and the cast(including Kenny) are fine actors. The problem is watching Ken Branagh be a great artist is just so painful.The Wallander character is a tragic burnt out wreck with all kind of issues dealing with his daughter, ex-wife, father and the bottle. The problem with this tv series vs the books is that too much screen time is spent beating you over the head with Wallander's suffering. The storylines and the mystery itself are secondary to almost endless footage of Wallander suffering and being confused. There is almost no time spent on the actual detecting of the crime or the other characters situation in life. So you have Kenneth Branagh hy-jacking the plot with mega suffering scenes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing, compared to the books","review":"Sorry, I can't agree with most of the sunny reviews, having the read the books ahead of time. I love Mankell's writing for the atmosphere and character development, and distilling the books to an hour of video each simply leads to disappointment - it's like watching a full-length movie on fast-forward. If you liked the books, skip these."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great New PBS/BBC Mystery Series!!!","review":"I have seen this DVD about 30 times! After reading all the Henning Mankell Wallander mysteries, I ordered it from Amazon UK and switched my computer to Region 2. Boy was it worth it. Fantastic actors and crew. The high quality of the production is unmatched. Branagh won several awards for this series already, both for acting and producing. They are set to create three more this summer, again based on the magnificent books by Henning Mankell. There are two DVDs in the box. One has show 1 and 2 on it. The other DVD has Show 3 and then a ton of wonderfully produced specials. These include a fantastic and long chat between Kenneth Branagh and Henning Mankell.

He talks about being a big time pimp but goes to another city and then has to ask another pimp for money because he is broke. That alone proves that he was not the pimp or player he claims to be.So much for cross country pimping.This guy was just a petty thief who tries to come across like he is some mob type of guy. He should take himself to players for being a petty theif impersonationg a player.I would recommend any book written by Tariq Nasheed over this garbage that Darryel A. Woodson claims as knowledge.

The only people I can think of who wouldn't like this album is people who like Janet for her pop music. Personally, I think this is an grammy album. I think it should get album of the year.

I am pleased with Janet's musical taste, it is open and filled with many themes that touch the inner soul of all listeners. I am happy for Janet and Jermaine.

Yeah I know she can be better than just 1x platuim while she ussualy averages 5x or 6 x platuim.. but it's ok we still love you Miss Jackson! Money Well spent.

She has never been a strong vocalist. She is nowhere as horrid as Britney or Jennifer. I don't feel that it is fair to judge Janet by sales. It is impossible to get a completely successful career. You will find this in all kinds of music careers (look at Kelis, and Pink...and just about anyone else.) Its not right to say oh she's getting old...you can be 100 and still feel sexy. Shes being expressive. This disc is really smooth and mellow. I don't think i've seen a mellower Janet ever. Shes as calm as the waves on the beautiful interludes.

Janet has evolved and given us something totally different...again! From the poppy Just A Little While to the down and dirty, bass driven All Nite (Don't Stop), there's something on this album for everyone to enjoy! Damita Jo takes us on a roller coaster ride of different genres and styles which is incredible.I'm not comparing it to 'The Velvet Rope' or any other album as doing so would be pointless because every one of her albums came from a different point in her life and they're all different and masterpieces in their own right.

Perhaps it will grow on me, perhaps Janet will make some bangin' videos to some of the singles, because after all, she is an 'entertainer' (her strentgh) vs. a 'singer' (her weakness)...Truth be told, we expect more from this Jackson. If it was LaToya or Tito we would just shrug our shoulders and just say 'oh well, t'was to be expected', but from Janet, and from a CD this hyped before the release...What has happened to music these days is not the fault of Napster and downloading MP3's.

I am a long-time Janet fan. She is a tremendously talented artist. When I first listened to the Damita Jo CD, I didn't like it, but after a while I really got into the music. My favorite cuts are Like You Don't Love Me, My Baby, Thinkin' Bout My Ex, and Island Life. I was surprised that JJ chose to work with additional producers than Jam & Lewis. I love the Babyface song, Thinkin' Bout My Ex. This is a great CD, but it's unfortunate that the album didn't receive good reviews. I think the record company failed to market the album as they should have after the Super Bowl incident. I'll always be a JJ fan. I hope that she continues to make beautiful music. its a good idea to purchase this album now, because I've heard rumors that a new version will be re-released in Sept 2005 with 6 new songs. Hope you enjoy the CD!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good album","review":"While it isn't one of her best albums, Damito Jo is still a damn good album compared to many of the ones released by other artists.

This is definately her weakest cd. I'm a huge fan and have every single album, but this one isn't even in the same league. I almost think I could be a soundtrack to a ... movie. I still love J, but this cd is awful..."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"I listened to this album the other day. One word: Boring. It's all sex no substance. Miss Jackson If You Nasty no more now it's more \\"I'm Janet so I am nasty\\" and nasty it is.(...)Sex is the only topic, and it's old and tired. Sex was the topic on the last one too and the one before that and even the one before that. With this one it feels like Miss Janet Jackson has made the same album for the 4th time in a row."},{"rating":"2","title":"better than i'd hoped","review":"after the controversy of the superbowl and the poor performance of the initial two singles i was fearing that my favorite diva had slipped irretrievably into a creative slump; however, there is a refreshing honesty on this album that is very endearing. the songs have a variety that keeps them interesting, and it's impressive how complicated some of the musical structures are: multi-layered chords, understated themes, and energetic rhythms combine to create a unique sound environment that doesn't sound like anything else that's out right now. i hope the album fares better once it receives wider distribution. if you liked janet's past work you will enjoy this album; however, it isn't going to win her many new fans."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same ole song","review":"The music is what helps her career because you cant understand the words that are coming out of her mouth. There is nothing new here and the same ole terms should be retired. We know that \\"she cant wait\\", \\"come here boy\\" etc etc. She need to be classy and not what she considers \\"naughty\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth the money","review":"I am a big Janet Jackson fan but I have to say this CD was a disappointment to say the least. I'm glad Janet has let loose of her inner demons and feels free to express her personality. This was done to perfection in Janet and later in the Velvet Rope CD and to a lesser extent All For You.Now it just sounds dull. Who knew sex could be so boring. Her whole sound on this CD is one of whispers and moans. I wish there were lyrics along with the liner notes so at least I could understand what she is saying. And here's a note for future CD's Janet, cut the intros. They've more than worn out there welcome.On the positive side a couple of tracks are some of her best unfortunately, they did not receive the airplay they deserved. Just A Little While and All Nite(Don't Stop) and My Baby is so-so. Download these singles and skip the CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry!","review":"As a big fan of Janet I was looking forward to her new cd especially because i love her song \\"just a little while\\".

However, this was such a disappointment for the dance community. The only song I honestly liked is All Nite (performed on Good Morning American and Ryan Seacrest). Of course, additional programming came from Sweden for this production. Sweden is so far ahead of the US with regards to quality dance beats. Something that I could also do without is all the short intro messages. Janet has BEEN THERE DONE THAT. I'm still a fan but hopeful for better material to come."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damita Jo= go back to the studio!","review":"Janet, such a wonderful exhuberant, vivacious performer, disapoints with a dreadful new album release. With way to many cheesy interludes and unnecessary comments heard randomly throughout the album, the once little cutie has turned into an all decked out sex show. DAMITA JO lacks musical as well as lyrical substance. There is not one song on the album that makes you want to drop what your doing, get up, and dance. Janet Jackson, a superstar celebrity did not impress with this much anticipated album. It is just a flop. NOT RECOMENDED."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is an album worth buying","review":"This album from Janet entitled \\"Damita Jo\\" is a very good CD that is worth buying. The beats on this CD are more funkier than her previous albums. This album is more of a R&B album rather than her \\"All For You\\" album. My Favorite songs are \\"Sexhibition\\", \\"Spending Time With You\\", \\"All Nite (Don't Stop)\\" and \\"I Want You\\". I think Janet went wrong with the song \\"Just For A Little While\\" which is like a Bubble Gum pop song which I do not like, but thankfully its at the end of the album and I can turn it off at track 21 instead of going thru with track 22. But besides that this is one of her best. KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!!","review":"Janet's back with \\"Damita Jo\\"!! This album is HOT HOT HOT!! Almost every track could be a single. Way to Go Janet!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Love her album! Janet still can make you dance!","review":"I love this album! Liked the dramatic Telepopmusik intro. The dance numbers are all solid! \\"All Night\\", the title song, \\"Spending Time With You\\", \\"My Baby\\", and many others are so funky! \\"Just a Little While\\" sounds new-wave-ish to me, but it's okay. I liked the Jam and Lewis songs, but Kanye West, Bag and Arnthor and the others were also solid with their offerings on here! Very good music to drive on the interstates just in time for summer!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Best Is Yet To Come","review":"Excuse the cliche, but \\"you go girl\\". The best is yet to come. This album is definitely representative of her development both lyrically and spiritually. She shows us diffrent sides of herself the most evident being the side of her that is very much in love. Not just with her companion, but also or more so with her music. It has been reavealed that Janet \\"Damita Jo\\" Jackson is and always will be at the top of her and game. And just when we think that she can't do any better, she shows us that the best is still yet to come."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the most funkiest janet albums","review":"the top 5 best songs on this album areI Want YouJust a Little WhileR&B; JunkieStrawberry BounceThinkin Bout My Exit's a musical genius that blends old school r&b;/funk and current r&b;/hip hop and sounds totally current and perfect with the times"},{"rating":"2","title":"Miss Jackson If Your Nasty...","review":"I would rank this album up there behind the Velvet Rope. I really like this album for the most part but there is a repeating habit with Ms. Jackson. Her albums start off fast, with good material and then it starts to drag when it hits the teens. Another thing that I have a problem with is her overt sexuality. I understand that Janet is a very sexual person, she doesn't try to hide it but after a while, it get really tired. Most if not every song has a sexual reference or two or is just basically about sex. I don't need to hear a song that has her moaning every other beat. There are other things in life than sex! If I wanted sex 24/7, I'd buy a porno! I just think if she could tone down all that sex and just sing about life and other things that go on in hers, she'd have more success. But other than that, Damita Jo is a really good album. She just needs to stay on track instead of venturing into some weird song (s) that tend to make up the end of her albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sexational","review":"Janet is back, still sexy and continuing to give her fans exactly what they want, hot music, sexy attitude and great dancing. Love is the theme of this CD and you can hear it in songs like \\"My Baby,\\" \\"Spending Time W/You,\\" and \\"I Want You.\\" Janet also comes correct again w/her sexy trademark ballads, \\"Warmth,\\" and \\"Moist.\\" A must have for every1!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Janet Still Holding It Down","review":"Miss Jackson is still holding it down with her new album.

This is a VERY BAD album, and I realize that a lot of janet fans just can't confess it because they simply like their idol (I just hate people who idolize enterteiners and think it's dramatic when the idolized entertainers have weak voices, bad interpretations and absolutely not creative musical projects), but the songs are horrible. The lyrics for Just a Little While are disgusting, she can't play with sexuality like Madonna in Justify My Love or Erotica ... . The songs sound more bubble-gummy than in her 2 first albums, it's not mature, it doesn't have personality. ...

It's not a good CD and I would prefer to just pretend that she didn't make this. I don't care that the music is primarily about sex--at least make it say something meaningful about sex. Half the time I don't know what she's moaning about or singing about because the loud beats drown her out. That is normally the case, but more so than normal on this thing.

Truth is, Janet hasnt had a good album since \\"The Velvet Rope\\". I dont know what she was doing on here, but I found myself incredibly bored throughout the whole CD. She only had maybe two stand out songs and they were both released as singles. One of them was \\"Just a little while,\\" which is a really good song and shoudl've been a big hit...but it wasn't. Perhaps it was overshadowed by \\"Nipplegate\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"gosh ill rather listen to spice girls","review":"what were you thinkin janet i mean you made 22 songs most of them are about islands i like strawberry bounce but man the rest of the album is trash and im mad because i spended 18 dollars on a cd i don't even like people who read this don't waste your money"},{"rating":"2","title":"Okay, But I know that this could've been better! Not Bad....","review":"Okay, so I've heard about this album. And you know what it's very nice to listen to. But I liked her last album better because of the songs. The Asian Version has 23 tracks in total and I have to say that this album is quite impressive due to it's new content and new style. Songs I liked on this album are, All Nite(Don't Stop), Just A Little While, Slolove, Island life and the album title track Damito Jo cause of it's hip-hop feeling. Overall this album had a happy feeling to it. I like this album cause of that. Most albums nowadays reflect sometimes a little too much on reality. I wanted a change of moods. I recommend anyone to get this album if they are always in a bad mood. But listen to it first. I've read a lot of people just bought it and then they're disappointed and complain."},{"rating":"2","title":"5 STAR CD!","review":"You don't have to be a Janet fan to enjoy this ablum! It is very different and much more urban that any of Janet's previous albums. I think she has been the most consist artist of her generation and Damita Jo is know exception. It is another quality album for Janet. There are songs you can dance to and songs you can just lay back and chill to!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Janet Jackson for a while along with Jam&Lewis seemed to be striving for something.granted she never had that much depth as a Vocalist but she had a vibe that worked but now she just seems content on getting by with Formula driven material as to challenging herself.Her vocals never get going&the Production feels like Microwave food that has been cooked over twice before&Still is icy."},{"rating":"2","title":"OFF THE HOOK","review":"THIS HAS GOT TO BE ONE OF HER BEST!!

Janet lost me on this one. But to be honest, she barely held my interest with VR. I'm not feeling the vibe on this at all. Too much sex(...)in her songs. (..) I only like \\"All Nite\\" cuz I saw her perform it live. Love that she can out dance the best world class trained dancers still! But as for the direction of her music. I guess I must say goodbye. Not worth my hard earned money. Love you Jan as a person an all but geeze hun keep your clothes on for once. (...) Too over EXPOSED musically, lyrically & professionally...."},{"rating":"2","title":"good job janet!!","review":"I'm a huge fan of janet and was hoping she would release something stronger after the weak All For You album, and this time janet really delivered. This album is coated with r&b/hip hop jams, janet is more urban than ever before, in fact, Just a Little While is the only rock sounding song on the album and the rest sounds nothing like it. I like every song on here except for one, some of these songs are the best of janet's career, such as Thinkin Bout My Ex, All Nite(Don't Stop), Island Life, Spending Time With You, Sexhibition. You'd better buy this today if you love good r&b/hip hop music or like janet, you cannot miss out on this album. It may not be like another rhythm nation, janet or velvet rope, but it's still pretty good and I applaud janet for changing her sound again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Janet Is The Best Female Singer Ever!","review":"I love Janet Jackson new album it is not as good as All For You.But is pure R&B music the songs are good and there are some that make you wanna get up and just dance I hope this album does good because over the Super Bowl Half Time Show.Her first single I Want You is so good that I love it!Well I'm going to say good bye and Janet if you read this I love you hold your head up high and proud of yourself and again I LOVE YOU!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Who Changes Who?","review":"There was a time when Janet would be known for changing the game.

This cd is very different from \\"All for you\\". It evokes a much more r&b/chill mood and you really won't find yourself skipping any songs. Every song on this album is great. My favorites are \\"I want you\\", \\"All nite\\", and \\"R&B junkie\\".It's funny how a past reviewer predicted album sales to increase after Janet's Super Bowl \\"publicity stunt\\". I knew the opposite would occur and that she would turn many closed-minded people off. It's a shame that radio isnt giving her singles \\"Just a little while\\" and \\"I want you\\" the airplay they deserve. Everybody seems to be giving this girl a hard time. Get over it!This album is smoooooth and you'll find yourself repeating it over and over again. I highly recommmend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous!","review":"CD is Fabulous.

This is not the Janet that we knew back when. Nothing like what she used to sing and the songs are senseless and no rhythm to them. Control was a great buy and rhythm nation, this is just not Janet.

It's like she is trying to be Britney Spears, almost. This is a great comeback for Janet, but it is less focused and ambitious than any of her other works from 1986 through 1997. Damita Jo has a lot of dance-floor jams. The title-track, \\"Just A Little While\\" is a Rock-pop tune that has an 80's feel in it. I like it alot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Much Better Than The Previous One....","review":"If not because of the controversy that happened before the CD has been released, I think Janet Jackson might have sold more than to her previous record.

Janet rocks on every track.Damita Jo is far the best album of 2004. Beyonce, Ashanti, and Britney need to watch out because the True Queen of all music is back and she is going to show the little girls how a REAL DIVA should do it. I love the production work by Kanye West, Dallas Austin, Jimmy and Terry, and Babyface. The standout tracks are Damita Jo, My Baby feat Kanye West, Warmth, Thinkin Bout My Ex, Like You Don't Love Me, Strawberry Bounce, Island Life, and my favorite track MOIST.

I definately recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Janet Jackson's Damita Jo","review":"Well Janet has realesed another album, but this one is different it is more kick back and mellow. Listing to this album makes you fall in love all over again. Damita Jo is sensual and has an erotic vibe to it. I honestly think it is different from her previously released albums. Janet is still going on strong it's as if she writes and produces what she feels at the time that she is recording. Janet translates a little bit of her self and feelings.

I'M SO HAPPY THAT SHE IS NOT DOING THE EXACT SAME TYPE OF MUSIC. THIS CD SHOWS THE MUSIC SHE CAME FROM WITH HER BROTHERS. I TOTALLY SEE THE FAMILY RELATIONSHIP OF MUSIC AND STYLE EXPOSED. ITS NOT HIGH ENERGY DANCE, ITS SOME DANCE BUT ALOT OF LAID-BACK CHILL UNWIND MUSIC. SHE SHOWS THAT SHE IS THE ONLY ONE WITH AN EROTC AND SOFT SWEET-STYLED VOICE IN ONE. SOME SAY SHE IS NO SINGER.

Which I think she deserved(to me the whole performance was raunchy).Other then that I gave this album shot and wound up disappointed. To me it seemed like Janet really lost her punch with this album. To me it just sounded really lame. The only two tracks I thought that were really strong were All Night and R & B junkie. I was like there's the janet I know and love! Uh, the rest just seems like really crappy filler! I wouldn't waste my time unless your a janet fan.

I didn't even plan on buying this album but when I heard these two songs then I checked Damita jo out and I was very impressed.Another favorite \\"My Baby\\" feat.

I was pleasantly surprised! It was definately worth the money to buy. I love Strawberry Bounce, R&B Junkie and All Nite. The only song I skip over is Warmth. But hey 21 out of 22 tracks ain't bad!!!

Where The Velvet Rope was more introspective, Damita Jo is just all out fun. It sort of reminds me of the janet album. This album has a great feel about it and will be in my cd player non stop for a few months.

In my opinion, Sade pulled it off much better.As for the album, I've listened to several tracks and can only tolerate \\"SloLove.\\" Had she released that song as the first single, the album might have went somewhere . . ."},{"rating":"2","title":"Her Middle Name","review":"Wow!! What can i say about this. This album is one of her best if not the best she's done. Before the album was released i thought that it would bore me because i thought that it would be all about nasty sexual things. And although it does have it's \\"sexy songs\\", they aren't really that nasty becaue she is singing about it in a different way. The song i'm talking about is MOIST. She has what i call i good work out/dance track on the album calleD \\"Just A Little While\\". This song is so damn good it hurts me. (LOL) And her interlude \\"Country\\", is funny. Now the stand out tracks on here are Sexibition,Strawberry Bounce, All Nite(Don't Stop), R&B Junkie, Thinkin' Bout My Ex, And Just A little While. It's very easy to listen to. You just put it in and jam to it. I love the DAMITA JO side of Janet. I've been a fan for years and i love her even more now that i've heard her \\"OTHER\\" side!!! You will not be dissapointed..."},{"rating":"2","title":"As always...Janet Delivers","review":"As a true Janet fan, I knew I had to purchase the album regardless of all the negative press. And as expected....Janet has delivered us another one! This album is definatley better then All For You. I love the R&B, Jazzy feel. The album is very sexy...but when has Janet not been? When is the concert..because I am there. One question though,is that song thinking about my ex boyfriend for JD??:)"},{"rating":"1","title":"light, breezy listen.... return of pop Janet....","review":"\\"Damita Jo\\" is a light, breezy listen with a number of fun songs to listen/dance to.... its only down side is a couple of them sound like something the talentless Britney Spears could have done. The by-now ultra familiar interludes are here. Janet Jackson fans from way back will find much to like here, but it's not on par with her best, such as \\"Rhythm Nation.\\" It's arguably on the same quality level as \\"All For You,\\" but without anything as infectious as that album's title track. A pleasant enough listen, without the self-consciousness of such albums as \\"Velvet Rope.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"OK at best...","review":"After listing to Janet's latest CD, I can't help but wonder if she's in a terrible rut. Her releases have always seemed to focus on a theme, whether it be independence (\\"Control\\"), unity (\\"Rhythm Nation\\"), love (\\"Janet\\"), or acceptance (\\"The Velvet Rope\\"). Things seemed to start going downhill with 2001's \\"All For You.\\" Maybe it was the focus on the sample, maybe it was the weak vocals and omnipresent giggles, but it was seriously lacking the punch of her prior releases. With \\"Damita Jo,\\" there are a few decent tracks to be found - \\"All Nite\\" (Don't Stop),\\" which reminds me of the Black Eyed Peas' \\"Hey Mama\\", \\"I Want You,\\" an instant classic that might fit well into an old jukebox, and \\"My Baby,\\" which features a slick cameo by Kayne West. Overall, though, it seems like Janet's focusing on the \\"shock and awe\\" value - she's no stranger to pushing buttons, but there's a difference between being coy and being downright explicit."},{"rating":"2","title":"LOVE IT!!!!!","review":"I have always been a Janet fan! I have Velvet Robe, All For You, and I just bought Damita Jo. And it's a great CD!!! For dancing or making love! Defintly one of my Fav CDs. Next to Britney and Godsmack! (I'm and all around fan of music!!) So buy, listen and enjoy! Easy as 1-2-3!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Janet is the Best","review":"This is one of Janet's best albums ever. I love every song on it. She has songs produced by Kanye West, Dallas Austin, and Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. I would recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"refreshingly","review":"Certainly the singles that are out right now don't push the album very well because any one of the other songs could have been a better choice, \\"My Baby\\" should be the next single...that song, along with \\"all nite\\" \\"like you dont love me\\" \\"Warmth\\" and \\"truly\\" make the album a worthwhile purchase...but actually the entire cd is very well arranged and produced as usual...very contemporay and abreast (err...no pun...), great CD though...no skips at all but maybe the damn interludes....her speaking voice isnt as refreshing and pleasant as that with which she sings....and she sounds like her brother a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"Shocked and Awed","review":"I don't think I've ever been as skeptical of a Janet album release as I was of this particular album. After all, 2 months of Super Bowl Nipple Rings and sketchy singles (Just a Little While doesn't fit into this album at all), Janet had left me worried. I thought she was loosing the magic touch she's continuously brought to her music. This time, I'm proud to report Janet proved me wrong!This LP's R&B tinged, hard-hitting dance tracks (All Nite, R&B Junkie, Strawberry Bounce), along with smooth and relaxing songs (Spending Time With You, I Want You) songs have kept me listening all day and all nite! I'm too excited!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I personally Love it","review":"I love the Cd from beginging to end, Of course I have my favorites, and they Are Thinkin bout my ex,Like you Don't love me and Island life as well as All night( don't stop), This is not your usuall janet cd and that's what i appreciate most about she's not trying too make you dance on every song, it's a laid back chill type cd, if your looking for same old janet then i suggest earlier albums. but this is a hot cd that if you honestly listen without bias then you should surely enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest review","review":"The album as a whole is remarkable. It is mostly R & B styled with some usual Janet and some rock. It is different and I think people will really enjoy it. I love the different beats and styles. It isn't as long as her other albums, but what she gives us makes us want more! It is worth having."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT ALBUM!","review":"This album is as good as her other ones. She has a lot of songs that can get you dancing like Strawberry bounce. Everyone should all get this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very little growth on Damita Jo","review":"For an artist of Janet's stature who has the ability to surround herself with very talented people, I am a little surprised that this album sounds so similar to All for You, the Velvet Rope and Janet. Very few songs stand out and except for the three songs in the middle of the album \\"all nite\\", \\"r&b junkie\\" and \\"i want you\\", I find myself skipping around a lot. Even the Kanye West collaboration borders on dull. The spoken interludes are downright silly and don't add much to an album. I would pass on this one and wait for the next Greatest Hits collection, which should be out in the next few years."},{"rating":"1","title":"how the mighty have fallen....","review":"Janet must surely miss her younger days when everything she released to radio was instantly added, when her albums sold in the millions, and when she was seeen as the \\"normal Jackson.\\"Some say media backlash is to blame for the complete commercial failure of this album. I beg to differ. This cd is simply just not good. I bought it, listened to it several times, searching in vain for standout tracks, memorable melodies, anything that grabbed me. Couldn't find it. And the cd now rests in the waaaay back of my stack, never to be played again. The Super Bowl debacle was just the final nail in her coffin. Rest in Peace, Miss Jackson."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Great background, but can't hear the singing well. The lyrics are almost indistinguishable. Some of it devolves almost to rap, which I hate. Usually, with rap, though, you can hear the words along with the bass/drums beat.Backround was pretty good, and makes good filler. The singing was hardly art. Some of the intro talking was really pretty insipid."},{"rating":"2","title":"Laid back, filled with grooves, Janet gets funky","review":"This album is a departure from past Janet albums. On this album, Janet is less pop-oriented and has created more R&B/funk/house music on this album.Each song is filled with laid back grooves that you can bop your head to.As a whole, it's a strong album that you can listen to over and over. Good creation by Janet, can't wait for more! Would love for more club/dance music from her as well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Making an exhibition out of herself...","review":"I was gravely disappointed with this album. It has too many slow songs on it, and the songs that are up-tempo, just don't go anywhere at all. Damita Jo was a good track, but it is way too short.The sex songs have got to stop. It was fun with her self-titled and Velvet rope albums, but by All for you, it began to get a bit old, and here she is, doing it again on three playboy/adult channel trashy tracks Sexibition/Strawberry bounce/Warmth and Moist. She is so pretentious as to be completely self-obsessed. It wouldn't at all surprise me if she were sexually inadequate.All in all, I shall award this CD with two stars, as Damita Jo, R&B; junkie and Slolove are good upbeat songs.I am hoping for better things with her next album."},{"rating":"2","title":"Janet's Latest Effort","review":"As an avid Janet fan, I would like to say that while at first, the cd was not grabbing me I am now growing to love it. I must admit that I was disappointed that Janet, who is now approaching 40 and in love, hasn't shown much growth with this cd. Frankly, I find the themes of uninhibited sexual energy a bit played out. However, her hot dance tracks such as Island Life, R&B Junkie, and others are classic Janet. Take your time, get past the sex, and give this cd a good listen. You'll be pleased."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Rave Album!!!!","review":"I absolutely love this album!! It has old-school r& b songs such as I Want You, Spending Time With You and Truly. Dance songs such as All Nite & Sexhibition really get you grooving. This album is for everyone beacuse it's all positive and uplighting. Damita Jo is a new era well worth the wait!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"DAMITA JO IS ONE OF THE BEST JANET ALBUMS TO DATE","review":"I JUST WANT TO SAY THAT I LOVE THE CD, IT IS OFF THE HOOK. THE BEATS ARE SLAMMIN AND THE SONGS FLOW WITH EASE. IF YOU ARE A JANET FAN OR NOT, THIS IS A MUST HAVE CD. I LOVE THE WAY THE INTERLUDES SET UP THE SONGS AND THE SONGS ALL HAVE A DIFFERENT SOUND TO THEM. I CAN'T STOP PLAYING THE CD. I LOVE THE WHOLE ALBUM FROM START TO FINISH. JANET AND THE VARIOUS PRODUCERS SHE WORKED WITH REALLY PUT IT DOWN AND IM LOOKING FORWARD TO THE VIDEOS AND TOUR THAT WILL GO HAND IN HAND WITH THIS JOINT. THE ALBUM IS THE BEST SO FAR THIS YEAR AND I WOULD ADVISE EVERYONE TO GO PICK UP A COPY AND SEE FOR YOURSELF. DON'T PAY THE HATERS ANY ATTENTION. DAMITA JO IS ALL ABOUT LOVE AND IT COMES THRU LOUD AND CLEAR..THANKS FOR SOME MORE GOOD MUSIC JANET, YOU DID IT AGAIN...PERFECTION!"},{"rating":"1","title":"What have you Done for us lately Janet!","review":"I\`ve been a fan of Janet since 1986 when Control was released. I have ALL of the albums she has made since then and this one is the worst! There is only One track that stands out which is the single Just A Little While. The first 4 tracks are just a fusion of bland soul music. Janet used to be like Madonna, always an innovator of music...not a follower. Janet was a great album with tracks like Thats the way, Again, If, Throb etc. Velvet Ropes best track was You, a withdrawn release. All For You wasn\`t a great album, but the title track,someone to call my lover and Son of a gun...all very different and brilliant! Come on Janet! You CAN do better."},{"rating":"1","title":"No. 15 and on its way down","review":"Damito Jo is now no 15 on the Billboard album chart! Thank you! To all of you who refused to be suckered by the wardrobe/musical/career malfunction, thank you. It is great to see that most of the CD buying public wised up to the fact that 90% or more of the wonderful reviews here were written by record company hacks wanting to make you believe that there was some grassroots fan movement. Let's keep it going until Damita Jo is in the cutout section and on sale for $1.99. And even then, don't buy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"CAREER MALFUNCTION","review":"As someone who likes to keep \\"abreast\\" of R&B;, I must saythat this latest effort by \\"Damita Ho\\" is a crashing BO!!Poor middle-aged Janet ran out of interesting ideas about 3CD's ago, and so has gone on to replace good songs with stalegrooves, 80's re-hashes, and boring sampling. And enough ofthe sexual stuff, girly girl! For a 38-year old woman to keeprubbing her \\"self-discovery\\" (i.e. \\"I love my coochie\\") in ourears is too much. Someone has lost Control!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ugh","review":"Someone here wrote that this music makes you want to get up and dance. Hard to do that with your pants down around your ankles. There's only one purpose to this music. And once you hear a couple of cuts, you'll realize that the Super Bowl fiasco was no accident. This once-innocent girl (the last of the sane Jacksons) knows exactly what she's doing -- corrupting America in order to line her pocketbook. Surely there must be some other way to get rich, but that would be taking the high road, and high roads require integrity and talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ummm... What happened Janet?","review":"I have enjoyed her albums Rhythm Nation, Janet, Velvet Rope and 3 songs from All For You, but this album is the worst. I dont feel the oomph that she normally puts into an album. This is what happens when works with different producers. Janet is a good singer, but she went downhill with this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used CD for Sale! Cheap!","review":"This is an R&B album, not a pop album. I can't express how disappointed I am in this CD. I have been a Janet fan since the beginning. I have endured this CD 3 times hoping it would grow on me. It is just a boring, poorly produced piece of work. It's nearly impossible to hear the vocals over the instrumentals. What I can hear is just vulgar. I am not a conservative person but someone needs to remind Janet that there is a difference between sexy and vulgar. The one highlight is \\"All Nite\\". This, the only danceable tune is placed conveniently in the middle of the CD, to keep the listener from falling asleep I asume. Even at the lower released price this album is disappointing. Unless you are looking for heavy bass and barely audible whispered vocals, skip this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"TWO SUPER SIZED THUMBS DOWN!!!!","review":"This album sets JANET JACKSON or should I say DAMITA JO back to her Fame days. What a waste of MONEY I put this cd (...). Now I know why she had to come up with something to get this to move off the shelves. IF you like a lot of softed voiced mumble jumble and maybe ONE dance song --Here it is. IF you want music that you can sing or dance to-- Move on. I heard Janet say this is a album about being in love well, I find it more LUST than LOVE. Janet keep this love cd behind closed doors and do what you do best DANCE MUSIC."},{"rating":"1","title":"Really Disapointed","review":"I have been a Janet fan for quite some time, and this was definitely not her best. I have to say that I find that the \\"genre\\" of music she chose to introduce on this cd is really almost irritating. I wish she would just go back to the type of music she used to write on her previous cds."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Janet has outdone herself yet again. Reinventing herself each time, Damita Jo is nothing short of a master piece and a true work of art. I love the album. Damita Jo has everything from the slow sexy side of Janet to the up beat dance side of Janet. I would truly recommend this album to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I've been a Janet Jackson fan for almost 20 years now and I must say that this is the weakest of all her albums. The production is very strong, polished, and crisp (as usual), however, the music is bland and very uninspiring. I know Janet is really into exploring (and exploiting) her sexually, but she doesn't take us into more of a deeper realm that other artist like Prince hasn't already been to.Out of the 22 tracks on this album, I only bother listening to two - \\"Spending Time With You\\" and \\"SloLove\\".If you are looking for GOOD Janet Jackson albums, then please direct your attention to Control, Rhythm Nation 1812, Janet., and the Velvet Rope. Leave this one on the shelf."},{"rating":"1","title":"Give it up! Damita Jo.","review":"In a word, Terrible. Janet couldn't have heard this album before release, if she had she would have pulled it from production. In all but 3 songs, you couldn't tell who was singing, her voice is just not strong. The back-up singers should get top bill. The songs sounded like everything else she has done in the past 8 cds. I had high hopes for this CD, and was extremely disappointed. From the sound of her voice, no lack of a voice, she should give up singing."},{"rating":"1","title":"What an aweful let down!!!","review":"After listening to all the ultra-conservative radio talk show hosts bash Janet for the last two months over that Superbowl stunt I was fully ready to support Janet on this new album even though I was disappointed with her last album All For You. People just freaked over the Superbowl performance and I liked it and didn't find it tasteless at all. We all have nipples afterall. Anyway, I don't know what happened to Janet on this cd, but the songs are just boring. She keeps the same light whispery tone throughout almost every song. The song All Nite is the best song on the album in my opinion and that really isn't saying much. I've been a Janet fan since the Control days and have all of her albums and several singles, but if this album reflects the way Janet's music is moving I seriously doubt I will purchase another Janet album. I will at least wait until a couple of singles are released next time to see what they sound like."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ooh No She Didn't","review":"I agree with the person who believes these five-star reviews are from Janet's record company or friends, etc. Janet hasn't made great music in a while but the last decent album she had was Janet. The Velvet Rope slightly passed the entertainment mark.(...) It's a shame she's compromising the talent she used to have so she can remain a black pin-up doll for people who weren't even old enough to remember her GOOD albums. All the songs sound a like and you can't understand a word she's saying half the time. Grow up, Janet. Skip this album unless you've misplaced your latest shipment of Viagra."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Waste Your Time...or Money","review":"This is absoutely ridiculous. I was eagerly awaiting the new cd from Janet; expecting an offering that illustrated why she is the star the other \\"wannabes\\" in the pop world copy. Instead, all Janet comes up with is tired, uninspired lyrics, which all seem to focus on one thing. I'm beginning to think Janet has a serious hangup. This is a far fall from her \\"Control\\" and Rhythm Nation\\" days. On the song, \\"Damita Jo\\", Janet claims to have \\"class\\" but she contradicts herself terribly as evidenced in the lyrics showcased on this cd. She leaves nothing to the imagination and the result is an utterly disguisting self-degrading mess. I would advise everyone to pass this one up...I'll be glad when Janet cleans up her act and returns to the regal form she once possesed.Don't let the innocent smile fool you; this is trash."},{"rating":"1","title":"Skip this one, unless you want music to fall to sleep by","review":"This is primarily an album of R&B lite and \\"Slow Jam\\" music. While there are a couple semi decent songs, this is not an album to grove or dance to. To be frank, I found it boring and a waste of Janet's time, an anyone (else's time) looking foreward an \\"Old School\\" jam. My adice is to listen to \\"Control\\", \\"Rythym Nation\\",\\"Janet\\", \\"The Velvet Rope\\" or \\"All For You\\" until Janet's next album after \\"YO 20\\" comes out. Lots of \\"old School\\" Janet fans, such as myself, have also skipped \\"YO 20.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST JANET CD","review":"Well, I really think this is the worst Janet's cd. It's boring, some songs are really fool. Janet should stop trying to write \\"atmosphere\\" songs because she doesn't succeed at all. to tell the truth, she never succeeded in the past too. Janet is for dancing, for songs full of energy, not for slow songs with fool lyrics like these, without any meaning.buff! che schifo!ciao!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This keeps getting worse","review":"Don't get me wrong. I use to be a fan of Janet Jackson's music. I loved the albums \\"Control\\", \\"Rhythm Nation\\" \\"Janet\\" and \\"The Velvet Rope\\". I couldn't wait for them. After I boutht \\"All for you\\", I was totally dissapointed. The music was bland, nothing special. I had high hopes for this album until I listened to it. What a waste! Not one good song. I miss the old Janet; I just don't know if the music she releases from now on is going to be this bad. My recommendation is to not buy this album. Save your money instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHE NEEDS TO STOP NOW!!!","review":"After the last CD, I felt she was really trying to hard to be sexy.This DJ junk is nothing more than Adult Entertainment on CD. And as far as the so-called \\"worbdrove malfunction\\" at the Super Bowl? Please!!!It was all plan JJ, just in time for this DJ mess and you know it. Hell!! You've been busting out with your chest open since the 1990 MTV music awards ever since. JJ you are 40 years old now, your sex goddess days, when you were in your 20's are over!!!

Or for that matter, you seriously need to mature your image and sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"What Was She Thinking?","review":"I like Janet Jackson, but this CD is.....just a waste of...I don't know. I listen to:1. Sexhibition2. I Want You3. Spending Time With You4. All Nite (Don't Stop)5. Strawberry Bouncebut the other 15,16 songs are skippable. When I listen to this CD, I feel like she rushed through making it. When compared to \\"All For You\\" and her other CDs, this should not even have been released. She should have took more time on the music instead of releasing it right after the SuperBowl, so it could sell, but it is not."},{"rating":"1","title":"This album is a waste of material, time, and money.","review":"I should have known this album would be plagued with seriously quiet whispering and incessantly stupid lyrics; but nothing on this planet could have prepared me for how lame this album is.On yet another album, Janet shamefully sneezes out lame tracks like ... uh ... every track on this album. Her voice is buried (as usual) beneath an assault of grungy guitars, similar sounding back-up singers, drums, and a lot of unidentifiable noise. Aside from \\"All Nite (Don't Stop)\\" and \\"Strawberry Bounce\\" the rest of the album made my fingers itch to switch the player off.It's embarrassing (for the artists, their \\"posse\\", their companies, and whoever else dips in their celebrity pool) that artists can get away with such sub-par music, lyrics, and \\"vocal stylings\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"tasteless, vacuous and slicky-slicky.","review":"Janet, this is little more than self-indulgent drivel.

I've been a fan since I was about 6. With each cd Janet gives you something to think about and with this one you feel the love Janet has in side her. Its intoxicating. It makes you yearn to have a love you can't see yourself with out! GREAT JOB J."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great artist....but needs to retire","review":"Sorry Janet. You need to realize that using the same sexed up image for the past decade or so isn't going to work anymore. You're not in your 20s. Follow Madonna's example and be more mature and come out with a new sound and acceptable look (remember Madonna from 1990-98? She came back and strong with Ray of Light). I always loved Janet, but it bothers me that time after time, she comes up with more garbage and doesn't improve well. Thank goodness this flopped b/c this album is complete trash. Using dirty sexy lyrics makes her look more desparate sadly. I was fine with the janet album, but this needs to end. Janet has officially lost it and somewhere down the road lost her talent as well. Just think of her as the r&b version of Lil Kim. The sad thing is that her troll doll bf is ruining her too. He needs to stop destrying her legacy. Get Rhythm Nation, janet., or Velvet Rope."},{"rating":"1","title":"Damita WHOA!!!","review":"This cd was utterly bad, and im not talkin about her brother's song either. I couldn't believe that a janet jackson album would sound so terrible. It's not about her \\"other side\\" because everybody had an other side, but this album didn't do nothing for me. She didn't.....bring it. It was like she was trying to get across that she is Ms. Jackson (if you're nasty) but she didn't need to do that because we already knew! (anybody seen the Hawaii concert??) I think the most decent track on here was \\"Thinkin' About My Ex.\\" Now that was a song that I could half way tolerate. I will say that the tracks on here were funky and cool, but the lyrics sucked big time. I'm glad I didn't buy this album otherwise it woulda been a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"How disgusting and disgraceful","review":"This cd has very limited quality, i mean no quality. It is just janet singing stupid songs. It has too many tracks where she talks about listening to the radio, or going to the beach. Its pure nonsense. When i bought it i listened to it in my walkman and instantly vomited into my Louis vuitton bag, thanks alot janet.. that is a total waste of eight hundred dollars. Dont buy this cd. If you are keep your reciept bacause you will want to return it. When people mention the name Janet jackson i think in my head \\"high cheek bones + the same nose as her brothers so not make a good mix\\" Ha! Dont buy it. You will only disappoint yourself"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn","review":"Truly awful. Don't believe these fake music industry reviews. This album is boring and uninspired."},{"rating":"1","title":"What has this woman done with Janet?","review":"Don't get me wrong - I like Janet. I own her albums. I watch her videos. But after putting this CD in my stereo and skipping over many of the songs after about a minute, I'm beginning to wonder what's happened to the talented, intelligent, sassy Janet I used to know. There's only so much heavy breathing and whispered words one can take...but saying that, the middle of the album (Island Life, All Nite, R&B Junkie) isn't bad. At least it has some sort of melody and tune going on. The rest of the CD tends to blend in to each other; there's nothing here to tempt me into listening to this album again. I could imagine this coming from Beyonce, but Janet? Give me Rhythm Nation 1814 any day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yep, it's boring","review":"I haven't come close to enjoying a JJ album since Design of a Decade, and this one moves even further back. It seems JJ is more interested in undressing than delivering a decent set of songs. The continued use of the spoken passages combine with the other elements to give me the impression of a very self-absorbed personality. There's very little of interest on this lackluster collection of whispers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Let Down","review":"I've been a Janet fan for a long long time, so I was really left disappointed by her new CD. I guess part of my disappointment comes from the mediocre production and songs that I couldn't get into. I've tried numerous times to force-feed myself this CD to no avail. Janet's previous releases have been arranged with a particular formula that has worked like a charm, up until now. There wasn't a need for Janet to deviate from what worked. This CD is sugary sweet, not as well produced as her other releases, and seems rushed. You could always bank on the fact that if Janet released a CD, then the songs on it would be great. Not the case on Damita Jo. It's time for Janet to go back to the lab with Jimmy and Terry and do this one over with better production and better writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"I feel like dancing to some Janet","review":"Wow! Like with all her albums, DAMITA JO is unique and different. Listening to the album for the first time, \\"Just a Little While\\" and \\"I Want You\\" definitely were the tracks that jumped out at me as being the hits on the album. It's a different sound thats refreshing to hear. I also think \\"Slo Love\\" should be a favorite track to hit the charts,too. It has that disco/dance feel similar but different to \\"Come and Get Up\\" from the ALL FOR YOU album. After numerous times of listening to DAMITA JO on my cd player, the other tracks are growing on me. I love \\"My Baby\\" with Kanye West and \\"Island Life\\" - very laid back, cool tracks...and \\"R&B Junkie\\" has the '80's sound that I miss...\\"Thinking 'Bout My Ex\\" is a truthful and sincere song people can relate to...How would I describe DAMITA JO? Cool, sensual, feel-good, sincere and honest....'til the next album....DAMITA JO has my vote!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Forget the Superbowl!

GO DAMITA JO!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Janet, you can do better than this..","review":"This is by far, the worst Janet album of her career. We're all tired of her heavy breathing, fake orgasms and meaningless lyrics as we struggle through the twenty-something number of tracks on this album.Especially because Janet takes a few years between albums, we expect more from her. All of the songs on the album are under four minutes in length giving one the impression that she rushed to get the album out.The only songs worth considering as possible hits are Thinking About My Ex, R&B; Junkie (good song) and I Want You. The others are fluff and nowhere as good as the songs on her All For You album. Sorry Janet, this one's a write-off. Better luck next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"This Sux So Bad...","review":"Hehe, i was a Janet Fan from Control to Velvet Rope, AFY suckedand We have another question...

That being said its still better than most of the crap that is out there.Many of the songs are dirty without being fun and exciting. And you know something sucks when they cant even make sex fun and exciting.Seriously this ablum lacks the hip dance beat, quality slow grooves and creative songs we are used to seeing from janet. There is little here to recommdend to anyone.There are 3 good songs here:\\"Strawberry Bounce\\", is a sexy but fun song, that tries out some new beats and has that \\"Go Deep\\" and \\"All For You\\" dance party feel to it. Just made for a dance floor.\\"R and B Junkie\\", plays homage to old school classics! If you loved the classics you will love this.\\"All Nite\\" is a passable song that only stands out so much because the rest of the album is so unexciting."},{"rating":"2","title":"ok I don't know what's up with \\"music Fan\\"","review":"If your goal was to bring down the over all rating of this album by voting 1 star for 3 million times, you've got a battle.

Find something better to do with your life than vote 1 star for 6 consecutive times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"Miss Jackson has done it again! I love this cd......its one of her best....My baby which is featuring Kanye West is a great track...but I love Kanye...so....lol.........This album isn't that sexual....I think All for you was a lot more sexual then Damita Jo....You have to be open minded when buying any new album.....you can't buy a new album and just expect what you hear on last albums....people grow and their music changes...So if you buy this album...be open-minded....:-)"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happend to Janet??? :(","review":"I was so excited to get this CD. I must say that this is one of the biggest waste of money I have ever spent. It almost puts me to sleep...almost all of the songs are mono tone and dull. There are no songs that stick out as being \\"classic\\" like the older stuff Janet is know for. This CD will most likely fall like a rock on the charts. The first single \\"Just a Little While\\" peaked at #45 then quickly fell and the second single \\"I want you\\" Is doing much worse and is currently charting in the 60's. I expected much more from one of my former favorite artists. Save your money and wait for the next one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Who Put the M in Music Baby its Janet Ms. Jackson if U Nsty","review":"Damita Jo in a few words takes you through a roller coaster of emotions. In all honesty I have and will always be a fan of Janet because she stays true to herself as well as her music. The Cd is one of the few that is so smooth that You can listen to it all the way through no pause. Anyway give it a shot you will not be denied if you want to unwind then listen to \\"Thinking about my EX\\" \\"My Baby\\", or \\"Spending Time with U\\" if you want to dance then get going with cuts like \\" All Night\\" , \\"Just a Little While\\", \\"R&B Junkie\\", or \\"Slo Love\\". If you want some sensual grooves Janet has included some of those too \\"Warmth\\" & \\"Moist\\" Leave very little to the imagination and can start the most timid of flames. In all Damito Jo shows Ms. Jackson's ability to deliver music at its best so don't wait get on and I hope you enjoy the RIDE.."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is her worst album to date","review":"This is the worst album that Janet has put out to date.In fact except for the song \\"R&B Junkie\\" that is the only song that can inspire me to pick up this CD. My feeling if this is the best that she can do -- then she needs to stop recording. My suggestion to anyone seeking to buy this album -- Don't!!!. If you must listen to it, borrow from some one who didn't have any type of warning (like me) or download it. Don't pay full retail price for this one. I love the old Janet -- but this is definitely \\"garbage.\\"\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this mess? I'm very dissapointed.","review":"This is horrible. What a mess. It's so unoriginal. What's with all the talking and rambling on before the songs? This CD is about only one thing, SEX. It's getting old. This is by far the worst music from Janet. I'm not blown away at all. I'm convinced that if not for the superbowl mess, there would be no mention of Janet or this CD at all it's that bad. The music is bad, but her vocals are even worse. Janet was never a strong singer to begin with but she always had great music to back her up. Here she has neither decent vocals or good music."},{"rating":"2","title":"good effort jan","review":"at first I had to comprehend the fact this was the same janet jackson we all grooved to, but then again janet is known for changing her musical style all the time, so that's what she's doing on this CD. The CD has more hip hop influences in the music than she has ever used before. She created a hip hop/r&b dance CD with explicit lyrics and modern beats. Only complaint is the length of each track they could have been longer songs I think."},{"rating":"1","title":"No creative efforts at all; it is all about (...)","review":"After all these years, I still think Rhythem Nation and All For You are her best works. Contrary to what Janet said in numerous interviews, I think this disk lacks \\"personality\\" and sounds plain and boring. Besides, her vocal just became much weaker in this album, and I could only hear the beats and background vocals in most of the songs."},{"rating":"2","title":"She is STILL IN CONTROL","review":"Janet has done it again with the release of her new cd Damita Jo. This album is nothing like anything she has released before. She gives you dance hits as well as smooth laid back hits. There is something for everyone on this album and those of you that don't like it....STOP HATIN'!"},{"rating":"1","title":"awful","review":"I used to love Janet. But now all she sings about is sex and it's boring and gross to keep talking about it. She needs to retire now. And please stop doing stunts.

Low songs, lyrically uninspired, nothing new but the boring melodies and poor songs. Could be compared to the first Britney album because of the lack of quality and artistical relevance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey, what's happening with her?","review":"Sorry, but right now I can understand why she was so desperately trying to claim attention with that ridiculous Superbowl performance. She knew that she's not inspired at all at these times (actually since AFY) and there are no excuses for her since she peaked with Velvet Rope and didn't need to leave the right way of doing music. She assumed in an interview that she sees Britney and Cristina as younger competition and this CD is a sad try to do teenage pop. The songs are simply BORING, she whispers all the time, the lyrics are VERY BAD, the rhythms are VERY BAD, the album is a waste of money, but I understand that everybody was expecting something better from her. This is sh_tty."},{"rating":"1","title":"No artistic growth on this album","review":"Is it just me, or is Janet Jackson trying to rip off Sade's \\"Love Deluxe\\" album cover? The black & white shades, body position, hair, etc . . . If you ask me, Sade got it right the first time. Really, Janet. Maybe you should stick to pasties or military gear circa 1814. As for the album, only \\"SloLove\\" sounds current and may lead to some great remixes. I also wish she would choose different procducers . .. I am sick of Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis tunes. They have produced every album since Control . . . .YAWN!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"This album is probably one of Janet's worst by far.

Its a shame how you say that we shouldf feel sorry for people who make albums and put effort into making albums.I feel more sorry for those people out there who waste $15.00 on a piece of crap.

Well, don't believe the hype and don't buy the disc. In fact, when you read too many glittering reviews for any CD here on this Web site, you should always take it with a great big sack of salt.

It hasa diverse collection of songs that will suit any occassion. You can dance, you can relax to Janet melodious voice, or set the mood for love (you guys know Janet has the bomb loving making ballads). This music has love all over it, I thank Jermain Dupri for giving Janet the passion that comes through to clearly in this CD. I was going to write about my favorite song but I cant choose one or two, there are so many great songs on here. I encourage everyone to purchase this CD. You will NOT be disappointed.And to all the people how think Janet needs to pull stunts on TV to sell CD's, the CD is a smack in you face. This is a talented and gifted woman and she has put it down on disk for you. Words can't express how much I love this CD. Thank you Janet."},{"rating":"2","title":"What more could you expect from Miss Jackson?","review":"Miss Jackson is back! After long anticipation, Damita Jo is here and here to stay!

It's everything you would expect from Janet and more!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible!","review":"This album is terrible! It is as if EVERY song on it is about sex, sex, sex. All For You was not all that great either, but at least AFY's songs weren't all about sex. I'd honestly rather listen to her first two albums, Janet Jackson(1982) and Dream Street(1984) than this absurd trash. They are both better and even though they aren't well known, they are a hundred times better than this album. Her voice sounds terrible and boring on this album. Listen to I Want You, a slow and boring song. The other songs are really nothing to write home about either. The inturludes are terrible, for example one about her saying, \\"I love this place because I relax here\\" or something like it. And this album being cursed with the Superbowl incident doesn't help matters. In fact, it brings this album down three notches. It should have been called, \\"Dammit\\" without the Jo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing New !!! Same Old Sound !!!","review":"I was terribly disappointed with the Damita Jo album. There is nothing new on this album. All of these songs sound like extended versions of her previous work. Gone are the days of Janet being an innovator in the music industry with albums like Control and Rhythm Nation. Now all her songs sound like one long sex party. I miss the Janet that used to impower women with songs that inspired us to do more than lay on our backs !!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great job!!!","review":"To me, this one one of her best cd's. I was afraid to hear it at first because i didn't know what to expext, but after the first few songs i was hooked. Best songs are Spending time with you,Strawberry Bounce, All Nite and Warmth. I recommend everyone to buy this cd!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"HER BEST ALBUM, GO LISTEN 4 YOURSELF","review":"This is Janet's best album ever. She did a good job with the style of music and her vocal. You will not be disappointed! One of her best songs in my opinion is Thinkin' Bout My Ex."},{"rating":"2","title":"Janet is still a trailblazer!!!","review":"I have to admit that i was a bit nervous about this new cd when I heard \\"Just a Little While\\" but once I was able to hear the entire cd I must say that it is definitely her best cd since \\"Janet\\". I can listen to it from start to finish and then start over again. The only disappointment is that she did not include lyrics on the inside of cd cover as with previous albums. All the songs are different and being that Janet never wants to do the same things over and over I can only respect the fact that she took risks with her new music inspite of the Super-Bowl controversy. My favorite tracks are Island Life, My Baby, Like you don't love me, My Baby, Thinkin bout my ex, and the 2 Nasty slow songs near the end. I guess you can say I love the whole album. Any die-hard fan is going to love this new album and those who never really cared may find something negative to say no matter what."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feeling Good.","review":"This album is just awesome. I have listened to it everyday since buying it and can't get enough of it. \\"SloLove\\" is my favorite one on the album, along with \\"All Nite (Don't Stop)\\", \\"Thinkin' Bout My Ex\\" is just so true and everyone can definitely relate to this song.

I really enjoy how she used her inner child flavor where you really ask yourself do I really know Damita Jo or do I know Janet Jackson. I thought it was clever how she made it so dimenensional to the point where if you didn't dig Janet you would dig damita Jo or vise versa. I really enjoyed the cd it gave a different quality of what is being giving today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Janet More Sensual then Ever :)","review":"Many say that this album is not like any other, but if your a JANET fan, every album is so very different. With any of her albums you get such a VARIETY of sounds. This CD is awesome. You have plenty of dance numbers, some very erotic/sensual songs, and of course all those cute little interludes between the songs. It is a much stronger CD than the ALL FOR YOU CD. There is even some disco ;) on the cd?!?! Can you believe it. I can't wait to see her next tour!"},{"rating":"1","title":"B.O.R.I.N.G....zzzzzzzz","review":"Most of the reveiews of this CD (on Amazon) read like a music executive wrote them, trying to hype they're product.This CD is a real snooze...Boring really doesn't quite describe it!

Apparently, that side is as shallow and vapid as this CD. The production is great, and the songs are catchy, but the lyrics are mind-numbingly vacuous, and Janet's interludes. Janet doesn't understand that love doesn't originate between the legs.There is a line between erotic and trashy, and Janet crosses it over and over. I've been a Janet fan since \\"Control\\", and this album makes me yearn for the old days. Janet, put your clothes back on and bring back that sweet, smart, sexy woman that we all love."},{"rating":"1","title":"yes I am a janet jackson fan","review":"this album is honestly one of her weakest ones, right down there with all for you. I can only tolerate about half the songs, but she's done so much better before and they don't live up to the real janet we all fell in love with. I also agree with many reviewers she's sold out trying to be like britney and christina, she's worse than them now actually taking fans places they don't want to go, being a fly on the wall in her bedroom at night basically. I hope janet can get her head straight and get back to making real music. People who like this CD are probably teeny boppers not old enough to remember the real janet jackson who gave us amazing music videos and albums with class, cause this longtime jackson fan is disappointed with janet, she hasn't done anything lately with her lousy new music and image. Go listen to michael jackson instead, his music is better anyways"},{"rating":"2","title":"Janet came stong with this one!!","review":"Since I bought Damita Jo, I have neglected my other cd's. I ablsolutely love this cd. This has become one of my favorite Janet album. This is her most R&B offering to date. I have so many favorite songs on this cd and I definitely listen to it from start to finish. I do more rewinding than forwarding. The cd is well crafted. The production is excellent and it just flows well. Trust me you will love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Phoning It In","review":"Here we go again. More songs about sexuality. Even more dirty talk. More breathy \\"singing\\" and spoken interludes. This could be the Janet album, Velvet Rope or All For you, but it's the latest Janet Jackson album. Yea right! She's making the same album over and over again.There are a few tunes that get your head boucing, but none of it as honest and compelling as her best work. Only for the truly hard-core JJ fans out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"TALENT MISFUNCTION!!","review":"Janet has always tried to emulate the career of Madonna, who is far more talented. When Madonna kissed Britney and Christina at the 2003 MTV Awards, Janet tried to top this by simulating herself getting raped at the Superbowl. Are Madonna and Janet desperate? YES! The difference is that at least Madonna pulled her stunt on MTV, where parents had the choice to not have their children watch. The Superbowl is a family oriented event. Janet hijacked this with her no talent antics and it was very shameful. The album, which features her having verbal orgasms, is just as pathetic."},{"rating":"2","title":"Damita Jo","review":"To all the people who have given this album a 1 star, you have truly lost your minds.

The plot is dull- a lame rehash of the countless \\"rise of the old USSR\\" that have flooded the genre since the events of 1991. The characters are weak, and the plot twists are weaker. Worst of all is Brown's disgusting Clinton-bashing, so naked in its hostility that it makes Brown look foolish and petty. Maybe Brown should have spent less time whining about Clinton than writing a better story. Better yet- he could give me my money back."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good author.","review":"Like all military books. Plots are always good and fast moving. Always am looking for his next book. More.

This one is however below average. The first half is decent, especially the Desert Storm mission, although the top brass' reaction to the latter is unrealistic. The second half is a let-down, with totally unbelievable actions. And the Clinton bashing alone takes at least two points of the rating. By the way, maybe Mr Brown could buy a decent map of the world? The Hong-Kong gaff in Fatal Terrain has been highlighted before, but here he manages to mix up Slovakia (formed from the former Czechoslovakia) with Slovenia (formed from the former Yugoslavia), even in the map included in the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too technical","review":"I have read several books by Brown and he seems to suffer from Tom Clancey's urge to describe in minute detail the entire operations of a submarine. Only Brown's forte is airplanes and in the course of his plot he wants you to know as much about the operations of an airplane as he does. This creates many pages which I just gloss over hoping that something else in the overall plot will surface which will hold my attention. I did not even finish this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The last Dale Brown book I ever read","review":"Petty politics undermines what otherwise might have been a passable action novel. Brown's grudge against the Clintons gets the better of him and skews the novel away from its otherwise interesting plotline, toward the author's apparently bottomless hatred of the First Family. One gets the feeling that only the intervention of his publisher prevented Brown from using even cruder language, particularly in his depiction of the First Lady. I respect the fact that Brown may have strong feelings agains the Clintons, but other authors I have read do a much better job of keeping their novels from having such a vindictive tone -- next to Brown, Tom Clancy seems downright even-handed. Unless he only wants to appeal to the most bitter of Clinton-haters, Brown should consider toning down the rhetoric and focusing on fiction in the future."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy Apex -Terrible Company","review":"Bought the GB51HD09 51\\" HDTV in November.

I could only suffer through 17 pages before putting it down for good.

My first impression was that the backbeat was more 80's revival than 21st century electronica which gives this avantgarde group a somewhat dated sound. The lead singer's voice is sweet but not as powerful like the leads in Evanescence and Lacuna Coil. Occasionally the music drowns out the singer entirely, though that might be a production flaw. Their music can't be put in one category and there's quite of experimentation going in the album to make listening an interesting experience. But after one sitting, I'm not sure whether I like the album or not. The lyrics are fab though and hopefully over time this group will win me over. This album is definitely for the open-minded. Ideally, I'd give it 3 1/2 stars for now but 4 is fair."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent mind bending collection of SQL problems","review":"This book contains a set of problems to be solved using SQL, and the problems are such that they make the reader think of SQL and use it in a set based manner as opposed to mixing in procedural techniques.A stellar book for instruction is SQL, as not only do the problems teach about how to solve SQL problems correctly, but many of the problems are quite difficult, providing for major mind expanding opportunities.Definitely worth the money if you have an SQL package to attempt to solve the problems with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will reinforce your knowledge of SQL.","review":"This book is for a typical sql programmer.

Any mid-level SQL developer could probably write a book of the same kind and usefullness by just logging every problem they solved at work for a period of a year. For this reason, if you did a lot of SQL work, you won't find anything useful in this book.If I am presented a puzzle, I expect it to look impossible to solve at first, and once you get on track of finding a solution, solving it would turn out to be a lot of fun.

But as far as helping you learn tactics, I loved it. It's full of simpler problems so it's obviously better suited to beginners or intermediates. (Maybe 1000-1600) I agree with other readers that it has very few errors and I really liked it's sense of pattern recognition. There are times when it will have 3 or 4 very similar puzzles within 2 pages so that when you don't get it the first time, by the 3rd or 4th time you think to you yourself \\"I see, I get it now.\\" I've gone through it 5 times and my copy is worn and dog-eared but definitely cherished.

If he thinks the reason he got another chance to complete the story was because of the slave/master relationships in the book he is wrong.

The characters were contrived and the sex highly improbable but the stories often had clever narrative structure and wonderful pace. Witness of Gor has none of this. It's long and most of the first three quarters is given over to the sexual politics for which John Norman is famous. The repetition is dismal and would be comical if it weren't for the constant claim to be taken seriously. It's strange to have these novels turning up in lists of sado masochistic writing; they are more slerotic than erotic - except, I guess, for the John Norman tragics who can't get enough of the one thin message repeated again and again.And then, suddenly, the novel comes to life and it is genuinely riveting. The action is powerful enough to save the dismal sex and while it lacks the lapidary finish of many of the earlier novels, it is still worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Complete piece of trash","review":"I loved the early Gor books and had hoped, based on a few reader reviews, that this was indeed a \\"return to adventure\\" as one of the reviews said.

There could not have been more than 10 or 15 pages of intrigue and action; the remainder is a bunch of slave girl garbage.My problem isn't that it is politically incorrect; my problem is that it is profoundly boring.

I think the problem is an engineering issue - with the weight of the water tanks on the back of the machine, over the wheels, instead of over the brushes and suction in front, there's not enough contact with the carpet to suck out the water, and the brushes aren't effectively engaged. I solved this (partially) by tying a brick onto the front. I notice another reviewer pushes down on the front while his wife runs the machine. But my old 5200, which lasted for years, had much better suction as well as brush action. So only buy the Agility if you can't handle the slightly heavier weight of the 5200 machines, because it does a very poor cleaning job and leaves the carpet very wet, which, with time, might be damaging to the carper."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hoover Carpet Cleaner F6207-900 metexpectations","review":"This product was purchased initially because of the weight and versatility, having both the rug tool and the upholstery tool which worked well on stairs and small areas.

The only problem I have with the machine is the foot lever on the right to lower the handle. It is very stiff and awkward to release.

I don't think that was a very well thought out concept in the design. While the latch is no longer intact, the water container still holds into place. My only other complaint is that the carpet cleaner does not stay separate from the water like other Hoover cleaners.

Fluffy clean carpets, great suction, looked professional. BUT IT WON'T LAST!! I've said it before, and I'll say it again. Pay no mind to reviewers who use this a few times and get excited and write great reviews. I previously owned the other Hoover Clean Surge steam vac, and that one seemed more sturdy, lasted longer, and sucked up more water, leaving the carpet dryer. Of course, all these machines will crap out on you after about 3 years of regular use, but I was really disappointed that we didn't get 2 years from this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hoover carpet cleaner","review":"Hoover is the brand a local appliance repair shop recommended and this one was a great price. Unfortunately, sometimes you get what you pay for! This model has, in my opinion, a design flaw. If the return compartment is not completely closed, the water will not be sucked from the carpet. I took it on and off several times, before and after talking to a Hoover rep, and it still did not function after the first run. I did like the brushes that clean in all directions rather than a brush similar to a vacuum and I will definately be investing in a better model and do the job myself rather than hiring companies.

Don't believe any review on any website that tells you otherwise. The only reason this cover isn't a complete waste of money is that it does fit and it will protect your firepit if you are extremely careful but even so it will still fall apart.

Yet, this one left me wanting. The characters were flat and steriotypical. The action seemed forced. The entire book is of running, running, running. Same scenes over and over, just in a different location. There are brief injections of the vampires and werewolves, but only very, very brief. The demons are also flat and are left with the impression of them being completely evil. Which we learned in \\"A Darker Crimson\\" was not the case.Overall, I found it a disappointment. I even had to force myself to finish the book, just so I would know what was going on in the next. Hopefully, the next author picks up the strings and delivers something with more action and more well rounded characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved the series---this rape/bondage episode's the weak link","review":"Sorry, rape and bondage themes are never going to be on my favorites list, even if it's for a \\"good cause.\\" This story had some great ideas, but seriously---the victim falling in love with her would-be rapist is just gross."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best \\"Crimson\\" book","review":"I've enjoyed the previous \\"Crimson City\\" books, but this one is not a good one. While I like that the protagonists are unique and not your typical romance hero or heroine, they were a bit stereotypical in their own right. But really my major dislike about this book was that it included a rape scene where the woman eventually enjoyed it. Without giving too much away to the reader who still wishes to read this book, the rape is ignored and turns into a positive plot characteristic. This isn't BDSM or even the old \\"dominant man/submissive woman\\" sex reminiscent of old romances; this is *clearly* a rape scene, named so by the victim. It's the real thing. Enough said."},{"rating":"1","title":"so far the worst in the series","review":"I've liked every book in the series so far leading me to have high expectations of this book as well. Unfortunately I felt this story fell flat. I couldn't get into the main characters at all. They didnt seem to have any substance. Also became somewhat offended by the American slams peppered throughout the book written as thoughts from the main character Xiao Fei. If these are reflections about our culture from the author then I really dont care to help her paycheck by buying another of her books or giving her a second chance to see if she writes anything better.

This is what I was looking for 20 years ago but had to settle for a cassete tape that included musical scores from other films (Kramer v. Kramer, etc.)The only disappointment I have with this version is that there are a few musical \\"segments\\" from the film that are noticably absent. Examples; The scene where, shortly after pulling the sword from the stone, the young Arthur chases after Merlin (into the woods), after Merlin reveals Arthur's lineage. Perceval on the hanging tree. The buildup to the showdown (joust) between Lancelot and Sir Gwayne (Arthur addresses the gathering and Perceval offers to champion the queen).That disppointment aside, this is still, like I said, a very good soundtrack and fans of Boorman's film will also enjoy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I have looked for over 20 years for an Excalibur soundtrack.

It is the least interesting and least useful book of all the required advertising books required in my curriculum.I'm also annoyed at the crappy resale value this book fetches. 17c for a used copy tells you why you shouldn't be subjected to fork out your hard earned cash for this book like I had to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Would you pay for an advertising flyer?","review":"Well, you will if you buy this book!

As the other reviewers have already stated; the writing is over zealous and self promoting. If you can manage to get passed that you will find the ideas presented in this book insulting; the foundation for the promotion of lovemarks is, \\"human beings are powered by emotion, not by reason,\\" which if you have ever seen a skyscraper, flushed a toilet, flipped a switch to turn on a light or used any other product of man's reason you would find this assertion wholly false.Kevin Roberts does not succeed in this book because he treats consumers as mindless kids in a candy store who have no volitional control of their consciousness.

Even better, it ought to come with a market-changing innovation-this book falls extremely short of these baselines. In fact, this book has all the substance of an Ikea coffee table: It looks good on the surface, but underneath it all, it is just cheap filler.The authors of this book are admen, professional hucksters. Somehow, they managed to convince a group of pseudo-intellectuals to publish this drivel. If you want to learn about branding, then read a marketing textbook by Kotler.

Lurie has a smooth, intelligent style, and a refreshing dry wit that sets this book apart from much literary criticism. My only complaint is that I would have preferred a bit more focus on the subversive texts themselves, rather than on the life stories of their authors; but then, I'm not too fond of biographical criticism as a whole. All in all, highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"more books like this please..","review":"Good book for introducing you, and your kids, to the kinds of authors that should be read by both you and your kids. While the book suggests attention to subversive literature (and in many ways it is), it delves in more depth in the lives of the authors, in terms of what shaped them to write their classics, than in the nature of the literature itself. Nevertheless, this remains an important, and terribly interesting, book that will shed light on some classic tales (as well as, perhaps, question some of our basic assumptions about these stories).

The author is constantly quoting from numerous studies and tossing around all kinds of (often superfluous) numbers & percentages. As a textbook it is a complete failure. However since the book covers a number of studies, you would think it might be useful as a reference book. The problem is that reference books should not contain the extreme liberal feminist bias that this author uses to color every page.

I have had my first one for over a year and it has lasted through a Minnesota winter and humid summer. It has survived raccoons, squirrels, and wild turkeys. The turkey and raccoon problems occurred because I had it too close to my deck rail and I didn't have a raccoon baffle on the pole. I have since built my own simple steel pole setup using some angle iron, 1 1/4 & 1 inch steel pipe, and two Droll Yankees curved hooks.I have not had one red or gray squirrel break into the feeder or figure out a way to hang on to the feed holes as some reviewers have stated. I have approximately 20 squirrels hanging around my yard. This feeder is extremely durable, user friendly, and has solved my squirrel problems. That is why I ordered a second one to replace another tube feeder.I highly recommend having a raccoon baffle especially if they are a problem in your area.

According to my father it works great against the squirrels. I recommend it to those that can afford it.

It is easy to load and clean. I hung as directed, far away from branches under shelter. This is my usual spot and I have always had lots of birds.

The reviews appeared to be good and said it was pretty much squirrel proof. Our local squirrels figured it our in less than three minutes. If there is any way a squirrel can reach the feeder from a bush underneath the feeder, they can beat the system. They hang on by putting their front paws in two of the feeding holes and eat out of the third. I've cut my bushes back, but it's amazing how high these squirrels can jump.

Her enthusiasm was so great I ordered it although I was a bit dubious whether it could be \\"that\\" good. It is. I am not musically qualified to rate the technical qualities of the voices, whether they missed any notes, etc. but from a lay perspective this recording is absolutely breathtaking. Deborah Voight in particular bring so much emotion, passion and pacing into the pieces. She caresses each phrase. The recording is riveting and hard to stop listening to.That brings up the potential danger to this CD. I listen to it usually at night in bed and have drifted off to sleep to it many times. Now, sometimes when I am at a live performance of Siegfried, sometimes i will start to drift off. The recording may have started an automatic response! But this is minor in the scheme of things and no reason not to get this superb recording immediately.

Unfortunately, it turns out to be quite a disappointment.Much as I admire Domingo, I must say that he is not very idiomatic for the part of Siegfried, even if he sings with considerable musicianship. The style just isn't right, and there're some audible strain at the top notes.Voigt just hasn't got the stentorian tone for Brunnhilde and Isolde. Yes, she sings quite beautifully, but her top notes, while accurately placed, lack force and power. She doesn't convince the listener that she can be an imperious Valkyrie or an ardent lrish lover.The orchestral accompaniment is good, but not exceptionally so.I would award this recording 2 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"A great disappointment","review":"Though I admire Domingo, I must say that this release is, to me, a big disappointment. Domingo's voice is quite unsuited to Wagnerian music drama, and his effortful, not to say unidiomatic, delivery of both the vocal lines and the text is really not very appealing.I have even more reservations with Voigt, whose wiry tone and generalised singing fail to do any justice to the music of Brunnhilde and Isolde.All in all, a forgettable release."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unsuited to their parts","review":"I can only say that both Placido Domingo and Deborah Voigt are unsuited to the roles of Tristan and Isolde, Siegfried and Brunnhilde, and such unsuitability shows in this recording.

Fates warning were always being compared to Queensryce even back in the day and I never understood why. Is it because both bands have singers that sing in high-pitched tones?

However...1. Although Jim Matheos is a good guitar player, but he is no shred master by a long shot (in the vein of Yngwie, Paul Gilbert, etc.). Actually, IMHO, he's more gifted at songwriting than at playing blinding guitar solos. His solos fit the songs very well, but the word \\"shred\\" never comes to mind for me whatsoever.2. A reviewer also wrote that Ray Alder (whose voice I love) can \\"easily hit notes higher than Halford or Tate.\\" This reviewer must not be a singer; all of the aforementioned singers peak out about where all other great metal vocalists do at the high end when executing those wails/screams - approximately at or between the G and A notes that one would find on the 15th - 17th fret of the high E string on a guitar."},{"rating":"2","title":"DRSAM","review":"Terrific illustrations from 1842!

I recommend using this only as a phrasebook to take with you to Japan, or just to further your learning of Japanese (but you will have to use self-discipline to make yourself study these phrases, since the CD isn't doing it for you).If you want to learn Japanese, I recommend getting the Pimsleur CDs to start with.

The characters are two dimensional/cookie cutters that could be found left on the floors of a choose your own adventure chop shop. The plot had promise, but too many boring character background deviations have pulled away from what seemed interesting - the government's abilities, technologies, and abuses with eavesdropping of any kind. That is sadly a sidenote to a high school level writing exercise. I may be a bit harsh - if I had picked this up out of the blue, it would probably have gotten 3 stars.

You won't find any mention of practicing until you open the box, whereupon all mention of single-player goes away to be replaced with \\"online game\\" and \\"off-line practice\\".Apart from pretending it has a viable single-player mode when it doesn't, it's bug-ridden: freezes up, elements (like the sniper scope) don't work, drive a tank and you can't command it it move while you shoot, because you have to perform each function yourself (you're SUPPOSED to be able to tell the crew \\"go here\\" or \\"do that\\", but it doesn't work).very disappointed.

Almost everyone I have talked with who has gone through a seminary or Bible College survey of Church History course has used this text in some capacity.It is very accurate and surprisingly readable. Cairns does a great job of showing Church History in the context of world history, and the interdependencies of the two. Although a strong Christian world-view is evident, Cairns objectively analyzes various movements and events and does not bless or condemn in wholesale fashion.The purchase price is a bargain for the wealth of information and this is a keeper for the library.

I have used several excellent church histories and in my experience, Cairns is certainly among the best. Contrary to what one reviewer said, Cairns takes neither an overly Calvanistic approach to theological anthropology nor does he appear to prefer any one form of Christianity over another. However, he does go to great lengths to present an unbiased, scholarly view of how the Holy Spirit guided church leaders and the historical developments of the church over time. I strongly recommend this book as an introduction to church history for anyone in church leadership who desires a history of the Christian church that pulls no punches and tells it like it was."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic synopsis!","review":"This book's endurance--it first appeared in 1954--is a testament to its excellence.

It is clear from the beginning that he is a card carrying, five point following Calvinist. Which is great, except that this leads him to do the following: to embarrassingly limit his history of the Christian church and to bash anyone in church history who disagreed with Calvinism in any way. Sadly, Cairns' dislike of anything Catholic that is prevalent throughout the book is almost mean spirited. He also doesn't even devote any print at all to the Orthodox Church.

Ray Adler is in my opinion the best singer out there. He hits highs that other singers would choke on. And the older songs with John Arch the old singer are just as good but in a old school prog metal way. Every song on here is a killer. Whenever I hear this in my car I can't help but speeding and thinking that I entered another world. It's really incredible. Get this CD if you call yourself a progessive metal fan.

This series is AWESOME as well!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disturbing","review":"I love Nora Roberts books and have read them for many years. However, this extremely violent and sexual \\"tale\\" is being told by an old man to a group of children!!!

Why was the audience a group of kids?"},{"rating":"1","title":"What happened to Nora Roberts?","review":"I've read just about every one of her books and was disgusted at the turn she's taken. Instead of real life stories, this ventures off into the truly dark side of fiction and is so unlike her usually uplifting stories. I sent it back and cancelled the other two. I really can't believe she's gone this route - she's a tremendous writer - I just wish she'd stick to real life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"I started to read Nora Roberts 'Morrigan's Cross' which is the first book of 'The Circle Trilogy' and found it to be a very disappointing book. I did not like Nora Roberts's selected style for this book which contained witches, vampires, sorcerers and related Gods of some kind. She lost my ability to concentrate on the story by including too much trash therefore I immediately took all three books to a local used book store and traded them for three other books. I therefore am, as the title of this review indicates, DISAPPOINTED."},{"rating":"1","title":"#1 Fan disappointed","review":"I wonder if Nora let one of her children try their hand at writing. This book was a great disappointment to me. I have most every book she has ever written but this one is not a keeper. The three books in this series could have been condensed into one book. I hope she does not start writing books like this all the time because I just think the story was weak."},{"rating":"1","title":"Drawn Out Obviously With a Trilogy in Mind","review":"I was given all three of the books in this trilogy and started reading the first one eagerly looking forward to getting to know the characters. For me, there was too much needless dialogue throughout all three books. The story could have been told in one book if edited properly. It was simply boring reading through all of the arguments by the main characters. In the first two books, the main female characters were just plain nasty and rude most of the time. I only enjoyed the last book a little because the female lead character actually acted like a woman in love and not like Linda Hamilton in Terminator 2."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intriguing and Exciting","review":"It was hard to understand the reader in the beginning, however, eventually I got used to his strong accent and became immersed in the story. Some of my friends could not take the accent and resorted to reading the book, and then became immersed, however, not everyone can handle this content with plenty of blood and immorality, vampires and such. However, it is a strong novel of the battle of good against evil and the good definitely outweighs the bad for me. I heard all 3 books and hated for them to end. I wish Nora would write a 4th book - I loved it!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Morrigan\\"s Cross","review":"I loved this book.I think the Circle Trilogy will be one of the best trilogies she has ever written, and I have read everything she has published.

I am biting at the bit for the second book to be released.ENJOY"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wizards, Witches, and Vamps .... oh my!!!","review":"I can't believe how negative most people have been on these reviews. I absolutely loved this book. I picked it up at the library but went to the bookstore to buy it (and Dance) as soon as I finished it. I do not normally like contemporary romance fiction, and thus do not usually read Nora Roberts (I like the futuristic In Death series better). However, I picked it up as soon as I saw this was about the ultimate good vs evil battle involving sorcerers, witches, vampires, shape shifters, etc.Granted if you're looking for your everyday run-of-the mill romance novel, this isn't it. But if I wanted \\"everyday\\", I would read the newspaper or watch TV!!!!

I greatly enjoyed it and am looking forward to reading the next two books in the trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a disappointment!","review":"I'm a devoted Nora Roberts fan and have bought and read nearly every thing she writes. If it has her name on it, I only stop to check to make sure I don't already have it before I buy it.I'm rarely disappointed. Her characters, particularly in the trilogies, are well developed and make you want to root for them. Her descriptions are evocative and poetic.But Morrigan's Cross just didn't delight me as most of her books do. The characters were not engaging, the plot was predictable, the prose was so-so.I enjoy her forays into fastasy and sorcery, but maybe it was the vampyre which turned me off.I've had to force myself to continue to read (eventhough I stopped in the middle to re-read Chesapeake Blue!) and I'm still not done. I usually stay up all night to finish a NR book, but it's been nearly a week and I still haven't finished this one.I'm not sure if I'll buy the rest of this trilogy. We'll have to see."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blech.","review":"What an incredibly bad and BORING book. I usually trust Roberts to tell a good story, but this book raised serious doubts for me. These characters are underdeveloped, BORING and I didn't care about any of them at all. \\"End of the world\\" - YAWN. I am not even tempted to buy the rest of the trilogy. And Roberts' habit of big, bloated speeches was bad in the last \\"Red\\" flower books; I'm assuming that no editor's curtailed her because it's just awful here. I just wanted everyone to shut UP with the big, long-winded declarations. And I'm annoyed that the person that, ah, not ends up not being part of the group, is that person. Talk about the final cliche in a book chock full of them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pick one of the other 100+ of hers","review":"I agree with the other reviewers who are criticizing this novel for being shallow and poorly worded in places. The characters seem like they're taken out of a playbook: one isolated sorceror, one sexy earth mama redhead, one overgrown kid off the streets, etc. The plot and setting are nothing special. Furthermore, Nora Roberts seems to have picked up Stephanie Laurens's bad habit of writing sentences that are missing a subject. And does it often; and it's ineffective.Nora Roberts can write better than this. The most recent trilogy--Red Lily, Black Rose, and Blue Dahlia--was far more vividly imagined. I wonder if she churned out this new trilogy in a month or two, skating through an unwanted homework assignment from her publisher to put out a vampire series now that they're so popular."},{"rating":"2","title":"who knew?","review":"This one, and the other two in this trilogy pleasantly surprised me. I had no idea Nora Roberts wrote fantasy or paranormal romance. I'm an avid reader in this genre, and not into straight romance, so I've never picked up any of her books before. These caught my eye, and I'm glad they did. Very nice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant new series!","review":"Another Nora Roberts classic.

Well written but as I said not my cup of tea..I will not purchase the others in the series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big disappointment","review":"Morrigan's Cross was the worst book I've read by Nora Roberts, and having really enjoyed both the 'Born In' trilogy and the 'Gallaghers' trilogy, I expected more. Much more. The plot was rushed and totally unoriginal (think Buffy meets Diana Gabaldon); the dialogue was conventional and cliched; the female protagonist was barely likeable; and the love scenes were forced, incredibly brief, and not at all imaginative. I'm convinced that an aspiring and dreadfully untalented apprentice of Ms. Roberts wrote this book and published it in her name."},{"rating":"1","title":"Morrigan's Cross (Circle Trilogy, Book 1)","review":"I have read pretty much everything Nora Roberts has written, some of it several times over, and I have not been disappointed, until now. I was not even able to get through the book. It is so unlike her previous Trilogies that I'm questioning whether she is the sole author or if she co-wrote it with someone. I was told that it is much more like her J.D. Robb series than her normal Nora Roberts writing. I was so looking forward to a new Trilogy and now, I am very disappointed. Sorry Nora, but this one, in my opinion, is a looser."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Cross to Read","review":"This book was so dismal and dark, it doesnt even matter that Nora Roberts wrote it. I read only 75 pages, skimmed the rest and left it on the plane. This never was my type of reading material but since I usually like Ms. Roberts' books, I bought this in the airport.Some of her fans might enjoy this type of story; I do not. Waiting for \\"Born in Death\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Vampires and time travel - not a good combo for NR","review":"Nora Roberts is a great writer, but this book was terrible. I lost interest after the first few chapters. The story line seemed tired - the chosen few fighting a legion of vampires - and there was little character development. I won't be buying the next two installments."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"I'm not sure what type of book this is - fantasy? vampire? surreal?, but it's definitely one of the worst Roberts' books ever written. Normally her trilogies are romantic and the thread is easy to identify with and follow. But this story asks a lot of the reader - you need to keep track of weird character names and the convoluted and extremely unrealistic plot. I didn't find this book or the characters interesting at all and thought it was very poorly written and planned. When I finished the book I looked at the front pages that list the other Roberts' triologies, and I found myself longing for something more like the Dream In., Chesapeake.., and Born In.. series. My recommendation is to skip this book and trilogy completely."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tried to Like It","review":"I'm a Nora Roberts fan and have read all of her books. I was just not able to get into this book. It's a little too dark and the characters are just not gripping. I had to struggle through, when I normally read her books in a day or two. I doubt I will purchase the second installment. I just don't care enough to do so."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge disappoinment","review":"I am a big Nora Roberts fan, and although I usually read her books in between heavier reads, I always enjoy them. This book was a really big disappointment. As a previous reviewer stated, most of the dialougue was nothing more than arguments between the very boring characters. Nothing in this book was believable or intriguing. I've read all of her books, and this was the first one I almost didn't finish. This read like one of those cheap, romance novels. If I could give it zero stars, I would."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Book 1","review":"This is a good first book in the trilogy, but I hate to break the news but book 2 isn't as good. Let's hope book three sizes up to book 1."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Your Every Day Nora Roberts","review":"This is a surprising and delightful switch from the suspense novels I've come to know from Nora Roberts. This first in a trilogy of fantasy-based drama unfolded oddly at first, but reliquished its humor and suspense early enough to keep it an interesting read. Listening to the tale with an Irish braugh seeping through the audio speakers entranced me to follow through as Warlock Hoyt struggles with love, family (lost & found), and his challenge to find the others that will become part of his circle destined to fight in the good vs. evil that is elementary for fantasy novels.I enjoyed this book and quickly loaded 'Dance of the Gods' as soon as it was done, hooked and anxious to discover more of the war to come and of those who would risk all to fight in it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No escape","review":"Nora Roberts's books are my escape, and usually a blissful one. I love the magic, character development, strong women overcoming obstacles, and romance found in her novels. Morrigan's Cross disappointed me. Vampires are a little over the edge for me, but what made me close the book was the 10-year-old vampire with the protaganist. I spend my days with children who have been abused in every way imaginable, and reading this put me in a bad mood. King was a comic relief, but he got killed. That was when I did something I've never done with a N.R. book - closed it, put it in the closet, and later sold it. I'm not reading any of the others in the trilogy. Instead, I took out the Three Sisters' trilogy and enjoyed myself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stock characters, not engaging, and formulaic plot","review":"I love Nora Roberts, I love paranormals and I love romances. I do not love this book. It's like NR reached in a grab-bag of paranormal creatures for her characters - or charicatures, really. One vampire, one sorcerer, one Wiccan witch, one demon-hunter, one shapeshifter, and one \\"King Arthur\\" like queen. Rinse, stir, repeat. None of the characters engaged my imagination and the story and romance was rushed. NR then mixes up Christianity with Celtic religion for a mash-up of neither. I never thought I'd read a Nora Roberts that I didn't love, let alone one I actively dislike, but this is it. I don't know if it's because it's her entry into more mainstream fantasy, but the book ends up trying for so much but succeding in nothing. Save your money and buy one of her other books or other paranormal or paranormal romance authors (Lilith Saintcrow, Kim Harrison, Charlaine Harris, Carrie Vaughn, Laurell K. Hamilton, Patricia Biggs)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not her best...","review":"I did not like this book. I couldn't even finish it and it was so disappointing because I always love Nora Roberts books.

I gave this book a good shot. I got to over halfway through and we are still basically where the book started. The characters are still talking about fighting the vampires that are going to take over. This is how it started, and over halfway through, this is were we are still at. I still don't know much about Lillith, nothing at all because I'm still reading about \\"uniting an army to fight\\". Alright already, this is just filler preparing you for her other books. Sorry, not me, I'm not biting. I'm putting this one away, I doubt that I'll finish it. Sorry."},{"rating":"1","title":"just boring as hell","review":"I've read nearly every Nora Roberts book out there - several more than once.

Skip this entire series and re-read Nora Robert's Donovan Series (Captivated, Entranced, Charmed & Enchanted).If you read much Nora Roberts, you soon realize that in her zeal to churn out the books, she has stock characters that she recycles from series to series. Some of her series are stronger than others and don't feel you are missing out by skipping this 'trinity.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"Does not enhance the author's reputation","review":"There are good books about time travel, but this is not one of them. Try Jack Finney's TIME AND AGAIN, for example. And there are good books about vampires, but this is not one of them. Anne Rice more or less owns the franchise on the descendants of Dracula. So what is left? Not much, unfortunately. I was prepared to be entertained, but it didn't happen.MORRIGAN'S CROSS is slow and dull and predictable and just does not have the feel of Ms. Roberts' other books. It would be nice to say that this is a worthy effort on her part to do something different, but that wouldn't be accurate.My introduction to this writer was with NORTHERN LIGHTS, and after since reading a couple of dozen other books by Nora Roberts, the first one is still the best. The one here is the least. Still, I keep hoping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bloody Disappointment","review":"Like many, I can hardly wait for a new Nora Roberts and have just about every book she has written. The rest of this trilogy won't be added to the pile. The lush sensuality, the complex characters, the interesting men and the snappy dialog are in short supply here. But there is lots and lots of blood and gore pouring out of nearly every page. The plot has a bunch of people training to fight vampyres--cutesy spelling is hers--and barely repelling them. They announce they must train better and get stronger, and more vampyres come and are repelled. They train some more, and more vampyres do battle, with ever more blood gushing. Then the book just stops. The dark side of the author usually enhances her books, but this time it disgusts and bores. I am in mourning--not for the mob of the slain, but for the fun and excitement we have come to expect."},{"rating":"1","title":"creepy without the demons","review":"Am I the only one who thinks its a little creepy to have the old man tell a story with vivid sexual detail to children? As he was telling the story, I kept seeing him in front of the children he called to listen and it took A LOT away from the story."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different","review":"I'm almost afraid to say it - I really enjoyed this book. Not, it's not her standard fare, nor is it as emotionally charged as, say, her Chesapeake Bay series is or even the Dream series, but it's fun and it's got some good dramatic tension and character development. And, Buffy-esque, it also laughs at itself. This book contains all the wit and humour that I'm used to seeing from her and I'm really interested to see where she takes this cast of characters. In some parts, yes, it's predictable, but Ms. Roberts always has a surprise or two. A good read, but I can see where not all of her fans will be willing to go down this path with her. If you're not into vampires, demons, time travel and other worlds, this might be one you want to pass on. Or, since it's Nora, you may just want to give it a try as she always manages to be entertaining."},{"rating":"1","title":"Morrigan's Cross what a waste","review":"I started this book and kept thinking it would get better...it didn't, in fact I didn't finish it or the series.

I like how she has gone out of her realm and written about Vampires.

Unfortunately, since so many millions of us buy on faith, the trilogy will most undeservedly end up a best-seller unit.

I bought this as part of my research on the Flegg family (ancestors of Margaret (Mauteby) Paston). It is still an interesting read even if you aren't related. You get very involved in their stories. This is not a general overview of life at this time but includes many wonderful tidbits. Some of the letters are rich with humor and love. Many of the stories that come through are suspenseful. Because it is all from documents it can be frustrating at times as some \\"story lines\\" you are following get dropped. In general it is an interesting read.

I would order paper again from Amazon.com, and hope that the delivery service, i.e., UPS or FedEx, would not toss it around too much as to ruin the paper inside.

I print on average 800 to 1000 color/ black & white pages per month and either staple or bind documents together so thickness, ink clarity, and feel are important.The Xerox 4200 line of paper combined with laser technology are by far the best companion tools for serious printing jobs. In addition, buying in bulk has been the best economic choice. Thanks Xerox for a quality product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed!!!!","review":"The quality of the paper is good, but, I was disappointed when I received my order.

The second box arrived in better shape, as it was heavily surrounded in clear box tape. However, the box still looked like it was thrown around. My suspicions were correct, as when I open the second box, 8 of the 10 reams of paper were broken open; and the edges of several sheets were curled. It was not worth my time and effort to send it back again. I learned a lesson and will never order paper or stationary supplies for home delivery again.

It must have been a great place to live back then.

All the songs are Lizzy Borden at it's best. The best songs are American Metal, Flesheater, and Rod Of Iron. The only downfall of this disc is the production isn't very good.(would like to see it remastered) If you're interested in 80's metal you can't go wrong with Lizzy Borden. They were (and are) far superior to other 80's bands.(Motley Crue, Ratt, etc.) Unfortunately, controversial lyrics and image kept them from getting the exposuer they deserved.The version of this disc that I own contains four extra songs, Give Em' The Axe, Kiss Of Death, No Time To Lose, and Long Live Rock N Roll, that easily push the rating up to five stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"Track title list is wrong","review":"This is one of those bands that I got into by listening to their later work, and discovered this little gem not too long ago.

In addition to signature recipes the book presents a very well thought out structured approach to vegetarian gourmet cooking. So not only do you have recipes, but you are given a pretty good idea of what sorts of things you should make in batches on weekends and save. That for me was really the key to being able to make something other than bland vegetarian fare.I've not generally been fond of the Moosewood or Laurel's Kitchen sort of recipes.

Faulkner's symbolic and engaging story of the rise and fall of Thomas Sutpen (representing the rise and fall of the old South) is an absolutely fascinating read. Similar to The Sound and the Fury, the story is summed up in the first chapter, leaving the reader both confused and curious to find out more. I would definitely recommend the re-reading of chapter 1 upon completion of the book to bring it all together. And for those who just want to sit back and dully rea through a book, you may wnat to ignore this one.

But that period was very, very trying.The style is very hard to get into. AA is filled with the run-on sentences that ate New Jersey. Yes, I realize that that was Faulkner's style for this book, but it wasn't a particuarly wise choice to make.The only reason that I am giving it two stars is because the storyline isn't half-bad.

William Faulkner creates, rather, reveals the tragic southern saga of the Sutpen family and how issues of ambition and morality bring about their downfall. Beyond the many thematic offerings of the \\"legend\\" and its telling however, a much larger picture looms. That the traditions of a society founded on shaky ground, by opportunistic ancestors created a people whose entire vision was veiled by the oppresiveness of the caste system and who, when war finally removed the veil, found that they were not the strong, honorable stock they thought they were. Two generations later the ghosts of the old south continue to haunt Quentin Compson who can no more seperate himself from them than his roomate Shreve can understand what it means to have been born in good old Yoknapatawpha County."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Great American Novel","review":"Faulkner's most compelling trait is he doesn't tell a story--he involves the reader in it so the reader, in effect, pieces it together in his mind as he reads it. It's hard work, but hard work is always more rewarding than the slop that passes for much of fiction these days (as well as back then). Faulkner makes you work, and this brilliant story of a doomed Southern family is a brilliant allegory for the entire South. It's about the human condition, and no one explains and explores it better than Faulkner. Read it and you'll understand...."},{"rating":"2","title":"my favourite Faulkner and the Bible","review":"O.K., so this is not exactly easy to read. At the beginning you have to constantly deduce who is narrating. But once you have learnt that the whole story of the Sutpen family is going to be told through a series of interviews between Quentin and several witnesses of the facts related, you can relax and really enjoy it. For me, one of the greatest wonders and sources of joy in this novel was to find the paralelisms between the story of the Sutpen family and that of king David of the Bible. And even though we know what is going to happen with Colonel Sutpen and his offspring (especially the one who stands for Absalom), Faulkner's chilling solution for the conlfict is inevitably amazing. Do I need to add that the paralelism does not only work at the level of the Sutpen family tragedy, but also with the historical setting --the heroic times of the American Civil War in the South?. One of the jewels of universal literature."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely incredible!","review":"Absolutely incredible! The writing structure is extremely difficult along with the shifting narrators, but it is an amazing book in large part because of these challenging aspects.

After all the KISS merchandise that has been put out over the years, a feature film was inevitable, but surprisingly the film works out well. Edward Furlong, James DeBello, Giuseppe Andrews, and Sam Huntington play four raving KISS fans with dreams that they're garage band will someday open for they're idols. In the meantime though, they're getting ready to go see KISS, but Jam's (Huntington) bible thumping mother won't have it, and burns the tickets. What ensues are the kids going on a trip to Detroit to get to the conert, and go through tons of whacked out hijinks and many a joint in the process. It's hard to classify Detroit Rock City as a coming of age movie ..., but the movie works and is very funny without going over the line of absurdity...DVD features are worth noting as well; you get three seperate commentaries, music videos, and some multiple angle features as well. All in all, if you want a fairly good laugh out loud comedy, check out Detroit Rock City."},{"rating":"2","title":"Detroit Rock City","review":"You Don't have to be a Kiss fan to enjoy this film.

I'm 24 years old. I started to listen to them when I was eight years old; my older brother bought me Lick It Up in '83. When I was younger, everybody was shocked that I liked a band \\"past my time\\". I have always loved them and always will, until the day I die. They ARE the best band in the world.

I managed to view the entire film, but I seriously doubt that I'll ever watch it a second time. It reminded me of American Pie a little. I've always had a lot of respect for Kiss, mostly because they were the first band I got into when I was very small in the late seventies. Detroit Rock City wasn't original and the script wasn't great. The movie had some moments here and there, but on the whole it was mostly bland and not very interesting. A disappointing movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"EXTREMELY SILLY","review":"Of course it will be getting great reviews because most of the people who are giving five-star rating are KISS fan who will buy anything they release.

I mean who can't identify with trying to score tickets to your favorite band's sold out show.The problem is they all turn out to be such jerks you end up hoping they get the (...) beat out of them.Not to mention, the portrayal of the Catholic mom and priest is one of the most vicious, mean-spirited, caricatures on film I have ever seen.

Noise to the ears, ugly to the eyes."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY WEAK","review":"This movie has a good general idea surrounding him, but the execution was poor. Of course it is a mere vehicle for KISS to make more money ( Gene Simmons is one of the executive producers ). Even ex-porn star and porn movie producer Ron Jeremy has a small role in the form of a stripper-show producer. The young cast saves the date, giving inspired performances. The rest is to be forgotten.

This is the funniest comedy with KISS and 4 KISS freaks like myself. THIS movie is 5 STARS ALL THE WAY. Cool concert clips of KISS which is the cool highlight of the greatest band in the world. These 4 pot-heads are teenagers that will do anything to see their band (I would do the same).

I rented this not expecting to finish it (not being anything close to a Kiss fan myself) but wound up buying it based on the genuinely funny script and great acting. Sure it's dumb, some of the best comedies are based on a lame premise (i.e. Ferris Bueller skipping school, Spinal Taps' ill fated US tour). The 70's era spoof is loaded with belly laugh material that combine to make this a mindless winner. Sean Penn was quoted on \\"Inside the Actor's Studio\\" that, \\"A film must make you a better person to be worth the time you invest to watch it, it must give something to the audience\\". Clearly this movie doesn't do that and the beauty of it is: who cares...pizza anyone?"},{"rating":"2","title":"gets better every time","review":"the first time i saw this movie i wasnt to impressed but the more i seem to watch it the funnier it seems to get, they picked a good cast for this if you dont like it the first time just give it another try you might be surprised and start to like it"},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't stop laughing","review":"You don't have to be a Kiss fan to love this move (although it sure helps) But of all the comedies of the year, inlcuding Austin Powers 2, Big Daddy, and AMerican Pie, this is the funniest!

There is a great deal of interesting and sometimes powerful poetry in this book. While taste's will differ, I find the earlier and later poems to be the most compelling. A good deal of Roethke's work in the middle of his life is characterized by experimentation with language. The later poems, in particular, combine the more direct approach of Roethke's earlier poems with greater command of language and imagery. Roethke's use of nature imagery in the later poems, often in the context of reflections on his personal life and problems, is outstanding."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vivid Images, Precise Diction","review":"Theodore Roethke is a poet I discovered while reading an anthology in college as a freshman. Writing about a wide continuum of subjects that range from the natural landscape to the convoluted paths of love, Roethke's poems are compelling and still applicable to our time. However, he does have a tendency to be quite abstruse, especially in such poems as \\"Forcing House\\" and \\"O Lull Me, Lull Me.\\" Roethke's persistent examination of nature and its meaning to him, though, is engaging and imaginative; it was my most favorite aspect of his poems. Take, for example, the following lines from \\"The Waking\\" (different than the vilanelle, this one is in The Lost Son): \\"And all the waters/ Of all the streams/ Sang in my veins/ That summer day.\\" The poet's intricate observations, too, make his poetry powerful and a treat for the senses. If you are patient and don't mind reading his poems a few times over to get their jist, Roethke is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A 20th Century Giant!","review":"This collection contains Roethke's \\"Words for the Wind\\", one of the great c20 collections by any poet. Everything Roethke touched came instantly to life. He's ignored for his classicism, so was Ravel. No matter. When it comes time to decide what a poem is, they'll turn to Roethke. The poems from Words for the Wind deal in heart stopping beauty, refinement of form, and the pleasures of a uniquely great mind in play.Dont miss it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye Opening","review":"When I think of poetry I put Roethke right next to all the mastersthat I love: Keats, Shakespeare, Thomas. Roethke separates himself byhis immersion full thrust into our world. For him there is no membrane betweenhis words and nature. Plants, people, provide pictures for his unerringrhythm. While chilling me to the bone, he charms me with wit. When I wishto shake myself out my doldrums I read Roethke. His poems have a courageof a pioneer that goes alone.

It pairs a good, basic biography with loads of images and pulls the reader into Ludwig's world in a way a less well-illustrated biography might not. The images are, in fact, the strongest part of this book since the narrative, though good, isn't what you'd call a comprehensive study of Ludwig's life. If you want depth, you'll have to look elsewhere. But for a better understanding of the king and the time and place in which he lived, this is an excellent beginning."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average","review":"This book didn't help me as much as other AP English Lit books, It's content is sporadic, and not as focused as Barron's or the Princeton Review."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inexpensive paper.","review":"It is good paper.

Not worth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"A romance novel this isn't!","review":"Parker is an exceptionally good author but this is by far his worst work. At the very least, this novel is his pathetic attempt at emulating the day time soap operas and he fails miserably."},{"rating":"2","title":"Is this Robert Parker's autobiography?","review":"This book is one of Robert Parker's few non-Spenser novels, though the protagonist has some sort of family resemblance to the Boston gumshoe. Like the Spenser novels, it's told in first person narrative and makes plenty of literary references. There's a friendship with a black man who boxes (like Hawk), and the girl eats fastidiously (like Susan). Much of the book takes place at Taft University, a fictional college that was the setting of Parker's Spenser novel Playmates.But what's most interesting about this book is that the protagonist describes his experiences as a writer and his work on a doctorate in English literature. At this point the character has less in common with Spenser and more in common with Robert Parker himself. One is left wondering if through this novel, Parker has given his readers more of an autobiographical glimpse of his own life and literary career."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real insight into the thinking of well-known author","review":"If you enjoy the Spenser novels, you will probably enjoy this - although the novel is not about Spenser. The main character wants to win the fair haired maiden at any cost and in that sense is romantic. What is lacking is any real history of the main character that would give him more life. The ending is like a fairy tale. The main reason I read this was to provide insight into the thinking of the author who created Spenser, who in my opinion is a wonderful character. If I hadn't read the Spenser novels and really enjoyed them I doubt I would have read and enjoyed this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Early Parker without Spenser","review":"As a long time Parker fan I found this book to completely different from his usual books.His usage of just 2 characters allows you to get involved in their lives even though the end of the book is somewhat farfetched.Since it is more of a love story than his other writings it has you rooting for the poor guy who gets a Dear John letter when he is in the Army and then has you cheering for him as he is pulling himself from a \\"lost\\" life of drunkeness and despair as he strives to win back his former girl friendI found it an enjoyable book and lets you see another aspect of Parker's writing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice","review":"Nice pleasent smelling, not to oily but oily enough...... ,Absorbed well in to the skin , but washes off easy, would buy again"},{"rating":"1","title":"misleading title","review":"I bought this book thinking the parallels would be helpful, and they might have been if I could have seen any parallel between the 2 texts.

Kind of boring, I kept expecting it to get better but it did not."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is incredibly touching and poignant.","review":"Horseman, Pass By is quite a departure for McMurty, being very different from his \\"Lonesome Dove\\" works. It has more in common with \\"The Last Picture Show\\" than it does any of his other works. It was the basis for the Paul Newman movie, \\"Hud\\", but that movie failed miserably in capturing the essense of this novel. (The best part about the movie is the performance of Brandon de Wilde as Lonny). I've re-read this several times, and it always touches me with each reading. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Horseman pass me by","review":"An outstanding read that accurately describes the way of life for many rural Texans of the mid 50's and 60's. Horseman Pass Me By far surpasses the Hollywood depiction of this great novel in their version \\"Hud\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Maybe McMurtry's best novel","review":"McMurtry's first published novel is maybe his best ever. If you think that Lonesome Dove is classic McMurtry, then you need to read this book. Horseman, Pass By introduced settings, characters, and themes that McMurtry has spent over thirty years defining. The prose is Faulkner dried out on the Texas prarie. The characterization is simple and full. The plot is classic and original. After this book, the reader should see the movie (Hud) and then read about the making of the movie in McMurtry's In a Narrow Grave."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bittersweet","review":"Next to \\"Lonesome Dove\\", \\"Horseman, Pass by\\" is another book by McMurtry I truly enjoyed. Engrossing and poignant, it tells of the growing pains of a teenager in a small town and his need to find his own path in life and make his own decisions. In so doing, he has to face up to his family ties, his responsibilities, his fascination with a character who is less than decent, and ultimately, himself. This quiet, honest, and sensitive coming-of-age novel is a contrast from the dramatic \\"Lonesome Dove\\", but proves to be just as enduring."},{"rating":"2","title":"WILL READ IN ONE SITTING!","review":"Chasing Rubi is extremely powerful with such a unique voice, you can't put it down.

Well done"},{"rating":"2","title":"What a life!!!","review":"I had never heard of Rubirosa until a friend recommended the book. I really enjoyed reading Rubi's memoirs, the FBI documents and the authors take on all the rumors. As I was reading the book, you could almost see the movie in your mind. Wonder why his ex wives and lovers didn't want to comment in the book. Hmmm."},{"rating":"2","title":"A GRIPPING UNTOLD STORY!","review":"Rubirosa was a one-of-a-kind personality, and this book gives us his story in gripping detail. I couldn't put it down. It put me right back into an era of spies, intrigue and sexual conquest of the not-so-long-ago past. In fact, the story of Rubi has great historical and social significance. And, to say the least, it's damned entertaining. If you've ever been fascinated by high-flying, jet-set society, or enjoyed a James Bond movie, you'll love this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute frame boy or girl room","review":"My husband drives a cement mixer and I framed a pic of him and our two sons standing by his truck in this for our 3rd child who is a girl.

I have to say at first it felt weird but after a few minutes I loved it. AND because the top is like rubber coated over the picture it doesn't bother the top of your mouth or your teeth. It's top heavy to feel but you don't notice it after a few minutes. I like it a lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great book from a young talent","review":"This book is really something. I generally am hesitant to spend so much dough on a writer that isn't a sure bet, but after reading her prize-winning title story in a lit mag I had to grab it. God, she's refreshing. Comparable (sort of) to Denis Johnson without the reliance on dope as a plot element. Funny, wry, dark, intelligent.

If you want to hear the origins of folks like Kurt Elling (especially his take on the John Coltrane song on the album Man In The Air), check this out.However, it's a shame that we have to make do with this CD instead of the Bop For Kerouac first take of a few years before this. The combination/interaction/integration of poetry and music are wonderful.

I am somewhat disappointed in this product because the sunflower oil used to prevent sticking during storage gives an initial off taste. Luckily this initial off taste disappears soon after sucking the cherries and then they have a very good flavor. I consume a lot of dried cherries and I will not purchase this product again. Sunkist dried cherries don't have this initial off taste (even though they also contains sunflower oil). It turns out that the cost per pound is not much different when shipping and handling is considered."},{"rating":"1","title":"stale","review":"The cherries are NOT particularly tart, instead are overly sweetened.

They are juicy, tart with the right amount of sweetness. However, there are just so MANY of them that I wish someone else in this house enjoyed dried cherries, too :-) Keep in mind: These dried cherries arrive in one big bag in the shipping box. They are not subdivided into multiple, smaller packages which I would have preferred. Nevertheless, they are a good quality snack. Due to the tartness, I can only eat a few of these at the time. So I think they would be even better used for baking or for including in a trail mix."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious","review":"These cherries are fresh and delicious.

I had been buying dried cherries in the grocery store and paying lots for them.

One thing for sure, they don't hurt anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Delicious!","review":"I was a tad disappointed at first because these cherries are tart, but now I think they are better than the sweet cherries.I really like them, and guests do, too.

They have a lot of sugar added, and they are a little on the sweet side for my taste. I prefer to limit my sugar intake and add sugar to food sparingly, but that's not an option with these cherries.2. These cherries, all four pounds of them, are packaged in a single plastic bag which is not resealable. I would have preferred them to ship in several separate bags, or at least a big resealable bag in order to make storing them more convenient.I ended up repackaging the cherries into several heavy-duty Ziploc bags to store them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Used to be great, now awful!","review":"I've ordered about 2 boxes a month of these cherries over the past few years and up until the last shipment (a few weeks ago), they have been excellent. Now, the latest shipments have lacked the quality that they once had. They are now smaller and the taste has changed for the worse.

That's a sharp increase of $7.37 in 3 months, which is a price increase of nearly $2.00 per lb. - and when you consider that this product is 61% sugar, that's quite a price hike.At this price, Traverse Bay Dried Cherries costs MORE PER LB. than the Trader Joe brand of Montmorency dried Sour Cherries which are delicious and come in smaller bags. The whole point of buying bulk 4 lbs. is that you get a price break over buying smaller bags in grocery stores. Not anymore.I'm gonna go to Trader Joe instead and buy their excellent dried sour cherries which are not as oily , and have a nice tartness.***UPDATE - Aug. 17, 2012 I just bought from Trader Joe their Tart Montmorency Cherries 8 oz. bag for $4.29 yummy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"2.5 pounds of sugar","review":"Just checked the Travis Bay web site.Every 100 grams of product contains 61 grams of sugar.That means that you are getting two and a half pounds of sugar in each four pound box.They carry unsweetened cherries at their web site."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice sweet but not too sweet dried cherries","review":"I have been buying these for the past few years when I catch them on sale.

Hmmm, that works out to 50 knots, not too fast for a 737! And from there, the entire movie went downhill.

But I think most people will hate it. (Note: I have nothing against violence in films, and I liked the Kill Bill movies.) The main problem here is that almost every character in this film is utterly unlikable, and terrible things happen to the two characters who are likeable. But even that wouldn't be so bad, if the film had a message.Dustin Hoffman's character is a whiney, wimpy, and mean spirited person who, when he finally decides to act, he does so for all of the wrong reasons & defends the wrong person.

Therefore, I bought the original on line at Amazon for 11.99 because I could not find any place that still had it for rent. I have to tell you that I was NOT please with this version at ALL! This version is NO way better than the Remake. It was just BAD all the way around. This was obviously a \\"pay-check\\" movie for Dustin Hoffman.The only good thing about this version is that the Blu Ray is outstanding to say that the movie is about 40 yrs old.

Whoa! Saw all three when I was 17 and all made a great impression. STRAW DOGS was -- and remains -- a distincly disturbing film. To what lengths will a man go to defend his home and family? This is a longer version than what actually appeared on movie screens in 1971. This has lost none of it's power. Dustin Hoffmann as a nerdy mathematician who goes to live in his English wife (Susan George) village. The locals see him as a weakling and a former flame rapes his wife. Hoffmann reaches the point where a line cannot be crossed. Despite everything, he will not allow a suspected child molester (David Warner) be taken and goes to extremes to defend his home. You'll never look at a bear trap the same ever again. On a sad note ... this is being remade and set in the deep south.

There is a fairly grpahic \\"sort-of rape\\" which is never brought up between the husband and wife after it happens. David Warner plays a version of Frankenstein monster that brings everything to a head when the drooling thugs converge on the Hoffman/George house.

Shaky camerawork and the dimly lit foggy environments don't make the film any easier to watch.

The old VHS tapes of this film were awful.I have to admit: watching Susan George is one of the big enjoyments of this movie. She is hot! In reality, it's doubtful someone like her would marry a nerd like the character played by Dustin Hoffman, although that \\"nerd\\" comes out of his shell in the suspense-filled last half hour.This is one of those early \`70 films that broke ground and shocked a lot of people.

Hoffman's performance especially towards the end of the film is amazing and is this film's only redeming quality in my opinion.

It just seemed a very slow and dull movie. Even when there is action, it's kind of boring. When all the men attack the house, Dustin Hoffman sets up many traps and it's pretty much just a 1970's Home Alone.

Little dark squares seem to pop up all over the screen. Also there seems to have been a problem whenever there was an outdoor shot that had fog in it (which is the entire climax).

This film will explore that for you also .It is perhaps a film to watch when you are angry with the world .

Although the system worked at times, it was extremely unreliable by giving false alerts or no alert at times when that alert would be needed the most. Although the price was very reasonable, I feel that the the dangerous assumptions of reliability by the concerned adult for this product , could lead to a tragic situation if the product failed to alert that guardian or parent at the most critial time.

The late great Ruben Gonzalez was the piano player and musical arranger along with director Enrique Jorrin on these sessions. The flute player was the also unforgettable great Miguel O'Farrill. Miguel joined Enrique Jorrin's orchestra from Orquesta Almendra in May of 1954, when the orchestra was created after Jorrin left Orquesta America. In my opinion, blockbuster hits like Rosendo Ruiz, Jr.s \\"Hasta Mañana Vida Mia\\", recorded by Jorrin in 1975, should've been included, but this compilation is still unique and has a good sound. A must have for Cuban music collectors. Unfortunately Enrique Jorrin died an untimely death on December of 1987 and was it not for that, he still would've given us yet more excellent music as his talents as a violin virtuoso, composer and director were infinite."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eerie flute music that nips at your heels.","review":"When I read about this CD in a massage therapy supply catalog I was anxious to order it for my office.

The results are sophistic and at time sophomoric.Missing also are some famous contributions to the field, such as Sartre's What is Literature? a book which raises some serious problems for literature. Also, the work of John M. Ellis.If you can afford it, buy all four books.

Thats a bit low."},{"rating":"1","title":"New male sexuality? I think not.","review":"The title of this book is misleading. to call it the new male sexuality is quite the statement and one would thinkit encompasses all forms of male sexuality. This is not the case. I totally agree with writing a book concerning straight male sexuality but that should have been a subtitle to the book. The doc chooses to simply ignore bi and gay men as if they didn't exist. This is not the new male sexuality. Male sexuality is much more then five to eight minutes in the missionary position. Straight couples these days are experimenting with new ideas and techniques. The penis is only one component to the overall male sexual make up. there are other areas to be explored as well. If you want the straight nuts and bolts I guess this book will do but if yu are an adventurous male, look elsewhere."},{"rating":"1","title":"ho-hum...more of the same","review":"In a phrase, this book is dangerously disingenuous, painfullydisregarding honorable and edifying moral imperatives, venereal diseaseaware-conservatism and prudent common sense. In some places the book is just flat wrong. The fact is, now, in the age of a mutating incurable viruses and pandemic VD, \\"If-it-feels-good-do-it\\" and other forms of 60's self-expression are dangerously misplaced.

Zilbergeld's book was great for general practices and will probably be a great resource for sexual problems later in life, but his tone treats feminism as something males are still learning to accept. In general, there is too much about overcoming men's guilt that women should enjoy sex, too, (performance issues) and not enough about creating better sex by appreciating it for oneself and being responsive to one's partner. In general, women's books like Because It Feels Good by Debby Herbenick strike a more emotionally stable and exploratory balance which fits where I am in life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Straightforward and useful compendium of ideas","review":"This book is unmatched in its straightforwardness, casual tone, and careful mix of do-at-home exercises and author's ideas.

Right from the beginning I loved this book and wanted to get a note to Mr. Tolkien asking that he finish another novel asap. It's suspenseful, and the story line and characters are well developed. The author takes the reader alternately from court scenes, to the murder scene and to past and present events in the characters' personal lives weaving together a story that kept me at the edge of my seat.I was leary about buying the audiobook because it is read by the author and I've been disappointed more than once when I've bought books read by their authors. I was pleasantly surprisedto find he has an enjoyable reading voice and accent.I highly recommend \\"Final Witness\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"legal thriller with a difference","review":"I have to admit that the main reason I picked up this book to read was the last name of the author...and an interesting escape route by the author's statement cautioning against any comparison with his famous grandfather....This novel is probably one of the better written legal thrillers with not as much emphasis on court room dramatics and unrealistic plot twists. The story is well-written - few characters (though the depth of character portrayal leaves much room for improvement) seen in the context of a murder..in different angles...legal, romance, family relations, and emotions...The story at times seems to be very predictable...but the author manages to sustain a high level of interest throughout the book. A worthy first effort by an author who has to live up to huge expectations imposed by his surname. Readers trying to find another Grisham will be disappointed...Simon gives uses the murder story as the canvas to bring to light some complex human interactions..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dry and pedestrian","review":"Simon Tolkien might be a grandson of the famous author, but he didn't inherit much of his immense talent. This legal thriller is a pretty dry and pedestrian affair. It's cardboard characters, and contrived plot are matched with longwinded dialogue and luckluster ending. Good courtroom drama can bring oodles of suspense, but the bad and boring one can be nothing short of torture. Mr. Tolkin bemoans the trials and tribulations of an author who is related to a famous writer. My impression is that well known last name is the only reason that this book was published at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad my last name isn't Shakespeare","review":"There is absolutely no way Mr. Tolkien could have gotten this crap published if he had a different last name. Gramps was able to create rich colorful characters who happened to be elves and hobbits without, presumably, ever meeting one. His grandson writes like he has never met a human being. People simply don't act like the characters in this book do. All creaky chess-piece moves are simply to propel the plot weakly along, and never have the ring of truth.

Broken Rhythms proves you need only expect something great and you will not be disappointed. The music is both very Indian and very contemporary without falling into the genre of Bollywood or Bhangra. And the fact that it is both distinctly Indian and contemporary is what I particularly like about the CD. For often times Gurtu collaborates with other internationally renowned artists at the risk of letting his work fall into the realm of \\"world\\" music. This is the CD to change that perception. Here, tabla, sitar and traditional Indian folk instruments are deftly arranged with contemporary percussion, bass and guitar. The vocals add variety and character to the music without distracting from the hot percussive rhythms of which Gurtu is the master."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst software ever","review":"I tried to install this software 6 times.

Out of desperation to start with SOME sort of design plan, I tried to load one of their floor plans (they only have 20 plans to select from by the way-- very dissappointing), the software wouldn't load it because \\"it could not read image.\\" I can't believe that the software wouldn't even load their own designs. Finally, I tried to draw my own plan from scratch and the whole screen started flashing/flipping out before I could get the lot lines drawn. Too bad.

Although Mr. Clark appears to be knowledgeable about the content, he and his editor were very careless about the development of many of the lessons. Topics do no flow in a logical progression. References are made to tools or techniques that have not been covered in earlier lessons. References to tools are not easy to follow and are not supported through repetition or consistent visual clues. Several demonstrations are made without file references which makes it very difficult for the reader to follow along. Some files are in the wrong folders, some are missing and others are defective. There is a great deal of useful information in the book, but it was obviously rushed to press before it was ready for publication."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just a brief introduction to PhotoShop","review":"The book is very good as a brief introduction to PhotoShop, however if you are seriously involved into graphic design, you will need a lot more information.

Well written in easy to understand English, the author provides a step by step guide to Photoshop in tutorial form for the reader to work through at their own pace, from introducing the PS environment to using special effects. On the downside, the colour management sections are a little confusing however, and in some cases totally misleading, so beware chapters 7 & 16."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"Since I bead and find the process very meditative, this book sounded like an excellent choice.

While his \\"Types ...\\" book is a model of clear exposition, this book reads like a set of notes jotted down on the back on an envelope. The extensive bibliographic sections are more than fifteen years out of date. Much of the material referenced is no longer in print, and recent developments are, of course, not mentioned. Those seeking a very gentle introduction to category theory would do better with the book by Lawvere and Schanuel, who cover more of category theory than Pierce. Mathematically mature computer science readers will find everything they need to know about the subject in Mac Lane's book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Good Read","review":"This book is not exactly what I would call easy going. I've managed to get through half of it in 7 months. However, I can say, with absolute confidence, that if you do the problems you will learn.Most everything I've seen on category theory is a confusing mixture of different notations with seemingly identical meanings (but in fact the meanings are totally different). This book is no exception. Often, I have resorted to IRC to sort things out when some notation is simply impenetrable to me. My mathematical training stopped at complex calculus, so this may not apply to you if you've had abstract algebra or something a little more 'meta'.There seems to be one typographical error, but I am not sure. In the example on the adjunction between products and exponentiation, the right adjoint is listed as \\"(_)^A x A\\" but in the diagrams it ends up as \\"(_)^A\\".

Anyone alive will identify with the lyrics. Yes, some complain the idea of climbing mountains is plagiarised, but my answer to that is that it is an idea integral to human understanding and therefore public property; progress and overcoming adversity are universal principles.

The crisp production makes it sound as if these tunes were laid down last week, not two decades ago.As far as the album goes, it's a great thrash disk, that really captures the metal genre at it's highpoint. Unlike today's metal, bands like \\"Flotsam and Jetsam\\" didn't sacrifice things like Lyrics, melodies, bass lines and so much more that seems to be missing from today's metal scene. Sure, they brought the heavy, but it was still accessable. Give a listen to the titular track, and you'll agree that these guys had talent, and made the most of their debut disk. I'm still amazed \\"Flotsam & Jetsam\\" were never able to reach the heights of fellow thrashers \\"Slayer\\" (I guess losing your key songwriter and bassist didn't help), but if you are a fan of thrash, you owe it to yourself to pick this disk up."},{"rating":"1","title":"Y'know, Maybe Jason Newsted had his reasons...","review":"Look, as much as it pains me to do this, I must admit that Doomsday isn't very good. I'm a huge fan of later Flotsam, and I was shocked at how pointless this album is. To be fair, you can see that F&J have potential. The guitar is quite good, if a little too aimless in places. The weaknesses include the Bass, or lack thereof. I mean you can't really even hear it most of the time. Also, Eric A.K.'s voice at this point can only be described as millions of tiny rodents nibbling on my skull. Believe me, I love good thrash, and some of this is good, but WAY too much of it is not. The songs seem to never end, and the one time I tried to sit through the whole album, I was so bored I had to turn it off most of the way through Der Feuhrer.

By the way, it's a lot of fun, but nobody will believe you if you tell them about it the next day (as I'm sure most of you reading this probably won't).

The author explains variations in strategy since the Indian Wars during the colonial period until the Gulf War. He uses common language, so that many people may have access to all information provided.

Reader of this book may need a basic background of knowledge in Eastern philosophy and modern scientific theories.

I took one car over and had the codes checked, and it came back as a \\"pressure\\" error for the tank, which is indicative of not putting the cap on tight. I didn't even bother having the other car's codes cleared. I used both caps until we moved out of that neighborhood, then I put the factory caps back on and had the codes cleared. I never had a check engine light come back on. These caps, while locking as designed, did not \\"fit\\" properly and allowed for gasoline vapors (or whatever) to escape.

He leads you back to pictures that you remember and then to God's presence which is where the real healing takes place. Gardner deals with 7 core obstacles: fear, rejection, worthlessness, shame, insecurity, defilement, and hopelessness. I also have the journal that he put together that takes you through a process that deals with these 7 core obstacles using scripture meditation. It's also a powerful resource that can be used alongside this book. I happened to meet the author recently and I was impressed with his sincerity and authenticity.

However, after being outside in below freezing conditions for more than 10 minutes, my hands were so cold my fingers were numb. The rubber palm grip became hard and frozen and my hands felt so cold like air was going right through the gloves. So, I am back to bigger bulkier gloves just to stay warm outside.

I didn't read any reviews before I purchased my GL-2, having used Canon SLR cameras and lenses since 1993. HAVE I LEARNED MY LESSON! Just look in my wallet..not much left in there. I love my GL-2, but there are better cameras out there for the money. This model has several known defects that Canon chooses to ignore (only ten tapes through since the cassette drive was replaced the last time).

The battery life of the PD-150 was incredibly longer than that of the Canon (even using the extended-life aftermarket batteries for the GL2). It felt strong, was only a bit bigger, and does DVCAM.

Then the infamous \\"Remove Cassette\\" error hit me: the rewind function no longer works and prompts \\"Remove Cassette\\" or \\"Eject\\" messages.I had a Canon ZR25MC, it failed exactly the same way a couple years ago: it refused to rewind tape and even chewed up a few tapes. Instead of paying a few hundred dollars to repair a relative cheap camcorder, I decided to upgrade to a GL2, thinking that Canon must be aware of this problem and had fixed it. Silly me.This problem is apparently not limited to GL2 and ZR models. A simple goole search will reveal that it happened to many Canon camcorders, including GL2, XM2, and ZR, Elura, MV models for the last few years.I will stay away from Canon for my next camcorder."},{"rating":"1","title":"Error messages","review":"I bought this over the Sony and I regret it. I get a tape eject error every time I try to rewind. I can only rewind at 10 second intervals before I get an error message to eject the tape and do the same thing over again. That's a long time to rewind a 60 minute tape. Many Canon users are having this problem and the only way they address the problem which is clearly a mechanical problem is to charge a ridiculous price to send it off to be repaired. Canon needs to own up to this problem and have a recall on the item. I will never buy Canon again after they have turned a blind eye to a serious problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"Decent Camcorder.....But I still regret it","review":"My primary camera is a Sony HDR-FX1.I bought the GL-2 as a second unit for multiple camera angles at sporting events.The GL-2 is a respectable camera but in my opinion the video image doesn't even come close to the Sony.The price and rebate offer was the greatest incentive in my purchase of this camera.However, beware of the rebate offer.I sent all the documents in strict compliance with the terms of the rebate only to have it rejected.The rebate facilitator claimed I did not include the UPC code.If I had it to do over, I would dig deeper into my wallet and buy a second Sony."},{"rating":"1","title":"flaws in ths camcorder","review":"There are few flaws with this camcorder.

The picture is really great when the camera is new. I use a VCR to import video for editing. After about 20 hours of use I can no longer use the vcr. I must use the camera to import video. I have had both cameras fixed twice for $240 dollars each time. After 5 months one went bad again. I went back to Canon and they have now raised the price to $400 for the same repair.They claim parts are hard to get. This is a current model! I have sworn off Sony, now it's Canon's turn. By the way the problem is caused by the same issue as the eject message, The tape transport."},{"rating":"1","title":"Add an extra thousand dollars to the cost","review":"This camera is SPECTACULAR!!!! For about a year or two.Then the system tape rejection errors start (do your research). Once this happens it's to the canon repair shop you must go where they are currently charging $516 for the parts plus $400 for the labor plus taxes and shipping etc. I am now throwing my GL2 in the trash and saving up to buy a new one. Canon's repair costs are outrageous - especially when this problem has been complained about for YEARS. A Canon rep even told me to never use the camera to play or offload videos (why advertise it as a feature if its such a bad idea?). He advised that you should buy a cheaper video camera to do those types of tasks. Good advise.... but even if you do... remember to add that cost to the purchase price of the GL2- Disgruntled."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too many GL2's with \\"Remove The Cassette\\" problem.","review":"I bought a GL2 because I had used the GL1 and I liked it. The GL2 was just past the warranty and I kept getting the error message on the screen that said \\"Remove The Cassette\\" I paid almost $250.00 for the repair facility to replace the tape transport system which they said was bent. No camera in the world gets better treatment than this one believe me, $2,200 is a lot of money to me. Now the camera is doing the same thing again after less than 6 hours of use. I would strongly suggest doing some searches to see just how many people are having this problem. Mine is anything but an isolated incident. Go to google or dogpile and do a search under gl2 remove the cassette or go to camcorderinfo.com and read the many complaints about this problem in the Canon forum area."},{"rating":"1","title":"You'll be sorrrrrrryyy!","review":"The camera has a design flaw and Canon won't admit it.

I'm getting pretty good at using manual settings to get rich colors and high quality shots. But lately, as I watch the video from the last two projects I am noticing a couple of dead pixels, tiny white spots that are always there. They are especially noticeable when you zoom in on someone's face. So on the next project I borrowed a GL2 from my friend to avoid having this flaw in my shots, but his camera is about the same age and it also has this problem. I called Canon to see what it might be, and it turns out that it is something wrong with the CCD and prism system. The Part is $500.00 and the labor starts at $400.00. In other words, its is not worth fixing. So I consider the GL2 a throw away piece of junk after about a year and a half."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dinosaur!","review":"Why is this camera still on the market?? It isn't even HD.

Duke's piano is barely audible. The bass fiddle sounds loud enough and the trumpet, clarinet and trombone, and Luis's voice also. With Duke Ellington on the cover with Luis Armstrong I thought he would get equal share of the sound. The music is ok, but sleepy. I have literally fallen asleep listening to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"If I could give this cd more than 5 stars I would.

Musically, it appears to be more 'sophisticated' (I mean better produced) than their earlier album, \\"Eye for an eye\\", but don't get me wrong, \\"Animosity\\" is still a brutal one without a single compromission.

Then there's \\"I Beleive\\" which raises the question: Are we alone? Then there's RAGE. Almighty headbangin' classic! On the Run is next, full of 80's metal goodness IN THE NIGHT! The next song is Twisted Little Sister (No connection to the band). Good ol' perverted song. Then, my favorite song off the album, Living For The NIGHT. Just a great song because it contains the word NIGHT in it. Then there's Scream Murder. Fine horro song with a gallopying rythym in the NIGHT! Then, the great ballad, Out On The Streets.

Then, my car was stolen and the CD was in it, so I bought it again. The guitar work is outstandnig and very unique. The drums are cannons and the bass player holds it down. The vocals are awesome as well and fit the band perfectly. So many bands cop different things off other bands, but Savatage has their own style and it's a shame that the guitar player passed away at such an early age in such a tragic way.

I can relate.I'm a huge Harrison fan and love Sundog, Farmer, and Legends of the Fall the best. I just don't get much enjoyment out of is name dropping and arrogant attitude. He mentions his wife and family rarely and there's just a couple references about his writing and approach.

Bad script, bad acting, bad direction, bad camera work, bad lighting, bad sound and bad special effects. The lead actor is a minor South African star but can't bring it off. Watching the DVD becomes more of a game of spotting anything they did right: the girl who plays Quatermain's servant is strikingly beautiful and regal, they added in some minor background effects approaching the \\"Temple of Skulls\\" which were OK, they had some period authentic African natives go topless. Ended up being boring and not fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Slow, Plodding, But Respectful and Beautiful","review":"\\"Allan Quatermain and the Temple of Skulls\\" is slow in all respects. It is has the feel of a historical documentary. The finale is a bit of an anti-climax and lacks a big-budget punch.However, the scenery is filmed on or near the locations mentioned in the H. Rider Haggard book. The tribesmen (if that is not an offensive term) are real South Africans who live in a village that caters to tourists. The spoken non-English language is apparently genuine and not some Hollywood mumbo-jumbo. The \\"Making of\\" and other features, while short, almost make this a two-star movie.Viewed from a \\"we-have-two-weeks-to-make-a-movie\\" perspective, the movie works.

Horrible acting, horrible follow through on characters, horrible segues between scenes and on and on.There is a lot of walking. They don't drive when they can, they walk. They jump off a train- to walk. They don't run after the bad man who has kidnapped the pretty girl- they walk. They are even walking when the cave is falling down on them and they may day.The music is good and it swells when it should, indicates danger when it should, and shows a nice light happy feeling at the end. Unfortunately, dramatic, swelling, suspenseful music will not make for a suspenseful moment if the characters don't act suitably scared, brave and yet with trepidation.This movie left a lot to be desired.

As I certainly was. I dont think its as dreadful as the rest of the reviews on here. I did enjoy it. Its a very modest adaptation and does contain a few twists on the original concept that I, surprisingly, didn't mind. Its budget is certainly modest. I am shocked that The Asylum would fit the bill to film in Africa and I dont think it was even necessary. Thats money that might have gone into some better sets or more action.

And how heavily English his voice sounded? Did anybody comment then? I don't think so.Secondly, at least give these boys a chance. Obviously somebody likes them if they are getting airplay on the radio.This is a solid album, I have listened and listened and I can't get tired of it. Mr Brightside for example has formed a pimple on my psyche and I don't think I want it to go away. Find the acoustic version of that song, and you'll see that regardless of how Brandon sounds on the album he CAN really sing. It's not just some quick dubbing.Please, buy this album. You won't be sorry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthy of a hot fuss!","review":"I heard 'Somebody Told Me' on the radio once and had to know who it was. I did my homework and eagerly waited for the Killers to release their first album, Hot Fuss. A few days before it came out I had the pleasure of seeing them live, and was almost tempted to order the import from Britain (it was released earlier). I managed to wait it out, and thankfully I was not disapointed. This is a great album. All the songs are full of energy, even the slower tracks like 'All These Things..' really show the amount of work the band puts into its music. There's lots of great synth work along with some serious lyrical talent on songs like 'Mr. Brightside.' Basically, if you like disco punk or art punk or whatever this genre is named, you will like the Killers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring","review":"Their songs are 1 chord. The vocals are 1 note.

Maybe they are not breaking new ground here, and their influences can be heard, but it still works.They are combination of The Cure, Depeche Mode and even U-2 (as you can hear on Midnight Show ) with a bit more of a rock leaning than some of the 80s bands such as The Cure, with songs that are very well done.The first time I listened to the CD I was able to listen to it all and it kept me listening to the entire record with solid songs. If you like pop/rock/synth blends you will like the."},{"rating":"2","title":"smile like you mean it","review":"There are 3 great songs on this album. The rest are not bad (mostly filler) but I would absolutely buy this for \\"somebody told me,\\" \\"mr. brightside,\\" and especially \\"smile like you mean it.\\" The synth pop rock of the last song reminds me of the 80's and i must admit that i can put the song on repeat and fall asleep to it and then listen to it for hours the next day and then again in my car if i go somewhere. the songs are very simple. . . they write one verse and a hook and repeat -- few artists have the production to get away with that sort of thing.I also appreciate the gospel choir in \\"all these things that i've done.\\" It's the kinda thing you hear in the Kanye West tracks that aren't singles. Not as much to the liking of mainstream opinion but good music nonetheless."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Debut","review":"The Killers stand out to me as one of the best new bands around with this \\"turn it up\\" debut. The opening tracks will have you jamming without even realizing it. The infectious \\"Mr. Brightside\\" isn't quite as good to me now that it's getting so much radio play, but the song is definitely worthy of the airtime. Every song is a good one--this CD has been a part of my regular rotation since I bought it 2 months ago. My only complaint is that the album mellows out as it progresses and the later tracks aren't quite as \\"rock and roll\\", though definitely still good. Absolutely worth buying--I can't wait for the next one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Debut","review":"The Killers are one of the new era of rock bands (Franz Ferdinand, Snow Patrol, Muse, Libertines, The Zutons) that are taking over the music industry by storm and replacing the all that crap Rap and Pop we have to listen to now.When I first heard them I mistook them for a British band due to the leader singer having a strong British Accent.As a strong Oasis fan I have to say, they are not as good as Oasis in their Hayday( Whats the story morning glory, time), but their showing signs of the same vigour and style of music that Oasis once had.Overall I have to say the album's not bad. The first 5 songs are really good, but apart from \\"On Top\\" the others fail to impress. However I have to say that it is an Album worth buying, and I hope they keep producing music as good in the future and one day they might eclipse Oasis in the music industry (Highly Unlikely)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"I found the Killers yesterday, before which I had only heard \\"Mr. Brightside\\" and \\"Somebody Told Me\\" on the radio. They were ok, but not my favorite songs. Yesterday I got my hands on one of their CDs and have been listening to it pretty much nonstop since then. I have changed my mind. Their music is AMAZING. For those people who have reviewed after only listening to the two songs of theirs played on the radio, you are missing out--you can't judge this band by two of their most-pop-like songs; you need to listen to all of it before judging it. My personal favorites are \\"Andy, You're a Star\\" and \\"Jenny Was a Friend of Mine.\\"If you haven't heard the Killers, I strongly, strongly recommend that you get your hands on the CD--and fast."},{"rating":"2","title":"---> 'Smile like you mean it' & Check this Out <---","review":"The Killers, are a 'break-out' band, coming out in 2004.The band has riveted to success with the brilliant hitsof 'Somebody told Me' and the newest 'Mr. Brightside'.This band,from Nevada, has catchy songs, that just stay insideyou're head,for better or for worse.

Some of the songs - like the first Single \\"Somebody Told Me\\" - have what seems like infinite replayability. The first half of the album is like that. From there, though, The Killers falter - like they used up all their A material on the first few tracks and REALLY wished that they were releasing on vinel, so at least people would know the rest was their \\"B side\\".All in all though, the album is worth a listen. I would suggest you buy the tracks you like on iTunes - $10 isn't worth four or five good songs."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too experimental for me","review":"The first I'd heard of The Killers (like most people's first experience with them) was \\"Somebody Told Me\\". I absolutely loved this song. Then along came \\"Mr. Brightside\\"; another good song. So, I took a chance figuring that the rest of the CD would sound similar. I was very wrong. Their sound leans more toward the synthesizer than the guitar. The two songs I previously mentioned are really the only two which have the guitar-driven melody and catchy chorus. Most of the songs seem to plod along. I kept saying to myself \\"is this song over yet?\\" If you like Franz Ferdinand, then you will probably like this CD. I was expecting something more along the lines of The Used. As for me, I'll be pawning my copy of this album (after I burn the two songs I like)."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pretty good debut album","review":"The Killers debut album \\"Hot Fuss\\" is not perfect, but fuss is something that it definitely could gain. The songs have the perfect mix of punk and new wave, a movement in desparate need of return. \\"Somebody Told Me\\" is the popular single from the album, and it's punk/new wave influence is pretty clear just in the lyrics (\\"Somebody Told Me, You had a girlfriend, it looked like a boyfriend\\"), a lot like the Clash. The other songs are in the same mold and cut. If there was just a little bit more variety, or a few more strong cuts, this would have gotten five stars. Still, not a bad debut, and a four star album that is worth the price of admission to check out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Will Get You Moving","review":"there are a lot of people out there who feel The Killers aren't true \\"indie rock.\\" True, they may sound pretty polished, but this album is great whatever you consider it! I lived in a cave until December of 2004 when I was told about \\"Somebody Told Me.\\" I seriously swear I was the last person in the country to hear it! However, going off the recommendations I just decided to buy the cd. Excellent idea! It's a good mix of mellow and music to get you pumped up. and if you are going out and need a little juice to get you ready, I highly recommend \\"Midnight Show.\\" Total high energy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST ALBUMS THUS FAR","review":"I'm not a big rock fan, as a matter of fact, I prefer Rap like 50 cent and Mobb Deep. I only started listening to Rock a few years ago when I heard Coldplay's \\"Clocks.\\" After that I felt in love with this sort of New Wave style of rock; Coldplay, The Postal Service, and The Killers are on the top of my list. The Killers did a great job with this album, most of the songs are those type of songs that could be a sitcom's theme song, if you know what I mean. My favorite is \\"Smile Like You Mean It\\"; it has a slow start but then the drums kick in, with a great chorus. Another good one is \\"On Top,\\" as it has sort of a techno-rock vibe to it.Overall, I recommend this album to anyone who likes great music, regardless of what you're into."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous","review":"After seeing Somebody Told Me, I knew I was curious about this band that called themselves The Killers. It was a wonderful song, but I hoped I wouldn't buy the record just to find that song their \\"one hit wonder\\"-esque track. I didn't. The Killers are a breath of fresh air from everything else out there, and their CD has gotten me excited about music again. I recommend wholeheartedly that you give this band a chance and I urge you to look for their b-side tracks online and give them a listen as well. Some of these tracks have a different flavor then the album, but all are beautiful. Some especially show off Brandon Flowers' wonderful voice, and these songs should help you either a) decide if you would like the album or b) help tide you over until the next album arrives."},{"rating":"2","title":"See what all the Hot Fuss is about!","review":"I'ld just like to say that this is not a bad little rock album, you can hear influences from The Pixies,The Cure, Bowie, Placebo, Suede, even U2 on occasion, with numerous other influences all through it. They wear these influences on their sleeves, that is for sure, but this album is a good little production all the same. The songs are quite good, and it should be noted that there is not many 'fillers' on the album at all, so you get your money's worth with this one.The second or third playing really gets this album in its groove, and this album became a mainstay in my car stereo for several months after I first purchased it.The Killers have made an excellent debut, and this album has turned out to be one of the best rock releases during the past year. I hope they can keep it up with subsequent works, and if this album is anything to go by the next one will be great as well.Check it out for yourself to see what all the fuss is about!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Have for Any CD Collection","review":"This Band and CD is an oasis in the barren desert that has become the current musical landscape.

The Killers may not have the sense of importance of Interpol (who actually steal quite liberally from Joy Division), and sure, they appear to be complete musical kleptomaniacs but in a sense it does not matter if the ideas are put together to create a new whole. So whilst the band wears its influences on it's collective sleeve there is no denying the rush of sheer, grin causing pleasure I experienced on hearing \\"Mr. Brightside\\" or \\"Jenny\\". The band does seem to run out of ideas by the end of the album though which is a shame. At least 5 of the tracks however are near perfect pop music, in all it's cheap, disposable glory, and although this album may not stay on your player for years to come I've found it to be the perfect summer companion."},{"rating":"1","title":"GOD AWFUL!!!!!!!!!","review":"are you people retarded? why do you listen to this crap? it's just fabricated 80's music. utter crap.ugh...ugh...ugh!!!!!!!!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Derivative, painfull, obnoxious","review":"Do you like listening to music that was made in the 80s.

Go buy Blur's self titled album and The Cars \\"Panorama\\" if you want REAL music of this style.Have fun giving these guys your money and giving them fame you don't deserve. Or take my advice and listen to bands who need your help and are deserving of it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stop playing these dullards before my head busts!!!","review":"Their music is far too cliquey and overplayed.

The irony of it is astounding. However, I like listening to that song at the bar. But in the sanctity of my own home.... silence, please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somebodys listened to the Strokes a little too much","review":"Yuck. Well maybe that's too strong a reaction. Rather more like: ........ zzzz. Heard it all before, nothing even remotely original or interesting about this band. I don't necessarily turn it off when I hear it on the radio, but for the most part it's just more top 40 overhyped mush, i.e. it's derivitive and dull. I kept hearing how these guys are the next big thing. If that's true then rock is surely dead. There are better bands out there folks, trust me.Oh yeah, the '80s were TWENTY f-ing years ago, get a clue. What will people say about the 2000s? What characterises this decade? I'll tell you what: it's the decade where bands imitated music of the past except without the wit or imagination that made the music interesting in the first place. Mindcandy for TV people. Go back to sleep junior, music is just entertainment: I keep forgetting that it shouldn't be something more. Trendy, trendy."},{"rating":"1","title":"So we're all up for nostalgia, are we?","review":"The Killers are another one of these retro-revivalists who've made it big. They're here honing in on those who've always had a soft spot for new wave hits. Who have enjoyed The Cure and Depeche Mode, who like their songs a little darker but still upbeat. Are they any good? Not exactly but they do show signs of promise. Somebody Told Me is not bad as a song as it has the androgynous tongue-twister chorus that is an update of Blur's Girls And Boys. The rest however is a little sub-standard really. Tossed off in a rush and sounding a bit like the also-rans of Britpop ten years ago. The music is nothing exciting though. As with most retro-revival acts, it treads on thin ice. It's only a matter of time before it cracks and then we'll see whether they sink or swim."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated attempt to jump start a dead trend.","review":"In a quest to find something right with today's radio, I landed upon \\"Hot Fuss\\" by The Killers.And now, my quest continues.This album is loaded with overrated buzz, horrible lyrics, and ghastly tunes. Just quit it Mr. Flowers, new wave pop is dead, and you're anything but the Re-Animator.Singles for this album such as \\"Somebody Told Me\\" and \\"Mr. Brightside\\" are just totally ridiculous. Take for instance, the chorus of \\"Somebody Told Me\\"Well somebody told meYou had a boyfriendWho looked like a girlfriendThat I had in February of last yearIt's not confidentialI've got potentialWHAT? Granted, it's not a mumbo jumbo hunk of lyrics like pretentious prog act The Mars Volta, but still, the lyrics, in any context, are just bad. And the album gets drier and drier as you move on, finally closing with \\"Everything Will Be Alright\\".Well, trust me, if you listen to this album, perhaps not."},{"rating":"2","title":"Can't Enough of The Killers!!!!!","review":"I absolutely love this CD.

I usually don't listen to the last few songs at all. I like the newer Killers, I think. I love their new album; Battle Born. I've listened to this one at least a dozen times, thinking it will grow on me, but I just don't think I like the style of most of the songs. I do like the first 6 songs better than the others.Edit 2/22/2013: I like this album a lot more now; I kept listening to it and it's grown on me.

It's like 80's rock with killer beats and modernized for todays sound. Not a bad tune on the album. I can't stop listening to it. If you like what you hear on the radio you'll like the entire CD. All though I'm a hard rock fan, I have to admit, this is really good! Buy it, you won't be disappointed. Keep those electric guitars humming guys! Sounds great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!!!

Saw them live and wanted more, so I pre-ordered the CD. Arrived a day before it was to be released. I was excited. Pressed PLAY to listen and haven't stopped since. 'Hot Fuss' is crazy addictive; I have friends who've picked up their own copy and are got just as addicted. There's something in the music, call it new w/ an old sound, whatever floats your boat. But you will most definitely enjoy.This is by far the best debut album I've ever heard. Really. It's damn near perfect!!! Go ahead and give it 5 stars. It is perfect."},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"I have listened to Hot Fuss 20 times in the last week, it gets better and better.The Killers are the best band in the last 5, maybe 10 years."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied","review":"I'm always a little skepticle to purchase any items online but the product was as mentioned and the turn-around was quick.Thanks."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite....","review":"...current band. I know they have a similar sound to a couple 80's New Wave band, but if I hated every band that sounded like somone else, I'd only be left with the Beatles.Anyway... suffice to say that my wife complains because I listen to this too much. Out of about 600 albums we own, it's easily in my top 30 or 40."},{"rating":"2","title":"Duran Duran meets Strokes","review":"Good album for fans of the Strokes or 80's new wave. All the songs are well written and make interesting use of guitar and keyboards. Some songs sound too much like the Strokes but this is one album that will be in my player all summer long."},{"rating":"1","title":"somewhat ok","review":"Take away 80% of the creativity, melody and uniqueness of the Talking Heads and the Pixies, throw in some mid 80's glam rock, and you're left with the Killers.Now it's not entirely a bad album- sometimes the vocals work, though more often than not the lead singer leaves me completely cold.If people seriously think the Killers are one of the best bands from the last several years, I have to strongly disagree. We need a band with a more original sound and definitely more creativity as far as vocal melodies and background arrangements go. This is basically commercial rock similar to Green Day but slightly better, that's all."},{"rating":"2","title":"soldiers of glam","review":"Catchy, electrifying tunes that take the word \\"derivative\\" to all time highs. This band proudly wears its influences on its sleeves while delivering a fresh sound and brings the energy to new levels. The melodies are hypnotic and the vocalist makes the best of his abilities. They really seem to have striven to be good on every song on this release, which proves refreshing. Their determination was worth it.The work is high energy and pleasantly addictive!"},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're an 80's child like myself.....","review":"Love it, love it, LOVE IT! If you're an 80's child like myself, this is the album for you. Combining the likes of U2, Duran Duran, The Cure, Depeche Mode, and the likes, The Killers integrate their storytelling of murder, mystery, androgyny, lust, jealousy & deception into 11 (not 17, HA!) compelling tracks. This Vegas-bred group (no, I'm not biased) knows where it's at! Mr. Flowers' AM radio-ish monotonish vocals, not to mention his cutie-boy looks, evokes emotion in his stylings accompanied with his 80's-style keyboard licks is just the icing on the cake to this wonderfully talented group."},{"rating":"2","title":"It Deserves All The \\"Hot Fuss\\"","review":"I literally haven't been this excited about a band since The Strokes \\"Is This It\\" album came into my life 3 years ago. The Killers have created one of the best albums I've ever heard. Every song is amazing (Some standout tracks: Jenny Was a Friend of Mine, Mr. Brightside, Smile Like You Mean It, and All The Things I've Done) and very fun to sing along to. If you don't have this album yet, GET IT."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good CD","review":"Hot Fuss by The Killers is almost a perfect album. I enjoyed the first 7 tracks more so than the last 4, but overall, the entire album is interesting. A bit overplayed on the radio, but what other popular band isn't? I saw them live, and their show was great too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet stuff here...","review":"Yeah I have a reputation of being 100% metal on this site, but I assure fellow readers that I have an open mind. I did enjoy these guys alot. I don't listen to the radio, so the so called \\"singles\\" aren't old to me. While every song is very good on this CD, the best song, IMO is Mr. Brightside. I did really enjoy this CD and I think it deserves a place in everyone's CD library. Pick this up if you're into this style of music."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty Good","review":"The Killers are pretty good, and this is a pretty good CD- the only problem with it is some of the tracks are just fillers. Best songs are Mr. Brightside, Smile Like You Mean It, Jenny Was a Friend of Mine, and All These Things I've Done. (if you want to just download them instead of buying)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing Album!","review":"I first heard of the Killers when I was in L.A. last winter. They seemed to be all the rage there at the time, so I broke down and bought the CD. I'm glad I did, because this is a great album! Every song on the album is amazing (and it's not often that happens). I encourage everyone to get this cd -- it's fantastic!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Definitley Hot.....fuss(?)","review":"Wow...around the time this was out it was all about Greenday and The Killers, I have both albums and they are both great\\"Hot Fuss\\" is catchy pop rock more rock and the songs are extremely catchy. \\"Jenny was a friend of mine\\" starts the album off on a huge high, and it lets people know this album ISNT gonna suck, then \\"Mr.Brightside\\"kicks in and totally rules the album. It has its downs but mostly this album is on a high. I agree \\"somebody told me\\" is great but it is totally one of the weakest songs on the album.This is a great album which you guys have to have.Try it out, seriously, I had NO intention of buying this, then I picked it up and it sits greatly in my collectionMust Havehot fuss!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I've got soul but I'm not a soldier","review":"I first saw the killers when they opened for stellastarr* back in April. I can still remember the concert as people would turn to their friends and just say \\"damn this is good.\\" The Killers put on an awesome show for that reason i counted the days down till the cd came out. This cd is AWESOME! With Jenny was a friend opening the cd hits the ground running, Mr. Brightide, Smile like you Mean it (a song that really grew on me).... There isnt a weak song in there. If you like the Killers look into Stellastarr and Elefant for great and unique rock just as the Killers have accomplished with Hot Fuss."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kate's Review","review":"This CD is amazaming!I heard Mr. Brightside on the radio and had to buy the cd. If you want good music take it from me and buy this cd!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing Repackaging.","review":"Don't let my rating fool you, I like The Killers and when I bought Hot Fuss shortly after its release I liked the material. However this is a flat out bad \\"limited\\" edition. We'll have to wait and see if it is truly a product that will only be produced for a short amount of time. With the amount of extra material that The Killers have it is better to just by the extra tracks from itunes(napster, sony connect, etc.) and save yourself the money. The three tracks are good but nowhere near worth rebuying the entire cd. So If you don't already own Hot Fuss then this is a good purchase, however if you already have the cd then don't buy into the band/record label just trying to keep themselves relavent and make more money."},{"rating":"2","title":"80'S ALTERNATIVA AGAIN","review":"ALONG WITH THE STROKES AND INTERPOL, THIS BAND RECALLS THAT SOUND OF THE LATE 70'S AND EARLY 80'S, SOMETIMES SOUNDING LIKE THE FINE POP ROCK OF DURAN DURAN AND THE ALTERNATIVE OF THOSE POST-PUNK BANDS EMERGING FROM THE DEATH OF 70'S UGLY DISCO. FOR THE PRESENT GENERATION NEW TO THIS MUSIC, I RECOMMEND YOU LISTEN TO BANDS LIKE THE SMITHS, PSYCHODELIC FURS, ECHO AND THE BUNNYMEN, PUBLIC IMAGE LIMITED AND OF COURSE THE CURE AND NEW ORDER, AND YOU'LL GET A REALLY GOOD IDEA WHERE THIS GREAT GUITAR AND SYNTH SOUND COMES FROM."},{"rating":"2","title":"Really solid stuff.","review":"2004 has been a gracious one for Rock, many new bands exploding on to the scene, and many cult favorites making their major label debuts have led to a strong year. Of those afformentioned new bands are the Killers, one of the most refreshing bands to come about in quite sometime. Their unique mix of 80's new wave and 90's alternative is neither over nor under done, but just right. \\"Hot Fuss\\" really delievers in a big way, from start to finish it has the potential to be a future classic. While nothing groundbreaking, it's arguably one of the better albums to come out in the past few years. If you're sick of everything MTV spoon feeds to the masses, and tired of bland Indie Rock, try this one on for size."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flashback","review":"Like a refreshing blend of The Cure and The Smiths, The Killers debut is a breath of fresh air.

Their stlye was 80's, but with a fresh twist. They didn't sound like the other bands riding this retro revolution. I really enjoyed the synth lines in \\"On Top\\" and \\"Mr.Brightside\\". \\"Somebody Told Me\\" is a great pop-rock song with good synth lines as well. Songs that wern't so hot were \\"Andy Your a Star\\" and \\"Midnightnight Show\\". \\"Andy\\" sounded too metal in the instuments and too pop in the vocals, and Midnight Show was... well I don't know what it was, but I didnt't like it.This is my first review but I've spun this album front to back and It's an awesome Cd to play on day when you want to listen to something really birght and fun. All in all a great everyday listen"},{"rating":"1","title":".....MORE OF THE SAME.....","review":"Here is the formula of this band:1) Make a catchy beat.2) Put it lyrics without sense (somebody told me that you had a boyfriend who looked like a girlfriend).3) Make a disc with one \\"hit\\" song and the rest just songs that don't give anything new to music(I'm not saying that the hit does).4) People will feel like \\"cool guys\\" when they buy your music and think it is the best.5) YOU ARE KNOW A ROCK STAR !!!HEY WAIT!THIS FORMULA SOUNS ME LIKE ........mmmmmmmm........ o yes! FRANZ FERDINAND (if you like franz ferdinand album buy this and keep listening to crapy music)I know that most people will hate this review but that is because they will know that this is just the truth of this kind of bands and I know that this band will be easily forgotten into some months unless they have another hit and the story starts again."},{"rating":"1","title":"(shudders)","review":"feel like paying 15 bucks to throw something away? then pick up HOT FUSS!!!

More like Lamers......","review":"I got suckered into buying this steaming heap based on that 'Somebody Told Me' song. Too bad nobody warned me that that is the only decent song on the album. The rest of the album is composed of pathetic crooning on the part of the lead singer and blantant U2 copycatting on the part of the musicians. Worst of all are the inane lyrics. For example from the effluviant pile of dreck known as 'Believe Me Natalie', we find the scintilanting lyrics:'There is an old clichéUnder your Monet, baby'I rest my case. This one hit wonder will be forgotten in a year and that's good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Alright for Emo","review":"They are an emotional-crap band no matter what but they did have some exceptional songs that paid off for the rest of the bad songs.

Come on."},{"rating":"1","title":"One Maybe Two Hits On A Below Par Album","review":"'Mr Brightside' is a great song, a little overplayed, but a great song. that is the extent of the praise I will give this album.Brandon Flowers is your classic manufactured pop star, nothing special lyrically or vocally, no real stage presence but he gets by on his enormous... ego and his feminine appearance which the girls go 'gaga' for.on the album vocally it is below par, the bass is simple and frustratingly dull, the guitar is energetic yet flat and the drumming... well, the drumming isn't that bad.Don't get this album, not all it's cracked up to be."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not recommended","review":"\\"Smile Like You Mean It,\\" \\"Mr. Brightside,\\" and \\"Somebody Told Me\\" are the best songs - but you've probably already heard at least two of these on the radio lots of times. \\"Jenny Was a Friend of Mine\\" and \\"Andy You're a Star\\" are OK - they're listenable tracks. Most of the rest is unlistenable filler - most of it after track 6 of the album. Just because radio seized on the few best tracks on the album doesn't mean that the album is good as a whole, and all the songs generally sound the same.Overall, as the reviewer whose headline reads \\"What's The Hot Fuss About?\\" said, as well as several others: as a whole this stuff is very average, mediocre even. It certainly is not innovative; it's the opposite. Not recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"heard it all before","review":"I don't see how someone here could actually mention these guys in the same breath as modest mouse. Sure, they demonstrate a knack for melody on a few songs, but their music is hindered by blase, crappy lyrics, such as \\"I like soul, but I'm not a soldier.\\" Not to mention that a few of their keyboard and synth lines are blatant Cure rip-offs, and that there is no real complexity to the music on this album either, unless you consider just adding more keyboards and guitars to be complex. All in all, the Hot Fuss successfully illustrates what happens when a band spends more time cultivating their image than their songwriting abilities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good and Different music","review":"While listening to this album, I began to feel like I was in the 80's. Not a bad thing. This band is definitely doing something different. This is punk that adults can listen to and reflect on their teenage years. (as if it was the 80's). Most punk and emo today is the type of music that 13 year olds would love. Not us older people. But this is actually good music made by a talented band that we can enjoy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Something Fresh..........Never A Dull Moment","review":"The Killers really show off great songs with very good melodies its rock n roll with a poppy 80's feel to it........highlights on the album are Jenny was a friend of mine.......Somebody Told Me..........Smile like you mena it.........and Andy Your a Star...............................n e ways get it now 4 1/2 stars"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Freakin Great Album","review":"These guys are great.

I got the CD and I thought that it didn't sound that good. It sounded flat and lifeless. I could tell right away that it was overcompressed. Because there aren't any dynamics left in the songs, there isn't any impact. There isn't any space for the instruments to breathe, and they sound like they are playing in a small box. There's \\"too much sound in a small space\\".Dissapointed Again,Chris Hudec"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Killers are generic pap","review":"This was a major dissapointment, especially after reading the Rolling Stone review which compared the Killers to the Psychedelic Furs, New Order, and Joy Division. The fact is the Killers have nothing in common with those bands, and Brandon Flowers' lyrics and vocals don't hold a candle to Richard Butler or Ian Curtis. If this band had even the tenth of the talent any of the aforementioned lyricists had, it would be a major improvement. This is rubbish, and not all that far from the mindless garbage rammed down your throat on MTV or modern radio."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overdone","review":"The Killers are a band trying to get in on the new wave of dance-punk bands. There are obvious Cure and Cars influences, and also newer influences such as Franz Ferdinand.I am a fan of Franz Ferdinand because they did something new, there wasn't anything like them being played mainstream last spring, until the killers came along with their keyboard and bad vocals.This album starts out with a kick,not a big kick but a kick you might expect from a 3-legged dog with a brain tumor, keyboards, guitars, dance-drumbeats, and mundane vocals that are semi-shouted. As the album progresses nothing changes, no songs stand out, none of it stays with you. It's extremely forgettable and frankly, it disgusts me.Please don't spend your money on this slbum if you claim to be a fan of good music. Please."},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this cd!!!!","review":"My cousin in london first introduced me to the killers with songs like mr brightside, somebody told me, & all these things that I've done. He kept playing and playing it on his phone. I soon started to like them more and more! So the next day, I went to HMV and bought the album already cause I love their msuic so much! I don't regret a single thing!"},{"rating":"1","title":"It doesn't have to be poetry, but.","review":"I really enjoyed the first 30 seconds of the first video I saw of the Killers. Then I listened to the lyrics. First of all I have heard this song already several times. Secondly, lyrics don't have to be great poetry, but when they manage to be both dumb and needlessly pretentious....Having now tried to give the whole album a fair trial, I must pass judgement - they are sad, pompous boys, who like to dress up in other people's music. Lack of originality wouldn't be the end of the world, since the melodies are generally pretty strong, but the lyrics! The lyrics are SO BAD I have trouble sitting through an entire verse (although I gave them two stars - I have to save a one star rating for things like Gwen Stefani's album). I wish the singer wouldn't try to pronounce his words like a Brit, either. Urgh.Yeah, I really hate this band."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rip Off","review":"This CD was obviously not new.

Though my favorites are Mr. Brightside, Somebody Told Me, Midnight Show, and Jenny Was a Freind of Mine."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"Somebody Told Me\\" This Album is Amazing","review":"This album should be considered one of the best album releases within the past five years. It has a sound for everyone with an ear for good music. It combines electronic, with 80s, with new age rock. Some people compare this band to Franz Ferdinand or Modest Mouse, but The Killers seem to have an essence and sound all their own. Sometimes I have bought an album for the hit single or several for that matter, which I did for this one, but found myself very pleased with the purchase as a whole. You will not get bored. This is an album that is well worth the money. Each song keeps you listening and gets you hooked. Believe me.....I was hooked for weeks on end. Hot Fuss is right. This album is indeed hot, and there should be quite a fuss about it. Purchase this album and you won't be disappointed. I would rank it in my top 10 cds that I listen to. From the old to the new, The Killers give you hope that their is different and intriguing music out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasant surprise","review":"I bought this album about a year ago after hearing the song \\"Somebody Told Me\\" on the radio.

Would not hesitate to buy this again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great CD","review":"I loved every song on this CD. The Killers are not only great entertainers but very talented in writing songs.

Not worth it, sent it back..","review":"This book had so many typos that at first I wasn't sure it was in English. It is unreadable and unusable. I sent it back.

I have another edition of this book which is excellent and well worth purchasing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mixed Bag","review":"I just discovered Michael Connelly and while I have really enjoyed his other books this is my least favorite so far. Parts of it are incredibly entertaining and it is interesting to view Bosch through the eyes of another character (McCaleb) and the idea of weaving together two murder cases is good, but, for me, the story gets a bogged down by both the solving of the two cases and the courtroom scenes. Reading so-called \\"courtroom drama\\" for me is incredibly boring. Apart from some clever word-play and maybe a \\"gotcha\\" moment, it's mostly just hot air...no action, no enjoyable writing, very little character development. Still, this doesn't deter me from wanting to read all of Connelly's books b/c those moments with the dark-hearted Bosch are worth it."},{"rating":"1","title":"truly dissapointing","review":"this is the first book from connelly that i picked upi like the theory and revelation leading to the painter who coincidentally was also bosch.. i also enjoyed the interpretation of bosch's painting but what i don't enjoy outweighs what i enjoy about the book...the thing about the owl and bosch was really fascinating but i was dissapointed on how the story was told..it wasn't really interesting and there's no flow to the story..i also thought the scene where bosch was in court was too long and boring, again, the way the story was told was very very boring..at that moment i really wished sidney shieldon had wrote the scene in court as he portrays lawyers as alan shore-like which is such a delight to read...i was so dissapointed as the elements of the story was top notch with owls, religion, darkness etc but the way it is told was just plain boring.."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Journey Well Worth The Effort","review":"If you are familiar with the characters Harry Bosch and Terry McCaleb, there is really no mystery here. But, as they say, it's not the destination that is important, but the journey itself. Connelly's writing is fast paced and streamlined. We are not given large doses of non-essential information just to prolong the story, as happens with quite a few other authors these days. We learn a little more about Harry but he remains a mystery, and that is the hook. A journey well worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Terrific story!","review":"I really enjoyed this!

Hopefully if a movie is made they will do a better job of casting the characters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Harry Bosch Fan","review":"I'm a fan of Harry Bosch, so I enjoyed this. I really like how Michael Connelly shows how Harry has grown. He shows all sides of Harry also. This book led me to read Blood Work about Terry McCaleb. It was interesting comparing the two characters, but Harry comes out on top in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Darker Bosch","review":"As the title suggests, this is one of the darker Bosch novels.Several novels into the series and I still can't put them down!The crossover with another character/story-line was fantastic.

I cannot say I am a great fan. But this finally just turned me off. The secondary hero, McCaleb, is supposed to have been an FBI profiler. Makes you wonder, when he suddenly decides that his friend, or at least long time colleague Bosch has turned into a bizarre killer.This McCaleb is an idiot in other ways, or I guess Michael Connelly has never checked on baby behavior: McCaleb has a 4month old child that needs almost hourly feedings through the night. This is utter nonsense. Not even a newborn needs hourly feedings at any time, much less a 4month old one. A doctor should be called, for the parents!Way too much boring filler in this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"another Winner","review":"If you enjoy The Harry Bosch series you will find this very satisfactory.Especially enjoy the subtle clues embeded through the story.Also enjoy the interconnections between the various books in the series"},{"rating":"1","title":"more is definitively less","review":"I am a big Connelly fan , but this one is dissapointing. the pairing of his two strongest characters, far from improving the novel, weakens it, as Mc Caleb's assumptions are not believable for anyone who has read the previous Bosch novels, and this makes the ending obvious quite early in the book. I Agree with the reviews which pointed out mostly the same objections; the only true Connelly touch is the revelation about Bosch's REAL part in Gunn's crime. Mc caleb has no dimension as a character and comes accross weak, linear and his domestic troubles are predictable and boring. Bosch should stand alone in the future, he's a fascinating character who can sustain a book in his own right"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I ordered this book for my mom for Christmas, she loves Michael Connelly books!

This book was entertaining although the idea of Harry being the killer was implausible to me."},{"rating":"2","title":"AMAZING BOOK","review":"This is such a good book. I like the Harry Bosch series, there is always a weird twist in each book. This one has many twists and keeps you guessing all the time. I purchased it in audio format and could not leave it until I listened to each CD. Normally I can listen for a while and fall asleep but this one kept me wide awake and I found myself listening to the wee small hours. If you are a Michael Connelley fan you will not be disappointed one bit with this story. Great piece of work.

You are drawn deep into the soul of Harry Bosch to view the good, the bad, and the ugly in this haunting book. Terry McCaleb is the perfect complement to Bosch's extremely complex character. He is drawn from retirement to help solve a baffling murder and the trail seems to lead in Bosch's direction. Not since The Last Coyote has there been such an intense Harry Bosch novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF HIS BEST","review":"I have only recently discovered Michael Connelly, and I am now devouring everything he has ever written.

This is one of the better one.i"},{"rating":"2","title":"Another great read from Connelly","review":"Connelly is one of those writers who never seems to disappoint. This book is no exception. Given the relatively short length of the book I was initially concerned that he would not do justice to both the Bosch and McCaleb characters, each of which can support a book on their own. My concern was unfounded. Connelly tells each of their individual stories with his usual depth and does a great job of intertwining them in the plot(I won't even think about ruining the surprises>...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Suspense at it's best","review":"When I judge a book it isn't by four stars, outstanding etc. but how hard it is to put the book down. With this novel it took me three reading to get to about page 100, then I was trouble. The next time I picked it up I couldn't put it down until I was finished. Without a doubt this is one of the best plots I have read in a long, long time. While this is the first Michael Connelly book I have read it won't be the last. In fact I'm going to buy a couple of more right now."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sheesh","review":"... The premise of this book is ludicrous: a respected and dogged police detective, of many years standing, becomes the prime suspect in a grisly killing? And might have killed a bunch of other bad people? Huh? If you've read any other Bosch books (...), you'll know that Harry ain't no freakin' killer. The whole idea is aggravating. The wimpy asides of his detectives make me gnash my teeth, and the awful (even embarrassing) predicaments he shoves them into make you wonder how they ever got to the lofty heights he claims for them. The former FBI profiler in this book is an idiot. And his wife and kids, over whom so much angst is spilled? Nonentities..."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different view of Bosch","review":"A Bosch yarn that has Bosch as a victim, rather than as a hero. The hero is an unlikely heart-transplant recipient, so there's some interesting aspects of what such a man experiences."},{"rating":"2","title":"Engaging, readable--but I couldn't suspend disbelief","review":"I like Michael Connelly's Harry Bosch novels, and I liked this one. It engaged me, I stayed up late reading it, and I enjoyed it.But... oh, are there ever plot problems in this one. The heavy plot machinery clanks and groans. I couldn't really believe any of it for an instant.I couldn't believe Bosch dunnit. I couldn't believe McCaleb could believe Bosch dunnit. And I couldn't believe the REAL criminal would have risked being so subtle setting up a frame. He couldn't possibly have been sure that McCaleb would pick up the clues and draw the right conclusions, I mean the wrong conclusions, I mean the conclusions the criminal wanted him to draw.And, while I have no objection to a writer naming his character after a fifteenth-century Dutch painter (any more than I object to Parker naming his after a fifteenth-century English poet), making the name figure directly into the plot sounds to me as if the writer is running short of ideas.Still, a good read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Major Disappointment","review":"Having read all of Michael Connelly's books, some of them more than once, I was looking forward to this one because he was teaming his characters McCaleb and Bosch for the first time. What I didn't know was that he'd come up with the ludicrous idea of having McCaleb think Bosch was guilty of murder, perhaps even being a serial killer! Those of us who've read this series know Harry Bosch has got a lot of flaws, but deep-seated psychosis isn't one of them. So, the book just didn't ring true for me and completely lacked any suspense. Bosch and McCaleb would've been better served if Connelly'd had them tracking a serial killer together, instead of Bosch trying to prove his innocence. Plus the references to Connelly's other books (Poet and Void Moon) were disconcerting. Reread The Black Echo or The Concrete Blonde and hope Connelly returns to form with the next book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A sickness more than Ted Bundy...","review":"The first half of this novel is very slow, but once you slug through it, you will enjoy the action packed second half. Terry McCaleb is the main character, brought out of retirement by Jaye Winston to profile a sick killer, who hogtied his/her victim and left an owl behind as a clue. We have little sympathy for the victim, who may have been a killer himself, but McCaleb must solve the case before somebody else ends up hogtied. The action gets intertwined with a courtroom drama involving old buddy, Harry Bosch. Meanwhile, McCaleb's new wife isn't enjoying involvement in this mess. McCaleb keeps sniffing and he keeps finding clues pointing toward Harry. Say it ain't so, Harry."},{"rating":"1","title":"A master of the genre disappoints","review":"This falls far short of the very high standard Michael Connelly set with his fabulous early books Black Echo and Black Ice. Later efforts have varied in quality, and this unfortunately isn't one of his better ones.The pivotal piece of the plot is not even vaguely credible. Without spoiling it for you,the main character (a retired FBI agent) would have to be a complete idiot to respond as he does to the key \\"clues.\\" A second key turning point is equally unconvincing.He is still writes well and can move the story, but one hates to report the decline in one of the best mystery writers."},{"rating":"1","title":"He Must Have Red Dragon on His Night Stand","review":"A former serial killer profiler for the FBI recovers on an island with his new wife and new baby...until a former colleague brings him a file to look at...the file intrigues him...he gets the scent again...the murders are inspired by famous renaissance paintings...This is my first, and now only, Michael Connelly book I've read...prodded by all the good reviews here...The above description fits DARKNESS, but it could also fit Thomas Harris's first Hannibal book, RED DRAGON, which is a classic of the genre, whereas DARKNESS is just business - selling tired plots without a clearly drawn central evil-doer (unlike, obviously, Hannibal)...the film producer of DARKNESS is only shown at the defense table reacting to the trial...the actual perps are only tossed in at the end...an in between you get an average level of police-procedural dialogue...An extremely disappointing read."},{"rating":"1","title":"do not waste your money and time","review":"One word,skip it.It s not worth it.People are tired of reading the everlasting fight of good vs evil.The emotional drainage the heroes(good guys) go through to fight evil and bring it to justice.I regretted buying the book.IT is highly unrealistic(not neccessarily a bad point for a fiction book) but worse of all it is boring with a capital B.Bosch and Mc Caleb can not cut the mustard anyway you look at it.Better luck next time Mr. Conelly."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Darkness More Than Night is a good read!","review":"I always enjoy the Harry Bosch mystreries although I thought this one was a little slower than most of Michael Connelly books.

I laugh so hard everytime I hear this band. What a joke! Do they have the cookie monster on vocals or something? The only thing I can think of that is funnier than this sh*t music is the fans it generates! I see at least one person a week wearing some lame Cannibal Corpse t-shirt, it's funny as hell because you know they're just wearing them for attention and the hope that they will offend someone.

I don't see how anyone could think this is deserving of anything over 2 stars. The guitar player is just playing the same chord over and over again and has WAY too much distortion for his own good, the drummer is just banging on the kit with hammers, and the singer, oh my god...the lyrics are all about gore and crap. This band is just a bunch of posers. If you want death metal I suggest getting Death, old Sepultura, and Obituary instead. Cannibal Corpse are posers."},{"rating":"2","title":"at last, an evolution of sorts","review":"i think that the old singer was holding these guys back. How else to explain the difference between this album and the previous ones? Contrary to what you may hear, Tomb of the Mutilated is alrigth but is not there masterpiece. This album is much better.

Theres more grooves here, hints of dare i say, melody? small hints mind you but enough so that the songs can be distinguished from one another...something not so easy to do in times past.

I love the characters in this book; they are so interesting and different that you'll find yourself really drawn to them. They learn lessons in life and are changed by it, and you can especially see this in reading the later books. Its great! Not many stories do that, and sometimes the ones that do don't do it realistically.The story was really good as well. There was always something to look forward to and you always wanted to know where it would lead. The writing was great in my opinion, sometime Ursula went off on tangents that I found incredibly boring, but when she stuck to her story and didn't try to do. . . whatever you want to call it (boring prose?). . . then it was great. Heck there were even good lessons in this book. Read them to find out, as I don't want to spoil ANYTHING. . .Its a classic (like LOTR), and for good reason (it was very inventive), so treat yourself to it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still my favorite","review":"When I was a child, the three big fantasy series in my world were Lord of the Rings, Chronicles of Narnia, and the Earthsea Trilogy. I loved them all, but the one that really moved me, that gave me wonderful dreams and nightmares, was Earthsea. I loved it deeply.Today I live in Japan, and the movie Gedo Senki, loosely based on the 3rd and 4th Earthsea books, was released last month. So I reread the original trilogy and I've started on the newer ones. They are still powerful, wonderful stories, and they only get better: the latter books are more mature and even more powerful, and LeGuin's skills in description and characterization have improved as well.There is an omnibus edition that includes the first four books under one cover, and I would recommend it over this edition, both for savings in cost, and because the omnibus has fewer typos."},{"rating":"2","title":"enjoyable read","review":"at 11 years old i first read earthsea and at the time i wasn't a huge reader i didn't like it as much as i should have.A couple of months ago i reread it and it was a very enjoyable read ursula le guin writes well and makes ged quit a complex character in fact all the characters are quit complex and ged is flawed hes incredibly power hungry. ged isn't your typical hero and the book is quit dark. It wasn't the best book iv ever read but it was very enjoyable. in conclusion i recommend this book to anyone who isn't looking for a classic thats written perfect but to anyone who just wants a good read pick it up and treat yourself"},{"rating":"1","title":"A lack of depth and flawed writing style hold this story back","review":"One of the basic tenets of writing good fiction is \\"show me, don't tell me.\\" An example: Tell - \\"Ged didn't like Jasper.\\" Show - \\"Ged felt a strong urge to punch Jasper right in his sniveling little face every time he looked at him. Every snide remark, every condescending look, increased the power of that urge.\\"Both of those examples convey that Ged didn't like Jasper, but which one brings you into the story and adds character development? That's the problem with the author's writing--pages and pages of narration. Too much telling and not enough showing. It makes the pace of the book very fast, which is nice, but it feels like watching a movie with the fast forward button pressed--you get the basic idea of what's going on, but none of the finer details. That's how reading this book feels."},{"rating":"1","title":"So-so","review":"The story is slow and plodding. Granted, it was written for teens, but it felt as if someone where reciting a parable instead of telling a story. The ending was not engaging (like much of the book) nor was it much of a surprise. There is supposed to be some sort of environmental message. If so, it's a weak one.I give it two stars as I am a big fan of this genre, so I don't write it off as a complete waste of time. This is certainly not Le Guin's best work. The Lathe of Heaven was much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unoriginal","review":"The book tries hard to be something of a Lord of the Rings story, but it rarely succeeds. We are quickly told about Ged and in the first few chapters he has lived about 4 years of his life, we rarely get a second to breathe or really know anyone, but Ged. And we hardly understand him either. It is quite a tedious read and uninteresting from this perspective. There are a few attempts (well, quite a lot actually) to capture the reader's attention, but unfortunately that is just what they are, attempts. This book isn't awful, but it is just like any other Fantasy book or Trilogy and doesn't stand out like Tolkein or Rowling's books. Read it if you like, but I would reccomend something with a deeper storyline, more colorful and dynamic characters, and events that keep the reader's attention and entertains them. This book doesn't do that."},{"rating":"1","title":"mediocre fantasy","review":"The Amazon review compared this story to Tolkien's Middleearth and C.S. Lewis' Narnia, but the only thing this story has in common with those books is that it stole the basic concept for the Earthsea series from those classic fantasy series. There is nothing original about the story or the main character. It is obvious the author was trying to write it like it was an epic fantasy soon-to-be classic but to me it was so contrived and cliche. The story was so boring and lifeless that I forgot most it as soon as I finished it. Don't bother reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult Understandment","review":"I (12 year old...just above average person) found this book quite challenging and difficult...I didn't understand it but there was some bits that I did understand! the bits I understood where pretty good (they were battle scenes)...only read this book if you are really desperate!"},{"rating":"1","title":"jaimelire","review":"This is no Lord of the Rings!!!! Where do people got this idea??? Lost interest in the poorly written story after 25% reading into it, mostly because I hoped the story would get off the ground. The conflict between Jasper and Ged is unfounded... totally weak plot.Not worth time and money"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"So often it seems like an adequate book is well loved just because it appears in an \\"unusual\\" genre. If this book was about anything but wizards, it would be considered mildly entertaining, but not much else. I found it neither very intellectually stimulating, nor focused around an incredible plot. Of course, people can like what they like, but I feel like this book was a real let down."},{"rating":"1","title":"incredibly simple and boring!!","review":"this book is written on about a 2nd grade level. it kept my attention for about 2 pages. it goes no where and is incredibly predictable when it does. the characters and and world are incredibly undeveloped and it lacks any fast paced action or excitement to make up for it. dont waste you time with this one or any of the sequels they dont get any better"},{"rating":"2","title":"Before there was Harry Potter . . .","review":"Before there was Harry Potter, there was Ged, also known as Sparrowhawk. He has the potential to become the greatest wizard of Earthsea, but his youthful arrogance keeps getting him in trouble---and may get him killed. A Wizard of Earthsea is the first in this series by Ursula K. LeGuin.I enjoyed this book even though Le Guin uses less narrative than exposition (more \\"tell\\" than \\"show). It's almost like reading something in the style of the Old Testament. After I thought about it, I decided it was not a bad way to present this story. It would have been too drawn out otherwise."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Fantasy Great","review":"Le Guin's Earthsea Cycle has found its place among the great fantasy series of the time. With a vast, colorful, and incredibley original world, readers can't help but feel drawn in. In this first book, we meet Ged, and follow his early adventures. The plot is intriguing, if feeling a bit rushed at times, though a pleasure to read all the same. This quick read leaves you wanting more, which you get if you continue reading the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Le Guin is a wizard of words","review":"Ursula Le Guin knows how to write about wizards and dragons in such a way that your imagination lives in her words. This is a gift not many authors have and some readers are not aware of. This is a book to read before you die."},{"rating":"2","title":"What I love about Fantasy","review":"This book was one of the first Fantasy books I'd read, and it (along with Tolkien's series) is responsible for a life-long obsession with finding books of equal stature in this genre. I've read far too much trash in Fantasy, and when the dredge begins to sour my appetite, I go back and reread The Wizard of Earthsea. It's a classic for a very good reason."},{"rating":"2","title":"Must read for any Tolkien fan","review":"Simple and poetic. The story flows like a song and grows like a tree into something complex and moving. The protagonist's struggle with lust and arrogance are so believable that you feel his story and power are yours."},{"rating":"1","title":"Audiobook Review","review":"The story is decent, though it suffers from the third person omniscient pov. Most of it is exposition, with very little feeling from the characters.But my primary review, and the rating of one star, is because of the narrator. His voicings are terrible. Even worse is how he speaks, screaming, stuttering, breaking up words and pronunciations in ways that no one would ever speak. Picture a high schooler who has just taken his first acting class and thinks he is a great Shakespearean actor. But it's even worse than that. Egads, what was the publisher thinking?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Incredible","review":"This book is often unfairly called a children's book. It is a brilliant piece of fantasy and can easily be compared to Tolkien in my mind except for being better written. The best bit though is that each book in this series is a story in its own right and Urusula LeGuin unlike most fantasy writers can get to the point instead of churning out long tedious 5 book epics. As for the assertion that older fantasy books are sexist anyone who says so hasn't read the last book Tehanu. The book does suffer from an intelligent and well thought out plot which may lose it popularity. So any stupid people out there should avoid it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb! The style reminds me of The Silmarillion.","review":"Absolutely wonderful. Although it has a somewhat distant, impersonal style of writing, every word is carefully calculated. This is definately not a book for people with very little brains.It's scope is compelling and majestic. A must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful stuff","review":"I loved this story when I first read at high-schooland haven't just re-read it, I've got to say thisis the closest to Tolkien in terms of writing qualityin the fantasy genre (though the tale less epic, theworld less detailed). Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT IF YOUR INTO MAGIC AND SPIRITS!!!!","review":"This book is so good! I just love how it talks about all the magic and people in this world where demons, dragons, and wizards are almost common place. The only problem with this book is that if you read it you just HAVE to read the whole series!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A VERY GOOD BOOK!","review":"I read this book for a book report and found that is was very interesting. I'm 14 and liked the stuff about wizardry. I tought it well writen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good story and very well written","review":"I liked the story, particularly the evolution of Ged's character throughout the book. I think the book is very well written, Ursula Le Guin uses a beautiful languange. The only drawback I find in this book is being a bit slow in some parts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Succinct and refreshing","review":"In a genre dominated by 800+ page tomes, the Earthsea books are a refreshing and delightful change. Ursula Le Guin is a master of flowing, lyrical prose. Each book is relatively brief, but chock full of all the elements that are required for a great fantasy story. She accomplishes this feat by keeping things simple and uncluttered. She doesn't need an appendix to list all the characters and their relation to one another. Her world is well-realized, her characters well-fleshed out, and the story captures you from the first pages. Take a break from the massive tales of Jordan and Martin et al. (not that there's anything wrong with them) and read an author whose writing is as magical as her story."},{"rating":"2","title":"The EarthSea Books Trash Harry Potter","review":"If I could give this series 10 or 20 stars I would. These books are dense, rich and beg to be read and re-read. I first read these books in my 20's; many years later, I still become engrossed in the wonderful imagery. Ms. LeGuin is the BEST writer I have ever encountered who can write with a 'sense of place' that makes you know that the book's world indeed does exist, and boy do you wish you could visit.I had trouble reading the Harry Potter books. They are boring and juvenile compared to this award-winning series. I can't understand the hoopla surrounding the Potter books when this series is a magnitude better. I'll bet people in their 40's will not be re-reading the Potter books. They will re-read again and again this superb series.My only complaint is that there aren't another dozen of books in this series.A stunning accomplishment from a truly gifted author."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good start - but the best comes later","review":"The Earthsea series is one of the greatest works of high fantasy, and A Wizard of Esrthsea is a good start to the series. But it's also my least favorite book of the series. Not that there's anything wrong with it - it just doesn't pull me in like the next three books do."},{"rating":"2","title":"I loved the book!","review":"I like fantasies and this was one of the books that I truly liked. The only strange thing that I noticed was that it is in the Earthsea trilogy, which so far I like the rest of the set, but there are four books instead of three. Could anyone explain this to me?"},{"rating":"2","title":"When fantasy was...","review":"Yes, there was a time when a fantasy book could end before 200 pages and still tell the whole story. There was a time when a series could be read one volume at a time and the plot was never left hanging on. The Earthsea saga is one of the finest products of that mythic, golden era. This, the first of the four books, is as fine an adventure as you'll ever find, but it's also a deeply philosophical book about life. Le Guin tells us that evil is inside, it can't be slain with ordinary weapons. A gem of a novel, I say."},{"rating":"1","title":"A BAD book","review":"This book may have had a good moral but I think it couldv'e turned out a lot better if it wasn't so borring. I had to read this in school, and not one of my classmates liked it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are we reading the same book?","review":"I heard all these excellent reviews of Le Guinn's \\"Earthsea\\" books. I read it and thought, \\"Is this the same book that all these people have read?\\" It was stupid. I mean, it was better than anything Terry Goodkind and Terry Brooks could ever hope to write, but that's not sayig much. Then I re-read it to catch this big deep underlying theme. There wasn't any. Or, at least, not any worth reading. If your a fan of Tolkien, Lewis, Jordan, or Feist, don't waste your time on \\"EathSea.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A Poor Man's Harry Potter","review":"I tried to get through this first book but just couldn't manage it. I was bored to tears. I presume Rowling was familiar with the basic idea of a young man going to wizard school and finding out who he really was, but Rowling did it brilliantly while Le Guin was just plain awful. I presume it was so popular when written because there just wasn't a lot of fantasy for fans of the genre. I'm amazed that it's still in print."},{"rating":"1","title":"Earthsea more like a puddle","review":"First of all this book was too into names of things. How could naming something give you power over it? I don't know, it was not explained. Also, why did everyone have 2 names? As a coming of age novel, this novel was a pretty good book. But I wish there was more action in this novel. Sometimes Sparrowhawk or Gad or whatever name the main character in this novel was going by just seemed to sail and sail and sail. Boring. Thats ok there are plenty of other fish in the ocean (no pun intended), like the Gor novels which have plenty of action and more of an interesting storyline.PS. I didn't really understand that last part where sparrowhawk/gad goes head to head with the shadowy creature who has hunted him all threw the novel. It was not very clear what happened."},{"rating":"1","title":"WOW, THIS IS SUPPOSED TO BE A CLASSIC","review":"Ok, I don't like fantasy, I don't really understand how people can read these books. How can you relate to some wizard with powers you know nothing about. Can you explain what it feels like, can you explain how you get it. Well, this book follows the ways of fantasy, you can't relate to this character, b/c you have no idea what he is going through, Le Guin doesn't tell us, she assume we are magicians. Plus, this book is boring (at least Tolkien makes for an interesting read). Man, I hated this book, back to science fiction, and Non-Fiction for me, this is my last foray into Fantasy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stick with Harry Potter","review":"When I first heard about Harry Potter, I immediately thought that the plot was expropriated from the Earthsea Trilogy (as it was called back then0> I was bored to tears by Earthsea and so resisted Harry Potter until I read book one. LeGin on her best day couldn't hold a candle to J.K. Rowling. Save your money and your time and read the Harry Potter books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Book, Do Not Waste Your Time!","review":"Very slow, dull, predictable, and wholly uninteresting. At no point does anything that happens come as even the slightest surprise. The battle sequences are very slow moving and would not interest anyone. It is a small book but it still took me over 3 weeks to drudge my way through this garbage. Afterwords I used it to start my fireplace, a task I am not sure its even worthy of."},{"rating":"1","title":"I thought it sucked...","review":"This book was a waste of time.. The complicated fantasy gave me a headache, but I don't really like this kind of fiction... So if you like unrealistic fiction this is a MUST READ. If you really hate unrealistic fiction, and think it's a bunch of B-S, stay far away from it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An unholy work","review":"As far as the mechanics, one cannot hold anything against the work. Nor will I comment on anything further than the first chapter, which I could not complete. I found it filled with actual witchery and sorcerel realism. It became a threat to my soul and poisoned my imagination. The rest of the work, I imagine, is filled with the demonic. Christian, if you own a copy, do not sell it, (spreading the evil) rather destroy it like I did, and boldly tearing it to peices lest it weave its spell over you.(I did however enjoy the tv mini-series, in which, interestingly, her wizards seemed more like our priests)."},{"rating":"1","title":"My review","review":"I thought the book was not good!

END"},{"rating":"1","title":"Dazed and confused","review":"I give credit to Ursula for imanginative and creative scenerios of writing in this book, but must say I didn't enjoy reading it. I read this book in English last year and found the plot very hard to follow. This was not only my opinion, but the opinion of 30 other students. This book is definately not a page turner. I would only recommend this book to those of you who have very open imaginations, LOVE fantasy, and have the time to sit down and carefully read this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Harry Potter? More like Beowulf.","review":"I have been hearing about this book for years and years and never got around to reading it. I finally did, and totally hated it. The prose was very lyrical, but there was hardly any characterization to speak of, and the plot can be summed up as \\"wizard chases his shadow\\". It was a very boring, albeit poetically written, story. It reads like an epic poem, flowing writing, but hard to connect with.Whoever recommended this as an \\"if you liked Harry Potter, then...\\" is totally off the mark. J.K. Rowling may have been inspired by the wizard school and coming of age story in this book, but the resemblence stops there. This book is completely devoid of the warmth, humor, and delightful reading experience found in Rowling's books. It is 100% exposition. It is more like a modern-day Beowulf than an old-school Harry Potter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Alex from Richview Middle School","review":"The story begins with a kid called sparrowhawk, but his real name is ged.

The story just was too complicated and it just was too hard too carry on reading it.

I would hardley recomend it to anyone but if they like that sort of book good luck to them."},{"rating":"1","title":"60's hippie wizard kid finds himself.","review":"The book is about a kid who becomes a wizard. Anti climatic from beginning to end. He is bullied and mocked, ends anticlimactically. He is tasked with dispatching a massive old dragon and its spawn, ends anticlimactically. He unleashes an evil on the world, spends half the book trying to bottle it up, ends anticlimactically. The character is not self absorbed, the story about him is. There is nothing epic about this story in the least, it could have been a biography about a kid who grows up to become an architect, and its about as interesting as that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Generally not bad. Probably a pretty good book.","review":"It was generally not bad, except the last chapter, especially the ending. The last chapter was boring enough to put me to sleep - while I expected it'd be exciting. The part Ged beat up his shadow was not that clear and the part saying they return was too short and without any conflicts there seems really boring. Except these, it was a good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Spellbinding","review":"This book is one of the best books I have ever read.

We are introduced to the major character in the series, Ged, and his beginnings to becoming an archmage.

Although the next 3 in the series only get 3 stars from me, this one is definately a 4."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why do schools require these sort of books?","review":"This book kept trying to make me think about the power of language, the balance of good and evil,and being responsible. Because of those reasons, I wanted stop reading it at page34, but unfortunetly it was required for school. Why can't a book be both preachy and entertaining? The only time I sit down and ponder the theme of a book is when the story didn't need the theme and was just intresting itself.This book failed at that. The plot of this book is also lame. Its about a young powerfull wizard who unleashes something terrible unto the world and goes hunting after it. Nothing else happens except this part involving dragons."},{"rating":"2","title":"A modern classic","review":"While I have not read any of Le Guin's other works, this book sorely tempts me to try. As others have said, the fast and furious action of sword fights and magic battles is somewhat lacking. It should be stated, however, that the book never pretends to offer that. It is more a story of growth and personal development and this is what Le Guin clearly accomplishes. She writes in such a manner as to engage readers of all ages over 13 with solid writing, incredible plot and character development, and extremely good dialogue. The action, when it is present, is appropriate for the scene and is never the focal point of the chapter. Call it the psychological drama/thriller of fantasy, I just call it a really good book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantasy of the highest order","review":"I don't often read books that combine a fantasy setting, spare, evocative prose with ideas of such great depth and - dare I say it? - universality. There is no real need to intellectualize about this book: there is a real case to READ it.The young Sparrowhawk, wizard aspirant falls afoul of the shadow of his own hubris and spends the rest of the tale trying to master the consequences of his arrogance and ignorance. Earthsea is a beautifully realized setting - with a minimum of verbiage, which so often in fantasy can overwhelm with its detail. The ideas - psychoanalytical, existential and drenched in an Eastern-style holism - speak gently through the simple language. I love this book and the first two sequels. Read 'em all."},{"rating":"2","title":"see!","review":"I have nothing much to say, it's just very good book! It makes you think differently maybe see things differently.

Each is only about 200 pages long, so if you read all three you'll still be under the average length of one volume of the usual wordy fantasy series.Le Guin's prose is a marvel of compact elegance; she can tell you what you need to know in a few vivid paragraphs where other fantasy writers need pages and pages. \\"A Wizard of Earthsea\\" is perhaps my least favorite of the three books, although it's essential to the development of the story.
