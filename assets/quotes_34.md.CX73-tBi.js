The film depicted the potential of taking culps hill in the middle of the day when the order was presented late at night in very dark pennsylvania.

If you're going to do a documentary about Gettysburg, shouldn't you at least check the basic facts? It was frustrating, to say the least.So frustrating, in fact, that I've yet to watch the portion detailing Lincoln's post-battle visit to Gettysburg. If the battle portion was any indication, the Gettysburg Address segment was going to be as bad ... or worse.The ONLY decent feature were the battle maps. When viewed in high definition, they're fairly cool. However, a few maps here and there isn't nearly enough to warrant a purchase. Go with something else ... anything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"DERP DERP DERP","review":"I never thought that people designing a documentary would get basic facts incorrect but these people did. There were several inaccuracies regarding the Battle of Gettysburg. Probably too many to list and most wouldn't be appreciated except by Civil War buffs. The historical actors were stilted, especially in their dialogue. Oh and they used some questionable sources arguing the American Civil War was fought because of slavery. While that was certainly a sub factor there's a bigger scope as to how this war came about and anyone uninformed who chooses to watch this documentary will be severely misled. Don't buy it.

But don't spend $15 on this item thinking it in any way a book that captures the power of the film's message or art. It's just a tiny, repetitive, thin promotional brochure with almost no content.

Had great laughs with my colleagues in the business and am writing an article recommending this book in one of Brazil's most important media watch sites...very soon.It is really incredible to see how there are things in common between the brazilian news tv business and its american counterpart. Mr. Corcoran's refined sense of humour is only a sweetener to the hard truths of today's news business. It is serious talk among some good jokes.Of course, foreign readers might miss some of the details about local news shows and talents but it is well worthwhile.Great Stuff! It is also a great incentive to write my own."},{"rating":"1","title":"...and the few marbles are widely scattered.","review":"I'm a former radio/TV journalist of 20 years -- the same as the author -- and agree with many of his points about the state of TV news: the superficiality, the \\"star system\\" for anchors and anchorettes, the \\"If it bleeds, it leads\\" mentality, and all the rest. However, his writing is all over the map. Corcoran often departs on flights of self-indulgent fancy before getting back to whatever main point he is making at the moment. As a hard-core newswriter from the \\"old school,\\" I find it ponderous and, despite his completely valid criticisms, not worth the effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect \\"Costume\\" Jewelry & For Everyday","review":"My husband bought this ring for me for a costume event last year (I was a midieval wench) and it went perfectly. But it's so lovely and funky that I wear it with just about everything when I want to bring a little sass to my wardrobe. It fits very comfortably, shines great (not too much detail-blacking), the hinge on the lid is well made and stays closed, and the stone is much prettier in person than the pictures portray. One of my favorite rings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Different orchestral sound","review":"First, though late 1950's, these are mono recordings, although I think the ear adjusts quickly. Although the tape was oversaturated in a spot or two at climaxes, the sound quality is very good. The string timbre and especially, the sound of the horns, is a bit different with this French orchestra vs. the usual German or American orchestral sound. Schuricht is perhaps more a 'classicist' and less a 'romantic' in his interpretation than many others. Overall a very satisfying setwhich provides a different sound-picture than many you have heard without the astringency of 'original instrument' performances."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHE'S NO DIVA!!!!","review":"I listened to the Journey and I discovered that Jayne Olderman is only singing on two songs, and they're the worst ones on the cd.What about the singers and artists with the real talent?Wondering why we're not hearing about them and their great contributions to this obviously worthwhile project!I went to the Red Warrior website and its just all about Jayne very little about anyone else.It just seems strange!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Clear, familiar and fun","review":"I learned the 1920's Minnesota Women's Club version of Mah Jong from my family (lots of wine and ice cream and chatting using delicate old bone and bamboo tiles) but often forget the details of play.

If you want a good explanation of American Mah Jongg, purchase Beginner's Guide to American Mah Jongg by Elaine Sandberg and Tom Sloper."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Guide For New Mah Jong Players","review":"This is an excellent guide to new players of the game. The directions and illustrations make this an easy way to learn. I take the book with me still when I play. Read it ahead of time to get a handle on things and you will not feel so uneducated when taking the first plunge. Some rules change with different groups so make sure you understand their method of play before trying to use some of the hands shown. I recommend this book to all our new Mah Jong members."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best mahjong book ever!","review":"So you want to learn how to play mahjong? This book explains step-by-step how to play so you can play without having to rely on someone else teaching you. Has an index of special hands in the back too. Our small group has been playing mahjong for several years now and this is the one book we always refer back to! The only book you will probably ever need to start and keep playing mahjong."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent readings of Kurt Weill","review":"I only knew Helen Schneider from her stint as Norma Desmond in the German language production of Sunset Blvd., but this is an awesome recording. Here interpretations of songs like Pirate Jenny, Surabaya Johnny, and Barbara's Song are no less than brilliant. She also does a great jazz treatment of I'm A Stranger Here Myself. She excels both musically and dramatically (IMO a feat shared only by the likes of Judy Garland and Betty Buckley)."},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE!!","review":"This is an album of already released un-released Parliament tracks (mostly from their album Osmium) with terrible music thrown in from some other fake funk group.

The documentary (couldn't stomach more than about 15 minutes) follows the civilian population.

However, this camcorder is pretty decent. It's small and lightweight thus great for travel companion. The playback quality is pretty good. It may look blurry if you watch it on the LCD, but looks much better when you plug it to your TV. It uses Hi-8 tape, which is more expensive compare to 8mm. The nightshot feature is not that great, it's blurry (black and white of course). So if you are buying this camcorder for its nightshot capability, I'd suggest browsing for a different one. The battery only lasts about 80-90 minutes (with LCD screen and non-continuous recording), and it takes about 2.5 hours to fully charge it.Overall, it is still a good camcorder, especially for beginners and for daily use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great little camera","review":"I previously had a Sharp viewcam, but, after 4 years it went dead. I decided to stay with the Hi-8 because my old tapes were in Hi-8, and didn't want the extra expense of going digital. I am very happy with this camera. The night-shot is a great feature - it's really amazing, you can tape your baby sleeping in a pitch black room if you want. If you're looking for a Hi-8 camera, this is an excellent choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Glad i threw down the cash","review":"for someone who is new to camcorders like i am, this camera works great! its a lot of fun filming stuff with my friends and myself. its really easy to use and there is a lot of cool stuff like night shooting, steady shot, and loads of other stuff! if your looking for a simple yet high quality camera then buy this one right away."},{"rating":"1","title":"Error message C:31:22 on two units -- a piece of junk","review":"Number of yrs. ago, I purchased one with the error message C:31:22 about a yr. later, then purchased another one in Houston which was on-sale, same error message appeared again less than a yr. under seldom usage.

The flow of information is not great to me, and the book is very heavy and bulky. I wish Uphold and Graham would produce a 2011 version of their book. It is much better.

For one, it is way too long for people my age. Come on, 567 pages when your teacher only gives you nine days to read it. Second of all, the Chinese names get me confused, and the author put in way too many descriptions. If you want to read a good book, don't read this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Long, Confusing Soap-Opera","review":"I admit, I was assigned this book to read for class. It is supposed to be showing us the place of culture in the lives of the characters and how it forms who they are. I think the people that set up the course could have chosen a better selection, especially at this time in the semester. Sure, we are supposed to be honors students, but we aren't superman (or should I say woman?). It may be a rather interesting book, but let me warn you it takes forever to figure out who these people are! On top of that, you can't pronounce their names or remember them, each chapter is like another episode of \\"Days of Our Lives\\" or the \\"Young and the Restless.\\" It is quite digusting in many places as well.In closing, if this said to be \\"China's greatest novel,\\" then I sure don't want to read any of the others!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't judge a book by its cover (or a picture of it)","review":"Although relatively good, this book was overall dissapointing. Of all the cinematographers featured on the cover picture shown above, only a third of them appear in the book. What happened to the great DP's like Tak Fujimoto, Vilmos Zsigmond, Russell Carpenter, Laszlo Kovacs, Dante Spinotti, and Haskel Wexler to name a few?! The book does have some insight, but not enough to make it worth buying. Instead, I recommend you go for its predecessor, \\"Contemporary Cinematographers on Their Art.\\" Or, if you are looking for a REALLY good book on cinematography, try \\"Cinematography: Screencraft.\\" Both Wexler and Sven Nykvist are there, as well as geniuses like Darius Khondji (\\"Se7en,\\" \\"City of Lost Children,\\" and \\"Delicatessen\\") and Janusz Kaminski (\\"Schindler's List,\\" \\"Saving Private Ryan,\\" and the upcoming \\"AI: Artificial Intelligence\\"). At least these two books will give you a more insightful and rewarding experience than this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still worth a look.","review":"A follow up to the author's first book, this continues the style of the first and is every bit as good.DP's interviewed are: 2nd Unit DP Mike Benson (Sliver, Volcano), Peter James (Driving Miss Daisy), Daryn Okada (Lake Placid), TV DP Neil Roach (Of Mice and Men), Commercial DP Ward Russell (Days of Thunder), Nancy Schrieber (Blair Witch Hunt), John Schwartzman (Pearl Harbour), Dean Semler (Dances With Wolves), Dante Spinotti (Heat), Ueli Steiger (Godzilla), and Vilmos Zsigmond (Bonfire of the Vanities).Unlike the previous reviewer, I think this book is worth it. There are always going to be great DP's missed out (the author apologises for some who didn't make the first volume, due to unfinished interviews), but that just allows for future volumes. However he is correct about the cover ... the image shown here lists far more names than actually made it, and is different in that respect from the cover of my copy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fatcback...","review":"A great collection from the band.

They seem to be written soon after this book was released.The errors are not just with the maps. This is a poster child for sloppy historical workmanship. A review of this book by Michael P. Johnson, in \\"William and Mary Quarterly\\" Oct '01 completly shredded the book and stated that the actual record indicated exactly the reverse of Pearson's conslusion. The Johnson review earned the prize from the Organization of American Historians for the best journal article of that year in all of American History, in spite of the fact that the President of that organization had written a blurb for the back cover praising the book.The Pearson could not even get it right in the book title--there was no trial.The current price for this book is so high because the publisher withdrew the book and tried to recover all copies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor research, inadequate scholarship","review":"Like the previous reviewer stated, this book was thoroughly discredited by Michael P. Johnson. How Pearson could keep his job or his pride after writing this travesty of a book boggles the imagination.I wonder how he would have graded himself, if he were his own student?The real tragedy here is that he takes a pivotal historical event in the history of slavery in the US and completely misrepresents it.

Because I liked Spirits of the Canyons a lot, being an excellent piece of Native American Flute mastery, I expected a lot form this CD. With all due respects, I was pretty disappointed. The melodies seem very repetitive, gone is the tension they created through the use of the classical guitar on their first album. Not only are the songs very monotone, this could be said of the entire album. I really had to force myself to listen through a single song, let stand the entire album.

Well, I agree with a previous reviewer concerning the keys of some of the selections being to low if you are using them with children. Along those lines, some of the recordings are not in the same key as listed in the book. When they are lowered you run into the same issue of suitability for younger voices.I also wish the book had been spiral bound.

It will serve it's purpose and I don't regret purchasing it at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Low quality, not worth the money of the trouble","review":"Low quality work, the finish is not as nice as it looks in the website photo. The changing pad shape is non standard so you better take this into account because buying another pad or a cover is very hard (if not impossible). The pad that comes with the table is very cheap, I would not recommend using it. We ended up returning it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great even when bought used!","review":"I bought this table used at a resale children's shop and was able to bring it home in the back on my Saturn Outlook (back row folded down). Then I carried it through the front door of my house and into the back bedroom where its home it. We have standard sized door openings. I can fit both of my baskets full of cloth diapers on the large shelves and there is more room on the sides & top. LOVE this table! We're expecting twins (babies 5 & 6 for us). We have a 2 year old and changing him on this is MUCH better then the traditional changing table or on your lap! Love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Product does not match picture","review":"I received my changing table today and I put it together - it was very easy and no problem for someone in her 9th month of pregnancy. I got all the parts and I was pleasantly surprised by the sturdiness of the table. However, the second and third shelves of my table are not as shown on the picture. The shelves have a rectangular shape and do not reach all the way into the corner, so things can fall off in the space behind the table. The inconsistency is even in the assembly instructions - the front picture matches the one here, but the part description shows rectangular second and third shelves. So I called their customer service and they told me that the product was changed and I can return it if I would like. Very poor answer... They gave me the number to their corporate office, which was answered by a generic message. (I left a VM.) I do not like being misled in this way and I was expecting to get new shelves mailed to me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save your money.....","review":"This is nothing more than a collection of bangs, clanks, screeches.

If you want great Chris Young horror music try 'Hellraiser' or 'Bless the Child'."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trans-negative garbage","review":"What trans-negative garbage. Every page of this slim volume reeks of trans-phobia, and every third page of homophobia.

I printed a document with the specific information from the AMAZON website (in case you delete it).My son was veeeery sad, and me ... i was veeery angry and lost eleven dolars.

One of the most outstanding features of the book is the cartography. The reader is presented with all sorts of information about all kinds of places and all kinds of weather.

The text and photos tell the story but the maps guide the way."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book for the Weather Enthusiast","review":"This book is about weather extremes, and it does an excellent job of covering the topic.The focus isn't to wholly describe weather phenomenon or the root causes of weather extremes. It concentrates more on the recorded weather extremes in many geographic locations. Think of it not as a weather encyclopedia but more as a book of world records.If you or someone you know is a weather enthusiast, this book will be a definite treat. It's definitely a catalyst to kindle the pursuit of more climatologically knowledge."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent and Affordable","review":"This is an excellent book and affordable. Some other reference books are very expensive and don't have the great photos and data presentations that this book has (I still highly recommend the others, but they are not cheap). This book saves a lot of time and makes it easy to show other people exactly what you are trying to say, and they will be impressed with the quality of this publication. Excellent book in its own right and can easily double as a \\"coffee table book\\" and a great conversation starter."},{"rating":"2","title":"A pleasure in every way","review":"This book is a delight to look at: the illustrations are stunning, the design is clean and elegant. It's a delight to hold: the binding, the quality of the paper, the form factor. And it's a delight to read: the text is clear and concise, while packed with detail. For me, the most compelling aspect of the book is the illustrations, which Lynch brings to life on the pages. I unhesitantly recommend this book to anyone who takes pleasure in the wildlife of the North Atlantic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disapointed","review":"Although the graphics were in detail, as an avid saltwater flyfisherman I was disapointed in the discriptions given for the species...When Mackrel was discribed there was no mentions of Tinker Mackrel a major food souce for Striped Bass who feed on this fish.( What I found interesting was the color plate for \\"Alantic Mackrel\\" looked a lot alike Tinker Mackrel.) When Weak fish were discribed a total length of 20 inch was given. I personally caught and released a Weak Fish well over 28 inches weighing in at 8 pounds.I did not bother to read the rest of the book.

The cardboard label was easy to rip off, but removing the black plastic peg was extremely difficult. In fact, I am virtually certain that I damaged the level while removing this plug. Now, I am worried about using it. I am not sure if the twisting and bending actions required to remove the plug affected the level calibration.

You do not need a lot of prior knowledge about financial instruments to follow it as he clearly explains the basic hows and whys of each of them. Also, he interweaves relevant anecdotal text that has you smiling as you learn. My primary complaint is that the overall structure of the material makes it a bit difficult to see the themes of the book until you are well into the material. Despite this, I highly recommend it and will probably read it a second time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cream of the rock crop!","review":"These are extraordinarily good singles, though the effect of hearing them in one sitting can be monotonous, even overwhelming. For this reason, it may be best to savor these gems a few at a time. Anyway, Cannon lays waste to the longstanding myth that Nothing Was Happening Just Before the Beatles. In fact, the Invasion bands owe more than a slight debt to these loud and high-energy rock classics. So does Brian Wilson. In their early days, the Beach Boys drew heavily upon the influence of Cannon, Eddie Cochran, and, of course, Chuck Berry.The sound quality is first-rate, though I almost think some of these sounded better on vinyl--in particular, the magnificent \\"Way Down Yonder in New Orleans.\\" But this is hardly the fault of the Rhino label, which should be praised for giving us one great compilation. The liner notes by the late Cub Koda are most excellent."},{"rating":"2","title":"Freddie cannon","review":"Freddie Cannon should have been a greater pop star but his label folded and he was forgotten. This collection revives his memory."},{"rating":"2","title":"A enjoyable eclectic mix of diverse musical styles","review":"An impressive followup to FUTURE PRIMITIVE, which includes a solid supporting line up including Mark Isham, Nona Hendryx, S'Ange and Loren Nerell. While quite distinct from his music with Tangerine Dream, it gives us insight into the composer's interest in diverse musical styles."},{"rating":"1","title":"A repetitive and monotonous album","review":"I was quite disappointed in this CD actually. It's so repetitive that I literally checked to see if the CD player had restarted instead of moving to the next disc... nope, it was just track 7. It's basically track after track of drums, all the same beat, with vocals and other things on top occasionally. The drums aren't even organic-sounding -- they sound like my brother's drum kit. The vocals etc are usually harsh and unpleasant. It sounds like someone decided to jump on the \\"let's make a drum album with chant-y, Deep Forest-y vocals\\" bandwagon, and it just comes across wrong to me.I am a fan of Tangerine Dream (both old and new), Deep Forest, Enigma... that type of music. If you're interested in that, I suggest checking out \\"Big Drum, Small World\\" by the Dhol Foundation instead; I really like that album. I'll write a review when I get a chance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't expect too much from this rather strange album.","review":"I bought this CD on the strength of hearing the composer's haunting soundtrack which accompanied the \\"concept\\" video/DVD \\"Planetary Traveller\\". As a fan of New Age/Instrumental Rock I was expecting something in the same vein, similar to Tangerine Dream or Christopher Franke. Unfortunately this was not the case. The composer has attempted to bring together different styles of world music and the resulting mix sounds a bit like Peter Gabriel during his ethnic period, but on Mogadon... The title track is okay and a couple of others are just about listenable, but I will not be listening to it in the car. On balance this is not an album I would recommend unless you really like this sort of music. If the composer happens to read this perhaps he would consider bringing out a more conventional album next time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Excess noise overpowering","review":"This CD player made a constant humming noise when plugged in.

I didn't expect Bose quality for under $40, but I did have an expectation that it would last a year with light use. Well after less than 100 hours of use, the CD logic went out. It first started reading only the last track and would not go to any other. Shortly thereafter it stopped reading any part of the CD.

Unfortunately, after a couple of uses and associated washings, I noticed that the non-stick coating was starting to flake off of the scoop.Like other users, I only hand-wash the scoop, so my handling isn't the cause for the peeling. I really wanted to like this scoop, and, until it started peeling, it was great. Yeah, it wasn't expensive, but it still should have lasted more than a couple of weeks..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seemed great until the nonstick coating started coming off.","review":"People that reviewed this product right after buying it, reviewed it too soon.

I'm not sure how much the anti-freeze in the handle helps, and personally I'd rather it not be there at all. I would imagine you would have to be scooping a lot of ice cream to see a benefit with that feature.A quick run under hot water from the faucet lets this scoop slide through your ice cream, making perfect scoops.Simplistic, effective, and no moving parts."},{"rating":"1","title":"The non stick coating chips off after 10 uses","review":"Usually the highest rated item is a great pick. I've had not-up-to-expectation products in the past but never a disappointment like this one. Sure it was affordable, but after only about 10 uses, within 2 months of getting it, the black non stick coating in the scoop section started chipping off. I just rub it with my finger and more keeps peeling off. To avoid digestion, I've thrown away the item. It's never been dishwashered as I only use the \\"soft\\" side of the sponge to hand wash this baby. Just wanted to let folks know what risks they are dealing with in picking this up.

Misrepresentation of the product.","review":"I bought this product hoping to have a decent hair-mascara to cover up my gray hair in between colorings. I bought both the dark brown and the light brown, not knowing which one would be appropriate for my hair. When I received them, I was horrified. The \\"dark brown\\" was actually a metallic, shiny copper, and the \\"light brown\\" was a metallic, shiny gold. They look like something you'd get out of a cheap Halloween shop. They should not be represented as something to cover gray when they are for costume hair streaks only. I had to pay shipping for these, but since they're inexpensive (the ONLY good point), it's not worth it to ship them back. So... I have to eat the cost, which upsets me since I bought this product solely based on how it was represented.

This is a book that I hope my daughter will enjoy and help her understand there are other girls and boys who have been adopted, have similar questions and maybe feel the same way.It does not mention birth parents or abandonment so this is a good book to start to introduce your child to the fact that other babies have been adopted from China. The pictures in the book do not look like actual photos so your child will not get confused that this is actually her story but a little like her story.This book is very special to us, especially since I found this book after we'd named our daughter the same name as in the book before even knowing about this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"3 Great Tracks by the MinimalTechno Master","review":"I went down to my local record store and had little more than about 7 bucks in my hand.

Over the course of these 3 tracks, I found he is so good at subtlely slipping in beats and rhythms; you are constantly adjusting to the music that is being spawned before your ears.

Wright's poems created ear-to-ear smiles. \\"As day tumbles down/The setting sun's signature/Is written in red.\\" were experiences that I shared many evenings in the backyard of my grandparents' farm. His haiku brought tears, as I remembered somber visits to my grandfather's grave. \\"An autumn sunset/Casting shadows of tombstones/Over mounds of graves.\\" But mostly, Wright's haikus brought joy and reminiscences about the simple things in life. \\"Keeping straight down this block/Then turn right where you will find/ A peach tree blooming.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"A lovely story","review":"This story was great to read.

The people are wonderful, main characters, all the servants truly cared and loved each other. This is the one thing that made this so good, the author‘s way of making the characters so realistic.

The one that replaced it was better, but still way noisier than my old Sony Hi8 which was downright silent. I guess the tape moves twice as fast and the heads probably spin faster too. Anyway, considering that the Hi8 was $1400 in 1992, this is a good deal as it has a bunch of things I wanted then like a built in light and the LCD display.There's a fine line between \\"noticeable\\" and \\"annoying\\" noise levels and this one is right up against it. As I understand it lots of the new digital cameras, including the DV format cameras are noisier than the older analog models, I guess unless you start spending more than a grand or so. Oh well. 4/5 stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good camera for beginners and novices.","review":"There are enough features to satisfy a normal person. Since I'm not normal, I wanted a bit more. Scrolling menus by spinning a tiny wheel is not very user friendly, but it'll do for most. I also wish I could control the fade in and out times. Some buttons that do not require the LCD screen require opening the LCD screen as they are in the inside panel. Charging is very quick and the pictures are crisp. The manual covers everything but is a bit disorganized. It needs to come with a memory stick. Self-focus requires turning the menu wheel instead of a wheel attached to the lens which is a bit annoying but that's okay as I use the auto-focus. The best thing is opening the cassette holder and watching the machine slide it out with a whirring sound."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Camera but no better than a lower priced Sony","review":"I bought this camera instead of the DCTRV250 becasue is had memory stick options for stills and also MPG recording on memory stick and also the 700 zoom.All 3 options that I mentionabove I felt would be worth the extra $...but I was wrong.

Many other people have complained about the high failure rate of this product. even though it's the loudest compact air horn I have been able to find, I would not recommend buying it.

Plenty of room on the existing horn mount, all I had to do was bend it a little to position the new horn.

Anyone with some basic wiring skills and a wire cutter/crimper could have done a perfectly good job in an additional 1/2 hour and saved the $30 for the wiring harness.Anyway, all told installation took me about an hour, with no serious problems. Only had to lift the tank up to run the wiring back to the battery in a concealed path.Haven't tried it on the road yet, but it is a VAST improvement over the Fiam horn that I replaced (which was itself an aftermarket horn).

I had to make a mounting system for it with a grounding clamp (the kind you use to ground electrical outlets to a water pipe or ground rod in old houses) and a piece of aluminum bar. It fit behind the right side fairing on my V-Strom with a little work. Once I got it in, I crimped some spades to some wire, put the (included) relay where my old horn was, ran a fused lead to the battery and life was good. The wiring kit might have been nice, but it wasn't hard to make my own.This horn is literally loud enough to cause hearing damage. I ride with earplugs, so whatever... but when I had someone trying to harass me while I waited for a light, leaning on the horn button got him out of there pretty quickly :) It also works quite well for the usual purpose of letting car drivers know they're about to merge into you.The claimed rating of 115dB at 6' is 1000 times louder than the standard 85dB (at 6') disc horn most motorcycles come with.

All I ever do in this game is play multiplayer. Modeled very closely with the Blitz series (over the top sports), the frantic action here actually works better than it did with blitz. With little interruptions of the action, you always feel as though the game is as quickly paced as possible. This feeling of frantic play leads to some very competitive moments. More often than not your games will end with one of your friends throwing something at you (mine have).

The only way I can prevent a puddle of soap from leaking onto the shelf is to empty the soap before storing the product.Rinsing the car with the filter turned on takes a long time since the filter reduces the amount of water coming out of the gun dramatically.It is 3 or 4 times quicker to use a drying cloth instead of the filtered water.I use this product to wash a black Mustang. Black does not forgive water spots or streaks.The water filters included in this kit say they are good for 3 washes. The replacement filters from Mr Clean say they are good for 10 washes. The filters that say 3 washes did not leave any water marks on my car. The filters that say 10 washes leave water streaks everywhere.

This was a really well done video and alot of fun."},{"rating":"1","title":"Humorous, but could confuse a child/puede confundir tu hijo","review":"What I've noticed over the years is that Veggie Tales is getting further and further from the Bible. This is a cute story, based on Moses, but since it takes place in North America among bears and cowboys, it starts to wander from the Bible. The biggest issue my husband and I had with it is when they are crossing the desert -- it begins to snow. I could imagine a little kid getting totally confused and thinking it snowed in Egypt or something.The older Veggie Tales were more sound Scripturally. Even this year, I see they're going to sell one about \\"St.Nick\\". We need to hold up Biblical standards and not support these moves toward secularism."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry to say I was disappointed","review":"I love the VeggieTale stories and could not wait for \\"Moe and the Big Exit\\" to come out, but this feature in no way compares to \\"The Ballad of Little Joe\\". Being one of the faithful watches of VeggieTales, this is the one video that my daughter will not sit through (and I have a hard time making it through). I guess we have come to expect great things from Big Ideas and with the great story of Moses we expected a lot more than we got. It is decent, but is at the bottom of the pile of my VeggieTales Collection."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for preschoolers!!","review":"I was very disappointed in this VeggieTales movie. These movies are supposedly targeted at young kids, but there was no warning that there was violence or disturbing images in this video. I realize this is simply a retelling of a biblical story, but some ideas really are not suitable for preschoolers. My 3 year old was very disturbed by babies being \\"sent up the river\\" to \\"thin the herd.\\" The burning bush was also very disturbing to him. He actually asked me to turn it off!!! No more VeggieTales for us!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A fine book hurt by a lack of maps","review":"This is an excellent overview of the wars between the British -- later the Americans -- and the Indians. Many books tell the story piecemeal, especially regarding the later wars with the plains and western tribes; this one tells it from beginning to end and yet manages to do so succinctly, compactly, and entertainingly. The account is balanced and objective, explaining the virtues and faults of both sides' positions.My quibble is that much of the book describes the movement of troops and tribes and the events of their battles and yet it contains, at least in my paperback edition, no maps to illustrate that. They would have been greatly helpful."},{"rating":"1","title":"How do I download?","review":"I purchased this selection on amazon.com expecting it to say something like \\"Click to download.\\" I paid for it, but I can't download it.John"},{"rating":"2","title":"Melodic metal","review":"Dating from 1989, Save Yourself was the second collaboration between Irish vocalist Robin McAuley and German guitarist Michael Schenker. As with the earlier MSG albums, the music was a blend of heavy guitar riffs and melodic vocal lines. The songs were a nice mix of hard rock and power ballads, but the songwriting was exceptional. Many of the songs featured engaging hooks and memorable melodies. The vocal harmonies, which showcased McAuley's higher voice, are almost a guilty pleasure. Most of the tracks were outstanding, although two (Bad Boys, and Get Down to Business) were a bit weaker. Arguably, this was the band's finest work. This edition includes several bonus tracks, including one unreleased song and two single edits. 4.5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"A weak folow-up to Perfect Timing","review":"I thought 1987's \\"Perfect Timing\\" was a fantastic record, so when MSG put out \\"Save Yourself\\" two years later, I was really looking forward to it.

In my opinion, however, the most difficult part of learning Access is to understand the concept of building working relationships between databases.

I would've preferred more instruction in this area, and less in how to enter data into a table.I will say, though, if you're just looking for a broad overview in how a database like Access functions, and how to work an already functional database, this is a good resource."},{"rating":"1","title":"access personal trainer","review":"This purchase from Amazon was not good at all.

I still have not received my refund for this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor character development","review":"Overall I thought \\"The Postman\\" by Antonio Skarmeta was poorly written, especially when it came to character development. The characters in the book lacked depth and seemed to be more like shadows than solid, deep characters. The main thing we learn about the main character Mario and his soon to be wife is that they are two lust-filled kids who can't control themselves. The rest of the characters appear as mere stick figures throughout the story. The book came across to me as lazily written by a lazy author. He should study Steinbeck and learn how to develop well written characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"Pure Country 2","review":"It wasn't anything like Pure Country, I bought it to hear and see George Strait and that did not happen in this video"},{"rating":"1","title":"Watch before buying","review":"Pure Country 2?! Someone should be made to lick the floor for even remotely relating this to the original Pure Country. It has nothing to do with the original movie.Let me tell you what this movie really is. It appears a movie company was desperate to make money. So they go grabbed an old film that was a hit and made a \\"sequel\\" to it. They got a hot girl, with a cheezy story, and tried to make a quick buck. George Strait did appear in the movie but mostly in small sections. He played a small role in the movie.At least some sequels try to relate to the original story line. This one had NOTHING to do with it!

Hardly!!","review":"This book is very hard to follow unless you are of the Catholic religion and know what all the technical terms mean. The author fails to make the fictional town of Sheresbury or it's inhabitants in any way appealing. And the author never makes quite clear why a widow of comfortable means would leave a perfectly lovely life in America for a cold, foggy, damp, cramped subsistance of a life in an unheated, unpleasant, unwelcoming house in England. If it's for the ambience, the author fails to provide any that make this setting attractive. The concept is good, the writing bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy","review":"Waste of money.

I haven't played a good Batman game since....ever! Probably the most fun I've ever had with a Batman game was the driving portion of BatMan returns for the Sega CD, now that's sad. From the moment you press power on your GameCube you can tell things aren't going to be pretty. The CGI opening is decent, but I've seen better on PS1. Once the game starts you'll quickly become aware of the jaggey graphics and horrible camera. The camera is in a \\"fixed\\" position, much like Resident Evil. But the camera never lines up where it should, making jumping from one area to the next nothing more than a guess. The gameplay is awkward and frustrating making even the first level unusally hard and frustrating. Stay away from this game.

You don't have much control as to how you opt to view Batman as he makes his way through the environment.2. Poor loading times. The games seems to be loading data every few minutes as you progress through a seemingly small map. Other games in this genre, have a nice loading scheme, where the map/stage is loaded completely during an initial loading period.3. Poor objectives.

I tried changing every setting and every adjustment I could think of. I couldn't fix it.So, I took it to the local Geek Squad and they sent it out for analysis. The result? Sony would have to replace the CCD and other gizmos for a total of $196! After 18 months.No, I did not buy warranties or anything - c'mon be serious.So my question: do I spend $200 for repairs? Do I buy a new camera for $300-$400? Should I buy a Sony ever again?I'm off to try to wrangle Sony customer support and perhaps will post the results of that wrangling here.EDIT UPDATE: Sony ended up fixing this for NO charge and now it works like a champ.

However, the book is nearly identical to 12th edition. Even the review questions at the end of the chapter are the same. Items to note that are different:11th edition has a cd that will only play in your computer, where as 12th edition has an interactive dvd.Chapter 7 and chapter 8 are flip-flopped.11th edition has more pictures than the 12th edition, so sometimes I was a page or two behind in page numbers.Highly recommend buying the 11th edition instead of the 12th in this instance...

So even though much of it is witty and insightful, It was like reading being privy to someone's thinking, with no real action or relationships. His marriages are between the books as is much of his child rearing. New Jersey real-estate aside, I found these books a stunt. The books are always set in a couple days before a holiday with the hero ruminating over his life and his interactions with incidental characters rather than those most important to him.

My interest has only been sustained thus far because I believe I also have similar age-related physical problems as does the narrator of this tripe. Can anyone actually say they are interested in the real estate and tedious highway details of New Jersey that make up the bulk of this narrative? His supposedly insightful views of human psychology and emotions are mostly self-fabricated nonsense disguised as occasional stream-of-consciousness revelations.

But this book was a huge bore. I can't believe anyone could care about these characters who didn't read the first two books; that's the only reason I slogged through it, hoping it would get better and start to feel profound and consequential, as it should have. I feel betrayed by the author, the publisher, and all those reviewers, including the The New York Times, who proclaimed it one of the best books of this year. Perhaps they were just happy to read a bash of the President and evil Republicans every predictable 25 pages or so, done so gratuitously that it's shocking Ford wasn't more clever about it.

But, Lay of the Land, is badly flawed with tiresome and seemingly endless internal monologues and an array of pointless characters. Ford seems stuck alternately writing as John Cheever and James Joyce and only one voice could work for this book. As it is, I found myself skipping parts of paragraphs, then entire paragraphs and, finally, pages at a time.It's fine with me if writers hate today's politicians - it's what they do and helps ensure a good review by the NY Times - but a novel is a novel and a political rant is something else, something I prefer to avoid.For $26+, I could have had a coffee at Starbucks.

I've been reading it for weeks and it seems to go on forever. A day for Frank Bascombe must last 72 hours, because he sure does a lot in a short time.If you hate Republicans, you'll love the author's gratuitous, ad hominem character's opinions regarding President Bush, and the GOP. It is plainly evident Mr. Ford is a liberal, as Frank, his main character-the person Mr. Ford speaks through.I tolerated as I plowed through this book, but it really is tiresome. It serves no purpose. I am glad I paid 25 cents for the book at a library book sale.The author provides excruciating detail about Frank Bascombe, and his Asian partner \\"Mike\\".

He never seems to get into a story. The book is generally very negative about life.

That was as read by Joe Bartlett. Just now, I was listening to The Sportswriter, by another reader, and Frank seemed callow and tinny. Bleh! The reader means to much to these stories!At the end of this one, though, Ford comes on and tells us something to the effect that Frank isn't real, he isn't off living his life, something like that. I said, \\"Nuh-UH!\\" and will never listen to an author's note on these again. You are not real, Mr. Ford!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring, boring, boring","review":"Ford is a master of the internal dialogue, but he went too far in this snoozer.

How anyone can bear to read this stuff is beyond me.I foolishly thought there might be something different this time round but no there wasn't. The same pathetic whinge about modern life, impotence, George W.

Yes, I'm a fan of Ford's writing (espeically his more recent stuff) and that review made me want to wrastle that reviewerMy goodness, this writer is a gift, and this is a poweful work.

There are moments when I wanted to throw it across the room, endless passages of soporific detail about driving directions, for example, or far worse, a set piece in the middle of the book that is an exact retread of the central incident of the second volume of this trilogy and which should have come with a warning: if you read \\"Independence Day,\\" skip the next 75 pages or you'll be swamped with deja vue. On the other hand, the ruminations on the Permanent Period and the finely drawn, lovingly ironic characterizations of many of the characters are illuminating, tender and memorable. In no way, however, is it at all fair to call this book one of the 10 best of the year, unless of course the editors at the New York Times, failing to read their own reviewer, based their votes on the first two novels of this series, not this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Frank B's last ride?","review":"Frank Bascombe is back, reflecting on life and being,this time through the spectre of cancer and the feeling of impermenence over a three day period during Thanksgiving.Richard Ford again brilliantly portrays Americana;New Jersey;cultural and political changes that we all have to face and find some way of dealing with;its bearing on our everyday lives.This book isn't as instant as \\"Sportswriter\\" or \\"Independence Day\\" and retreads a lot of philosophies and reflections made (perhaps more bitingly)in the first two books. I also found I needed to read LOTL in great swathes (ie 80-90 pages a sitting;reading the whole novel over 5 relaxing days) to get the same kick out of it as with the other Bascombe novels.I lost interest if I put it down after a paragraph or so and then came back-something that didn't occur with \\"SW\\" & \\"ID\\".

Wish I had read Zelda's review because a book that espouses anti-gay and anti-woman beliefs would not help my depression at all, and would in fact make me even more depressed that that kind of bigotry gets backed by a publisher.

I understand this passage has been toned down a bit in the current edition, but this should give you a good idea of what kind of sick, twisted, so-called Christians the authors are:\\"Whenever a battered wife comes seeking advice and consolation because her husband beats her up twice a week, our usual response is, \\"Oh, really? How do you get him to do that?\\" In all the scores of cases of this nature that we have analyzed in depth, there was only one case in which the battered wife was not provoking (usually unconsciously) her explosive husband until he reached the boiling point (of course, this does not diminish the husband's responsibility). After a beating, the husband usually feels very guilty and spoils his wife for several weeks. In the meantime, she is getting from people around her the sympathy which she craves, and she is satisfying her unconscious needs to be a masochist\\"(pages 96-97)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Well presented...","review":"There were a lot of specific suggestions for accomplishing the goal.

Somewhere on the promotional material printed on the book itself \\"A Sorry Beyond Dreams\\" is said to be his \\"masterpiece\\". I suspect that's certainly an exaggeration.I'm inclined to call out the author of \\"Bread of Shame\\" suggesting she maybe should be a little ashamed at trying to drum up interest in her book by writing a response, generally flattering, to just about every review entered.

This method comes off as pretty insincere, whether I'm mistaken in your motives or not."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Sorrow Beyond Dreams","review":"Though this purports to be a \\"holocaust\\" story, it is a biography of a woman (the writer's mother) who lived during that time but only slightly refers to the events of that period and their impact. It's more of \\"50's\\" women's story - the tamped down emotions, the \\"other-directedness\\" of the personality. This is mildly interesting but he is straddling his fence as a writer. It is his mother so he is backing off the subject, trying to be objective, but in doing so only gives us broad hints of the real problems in her life.

So the repair guy suggested that, since we don't want to rip out the walls, we get a base for somewhere else in the house and just replace the phone in the kitchen with an auxilliary. Also we weren't getting good reception on the unmatched phones we had been using. Very frustrating. This set with the expansion phones solved the whole problem. Sound is clear, speaker phone works nicely. I've shopped around online and in stores, and this is a good deal. I would recommend it.

The speaker button no longer works on one handset (the call is disconnected when the button is utilized.) One handset won't work at all. So I have $260 investment that is practically useless. Very dissappointed, I should have bought a cheaper brand. The intercom functionality is horrible, you have to scroll through the menu to access it.

There are a total of 38 tracks that cover his career from his early days as part of Dizzy Gillespie's band to his solo bebop recordings.A This is a great set for anyone interesting in Parker's music. n added bonus to this set is that the packaging is excellent. each CD is in an individual \\"booklet style\\" case and it includes a 50 page highly readable booklet. The only disappointing feature about this set was that all the tracks are found on other albums(mainly from the Savoy, Dial and Verve catalogs). and there were no \\"new\\" unreleased recordings here. A good sampling that is ideal for anyone beginning a jazz collection but it will make you want to go and buy more of Parker. I would recommend the Complete Dial Sessions set."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is where one's Bird collection should start.","review":"Simply stated, Charlie Parker was the best alto saxaphone player who has ever lived, and this is where one's collection of his music should begin. This album features a wide variaty of tunes, including ballads, hard bop, blues, and some live material. From the wild chorus of \\"Ko-Ko,\\" to the goofy fun of Gillespie's \\"Salt Peanuts,\\" to the catchy groove of \\"Parker's Mood,\\" this album will pull the listener in five direction at once. Parker's playing is at it's best. Perhaps the best thing about this album is the diversity of the other musicians. Miles Davis, Dizzy Gillespie, Milt Jackson, and Thelonius Monk give the songs a little of their own personal flaver. It is clear, though, that Charlie Parker is in control, and he leads the other players at break-neck speed. Part of the fun is listening to them trying to keep up. With this album, the listener gets, without a doubt, the full range of Charlie Parker."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great movie. DVD transfer is unwatchable.","review":"Love the movie.

It deals with one idea of Purgatory, and interestingly, is decidedly non-judgmental. Sidney Greenstreet's character deals with each human with one idea -- redemption. Even the \\"condemned\\" are told, \\"We never interfere.\\" The theme of personal responsibility is strong, but without the post-modernist tendency to imply that God owes anyone an outcome without consequences for choices made. It is thoughtful, but not preachy. Our culture wars often turn on whether \\"I\\" am the center of all being. The film is more subtle than Dante, and speaks to the issues of judgment and the after-life with a refreshing tone. It is indicative of why such films are timeless, and greatly valued."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best Kept Secrets in Movies","review":"I have waited years to have this out on DVD and have just purchased it.

While a plum piece of reading for academicians, it warrants reading by anyone interested in Cesar and his speaking style--such a person might find the work weighty and often repetitious.

Alas, I was disappointed. Robinson seems to have fallen in love with his vision of the future, and describes it in great and glorious detail, but doesn't seem to DO anything in this new environment he's created. I admit I like novels with action, and these endless descriptions bored me, so perhaps others have a different opinion. I could see the value in describing Mars in such detail in the 1st book of the series, to set the stage. And scientifically it was interesting, as I don't know much about Mars except what appears on The National and in Time Magazine. But scientific interest isn't satisfied with speculation about how Mars might look (in minute detail) after several decades of terraforming. A tedious ending to what otherwise was an interesting and entertaining series."},{"rating":"1","title":"Where's a good editor when you need one","review":"Blue Mars isn't a novel, it's a core dump.

In the first two books he built real characters and included real human emotions and reactions like sex, greed, manipulation, murder. But I think he lost his edge in Blue Mars, it never had the drama of the other two books, the characters never came alive. His dialogue of the politics of Martian government was like watching C-Span for 24 hours, it just droned on far too long.

I was in awe of the technical writing and found the plots likeable. I read Red Mars, Green Mars, and Blue Mars together and the further I got the more annoyed I became with the female characterizations. Robinson is clearly better at writing about men. His male characters have such depth and are intriguing. The female characters are either mentally unbalanced, sex addicted, jealous, petty or incomplete with lack of description. The males have such interesting relationships with each other, but I can't think of any females in any of the books who are even friendly with each other. I liked this series very much and loved the men characters, but the books would have been much better with more rounded female characters."},{"rating":"1","title":"a disappointment, a waste of time","review":"red was good. green was ok. blue was like dragging myself through literary molasses. i found myself skipping entire paragraphs and still being in the same place. the descriptions have been given before and they just drag on and on. also, there is a fair amount of repetition in how the characters are feeling.i like to finish things, and so i somehow read through it. didn't enjoy it at all, however."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wondrous, but badly edited, conclusion to a masterwork of SF","review":"Kim Stanely Robinson's BLUE MARS is the third book in his epic Mars trilogy, and it follows well the grand scope of the first two books. Here Robinson takes us over almost a hundred years, from the end of the second revolution to the inhabitibility of the Red Mars. Each section of the work is more than ten years apart, and the reader can feel the tide of history and the weariness of the First Hundred as they deal with senescence. It is like those lines of Montale, \\"There's no inheritance, no good luck charm that can ward off the monsoon's impact on the gossamer of memory.\\"The sole problem, however, is that this work was not edited well. Ann's section doesn't even seem to fit with the sections it is between.

I do have to say that the research he did to describe Mars and all of its features is impressive. But it was less than helpful to the story. I personally like to use my imagination to fill in some of the blanks left by other authors. If you want a COMPLETE description of the enviroment that the characters are in and don't care much about a strong storyline then this is the book for you.These were the first books I have read by Robinson.

As the story progresses, the plot is based more and more upon Robinson's previous suppositions than on fact - in short, he begins to extrapolate. By the last page of the last book, we're asked to believe that human beings can postpone death almost indefinitely, have solved the problem of war, and are ready to colonize space, all in about three hundred years. My willing suspension of disbelief wore out about two-thirds of the way through the last book."},{"rating":"1","title":"DULL","review":"\\"Red Mars\\" was very well done, and all three books in this series are praiseworthy examples of technological research and terraforming projections, but none of that matters very much to most readers if the plot is a sieve, the characters wooden, and the action contrived. \\"Blue Mars\\" is a failure I'm afraid. I usually avoid SF, preferring historical fiction like the O'Brian naval adventure books, or WWII novels like \\"The Thin Red Line\\" or \\"The Triumph and the Glory\\" It is only because I'd heard so much about \\"Red Mars\\" that I tried Kim Stanley Robinson's trilogy, and the all three books were good in spots, overall I found them pretty tedious."},{"rating":"2","title":"Proper ending for the brilliant series","review":"Just like in Frank Herbert's Dune series the longer you go in the series the more theoretical the books are getting.

The best, almost only good, thing about this book was finishing it. Ignoring the reviews, I should have remembered the last book in the Dune Trilogy.I lay the blame with JRR Tolkien. He had a wonderful story to tell, and it took a trilogy to get it all out. This should not be taken as an invitation to subsequent writers.The real criminal here is the editor. Someone with both technical knowledge and a sense of a good story well told should have gone through the manuscript with a blue pencil the size of a telephone pole and performed major surgery.Alas, this did not happen.The only reason I kept going through this book was because I was sure that it had to get better, and, having invested so much time in reading the trilogy, I did not want to give up hope prematurely.Big mistake.

Or if it didn't work for you, you may not be into extended, involved discourse. Blue Mars seemed to have a bit more than the first two books. But that makes sense--this dream-world expands in our minds, from a tiny speck, the words \\"Red Mars\\". KSR seems to progressively relax during the course of the stories, drawing out the descriptions of places, people, and ideas further and further, expanding the horizons of the narrative, in a way that compliments the concurrent expansion of our own minds as we read the books. He seems to explore each thread, each idea, as long and deeply as he possibly can. But this is only fitting. Before we die we want to go deep--go deep into reality. And if great books can't do it for us, what else do we hope will? How long can KSR make the now? As long as you're willing to let him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoughts on Blue Mars","review":"The third book in Kim Stanley Robinson's Mars trilogy... What can I say?

He goes on to say that a green and red spotlight combine to form a color but he doesn't know what and says, \\"Look at an artist's color wheel.\\" WRONG AGAIN! The color made by a red and green spot is yellow, the same color your eye sees if the vermillion and green cones in the retina are stimulated. An artists color wheel will show the results of mixing pigments, not light. He is confusing the subtractive process of reflected light, in which pigments mask out all but the color you see and the additive process, in which light adds to light, the \\"secondary\\" colors blending to create the \\"primary \\" colors.

Those books were a little slow and too PC. I gave the third one a chance to wrap up the series hoping the action would pick up and that the politics would be a little more realistic. Neither happened. It was worse than the first two. The author continuosly refers to \\"a new way of doing things\\" and in a convoluted boring fashion states yet another case for Marxism.

Better yet, read \\"A History of Communism\\" to see how many times the authors \\"vision\\" has been tried...and failed."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blue Mars - The Geology Lesson","review":"This series had great ideas, and a great story line.

I constantly found myself skimming boring sections re-hashed from the previous two novels, the characters lacked development in any significant way, and the storyline went virtually nowhere. Unfortunately for its readers, you have to finish Blue Mars to get closure. I bought the entire trilogy at a going-out-of-business sale for 50% off, so I can justify the money -- just not the time wasted on this final book of the series."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Finish","review":"Blue Mars provides a superb end to a great Trilogy. More than a century after the First Hundred colonized Mars millions of people now live on her surface. In Blue Mars Robinson speculates not only on what the future of the Fourth Planet may be like decades after colonization, but also delves into the future of intra-Solar System space flight, the future of medicine, as well as a whole host of other probable technologies. The only draw back is that this novel can, at times, mire itself in politics and seemingly forget that Mars is really big and has a lot more to offer than seemingly endless governmental meetings. This slight drawback (and it really is slight) does not however overcome the grandeur and scope of Robinson's final book in the Trilogy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hard for trilogy and even harder to finish it","review":"It is a pity I could not feel good about this trilogy because of missing the SF favors.

It reminded me of a writer who had written on one topic too long and was lost in detail that was probably interesting to him, but he had forgotten that most of us read to be entertained AND informed. In fact, for me, the story became more and more difficult to stay focused on the closer I got to the end, almost in the tradition of Murphy's Law that the work will slow down as it nears completion. Too bad."},{"rating":"1","title":"Uncomfortable","review":"I found this product very uncomfortable to wear. I used it for a chest guard in martial arts, but unless it is a completely standing art without a lot of bending, it is uncomfortable.Bending forward with your chin tucked to your chest, the plastic guard catches your chin. I modified the plastic and cut away at it hoping to improve, and it did get a little better, but still caught me in the chin any time I had to do a somersault type movement.Also, when pressure is placed on the guard and you move/twist, it cuts into the side under your arms (and I wore a sports bra and tank top underneath)It is a good guard to protect against striking while standing, maybe I just wasn't using it properly."},{"rating":"2","title":"don m","review":"item was OE fit and works fine.

It appears to me that the first section of the book is the only part directly related to mastiffs. I could be wrong, but after the first section every comment focuses on \\"your new puppy\\" and doesn't specify the breed. It tells you general health concerns that a new \\"parent\\" should be aware of no matter what breed the puppy is. A much better book (in my opinion)that is in the same price range would be \\"Mastiffs: A Complete Pet Owner's Manual,\\" by Kim Thornton. It's a \\"Barron's\\" book.

The real problem is that according to the thermometer, water boils at about 190 Fahrenheit. Since I live in NYC and not, say, Denver, I have to assume that I'm dealing with seriously defective equipment. To add insult to injury, the readings are barely legible and are in two- rather than five-degree increments which makes judging a brewing temperature of, say, 175 something of a problem.

While often justly compared to bands like The New Deal... Medina's songs offer a personal touch that really hits home. Get this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"WOW -pleasantly surprised from start to finish","review":"I have to admit, I was expecting another middle of the road local sound.

This band is different.My friend Shannon said she'd be sitting in with this band Second Sky at the Lion's Den. I went because she was my friend, but didn't really expect much.What I was treated to was an hour of fun... sexy... and energetic techno-ish music. The singer (a thin, handsome, blue-haired cross between Mick Jagger and Ziggy Stardust) surrounded by a DJ, keyboardist, 2 drummers, and a bassist lit up the otherwise dingy NYC club. The CD was just as good when I got home and listened to it, and a great keepsake of my experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"if you love music, this belongs in your collection","review":"If you are a true lover of music, the arrangement of sounds, this belongs in your collection.

Like most Indian films, the sound is added later, and the dubbing is poorly coordinated. It is interesting only in that it shows how far Ash Rai has come as an actress since this earlier film (98). Her acting is truly poor, but this partly reflects the weak writing for her character; despite that excuse, it's hard to believe that just one year later she delivered the performance in Straight From the Heart (99), a far better movie. PS: there is Nothing about Jeans in the movie; Genes, yes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Bollywood version of a Tamil movie","review":"Young Aishwarya Rai is pure delight to look at.

Techniques in this books were used on me by my Physical Therapist. I was on high doses of very strong pain medication. Through techniques used in this book, I no longer need to sleep with a cervical collar, my sciocita is fixed, as well as many other areas of my body that were in constant severe pain. I now take little and no pain medication. Positional Release Therapy along with other simple aids have helped me get back to a more normal life. The book is written so clear that a person without medical knowledge can effectively use the procedures. The good thing is you can't mess something else up by doing it wrong. You follow the directions and pictures until you get it right. Surgery was recommended by doctors on my back and this is now not a necessary option for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Chiropractics","review":"This is another book which lacks insight into the Source of all health.

I am from Chicago, and I was eager to see their interpretation of the city. Most people who do not know the city, travel guides and tour shows call us the \\"Second City\\" and a \\"small unimportant version of New York\\". This dvd plays right into that. Not only do they only show downtown, except for a clip of a museum, but they show suburbs as part of the city. Then to top it off, they show the John Hancock building and label it the Sears Tower. The tallest office building in the world, formally the tallest building in the world, is not even recognized.Now I'm not just biased for Chicago, the whole state of California was dwindled down to basically L.A. and a few parting shots of greenery and even New York was only recognized for Manhattan.This dvd was a terrible representation of America."},{"rating":"1","title":"Blue ray POS","review":"I got this in a set of videos, (the 'Over' series) and this is one of the worst pieces of junk I have ever seen.

I was expecting, not necesarily a wildlife video, but at least some beautiful shots of natural wonders of which this country has many (some may be surprised to know that, especially after seeing this video). The first 30 to 40 minutes is nothing but city shots, New York, Chicago, etc. Why anyone would want to see this is beyond me. America has some of the ugliest cities in the world. Taken into acount all the beautiful natural wonders they have forgone in order to show us this crap, it is beyond comprehension. Yes toward the end they show some shots of the Grand Canyon (over done!), but over all it was crap.

The footage is over ten years old, not very hi-def, and is haphazardly put together. As a blu-ray disk it is a complete waste. As far as the content goes, it is less than inspiring and does not do justice to many of the places covered, but then there aren't that many places covered.

It is mainly written full of psychological advise (not bad) for someone who has poor emotional control. If this book is for you, you probably should see a psychiatist as well.

I received one big insight: Don't just research the markets - research books about the markets before buying! Mr. Kiev entreats us to: \\"Find your weaknesses and eliminate them... Seek your psychological stumbling blocks and overcome them... Determine what restrains you from trading freely and well - and cast these things aside...\\" And so on -ad infinitum; ad nauseum.

It is reminscent of a plethora of self-psych courses one sees so intensly advertised on cable TV and in certain periodicals.I don't mind motivational books. They can be quite helpful.

Poorly written","review":"The experiences, which served as the foundation of this book, are quite real and valid - judging based on my 14 years experience in trading. Equally valid is the author's LACK of ability to focus on, and deliver, his message. Mr. Kiev may be trained in psychology, but for certain not in trading the financial markets, nor in writing. The only useful reading appears to have been arrived at from his notes and quotes of his clients, otherwise this book is mumbo jumbo. You will have a hard time following the author's cluttered thought process and message. Some passages in this book lead me to visualize traders, seated in a circle, holding hands and chanting, while \\"clearing their minds\\" in a markets pre-opening ritual.

This is just my opinion..."},{"rating":"1","title":"This episode is a real disappointment","review":"As a whole entity, Young Indy was a wonderful, brilliant series that deserved a much better fate than to be swept away after only a couple of seasons. However, every family has its black sheep, and this episode is decidedly the low point of the entire series.The first hour is okay, and one hopes that at some point, it may even take off and soar. It has the makings of a fun and exciting Indy adventure, but then it just wanders into pointless and emotionally unengaging territory. Sadly, the second hour drifts and is, well, just plain boring. The scenes on the island with the native tribe are endless, and the conclusion of the episode seems entirely out of character given the previous relationship of Young Indy and Remy. Not to mention, it's depressing.Yes, buy most of the other episodes of the series, they are wonderful! But, this episode is a dud."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite a treasure","review":"Flannery delivers as a younger version of Indiana Jones in, \\"Treasure of the Peacock's Eye\\".

As you can imagine, these photos vary in quality from very blurred to ok, plus there are a handful of official propaganda photos shot by the Whermacht which are the clearest.This book does not go into details of the various motorcycles used, the theatres they were used in or how they were viewed by the men who rode them. Each photo has a few lines of text which all sound very much the same after a few pages (e.g. 'This is a BMW R75', or 'This is a Zundapp', etc., although how the author can tell the difference and recognise the model of cycle from the blurred photos is beyond me!).The only think I did like about this book was it's brief explanation on the heating system used on some models of motor cycle and the diagrams used (obviously from the cycle's user manual)."},{"rating":"1","title":"The problem of The Problem of Information","review":"This book is boring, tedious, at times illogical, and almost always pretentious and tiresome. It's taking me on average 5 minutes per page to get through it, only to find that his points fall into four camps: 1) something I knew already, 2) something I didn't know and don't believe because I think it's illogical, 3) something I didn't know but don't think is relevant, and 4) something I didn't know, do think is relevant, and do believe. All in all, I think that Raber wrote this book in such a way that his language masks his sloppiness; I feel I'm wasting my time reading his work--Castells is much better--and I wouldn't recommend this book except as a literary cure for insomnia."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Day In The garden: A Picture Book","review":"This book was a treasured gift.My daughter and I have been looking at this book every night since she was about 6 weeks old.The illustrations are beautiful.The reader is taken into someone's back yard in muted colors and relaxing hues.A story can be imagined as each picture takes the reader to a new day and a new season.As the seasons change, the activities of the family and animals in the garden changes.There are so many little details in each drawing that we find a new story every time we read the book.This book is a must for any imagination."},{"rating":"2","title":"A really exquisite little book....","review":"...it couldn't be more enchanting.

Favorites such as \\"Lucky Man\\", \\"Karn Evil 9\\", and \\"Pirates\\" are included. Also, there are some new mixes of classic ELP classics \\"I believe in Father Christmas\\" and \\"Touch and Go\\". Elp was defined by Greg Lake's vocals and bass, Carl Palmer's thundering drums, and Keith Emerson's innovative keyboards. This collection does a superior job of keeping the ELP legacy alive. I highly recommend this box set to all progressive rock fans. You definitely will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Most Wanktastic Band Ever!","review":"If egos could kill, Emerson, Lake and Palmer would be mass murderers. This is likely the most bloodless, self-indulgent stuff I've ever heard. There's a lot of musical talent on display here, but it's mostly too obnoxious to enjoy. For example, they take a perfectly enjoyable Dave Brubeck number (\\"Blue Rondo a la Turk\\"), change the name to \\"Rondo,\\" muck it up with an overly complicated arrangement and add a super-extended drum solo that doesn't take long to wear out its welcome - but just keeps going. PPHHHLLLLUUUUUDDTTTT!!!!! Painfully dated."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Boxed Set","review":"This boxed set is an extraordinary example of the collection of ELP's work. The sheer power and emotion of their work is staggering alone, but combined with the energy to do unusually long songs makes their work truly special. Given the mass of work ELP has put out, it should be unsurprising that each disc has over an hour of music. It is a pleasant change to hear a best-of album that is worth the money. ELP's music is a fascinating blend of orchestral talent and the use of synthesizers. Their songs go all the way from the maniacal to the calming, from social commentary to epic stories. As \\"Karn Evil 9\\" says \\"Welcome my friends to the show that never ends.\\" This is the best way do describe this boxed set. You can listen to this album set as many times as you like and never get bored with it. Furious instrumentals combined with emotional lyrics make this album a must for all rock fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Very Earliest Nazi Medal Books!","review":"Published in 1958, this little primer was the very first Nazi Medal books that I owned.

It is great to put over blisters when you need to keep doing the activity that gave you the blister. It is great on the knuckles under hand-wraps and boxing gloves, especially with new wraps or gloves, either for prevention or after you already have blisters. I've also used it on my thumb for bowling, to prevent blisters or cover up a blister that's already there. It is fairly waterproof as well, and great to put on before swimming. I recommend putting on a couple coats for the best protection, just wait for it to dry between applications. Also, try to apply it and let it dry outside, or at least somewhere with lots of ventilation...It has a strong odor that will stick around for a while."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh, not worth my money","review":"I was hoping to use this instead of band-aids for cuts and scrapes on my hands. As a stay-at-home mom, my hands are wet all the time - doing dishes, laundry, changing diapers, cooking, cleaning up messes, etc. Even water-proof band-aids don't stay on very long, or they get wet and uncomfortable. I thought this would be better, but it's not. First, it's smelly, like nail polish. Second, I have to wait for it to dry, which is inconvenient when chasing small children. Third, it doesn't stay on very long. After just a few hand-washings it peels right off and I'm back where I started. Not very useful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good for hand wounds","review":"There's little that annoys me more than having a cut or hangnail on my hand. Contact with water, lotions etc. make bandages nearly impossible to use. I prefer painting on this protection until the wound heals.

The only negative is the awful smell that lingers even after it is dry."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finger Saver When Hangnails Appear","review":"I seem to never have my hands out of water between the kitchen and my studio so hangnails are a big problem for me. I find that clipping as fast as I notice a hangnail and coating with this \\"new skin\\" saves my fingers from a lot of painful raw areas. I've used this on minor cuts also and it works great to save the day - stops the pain and closes the wound. I would recommend two applications and make sure the surface is good an dry before resuming your daily activities and you'll find this stuff will hold up even after repeated dunks in water throughout the day.

I own about a dozen other bread cookbooks, but this seems to be the one that I turn to most. All of the recipes I've tried have been a success. There is a wide variety of excellent recipes in the book, ranging from basic & everyday to impressive for entertaining. I feel that this book has something to offer everyone, since it has simple enough recipes for the beginner, but would not bore the more advanced baker who likes sourdoughs and more artistic types of breads. Another thing I like about this book is its layout and organization. I have found that some of my other bread books tend to be a bit confusing with their directions. Not this book - the instructions are VERY, VERY CLEAR. I believe that anyone who wants to make their own homemade bread should have a copy of this book.

I doubt that most people considering a book titled \\"Whole Grain Breads...\\" are looking for recipes that contain just a small portion of whole grain ingredients.

For those of you that don't have an understanding of what term whole grain means, look it up in the dictionary. It has the \\"whole grain\\" including your flour.

I've tried baking both inside the machine and outside in my oven. With many, many successful loaves under my belt (no pun intended) from other recipe books, I've never once had a good loaf come from this machine.After this last attempt, which is currently struggling to rise as I write this, I'm afraid this book is history."},{"rating":"2","title":"I have found me way","review":"I first became interested in baking bread since I felt it to be the most challenging cooking/baking a person could do. And challenging it was - rock hard loaves, loaves that never rose.... Then I got a breadmachine from a family member. Looking for recipies, I happened on this book (3 days ago).

One the first the thumbstud broke off after closing the knife a half dozen times, rendering it unlockable and quite useless.

They barely made contact with the metal liner lock therefore didn't have anything to really bite into except the plastic handle. I tried to put them back in and all they would do is keep turning. I finally got one to stay and the other one I never could get. I went to the Gerber site and sent an email reference this issue requesting it to be repaired or replaced. It's been a week and I've heard nothing back. Very disappointing. I used to hold Gerber products in high regard. The knife's pocket clip was a fail and their customer service, well,..what customer service? It sounds like others have had better experiences with this knife. Buy at your own risk I guess."},{"rating":"2","title":"Light duty Gerber from China","review":"It's a lightweight folder from Gerber / China.

After receiving it, it was a battle to let it go and not keep it myself. It has a very minimalist design but with quality construction. The leather on the top has a lizard texture but with a rich feel. The only negative is that there is no metal hinge but only two strips of fabric that prevent the lid from falling back. I don't know how this will hold up to active use and a metal hinge assembly would have been a much better design choice. But other than that it was well worth the price and highly recommended. Four stars only for the lack of a hinge assembly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for the Price","review":"I bought this for my husband for Christmas in 2010. It looks great from the outside.

Some people critics compared this album to the old King Crimson ..and I would actually agree to a point.They do share the same courage to explore the possibilities of the new music which characterised the prog rock bands but there's allways a punk feel in it.If you're into predictable music you're not gonna like this one anyway.Strongly recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"Woah!

I completely enjoyed Kid A and Amnesiac, but I longed for some rocking Radiohead in the midst of all the bleeps, blops, and strung out madness that was their experimentation. Here we seem to have found a balance with many electronic beats with an always-flowing shout from Yorke. Favorites as of now include Sail to the Moon, Myxamatosis, There there, Punchup..Wedding, and the rest are not far behind. Entire album is awsome - no skip songs and no BS as usual.

I think that radiohead is a band unlike all others mainly because they are constantly evolving and changing. Hail to the thief is a great record because they took the electronics and great lyrics from Kid A and tied it in with the mor pop oriented Ok computer. I suggest you buy this album."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"During the sessions for this album, the word was that this was going to be Radiohead's return to guitar-based rock. Well, no such luck. Hail To The Thief is a continuation of the experimental leanings heard on Kid A and Amnesiac, but with diminishing returns. The band is still staying away from anything resembling traditional verse-chorus-verse songs, and your enthusiasm for the album will be in direct proportion to your tolerance for the direction their music has taken. Even so, this is not a strong set of songs; the music is simply unmemorable, with little to draw the listener in and stay in the mind. Atmospheric and impressionistic, but ultimately self-indulgent and snooze-inducing, it's their weakest album."},{"rating":"2","title":"What's the difference?","review":"I know a lot of you out there are probably deciding whether to get the regular version of Hail to the Thief, the special edition, or if you're a big enough fan to get both. Well, I got both, and so I've taken the liberty to list what's different about the two editions.Things they have in common:- Same tracks- Lyric bookletThings the regular edition has exclusively:- An extended roadmap continuing off the cover- A black cd- A regular shaped, plastic cd case- CheaperThings the special edition has exclusively:- A large poster that looks like one of the pages inside the regular edition's booklet, only enlarged, with a color key, and some notes at the bottom.- A white cd- A larger, paper cd case- More expensiveSo, which cd is a better buy? Well, I liked them both. I found it odd that the special edition didn't have the extended roadmap that the regular edition has. Either way, the cd is still an awesome one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hail To The Thieves","review":"They stole from themselves, ironically, in producing this Radiohead incarnate album. However, it's musically a masterpiece, and although rather repetitive I really enjoyed this album. If you enjoyed their past albums, I see no reason why you would not enjoy this one. Darkly beautiful, multi-textured, with a kind of schizophrenic, surreal, claustrophobic feel to it. It's like stepping into a nervous dream, with beauty and dark edginess pulling at each other for control of the illusion. Not an improvement over their past works, but for sure it stands on its own as a solid, classic masterpiece of music making. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not that good","review":"Maybe I didn't like this cd because I am not a big fan of radiohead. track 1,2 and there there are the best songs on the cd."},{"rating":"1","title":"Copy controlled rubbish from EMI. Avoid!","review":"My copy of this is 'copy controlled', which is corporate Newspeak for broken. It isn't a CD. It's a disc that looks like a CD that might work on some CD players, if you're lucky. It deliberately violates the CD standard in a weak attempt to stop copying.A friend of mine couldn't play it in her computer, so I had to burn her a copy of mine. How's that? Copy protection that stopped her from even listening to it, but didn't stop me from copying it. Record company idiots.Avoid.How's the music? Hit and miss. A number of fine tunes, a number of directionless, meandering dirges. '2+2=5', 'Sit down. Stand up.', 'Sail to the Moon', 'Go to Sleep', and 'There there.' are quite good. However, a number of tracks strike me as filler (I defy anyone to honestly state that track 8, The Gloaming, is not filler). Radiohead peaked at OK Computer I'm afraid."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Greatest Album Ever Made","review":"You want to know how good it is?Mix OK Computer, Kid A, and Amnesiac.This is what you would get.The album is beautiful, melodic, depressing, angstful, fun, diverse, expirimental, gut-wrenchingly intense, captivating, and absolutely brilliant.It opens up with a sudden guitar amp plug-in and then Thom's perfectly toned moaning in '2+2=5' which goes from a quiet fog of a song to a romping roller coaster of guitar, drums, and fun vocals.The album only picks up from there.It goes into the depressing, intense, and captivating sounds of 'Sit Down Stand Up', 'Sail To The Moon', 'Where I End and You Begin', 'The Gloaming', and 'I Will'.It also carries the catchy, guitar-ish sounds of 'Go To Sleep', 'There There' and 'Myxomatosis', and the dark techno beat of 'Backdrifts'.Grade: A+"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"Undeniably Radiohead is one of the most innovative and interestings bands around. But they seem to get more and more slack and self-satisfied -- almost smug -- with each record.

For me, I'd prefer the roller coaster ups and downs (like the dramatic jump from \\"You and Whose Army?\\" to the horrible \\"Pulk\\") to a cd with a relatively good songs that all sort of blend together (that's httt). Their new album is nothing groundbreaking, but it's nice and pleasantAt times when everyone's \\"rocking out\\" to HTTT, I am rediscovering Radiohead's old B-sides, such as Trickster, and I'm developing a new sense of appreciation for their more rock-oriented-less-electronica style.

It was Amnesiac and I'll start by saying it is not a CD to be introduced to radiohead by. I stopped listening to them put off by their almost alienating lack of hooks or any aspect to get into the song. I then however listened to the bends and fell in love. Then i found litsening to Amnesiac was much easier on the ears and now i love it. To get to the point this is the perfect cd between the bends and amnesiac. It has everything proven fans are looking for as far as depth goes, but also is catchy enough for new fans. To me this is what Radiohead is if anyone can actually say what Radiohead is. I have to say well done to the band and well done for anyone who has had the sense to go out and buy this album. To those of you who hasnt there is still time.

This album is definitely a musically awakening expirence; you can see into the soul of Thom Yorke more than ever before.I bought this for finals week.

I'd imagine you can guess what the other 4 are.Radiohead's music seemed effortless for a very very long time. This one sounds more like work.

All and all this is defenitely there most political album rather than Kid A which used more metaphors. Hail to the thief (taken from the protestors signs when bush was sworn into office)is a direct statement. The music as usual is very sonic and matures with every release. This being there most ambitious with full rock and idm/experiemental songs. Do yourself a favor and listen to the words. The beautiful we suck young blood is brilliant. ..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Each time I listen to the entire CD I not only hear new sounds, but I'm taken to a new place, Amazing!!!!

Keep it coming guys...I'll be waiting!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good blend of different sounds","review":"I don't know why people around, don't understand what Radiohead is all about and write all the stupid stuff. Hail to the thief is definately a good blend of different sounds, mixed with some very sharp and criticising words, in a sense of a metaphor. Mixing of voices in the first two tracks is just fantastic. Especially the high pick up of percussions at the end of track 2, stand up sit down, just blows one's mind. I regularly hear Go to sleep, Gloaming (superb electronic loops and trashing and a sleepy psychedellic voice), There There (i believe they could have used better beats, but the song rocks), and a real surprise melody in A punch up in the wedding.Overall a must buy for a Radiohead fan. Unlike Kid A, Electronic loops are used less here, but still the sound and melody of york and boys rocks.A true psychedellic band after Floyd."},{"rating":"1","title":"NOWHERE","review":"This is such a letdown!! Radiohead tries to hit a fine-line somewhere between OK Computer and Kid A - and the result leaves their sound NOWHERE. A half-hearted, half-a**ed, middle-of-nowhere mess that does not excite in the least. Coldplay are apparently the new Radiohead...let's hope they can stay the course. Radiohead are so over."},{"rating":"1","title":"no rock, no swing, just... sound","review":"There's a lot to listen to in this collection, but it's an unrewarding experience unless one seeks the morose, flabby, throbbing sensations that are offered up, cut after cut. Nifty and quirky passing sounds and unengaging verbal blather wash by to mostly enervating and surprisingly unpleasing effect. Despite the prerelease hype desperately describing this as the hoped-for \\"rock\\" and \\"song-based\\" work from Radiohead, it's not. The \\"band\\" continues to produce self-referential sound that is cliche from a general, modernist standpoint, but presumably \\"new\\" and \\"original\\" in pop. Klee, Kandinsky, Beckmann, Nolde, and Ensor are painterly antecedents for what, appearing today, comes across as angst-y, and demoralizing sound that may be music but is not rock. These artistes take themselves way too seriously. Weak even on its own terms."},{"rating":"1","title":"Greatness Streak comes to an End","review":"Don't get me wrong...this is a good album. But, it falls short of the great albums that started from the Bends to this point. I enjoy the music ....but it falls flat compared to those. The highlights are There There, Where I End, ScatterBrain, A Wolf at the Door, Sail to the Moon & I'll throw in 2+2. But they are few and far between and not as soul stirring as their other work. The low spot of the disc was We Suck young Blood- A boring ditty that contains about 10 seconds of genius during a tempo break, otherwise your stuck with some clapping and not so good ramblings.This is actually a 3 Star review..but it needed to be a notch down to drop the hype reviews."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing but different","review":"its not a perfect radiohead album but its brillant still listening to it a lot after 6 months i love radioheads rock and mellow songs and aint big on electronic crap thats why its not perfect but when radiohead get it right they are untouchable"},{"rating":"2","title":"jacek","review":"Not as good as Kid A, Amnesiac or as breathtaking and scary as OK Computer this is nevertheless a great CD. It deserves a 4.5 (out of five) rating.The music here is intense and relevant. After 2 more experimental Cds they went back a bit to their earlier sound (but not entirely). The Gloaming, 2+2=5, Sit Down Stand Up sre more experimental in sound but some of my favorite, but there are plenty of rocking songs to choose from as well.

Amnesiac was a nice try but really nowhere close, and this one misses the mark even more. Aside from the stupid premise that this album somehow has to do with some obsessive disenchantment over the U.S. 2000 election (get over it!), the songs just don't measure up overall. There are a couple of good-approaching-great tracks, but that's about all. Whatever that stuff was that you guys were smoking when you did OK Computer - get some more of that...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful album from a once-great band","review":"Radiohead's last album Hail to the Thief has to be the worst album they ever did. Despite the fact I am a Republican and Bush supporter, I gave this album a fair chance seeing as I liked its four predecessors The Bends, OK Computer, Kid A and of course, Amnesiac. However, this album is a mess. The band are tired, uninspired, bland and the material is forced. 2 + 2 = 5, Wolf at the Door and There There sounds like something babies would come up with. I can see why this album was a flop when released because the material was boring and also competing against R&B great Luther Vandross and Metallica's St Anger didn't help matters. I tried listening to this album four times for it to grow, just wouldn't cut it so I sold it.

I just can't get into this album at all. I've listened to the album maybe 5 times, and I wouldn't recognize one single tune if you played it for me now. They just don't stick in my head they way that songs like \\"Karma Police\\" and pretty much any tune from The Bends.I'd say, buy the album if you're a die-hard fan. You probably already own it by now if you're a die-hard fan anyway. If you really thought OK Computer and The Bends were great, go buy the Coldplay CD instead. You'll be much happier with your purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"what happened?!","review":"pablo honey was ok. the bends was revolutionary. ok computer was so beautiful. kid a was a great album but not at my first listen. amnesiac was kinda experimental and i dont like it as much.ok time to go back to the good stuff right? wrong. driving even further away at what they were best at. ive tried like 3 or 4 times to listen to this album and like it. everytime i stop it. its boring and the songs are dumb.hell, that thom yorke solo cd is better than HTTT."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware....","review":"Radiohead used to be one of my favorite bands. Pablo Honey is my absolute favorite release of theirs. The last few releases, however, have been poor showcases of their vocal and musical talents. They have really gone downhill. It's too bad because they are capable of such great stuff. I hated the last few releases and I'm not liking this latest one any better. I wish I had borrowed it from a friend and burned it, or downloaded the MP3 instead of wasting my money on a CD that is going in the trash can."},{"rating":"1","title":"Simply Dreadful","review":"I'm a big Radiohead fan so it pains me to say this, but.... this collection of tracks is the most uninteresting, unlistenable, monotonous music I could ever imagine a band like Radiohead recording.

Pass this one by."},{"rating":"1","title":"I don't get it","review":"This album is for fans only, although i don't know how they have any left.. unless all these reviewers giving them 4's and 5's are secretly record label executives. I mean honestly, how hard would it be to make \\"backdrifts\\" or \\"the gloaming\\"? Nothing but incoherent computer noises. Most of the other songs are just tuneless and depressing. You can call it genius all you want but like one reviewer said, Radiohead fails on the most basic level, which is that music has to be enjoyable. Ok Computer was thier peak and they know it. They're not even trying anymore."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh poo","review":"is this the great white hope?oh boy.western culture, for gods sake, point the canon at yr head and pull the friggin string."},{"rating":"1","title":"Radiohead R.I.P.?","review":"I give up - sorry guys. I absolutely loved OK Computer. Being somewhat disappointed with Kid A (other than \\"Everything...\\" and \\"Disappear...\\") I went out and bought Amnesiac in the hope of something better - no luck. Not having much luck with this new album either, although \\"Scatterbrain\\" and \\"Wolf\\" come close to what I liked so much on OK Computer. Does this make me too mainstream? If so then I guess Radiohead have lost a fan."},{"rating":"1","title":"I've given up on Radiohead","review":"I will start out this review by saying I think OK Computer is probably one of the best albums of the last decade. However this CD, along with Kid A, has got to be the worst. It is a collection of incoherent meaningless noise. Anyone who thinks this is art is also the person who thinks someone is a genious because they can't understand them. I am not opposed to experimentation, but some experiments are failures; and these \\"songs\\" (much like an ugly baby)are something only their creator would love. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Revolutionary, best of last 2000 years","review":"These guys are so expirimental. Thet are geniuses. I am special too because I like them. In fact, I am better than you because I \\"get it\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Radiohead is stronger than ever","review":"HTTT starts off on a right note by listening to Thome's voice quietly in the opening seconds of 2+2=5 saying \\"That's a nice way to start'', later in the song he says, you were at home, allowing yourself to believe the lies. The CD is loaded with political messages as well as optimistic lines that leave you thinking about what the future will be like for Radiohead. The 14 tracks, which contain several song-oriented tunes make is seem more like a classic Radiohead CD, but they still incorporate the synthesized sound captured in Kid A and Amnesiac. Overall, it's an excellent CD, with a variety of great tracks. It ends with a great song, a creepy suspicious fantasy that captures the essence of Radiohead, and leaves you thinking that the best is yet to come. I should only give it 4 stars because I think that O.K. Copmuter and The Bends are better, but in my (biased?) opinion all but Pablo Honey are 5 star albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mold","review":"This record grew on me. At first, I did not like it, and I love Radiohead! I listened for a couple of weeks, and one day, I started hearing it. It is now one of my favorite records.

This is one of the best reords of the year.Vivillo"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent!!","review":"I have always enjoyed any album from Radiohead, but by far this is my favorite so far. Can be \\"gloomy\\", but I love a good gloomy album. The albums flows well, excellently blended along with great lyrics. I find that I could listen to this over and over again. If I had to cut my CD collection this would be a CD that would make it high on the list."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love It","review":"This is one of my favorite Radiohead albums. Honestly I'd only recommend it to a Radiohead fan. It's definatly an aquired taste, and I don't think somebody who wasn't really \\"into\\" Radiohead would enjoy it that much. If you're new to Radiohead, go for Ok Computer before this. Otherwise, I'd put this on the same level as Kid A and Ok Computer which IMO were the 2 other best albums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of time","review":"Corporate rock rears its ugly head once again on this one-hit-wonder's set of 14 all new cookie cutter tracks.

A misfire of historic proportions."},{"rating":"1","title":"I'm sorry, Radiohead has lost it.","review":"I recomend fans listen to the album a bunch of times without regard to radiohead's history, the ... critics, and the views of those around them. I think they will find that is not technically bad, but it's really not good at all. It lacks passion. Passion is easily recognized but hard to define. Pablo honey had the passion but the wrong direction - yeilding a few good tunes. The Bends and O.k. computer had the passion and the direction, resulting in brilliance. They started to lose it during kid A, half of which is brilliant. Hail to the thief is so damn boring. One cannot not image them and their producer, engineer, etc, sitting around and feeling confident about this release. Many will listen and convice themselves that this album is good. Rember fans, you owe nothing to Radiohead; it's o.k. to say you don't like this album. Come on, it's o.k., the karma police won't hunt you down."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ahead of the curve","review":"Once again Radiohead comes back to save popular music from the banal drivel. \\"Hail to the Thief\\" is without question thier best effort to date. It is experimental while still maintaining accessibility, few artist can pull that trick off. One of the best tracks is the funky \\" Myxamatosis\\", it's pulsing synth is completely infectious. It is hard to pick other standout tracks, the entire work is so strong. This CD has a cohesion about it that flows gracefully from one song to the next. It is nearly impossible to listen to one track without listening to the whole thing.Hats off to Radiohead for making the most interesting CDs of the year. Ahead of the curve, WAY ahead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Radiohead Reinvent Sound & Music ! AGAIN !","review":"This is going to be very short.Simply run and get this record.In the 14 new songs featuring here Radiohead had mixed all thier previous styles, and also created a whole new sound concept. Nigel Godrich sure is responsible to a great deal of this album's perfection.Thom's Voice is better than ever, more exciting and heartfelt,Instruments also sound very different, especially the Drums and the piano.Radiohead has done it again !!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bridge between Radiohead's styles","review":"Hail to the Theif is, in a nutshell, a bridge between The Bends / OK Computer, and Kid A / Amnesiac. It is as if you mixed both, and the best possible result came out. Hail to the Theif is a booming soundscape, and a whispered prayer. It is clear that there has been combination between their former styles and techniques on Hail, and they are beautifully combined in the masterpiece that is Hail to the Theif. This is one of the best Radiohead CDs thusfar, moving away from the Over-Production of Kid A and leaning back towards the former Progressive tones from OK Computer, and the melodies from The Bends. Buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"great follow up","review":"I had anticapated the release of Hail to the Theif for about a year. It was well worth the wait. I would recommend this cd to any radiohead fan. Some of the songs have almost a \\"techno\\" sound to them. I enjoy all of tracks on this cd!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The most progressive band of the mainstream arena","review":"Well , they did it again , I was not expecting anything so good as this one , it is clear that this guys became the most progressive band of the mainstream arena and hopefully because of them others will gain popularity.A step forward from the previous works and their most solid achievement.Now, if you are a sound explorer and would like to discover other bands as good and adventurous as Radiohead , try Porcupine tree \\" Sky move sideways\\" , Godspeed! yo black emperor , and what is for me the best discovery in years , Tempano \\" the agony and the ecstasy\\"Happy listening."},{"rating":"2","title":"guitars are back but the beats remain","review":"Radiohead have reached such a high level on their previous releases that I was willing to purchase this album without having even heard the first single \\"There There\\", and I was not disappointed. After a subtle begining the opening track \\"2+2=5\\" kicks in with more guitars that their last two albums combined. This is short lived however, with the next track reverting back to the electro experimental sounds that have alienated many fans over the last five years. Only two other songs on the album continue in this vain with the remainder of the 14 tracks built around traditional live instruments. Elecronic touches are still evident in many of the tracks, but in a similar way to Blur's \\"Think Tank\\" do not dominate the mix. While this album is far from \\"OK Computer 2\\" as many fans had hoped for, it is far more accessable to the casual music listener (and radio programmer) than either of their previous two albums."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another stunning album from Radiohead","review":"They've done it again. Radiohead presents the world with another beautiful album. While still using alot of the more \\"out-there\\" sounds of Kid A and Amnesiac, they have blended that sound with beautiful melodies and taken out some of the eletronic noises thats characterised their last two albums which makes Hail to the Thief very reminiscent of The Bends and OK Computer. Songs like \\"Sail to the Moon\\" keep the spacey feel of Kid A, but are more stripped down using only piano or guitar. Not to say that this album is just the same old stuff though. It presents alot of new sound, especially on tracks like \\"Backdrifts.\\" All in all, its a great album that is still very much the old Radiohead sound, but also is fresh enough to keep it interesting. Nice work gentlemen!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately Radiohead may have gone a little too far...","review":"Unfortunately Radiohead may have gone a little too far this time. On hearing this album for the first time I wasn't impressed. On saying that I never go on first impressions of an album but on listening to it again for a second and third time something seems missing. There are a few higlights that remind you of songs past such as 'Go to Sleep' & 'There There'. It feels like I have to work to hard at understanding and liking this album. Gone are the days of Thom Yorke's powerful whining in tune. Now he sounds like a choir boy hitting puberty! And to finish off I'm not impressed by the album cover artwork compared with previous masterpieces."},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"Radiohead is one of those rare bands these days whose recording careers progress forward into uncharted territory. If you've only heard \\"Pablo Honey\\" and \\"The Bends\\", this album will take some getting used to as it's extremely complex in its sound compositions. But for those of you who have been listening all along, you'll be instantly pleased with the results. \\"Hail to the Thief\\" synthesizes the lyrical style and tone of \\"OK Computer\\" with the experimental soundscapes of \\"Kid A\\" and \\"Amnesiac\\", resulting in a beat-laden collection of singable, memorable, and intelligent songs. The music has a distinct 'indie' feel which is refreshing for a major-label release, and, of course, is what makes Radiohead so unique. I *highly* recommend this album, especially to those people who loved \\"OK Computer\\" and want an inventive sequel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just as great if not better than O.K. Computer","review":"I really got into Radiohead shortly after buying O.K. Computer and listening to it 10 times a day. I felt I should buy their latest album, just to get me back up to speed and see if they deviated much from the kick-arse music they were so brilliant at creating on O.K.. They haven't, they've only gotten better. As a listener, you shouldn't have to play any specific tracks. This album, like all their others, is meant to be played straight from track 1 to 14, because the lyrics(more like poetry I'd agree)tell one big story, as do the mind-blowing instruments performed by the rest of the band. Radiohead has managed to do what most bands before our time haven't in a long while: remove themselves from a genre and build one of their own. Brilliant stuff. 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fatigue-Inducing","review":"I love Radiohead and have enjoyed all their other releases since the Bends. Unfortunately tough, I have to admit that \\"Hail to the Thief\\" does nothing for me. While the band appears to be continuing to try to expand itself artistically and conquer new ground, it forgot to bring something essential with it -- good songs.I respect the band for pushing the envelope on each new recording, but I think they've gotten too caught up trying to be avant garde and have lost what made them great -- brilliant songs with thought-provoking lyrics that grow on you with each listen.Hail doesn't grow on you at all. In fact, it gets worse with each listen. In fact, after listening to it now about 7 or 8 times now, I find the process to be tiring. And fatigue is not what I'm looking for in a Radiohead release -- sorry guys!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant!","review":"Radiohead has done it again. Like many of their albums, the music is something that you have to soak in, maybe even contemplate, or wonder. I found something haunting about Hail to the Thief, which purveyed a more profound dimension to the band (and to Thom Yorke's chillingly beautiful, versatile voice). I found all of the songs to be very intriguing, creative, experimental, eccentric, and beautiful. The highlight of the whole album for me was \\"A Wolf At the Door,\\" which left me breathless. It somehow touched a certain emotion in me that I can't explain. Radiohead continues to reinvent their sound, creating a innovative concoction of depth, honesty, fear, humor, sadness, and life with darkness and pain. I highly recommend this album along with OK COMPUTER and THE BENDS."},{"rating":"1","title":"my opinion is worth more than yours, trust me","review":"OK Computer, The Bends, and Kid A were good.

There are also too many people saying it is horrible. In my opinion, it is an incredibly ambitious album, but is just much too unpleasant to listen too. There is more sonic experimentation AND rocking, but the problem is that Radiohead has completely lost their soul. It is very intelligent and they definitely put lots of work into it, but all of the abstraction leaves me ice cold and with the feeling that my brain will explode. The problem is that, as with OK Computer, Radiohead is using almost exclusively their brains, and ignoring their most overlooked assets: their souls and emotions."},{"rating":"1","title":"CD Not Playable","review":"Thanks to the RIAA and the VERY restrictive \\"anti- piracy\\" measures used on this CD, I was forced to return the CD to the store (For store credit, as the CD was opened....) due to the CD not being playable on my computer, or mp3 player (the reason i purchased the CD, and which are both legal uses of the CD.

I take recommendations, such as these on Amazon, and I make CD selections based on hype. Radiohead is one of the most heralded bands on the planet, if not THE #1 Rock band. Why? I can't figure it out.OK Computer was a terrific album. It was different. It was enjoyable. But everything else Radiohead has done just bores me to death. Don't get me wrong. I'm not coming on here to bash Radiohead beacuse I don't like them, and I have something against them. I honestly can't figure out what the big deal is. I've found myself listening to their albums, especially this one, over and over again, trying to find something I like. I can't. I just can't find something to like.Hail to the Theif... boring. Mediocre at best. There is not one song on the album that fully captures my attention. Radiohead has done this all before, and it's just making me Yawn this time around. Sorry, it's the truth. My take on the matter."},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess I'm missing something...","review":"After hearing \\"There There\\" a few times I gained a liking for it, and decided to give this album a shot. I've never really listened to Radiohead before, so this probably attributed to my dislike of their style. I'm not saying this album [is horrible]; I'm just saying it doesn't appeal to what I look for in music. I personally look for more energetic, loud, dynamic music with the guitars and drums being the driving factors, as well as a vocalist with a powerful voice. That's just not how Radiohead approaches making music, and no matter how hard I try to enjoy this album I simply can't. I find this album boring and monotonous. I guess I'm just not [into it]."},{"rating":"1","title":"Thin and Hypocritical","review":"Been a big Radiohead fan for several years now, but I have to say this is a weak effort. Too much posturing and white-bread indignation, too little originality. If you're rich and you want to be righteous, try spreading the wealth."},{"rating":"1","title":"a good collection of songs, but not a good album","review":"In comparison to all other radiohead albums, this one is by-far the most uninspirational. The songs just come at you one after another, seemingly pulled out of the hat. The idea to rely on the live audience as a determining factor of which songs to run with (salamanca spain, et al.), is a bad one, primarily because it turns an album into a collection of \\"best of\\" moments not unlike \\"america's funniest home videos.\\" This democratic ideal has weakened the end-product. In their attempts to make it as pleasing as possible to everyone, radiohead missed the opportunity to run with their momentum after their excellent five-star hat-trick: ok computer, kid a and amnesiac. I haven't lost faith in them yet, of course, its only one dud in a sea of brilliance."},{"rating":"1","title":"Past their peak","review":"Radiohead were an amazing band in the ninties but are hard to like today. Hail to the Thief was just too hard to get into. Most of the songs seemed predictable and I just wished Thom Yorke would spit out what he was singing and quit dragging it out, it made it real boring to listen to. The music isn't anything special at all, it comes off as if Radiohead have been stripped down to a conservative joyless band making the present songs sound repetative and dull. There still are a few songs worth hearing that remind you of what Radiohead used to be, but that band is gone leaving the listener with a bitter old man nobody wants to get stuck talking to. This disc is just for the hardcore fans who don't mind being force-fed a sub par only to crap out, in their minds, genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"hail radiohead once again","review":"I dunno why people keep ranting how dissapointing this album was...Well, maybe it's a bit weird like Amnesiac and Kid A...but then, those albums you either love or hate. If you're seeking to try out Radiohead for the first time, get their undeniable gem, Ok Computer. The next three are weirder, and The Bends before OkC is more guitarish.HTTT takes a few spins to get into...but the songs are fabulous.Sail to the Moon is so pretty, it truly takes me away. Myxamotosis is sorta tecnoish. Alot of the songs are kind of dark feeling...but in a good way. There There is really good, and sunds like something from OkC. So does the great Wolf at the Door. It's like a mix of all their stuff.Anyway...I say give this a go, and, while it's not as tripped out as Kid A and Amnesiac...it's not normal either."},{"rating":"1","title":"Oh, please....","review":"The most overrated rock album of 2003. This talented band now seems more interested in being provocative and 'in-your-face' than being musical, and it's a shame. If you want to hear Radiohead at its peak, check out The Bends (1995) and OK Computer (1997). Don't waste your money on this tripe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Album of the Year","review":"I wasn't sure about it on the first listen. I was waiting for the 'grabber' hook. I refused to give it that attention. Then I realized they're putting one over on everyone. They're not making intelligent music as much as they're demanding intelligent listeners. Which is why I think Hail to the Thief is hands down the best album of 2003. It's pure unabashed art rock and despite all the press and Thom's closed book stance, they want more because they're giving more. How ballsy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Geez.","review":"I dunno what happened to bring out all the bad reviews for this album lately...I disliked this album too, because I didn't have a clear view of it at first. After the initial 2 or 3 listens you start to develop a sort of vision of the album as a whole. What I didn't realize is that I felt the same way about Amnesiac and Kid A when I first heard them, and it doesn't seem like I learned my lesson.\\"2+2=5\\" \\"A Punchup at a Wedding\\" \\"Sit Down. Stand Up\\" \\"Sail to the Moon\\" \\"Backdrifts\\" \\"Myxomatosis\\" \\"There There\\" \\"Go to Sleep\\" \\"Where I End and You Begin\\" and \\"Wolf at the Door\\" are all brilliant tracks, and it pains me to think of how I didn't notice their brilliance before. The other tracks shine less, admitingly, but I don't think there's one song on this album that is less than good.Please give it a try. Some people give up too easily."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"Radiohead never cease to amaze me. With every album, something new comes into they're music. Go and buy this album.

You see copies of this album in Canada are copy-protected, which leads to problems when playing it on your computer (Mac or PC), but what is more upsetting is that this same technology was not forced on the US market, where Napster was invented. I actually gave away my Canadian copy and went to the US to buy a non-copy-protected version, since I like making compilations. Oh yeah. And the copy-protected version also skipped on my walkman. Since EMI Canada seems unwilling to compensate or even acknowledge complaints about their defective CDs, I'd recommend buying this just to spite them! However, if you have no desire to rip this CD (for your own copies!), and are going to play it only on a standard CD player (not a discman or computer), then you might want to buy the regular domestic copy, which is no different in these uses."},{"rating":"1","title":"Radiohead dissapoints","review":"I was feverishly anticipating this album, and when I bought I didn't like what I heard. I find Radiohead's music very accessible and can like one of their songs on the first listen. But this album does not make me happy like other Radiohead albums do. It doesn't really have on objective, I hate to say this but it sounds like Thom Yorke, the Greenwood Bros. and company are starting to go pop. This album is like non-convincing theatre rock. It tries to sound really dark and dramatic but it's not. It doesn't sound like any effort or emotion was put into this, like it was thrown together in a couple of weeks and put it on sale.Hopefully, Radiohead will ante up a little the next album.PS: Awesome title, Dean 2004!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"THOM WILL BOW TO HASSELHOFF","review":"Hail to the Theif = good758 chodes thinking that THEIR review will be special = badDAVID HASSELHOFF IS THE GREATEST SINGER EVER!!!the song \\"Hot Shot City\\" is particularly good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still a Creep.","review":"Are we as stupid as they think we are?

I don't like being duped into buying rubbish like this by those deluded, self-satisfied music critics. You're on thin ice Thom. You better make the next album worth my while or I'll be starting a new anti-radiohead site in the near future. It will most certainly talk about your selling out to the music industry, and how for the last fours you have been lazily resting on your laurels and relying on your loyal fan base to buy whatever mish-mash you decide to put out there. It's time for honesty, and some real soul searching. If this is the best you can do then you guys should stop making albums, because I for one will not stand for your half-hearted efforts."},{"rating":"1","title":"...","review":"It gives me no pleasure to say that this record is damning evidence that Radiohead really isn't a great band anymore!The End"},{"rating":"1","title":"radiohead is extremely overrated","review":"this is a band that had a wonderful single over a decade ago called Creep. it was beautiful. then they went art rock and everything that they have released after that has been painfully dull, overbloated, overhyped, extremely simply, and amaturish. radiohead is a great way to make yourself want to hurt someone or go into a coma. they are way overrated. they are talented, but rarely use that talent. just because something is popular doesn't mean that it is good. it just means that most of the idiots agreed on something. radiohead is a one hit wonder"},{"rating":"1","title":"good grief","review":"I have a feeling the perception of this album in many cases has to do with whether someone fell in love with their early sound or not. This band seemed to write actual SONGS up through OK Computer. Kid A and Amnesiac had much self-indulgent noodling, but still delivered the occasional gem. Hail to the Thief simply discards anything accessible and takes the worst noodling aspects of the previous two albums to the extreme. Sure it's wonderfully produced but it just doesn't grab me in any way. The songs are generally agitated and dissonant, but with no melodies to allow Thom's vocals to go straight to the heart--a quality I saw as the hallmark of this band.I guess Capitol is forcing radio to play the first couple singles, because they certainly can't be connecting with anyone on their own merits. Which isn't to say they have to be a radio-friendly band, but Electioneering from OK Computer sounds like a bubblegum hit next to this stuff."},{"rating":"1","title":"Man this sucks","review":"This cd sucks bad. its horrible. slow and steady dosent win the race hear. it sounds like one huge long song. the music videos are really bad. i think this could win one of the worst bands alive award. that or ok computer. be free to e-mail me if u wont to argue about it."},{"rating":"1","title":"No Go","review":"Somewhere in the half-way wasteland between the great OK Comp and the somewhat interesting Kid A, this album is NOWHERE.

Pass on this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Save Your Money","review":"This is more way-out-there stuff liek Kid A and you should only purchase this album if you are a devout Radiohead fan. If you are new to Radiohead or are just looking for some great music from this band, purchase The Bends instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Anyone else's ears bleeding after a listen???","review":"Well....I should probably start this off by saying I really, really love \\"The Bends\\". It's in the top5 of my collection, and gets played regularly. I picked up some of Radiohead's other offerings with the hope I'd find another \\"Bends\\" to add to my collection....I could not have been more disappointed. I don't care for the \\"electronic-techno\\" sound they employ so often...and this album just continues that course. Initially I was sort of hopeful, as 2+2=5 sounds as though it could grow on you....but it didn't. Weird pinging sounds with \\"fax machine screeches\\" interrupted occasionally by a Thom Yorke wail do not equal good music for me. To be quite honest I'm left wondering if the rest of the reviewers here have lost their minds? (or, more likely, their hearing?) This is awful and left me wondering how I could love EVERY track from \\"The Bends\\" and yet not find one other Radiohead offering worth listening to..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"The instrumentation of the main disc is great, the bonus disc is good as well. I especially liked the extended intro of \\"I Will\\" and \\"Fog (Again).\\" I have not yet looked at the dvd, but I did like the map-poster thing."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Artistic Oddity","review":"I find this to be an interesting album. It is like Thom Yorke took 'Ok Computer', 'Kid A' and 'Amnesiac' and blended them together to form 'Hail To The Thief'. I can agree with the other reviewers that this album does lack some flow. But, Radiohead has never been able to fit into some sort of formula.This album takes longer to \\"get into\\", so to speak. I had to listen to it a few times to truly appreciate it. I remember feeling the same way with 'Kid A', and I like that album a lot now. I really like the title of this album and how it corelates with the 2000 election. I find Radiohead's tongue and cheek response funny.I think this album does fit into any Radiohead fan's collection. Its a good album, but maybe not as brilliant as Kid A, The Bends, or Ok Computer. It is still good stuff. If you are new to Radiohead, this may not be the best album to start off with. Try 'The Bends' or 'Ok Computer.'"},{"rating":"2","title":"The essential Radiohead album","review":"I've been a fan of Radiohead ever since The Bends came out, and although I began missing those \\"actual\\" \\"songs\\", I did really like a lot of the experimentation the fellas had going on with recent albums like Kid A and Amnesiac. HTTT, however, begins to bring all of Radiohead's work full-circle, encompassing not just melodies (actual melodies!!) that you can sing along to, but still the progressiveness Radiohead fans have come to expect from this band of all bands. Hail to the Thief is undoubtedly Radiohead's best work to date. Five stars and a huge thank you to this Oxford quintet for sticking to their guns and giving real, good music to the world during a time when that's something that's really difficult to find."},{"rating":"2","title":"Convince yourself","review":"I own all the official Radiohead albums. They all have something that make them unique, something that I can't explain with words, some magic that I couldn't find in another band. Some people doesn't like the experimental era (Kid A and Amnesiac) but I think of this era as a natural evolution in Radiohad's music. Hail to the thief continues with the electronic exploration but it's more rock oriented. What I'm saying is more evident in the first track 2 + 2 = 5 Slow tempo songs are present in this album too: The beauty There there and the suplicant Scatter brain In conclusion this album is unique as every Radiohead album is. Listen to it and convince yourself.Er... Did I mention the excelent CD cover and artwork?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Radiohead Rocks my Socks!","review":"I started listening to Radiohead hardcore with this album, and I must say it is amazing.The songs on here are melodramatic, yet perfect, crazy, yet crazy enjoyable.Definitely need to check out this album about 30,000 X million times."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Buy This CD","review":"Much like the previous Radiohead albums, this one will need to grow on you. Once it does you can't get enough. From start to finish they keep you interested with Pink Floydish tunes, and that typical Thom Yorke flare. You won't be disappointed with Hail to the Thief."},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent album with some filler","review":"First of all I'm a huge Radiohead fan. I own all of their albums and love them all. Hail to the Thief is no exception, although it was somewhat harder for me to get into than the Bends and Ok Computer.Pros: -An excellent album with several great songs (Great songs on this album are 2+2=5, Go to Sleep, There There, Drunken Punchup at a Wedding, Where you end and I begin, Myxomatosis, and A wolf at the door.)-Inventive and Unique like you would expect from Radiohead-Its Radiohead-A very diverse and excellent collection of songsCons: -It doesn't really flow-contains some songs that are mediocre and some that are tediousYou have to give this album a chance because there is a lot of good stuff here. There is a good chance that you will hate this album the first time you hear it, because I did. Don't give up on it. It gets better each time you listen to it.Buy this album! You won't regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not their best","review":"I'm not surprising anyone by saying that this is not their best album, because it isn't. That's not saying much though. This is a great album in itself. I like to see them getting away from the sounds of Kid A and Amnesiac, great albums but definately a different sound from the previous albums. In my opinion if Radiohead had never released an album and this was their debut everyone would love this. But, as we all know Radiohead has released a couple of the greatest albums released in the recent past, with The Bends and OK computer. Final Verdict: Good Album, not their best."},{"rating":"2","title":"absolutely brilliant","review":"radiohead's new album 'hail to the thief' took me a few listens like every radiohead album with the exception of 'pablo honey' to love. the songs are brilliantly crafted, and the overall feel of the album is superb. I don't want to necessarily say that this is the best radiohead album, but it's RIGHT up there with 'OK Computer' and 'The Bends'. genius."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice..","review":"It seems that after four years of vastly electronic experimentation, Radiohead has incorporated more of their rock influences into the Kid A and Amnesiac formula. I personally think that this is a great album, and a great expansion on the musical ideas expressed in the aforementioned efforts. Hail to the Thief is far more versatile, with song writing that rivals that of OK Computers. Not that I didn't like Kid A and Amnesiac, but they were just missing something that Computer had and that Thief has. Anyway, I suppose that's that."},{"rating":"2","title":"very, very good","review":"this cd is quite awesome. the first track (\\"2+2=5\\") starts off with the guitar getting plugged in, and that's pretty rad. the whole cd is good, but i wouldnt say its as good as \\"The Bends\\" or \\"Ok Computer\\". either way its a good cd. if your a die-hard radiohead fan, get the special edition one. it has a free poster and it comes in its own unique way.(youll know what im talking about if you get it.) if your just a fan that likes \\"creep\\" and/or \\"optomistic\\", then get the normal edition."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fans Deserve Better","review":"This album proves that it is possible to blow your money on a Radiohead CD. Radiohead is a unique band that can play two completely different styles of music (prog rock and experimental) exeptionaly well. Unfortunatly, this album proves that they cannot bridge this gap. There are three good songs on this ablum; \\"there there\\", \\"where i end and you begin\\", and \\"a wolf at the door.\\" All the rest of the songs are [garbage]. For most bands, this would be an ok album, but I expect more from Radiohead."},{"rating":"2","title":"More of the same from a great band","review":"This album sounds like a slightly more guitar based version of Amnesiac. By overall mood and sound the band's description as \\"OK computer II\\" is not too far off - (HTTT is a bit more depressing even). However it's songs lack the elemental quality that make the songs on OK, the Bends and Kid A so fantastic.Overall a good album with all the rich texture and complexity we expect from Radiohead, but a bit less inspired than previous releases."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing worth keeping","review":"Terrible Terrible Terrible.

Radiohead has done it, they're simply amazing...Everyone should expand their horizons and listen to radiohead ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Meal Fit For A Thief...","review":"Naw, even a thief would trash this pathetic excuse for an album. As much as it pains me to do it, I must agree with all the negative reviews here. This is boring. This is mind-numbing. This is poor. This is tired. This is nothingness. Actually, even nothingness is more than this CD. I'm guessing the 5-star reviewers are misguided fools that think they're shining with some sort of perceived superiority. Don't make me laugh. They're obviously not as slick as they think they are. They don't know why they like this album. They just like it cuz it's Radiohead. This is a hammy disasterpiece. Radiohead have disappointed me 3 times in a row. How can one of my favorite bands of all time disappoint me 3 times in a row?Make way for disappointment #4."},{"rating":"1","title":"Still not back to their best, but give it a chance","review":"I was hoping this album would see a return to the form of OK Computer or The Bends (though to even come close to equalling those two superb albums would be amazing) so was quite disappointed when I first listened to this album.While it is not as experimental as \\"Kid A\\" or \\"Amnesiac\\", thank goodness, it still has quite a few tracks that could be straight out of those two albums, complete with random noises and unintelligible or pointless lyrics. However, there are a few tracks that are reminders of the good old days: \\"There There\\" (by far the best track on the album), \\"Where I end and you begin\\", \\"2+2=5\\" and \\"A punchup at a wedding\\"The songs that fall somewhere between the good stuff and the experimental stuff tend to grow on you though, so if the stuff that is reminiscent of Kid A (buzzing noise and pointless lyrics) is ignored, this album is pretty good, rather than just average."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hail to the Thief","review":"Hail to the Thief being Radiohead's 6th studio album and their 2003 release was met with positive reviews by the critics and did also very well with the general public. Allmusic, IGN and Pitchfork Media all gave it high marks. The album reached nr 1 in the UK and nr 3 in the US. Three singles were released on this album. These being, i.e., \\"There There\\", \\"Go to Sleep\\" and \\"2 + 2 = 5\\". All the lyrics are included in the booklet and we also get a personnel list that lists what they played. 4/5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not my favorite radiohead, but still awesome","review":"I bought this cd the day that it was released, went home and listened to it, and was not dissapointed. I had heard there there on the radio and was not overly impressed with it, but i found with Hail to the Thief, that the more you listen to it, the more it grows on you. After hearing it many many many more times there there became a favorite song of mine (also after seeing the video numerous time) along with the songs Wolf at the Door, Stand Up Sit Down, 2+2=5, and the Gloaming. Those are just some of my favorites though, because the whole CD is outstanding. I've heard people call this OK computer II, which is remotly true, as it starts up from where OK Computer left off. Truly a good Radiohead album."},{"rating":"2","title":"And I don't even like them","review":"I've never really liked Radiohead, the singer's voice kind of annoys me, but this album blew me away. I still think they're pretentious but here they actually pull it off without it being embaressing, which is pretty rare in music. There are so many different forms of music going on in this album it can take a while to digest, my suggestion is finding a favorite and listening to the rest of the album every time you want to hear that. That's what got me to love it. Backdrifts is just cool."},{"rating":"2","title":"Music at a higher level","review":"ANyone who did not give this record a 5 star rating is full of crap.

Man...this album (despite the political connotations) is just plain off the chain. WhoA!"},{"rating":"1","title":"a catchy mistake","review":"Although this album sounds as good as anything else they've recorded, I think conceptually the boys have sort of lost their way. One doesn't release two ground-breaking works of near genius and THEN decide to tackle \\"the big issues\\" like politics. I mean, I tend to cringe whenever politics enter music at all. Again, sounds lovely, but the ham-fisted title and cover art put me off. Feels like a career miss-step. Anyway, I'm not going to buy it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Don't refuse","review":"Hands' down the best album of 2003.Haunting and disturbing all the way out,But yet very catchy music that well never leave until you die.A must."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Pros.","review":"There are far too many negative comments on this review board. I would have to say that this is one of a very few \\"new\\" albums I own, but it is one of the best I have. Granted, these songs are strange and sometimes embarassing, but give them a chance and they will find their way into your heart with no judgements attached. I am not going to go into what songs are good, and what songs are bad. Find out for you self, they will move around on your charts. You wont like them all at once, or hate them all at once. There will always be 2 or 3 that stick out when you listen, and they will change, then eventually you put the CD away and find something else.

It's such a good song i can just listen to it over and over again. Although, all the songs are wonderful.

Not that Kid A and Amnesiac were not great, but I think most fans have been waiting for more of the guitars and style that made OK Computer great. Hail to the Thief combines the experimentation of Kid A & Amnesiac with the listenability and structure of The Bends and OK Computer. I don't believe this is a love-it-at-first-listen album. It took me 5 listens before I \\"got it\\". That is how the best albums usually are. Every style of Radiohead (to this point!) is represented here. Every track is good in it's own way- there are no garbage songs. It's hard to pick highlights, but \\"2+2=5\\", \\"Sail to the Moon\\", \\"Where I end and you Begin\\", and \\"Myxomatosis\\" are the very best. Enjoy, and see them live if you can!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Exceptional","review":"Perfect blend of old school Radiohead and the newer sound. If you want another OKComputer, look elsewhere.

No longer does he brood in the depths of his own psyche; He now lives in the same world we do, and he is quite worried about it. This new found sobriety and connectedness of his permiates both his lyrics and voice. Every track is no longer an exsistensial life observation; character sketches and pictures of moments in the band's life make up the majority of the songs. This is not a new Radiohead by any means, but it is one that has changed with time. If you follow this band, you must own this album."},{"rating":"2","title":"difficult ryhtems, rich music, strange voice but very attaractive though","review":"The voices on this recording are strange. The rythems seem to produce another Kid A, but the guitars are for instance always around in order to make an impression. This is not simple rock music. After a few times listening to this you will appreciate this more or you will not. Some songs even I do not like, four stars In my opinion 1, 5 and 6 and 11 are great."},{"rating":"2","title":"It grows on me every day","review":"My only problem with this album is that it barely rocks at all, and is a little depressing (2+2=5 being the exception).

A great album that should not be missed."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a beutiful Album","review":"I have to admit that i was warry that Radiohead was going to go with the Kid A type sound, but when i listened to it... wow.

I just love it so much."},{"rating":"2","title":"radiohead reigns again","review":"with a modern-sounding mixture of ok computer and kid a giving a soundtrack to fear of the present world, radiohead have proven themselves yet again.i can only give it 4 stars though, cuz 4 of these songs don't seem to sit well with me (backdrifts, the gloaming, i will, punch up at a wedding). maybe they're great, but they don't stick in my head. the other songs are great though."},{"rating":"2","title":"All Hail Radiohead","review":"I love this album. I also love Radiohead. This album is pretty gritty. The song \\"I Will\\" is one of my all time favorites. The album art is very good too. Also pretty lengthy. Very good quality.

Some songs are beguiling as good but are just mediocre with excellent production. But as usual with Radiohead, many of the songs are chilling. But because I have to press 'skip' so many times I never want to put it on. So it collects dust."},{"rating":"1","title":"Amazing Album but Copy Protected","review":"This album is copy protected so you won't be able to play it on your MP3 player, on your computer (without their software which didn't work for me), on some Car stereos and even on some home stereos!Tell them what you think about this sort of thing by taking your money elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"They have done it yet again!","review":"I agree with another reviewer about the first song of a CD being critical to how the rest of the CD is going to be. Track #1 does show the band's diversity in that it is a little bit rock, a little punk, and of course a little trippy. Now track #2 is one of my favorites on the CD. Not much lyrically, but who cares. This is classic Radiohead, meaning that they are the best at climactic rock. That's what they do! Build you up little by little and eventually hit you with this array of sounds and guitars mixed that just seem to make sense. I only have 1000 words here, so in closing, buy the CD and listen to it very loudly with headphones!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not quite Fridge buzz......","review":"If you were an English band who came to full power in the Mid Nineties with a genuine classic like \\"Ok Computer\\", then imagine how you would feel trying to follow that up.How Radiohead handled that is by what I would call, total stylistic shifting. They dropped much of the 3 guitar interplay that was so unique with them and replaced it with some seriously different electronica sounds. However, the inner sound of the band was not masked but highlighted. I myself was a bit lost with this shift (KID A)at first, but found myself stretching out to finally enjoy a change of pace.The new album HTTT, is a bit of a compromise from the keyboard based \\"new\\" Radiohead sound and the guitar based sound we all came to love.With that said, it is only logical for them to return to what they enjoyed in the first place, while keeping it new and fresh to still intrigue them.2=2=5 is a fantastic example of this. Thom sings quite well throughout....."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just because you feel it","review":"as a follower of RADIOHEAD for several years, with each album they always end up surprising me in new ways. 'hail to the thief,' however, has been one of the bigger suprises. although, it seems to be a \\"political\\" album, with references to george orwell's <u>1984</u> and the infamous \\"hail to thief title\\" (actually dating back to an election about a hundred years ago), it can also been seen in many other different lights. it can mean whatever you want it to mean, not just a an album about whatever title it displays. it is less \\"comupter blippy,\\" a depature from the art project 'AMNESIAC.' more musical and intricate. i believe spin magazine had a pretty acutate artical about it in their june issue of 2003. check it out it's worth it. the cd i mean."},{"rating":"2","title":"I must be losin' it...","review":"...'cos I think Myxamotosis is by far and away the best track, and others who've commented seem to think its all a bit weird. So many layers, so many conflicting and complementary beats.A juicy bit of work with something for everyone...except all those whiners who want them to do OK Computer all over again (which still wasn't their best album). Anyone who wants to re-live the past glories, buy Christopher O'Reilly's 'true love waits' which is a beautiful mix of the old stuff.The band knew that another Kid A or Amnesiac effort would finally alientate their fan-base (I wasn't taken with either unless I'm listening to them with the other 3 albums on 'random'), so they compromised...and as compromises go, this is a good one.Buy it if you've grown-up with them. If you're still stuck in your old groove and haven't matured, then go get yourselves the White Stripes and re-live your waining youth."},{"rating":"2","title":"I am absolutely Blown Away!","review":"All my life, I have been listening to Modern/Alternative Rock bands such as; Linkin Park, Nickelback, and Hoobastank. I have to say, I am fed up with that genre of music. They all use the same style, technique, and cheesey lyrics. I recently picked up this album by recomendation of a friend. I have to say, that this is the best album I have ever listened to. Radiohead uses eerie lyrics and vocals, mezmerizing special effects, and awsome guitar techniques. I know that alot of other reviewers say that Radiohead's previous albums were better. This is possible, but I fell that this album is better than previous albums the Mainstream has had to offer."},{"rating":"2","title":"When will everyone else catch up?????","review":"Hail to the Theif-again, Radiohead puts out music that is truely by itself. I love the Orwell references on this one. If you have a half a brain you can read between the lines of this one and see that radiohead has alot to say about the world in the state that it is currently in and of course, Thom Yorke articulates it so freakin' well. The only critizism I have of this album is that it lacks the \\"flow\\" of albums like Kid A and OK Computer. This album is very disjointed and to me just seems like a collection of songs rather than a full expression like previous effort. But none the less this album has got some great tunes. If you are just discovering Radiohead, this may be a good album to begin with"},{"rating":"2","title":"Without Peer","review":"With apologies to Bono and the U2 boys, Radiohead is far and away the greatest rock band on the planet.\\"Hail\\" only gets 4 stars because you can only compare Radiohead to Radiohead and \\"OK Computer\\" and \\"Kid A\\" are the gold standard.Moreover, you have to listen to these albums first (plus the Bends and Amnesiac) to really get everything that happens in this album.Radiohead is a growing, linear band that evolves over time.

OK Computer was the group's best, and they should have left it there. \\"Hail To The Theif\\" sounds like they were bored when they recorded it and takes the enjoyment out of listening to the few decent tracks with waaaaaaay to much politicizing. (If I wanted to get opinions on politics, I could turn on CNN) Even if you love Radiohead, skip this new (and hopefully last) CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not like normal Radiohead","review":"I was rather dissapointed with the new Radiohead CD \\"Hail to the Theif\\". Most of the music was reminiscent of techno and new age computer generated music, now I see why they singled \\"There, There\\" mainly because it was one of the few not totally digitalized songs on \\"Hail to the Theif\\". If you like songs from Radiohead like Creep, Karma Police, or pretty much any song off all of Radiohead's previous albums then you probably won't like \\"Hail to the Theif\\". I suggest going to a local store or your friend's and sampling the tracks. Most of them sound like the Radiohead song Ideoteque. I hope this review helps you, I didn't want to come out here and just shout and bash the album, I just wouldn't recommend it if you like old Radiohead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Getting old","review":"Their problem with self-importance is getting old. I loved The Bends and OK Computer, but I don't see how anyone could be intellectually honest and think this is good. If I want to listen to musical experiments then I'll put on late period Coltrane or Schoenberg. Different or experimental does not equal good. This is not good. Rock experiments usually don't work so I think I'll put on Beggars Banquet."},{"rating":"1","title":"today the world gets sick of radiohead","review":"rotten album. yorks inane ramblings and over-used falsetto make virtually every song impossible to listen to.

While 'critics' leap aboard Radiohead's gladwagon and hail this as yet-another jewel in the groups crown, I've finally exhausted not-only my patience but my pocketbook.If Radiohead were U2, O.K. Computer would be their Joshua Tree and everything after would be the turgid, euro-garbage that has made U2 the despised sellouts they are.Join me and send Yorke and the rest a clear and concise message: We aren't buying your 'brilliance' any more.

I do not understand why Radiohead is seen as such an amazing, groundbreaking band.The only thieves I see here are Thom Yorke and co. They started off as imitators of grunge (remember \\"Creep?\\") and now are imitating Aphex Twin -- from five years ago.You can like them if you like, but this is only innovating because MTV2 wants you to think so.Just buy \\"OK Computer\\" or \\"The Bends,\\" it is all the Radiohead you'll ever need."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and Dissapointing","review":"Although this release isn't half as bad as the two latest Radiohead albums, it doesn't represent anything new or goundbreaking. The lead singers voice is particually bad on this album; he constantly sounds as though he is about to cry!!! All the songs blend into each other and it will soon be put on the shelf.... for ever. Stick to their early stuff up to OK Computer to avoid dissapointment. AVOID at all cost."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clogging the used bins of the world","review":"I recently returned from a trip to London where I saw this CD in so many used bins I thought it was a mistake. Apparently Radiohead's dated and whiny pseudo-political message wore thin mighty quickly over in the UK, and it's done the same here. Political albums are boring, trite, heavy-handed, doctrinaire, and simplistic. Every song on this album is political in nature, featuring a band that plays its laptops pretty average while the whiniest, most morose vocalist of the 20th century croons like Gene Pitney on thorazine, whining about political crises in another country as if Justin Timberlake decided to take on the Sierra Leone civil war in a rock concept album. Bland, uninspired, force-fed and critically overrated like no other \\"band\\" I've heard."},{"rating":"2","title":"Superb","review":"I don't have much to say. I think this album makes Radiohead's sound concrete. They've spent the last years gathering new sounds and ideas and now they are laying them out on the table and picking from them. Working to get a perfect mixture. Some say this is a re-hash of the same sound but its not. It's the same ideas. And they've earned the right to settle momentarily before going out again. A very political album without being direct. That shows artistic maturity. If you're a Radiohead fan then you don't even need to read this because I'm sure you've had your mind made up. They could have made an album full of kazoos and still would have found the perfect melody. Even their B-sides can't be touched by any other band. ALL HAIL TO THE THIEF!"},{"rating":"2","title":"....and the raindrops","review":"Radiohead are back at it again and from the first song on the album you know that they are back with guitars strapped on. The album is definitely a blend of the different elements that made their past albums so incredible. It does takes a few listens to really appreciate the album, but as you listen more of its moments standout and the better it gets. Less earth shattering than their last two releases, but I don't think that detracts from its greatness. If you haven't realized already Radiohead is the greatest band of this generation and they keep proving it over and over again. Even without redefining themselves or rock music this time, they prove that they can just rock. One of the few bands worth the hype. Just brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"great album","review":"easily my second favorite radiohead album before in rainbows has several great songs none are to alike to each other and like the artwork was very confusing at first but the more i look at it the more it makes sense. great buy you will not be dissapointed"},{"rating":"2","title":"More Brilliance","review":"This album serves as an excellent balance and cumulation of Radiohead's previous attempts. The Bends characterizing rock sound is prevalent in tracks like \\"2+2=5\\" the swirling virtuosity of OK Computer that gave the band their name is present on \\"There there\\" and \\"A Wolf at the Door\\" and the dark electronic sound of Kid A can be heard on \\"Backdrifts\\" and \\"The Gloaming.We also get a look at some of Radiohead's more experimental sound like \\"We Suck Young Blood\\" which is a great track, and \\"Sit Down Stand Up\\" which sounds pretty normal until it bursts into a frenzy. Radiohead are not treading on completely shocking and new sound, like they did with Kid A, but they are still the best at what they do, and this album will most definetly stand as a strong attempt, if not a peak, in their incredible catalog. I cannot wait to here what is next, strongly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just great","review":"Like all Radiohead albums, it has to grow on you.

Peterson provides some fundamental reasons as to why the black community has not reached it's full potential. We are the only race that has completely politicized our culture. In return we have recieved promises and rhetoric, and yet the chasm that seperates the black community grows wider.His assessment of our so-called leadership is also dead on.

Unfortunately, once I started reading, I found it too difficult to suspend my disbelief that the hero could continue his masquerade as a therapist, when the whole misunderstanding could have (and should have, professionally speaking) been cleared up in less than 5 minutes. Actually, I blame the editor for not giving Ms. Nichols' reading public credit for more intelligence than this. I also found it hard to like Maggie, the main female character, because of her whining.

The songs almost sound familiar, even on first hearing, but this isn't to say they aren't original: it's just that they seem to talk of things you know. I can't listen to it without pictures flowing through my mind...but then I try to make them go away so I can concentrate on the incredible technique.

They want to say, \\"Oh, it was so easy to be a kid back then\\" or \\"Kids today...\\"-which was said during the time of Julius Ceaser(3000 years ago)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great \\"early X-er movie\\".","review":"\\"My Bodyguard\\" is a genuine and enduring \\"little\\" movie from the late 70's, that I've always regarded as the first great movie of Generation X. Great early performances by Matt Dillon and Adam Baldwin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie!","review":"I remember when this movie was first on ON-TV, I begged my grandpa to videotape it (on his old Betamax machine). He did, and I wanted to watch it every time I came over to visit. Of course, my grandpa thought I wanted to watch it for all of the swearing, but I loved the story. I've always loved movies about the underdog triumphantly outwitting the bad guy. This is just one of those movies you have to love!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A terrific film","review":"This is a terrific movie. The plot concerns a boy named Clifford (Chris Makepeace) who's new to a Chicago high school. He quickly becomes the target of Moody, the school bully (Matt Dillon). Rather than put up with Moody and his friends, Clifford gets Linderman (Adam Baldwin) to be his bodyguard. Everyone at the school is terrified of Linderman, but he and Clifford become close friends. There are also a few scenes with Martin Mull as Clifford's father, a hotel manager, and Ruth Gordon as his grandmother. It's a very sweet film with superb performances from all the actors. I would recommend it to just about anyone, although there is a little bit of swearing and some mild violence. Overall, though, it's a great film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good Movie","review":"I didn't care for this movie, the first time I saw it. I watched it a second time and I really liked it.

It was sensless and lame. The fighting scenes in it were so fake. All this film was about is this little wimpy kid who decides to hire and pay a strong kid to protect him from the other bullies. Thats all this is about. This was one painful movie to watch."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's a collector/display item - not a toy!","review":"I bought this boat as a toy but discovered it's really only made as a display piece. Here's what I wish I knew before I bought it:- First, I should have taken the product description more literally. When it says \\"for collector's only\\" that means that it's not designed to be used as a toy. It says age 8 and up but that's only if there's an 8 yr old content to leave it on a shelf.- The tin motor does function, but it's made from very thin/bendable tin and the fragile nature of it prevents it from functioning in water. Just the resistance of the water prevents it from spinning - when you lift it out of the water, it will slowly unwind.- The wood is very dense and when in the water, the bow actually dips below the water.- I don't think it was constructed with water-use in mind. After getting wet, the glue that holds the blue seats in the boat starts to soften and the seats will come off.Bottom line - it's a display item only - not a toy that can be used."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring book","review":"I expected this to be a book, which would reveal all the secrets of Kenyan runners and take my own running to another level. I was a bit disappointed at first but when I started reading it more I found it very inspiring. It teaches you how crazy actually the Kenyan runners are with their training. This book does give training examples of what the Kenyans do but they are more like just \\"samples\\" of the training and it's hard to get a big picture. If you want to learn the secrets of Kenyan runners, forget it -- there are no secrets. These guys just train so hard that it would be a wonder if they wouldn't be world class runners. If you want find out what it takes to be a world class runner, this book could be your choice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Inspiring, Informative and a Runner's MUST","review":"A total break from the boring running books.

Both side had a hard time to get their troops to fight in the early stages of the war as there was little racial / national hatred between the germans and the english. Watch the history channel episode about christmas 1914 in the trenches and see if these are the same blood crazed barbaric germans that were bayonetting women and children. All of these claims have been discredited, I find it hard to believe people still waste their time writing books on it, and more incredible to find people wasting their time reading those books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Tell a lie often enough..........","review":"It amazes me that after 90 years there are people still trying to revive old anti-German propaganda myths from WWI. All these supposed attrocities were investigated after the war and found to be totaly false.Even the Belgian government,when it investigated the allegations made in the infamous Bryce Report,couldn't find any evidence to support the stories.And I think you will have a pretty tough time trying to convince people that the Belgians were covering up for the Germans!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally the truth comes out","review":"Much atrocities were committed on Turks and Moslems under the tutelege of European powers towards the end of the 19th century and the first quarter of the 20th century. European powers just watched it as they did in Bosnia recently.In western sources these atrocities and genocide against the moslems by the christian subjects of the empire were flip-flopped and many histories talk about moslem atrocities against christian subjects. FINALLY THE TRUTH COMES OUT. Excellent book-highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Politicized history","review":"While physically attractive, this book is very one-sided history by a writer who is known primarily for defending the Ottoman state against charges of genocide. If you are looking for a positive portrayal of the Ottomans from a nationalist Turkish perspective, look no further, but if you want an objective account of the late Ottoman period, you'd best look elsewhere.It is nonetheless interesting to see the same degree of partisanship displayed by the other reviewers below who rate this book highly: The reviewer \\"Holdwater\\" for instance, has (as I write this) written just eight reviews for Amazon. All are on the Ottoman Empire/Turkey and its relations with its Armenian and Greek citizens. He gives five-star ratings to the pro-Turkish books, and one-star ratings to books critical of Turkey or the Turks. His reviews are thus more propagandistic than even-handed assessments - a comment that also, unfortunately, applies to this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hired Lobbyist at Work","review":"The author of this book has made new headway into the the field of historical revisionism and distortion of historical data. The book gives stats that include many numerous victims of the Turkish state's genocidal mentality. Kurds and Arabs who revolted against the Ottoman political system are included in a highly suspect death toll. This is classic genocide denial that attempts to blame the victim-Armenians,Assyrians, and Hellenes.Given the fact that the author has spoken to the U.S. Congress on behalf of Turkish Embassy front organizations, one begins to understands that the author is a Turkish government subsidized bookeeper and far from a true scholar."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke on second use","review":"I've used two prong cork pullers for many years - they're my favorite way to open wine.

The good news is: Given that we create our beliefs, we also can eleminate them thus freeing ourselves to \\"be\\" in the world differently than before.He goes on to explain where the process can be used and how our institutions, government and world can be truly changed.The book is a quick read with excellent case histories that allow the reader to \\"relate\\" to the person being facilitated and also understand how the process works.

I grew up with their music.I rediscovered them in 2006 and enjoy their happy and simple music as much now, as I did over 30 years ago. More than a sentimental attachment, ABBA was truly a great and pioneering pop music group. They suffered the misfortune of existing during the early 70's to early 80's, when rock music was more prevalent.I own another ABBA documentary DVD which goes from their beginnings to 1999. This one continues up to 2004, for the five year anniversary of the hit musical \\"Mama Mia\\". There's more coverage of live ABBA performances in this documentary.

While the bulk of Cipher Method is high bpm beat-driven melodies, there are some features that seperate Negative Format from other bands in the genre. The vocals are slightly distorted, and tend to drone on robotically. This leads to lots of repetition in the songs, but it's also a very useful tool for conveying the technological theme of the lyrics. The music itself is also repetitve in regards, with synth-loops and sequences abound (definitely demonstrating some instrumental trance influences). So if you're looking for something that deviates from the militant electro sound of Funkervogt and :wumpscut:, or just want something a little lighter in the way of aggro-industrial music in general, Cipher Method is worth a listen."},{"rating":"2","title":"Negative format is in the techno-trance genre","review":"Negative Format has a generative beat layered with the propulsive lyrics which describe our retro-techno age. Ifind it both enlightening and hypnotic."},{"rating":"1","title":"Same Album #3","review":"Just like Negative Format's first 2 albums, this new one is just the same song over & over & over again. The only difference this time is that the song titles are far more computer-geek related. Someone's been watching \\"The Matrix\\" & \\"Bladerunner\\" a little too often by the looks of it. The vocals are little more than cliche themed spoken word processed through lots of computer sounding distortion and no song has any obvious verse/chorus hook to it. This EBM band continues trying to convince people that it's Trance now, but that's not the case at all. Even the most generic instrumental Trance has more musical punch & catchiness to it than this does. If you enjoy unimaginative background music whipped up on a laptop computer, then you may like this.

The plotting and prose are pedestrian, which is to say about as exciting as watching someone take an afternoon stroll. Yes, it's set in New Jersey, and it's not an awful book, but it has nothing to do with the wonderful insanity of \\"The Sopranos\\" or the bittersweet intensity of a Bruce Springsteen song. Harry Rane misses his wife and his job and drives around his niche of the Garden State in search of meaning, even if he doesn't say it in so many words. Then he gets involved in the troubles of a childhood friend, which leads to further complications involving an old lover, the consequences of which are obvious to anyone who's ever read a mystery/crime novel.

It is funny how many of the reviewers for this book say Judith Lansdowne is back which is an indication, I think, on just how many of her devoted fans feel that she has left in the first place!! Just in Time just is not that intereting a story and really lacks in the romance department. I do not mind the 40-something romance. But the real romance and fun that can be found in some of her best books, The Bedevilled Duke, Annabella's Diamond, Balmorrow's Bride and Camilla's Fate, is missing.

Man, this cat jams on his 8-string and has brought some great vocal talent to his music. I saw him recently here in Los Angeles with Norah Jones and the perfomance was so enlightening, groovey and energized! If you enjoy jazz, from traditional to groovey to funky to even tribal (he's got Mos Def laying down some tribal vocals on his first track!), this is a must listen! He's got some free downloads [on his website]too..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Vocalists are key","review":"Although I've generally enjoyed the instrumental work of Charlie Hunter, what makes this album rate five stars is the variety of vocal artists he's gathered. From the low, swinging tones of Kurt Elling and the poetic, smooth stylings of Mos Def to Theryl de Clouet's great turn on Earth Wind and Fire's \\"Mighty Mighty,\\" the album really flows. Norah Jones offers two fine covers, as well. I've only rediscovered this album and just purchased it for a friend who was similarly impressed."},{"rating":"2","title":"At Long Last","review":"I never had to suffer the VHS 'TKAA' (which by all accounts is \\"flipping lousy\\"), as I had a Betamax recording of the theatrical release (no omissions) that was shown on a UHF pay-per-view service (c. 1980); of course, the sound wasn't so hot, as Beta Hi-Fi wasn't to be for another 15 years. I'd always watch it straight through -- never pausing, stopping, cueing, or reviewing, hoping to preserve it till they invented what I'd imagined would be \\"recordable video CDs\\" or something.So, I bought a DVD recorder to save it with, though time [20+ yrs.] had taken its toll on the videocassette anyway (shock, horror) and then only a few months later they release this 'restored' DVD.I'm glad to have the stereo sound, now.I'm sure it's a real treat to see for somebody who hasn't seen it at all in all this time (Roger), as well as for those who put up with the VHS-trash (pity.)So, now, I can crank it, and go back and look at thus & such, and pick & choose, too.

Thankfully, the movie has been fully restored,and the quality far exceeds the cinema release.Although I would have loved it if Jeff Stein could have locatedmore concert footage or even added more of The Who's Woodstockperformance.

Sure, the footage was kinda cool in spots, but as a film it just has not aged well. There is far better footage circulating amongst collectors which leads me to believe that a much better movie could be made. If you are a rabid Who fan (which I am not) then you will love it....if you are looking to relive the thrill of what you experienced when you saw it \\"back in the day\\" then it might not be for you."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Kids Aren't Alright","review":"The only thing this film has going for it is its sentimental value. This film showcases some of the last great performances of the venerable Keith Moon. Both Moon's fantastic drumming and Daltrey's famous blood-curdling scream on \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" are classic pieces of rock history. The likes of which will never be seen again.Keith Moon was not only rock's greatest drummer but he was also one of rock's funny men. Moon always had a quick wit about him and you can see some of that in this film. Unfortunately, you don't see enough of it.Aside from its sentimental value, \\"The Kids Are Alright\\" doesn't have much going for it. The film is choppy and disjointed and its quality leaves something to be desired. If I didn't know better, I'd say Jeff Stein put this film together in his garage.If you're a true Who fan, you may want to rent this video for sentimental reasons.

The Who were the greatest live rock band in history. This movie as well as Live At The Isle Of Wight In 1970 proved this point. The compelation from The Smothers Brothers Show in the beginning to the Marquee Club performances to Woodstock are fantastic. I am disappointed about the editing in A Quick One as well as the missing Join Together and Roadrunner medley parts at Pontiac Stadium in 1976. But why quibble this is the best rock movie ever assembled. I hope this reaches DVD soon. It certainly deserves it. Oh by the way, the CD is also edited with the missing Join Together, Roadrunner and My Generation Blues medley from the original LP. Maybe MCA will get the message. Long Live Rock!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This tape is edited!","review":"This film by Jeff Stein has inspired so many imitators - Spinal Tap, MTV, etc. That the 'ORIGINAL' rock opera 'A Quick One', which was so instrumental in spawning 'Tommy' and subsequently, 'Quadrophenia' is sadly edited out of this tape, is a shame for all.When this film was released, the entire 10 minutes of 'A Quick One' was presented from 'The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus' - a treasured and short lived BBC TV series and which ended up becoming the most pivotal segment in this film.That 'A Quick One' is edited in this tape from 10 minutes to 2 minutes is completely inexcusable. This rare, live, musical rock treasure of love and forgiveness is gone in this tape - perhaps forever.Who's responsible?"},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"My Friends Call Me Keith, You Can Call Me John!\\"","review":"This is one of the best documentaries of rock and roll- ever! I enjoyed the interviews (John claims now he's got money and too old to enjoy it; Pete warns people not to come to close to him while performing or he'll \\"probably kill you\\", and Keith chats with Ringo Starr). I enjoyed the videos (Happy Jack and the obscure Cobwebs and Strange- the latter featuring a killer drum solo by Moon the Loon, of course). I agree I was disturbed by them only including part of \\"A Quick One\\" (they also cut out an eyepatched Keith Richards' introduction). Then of course, the highlight is the performances- \\"My Generation\\", \\"See Me Feel Me\\" (Woodstock), \\"Anyway, Anyhow, Anywhere\\", working in the studio on \\"Who Are You\\", and Keith's final performance with the Who ever- \\"Won't Get Fooled Again\\" closes the show. So long, Keith, we miss you."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must for all Who fans","review":"I loved this movie when I first saw it while in high school. This blu-ray is not put together very well, though. The chapters menu doesn't allow you to move through several chapters at one time. If I want to get to chapter 24 I need to move through chapters 1 - 23 first. This is very annoying if I want to get to my favorite scenes quickly.No extras. You get an alternate audio track of the director's comments, but that has limited value.This wouldn't be my first choice for buying a blu-ray of this movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"If a better Who compilation exists, It has yet to be seen","review":"This video is AWESOME! Perhaps a bit choppy, but the full live performances coupled with the peeks into the life & minds of the men behind the music through interviews & clips of them backstage etc had to be \\"chopped\\" into the film somewhere....I think the producer did a phenominal job!Don't miss seeing this title, you will NOT regret it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Kids are Alright???

My copy of this double disc set states that there is a \\"Director's Cut\\" version on disc one (that would presumably include the video for the song TKAA). However, when you go to the special features section of disc one, it asks you to go directly to disc two (but I didn't find the \\"Director's Cut\\" version there either). Otherwise this version of the film is no better, or no worse than other versions, as there is no \\"real\\" bonus footage. Most film information on The Who is generally grainy, and somewhat sloppy, but isn't that why we loved The Who all along anyway?"},{"rating":"1","title":"NO Customer Service","review":"DO NOT DEPEND ON CUSTOMER SERVICE.

It does not dry at ALL because it uses steam. It can do socks, but forget sheets or towels. I've folded stuff thinking it was semi dry only to find mold lines where the folding creases were.

Called them back said that they never came, never heard from them again, nor did I ever hear from Haier. The part finally arrived after about 2 1/2 months. Dryer again stopped and is not working so I had to replace the sprayer myself.

They're rather obscure, and it's hard to tell if you've actually changed anything.The cycle takes for f***ing EVER, even though I've given up on drying.But hey, whatever; I'm only renting this apartment.

From my experience the motor last only one year, strangely enough almost to the day of the last replacement motor.

I have had the motor replaced, a new panel put in and four visits from the repair company and still it isn't fixed. I have lost a week of work.

Ti Lung and Raymond Wong are gangster brothers - Wong has a change of heart and becomes a minister. Lung goes away into hiding for 5 years and returns older and wiser. Lin plays May, Lung's old flame who is now unhappily married to a mob boss old enough to be her father. Lung convinces her to leave her mean husband and leave with him. May is killed by a crooked cop sent by her husband and Lung goes gunning for revenge. Wong has a change of heart and helps his friend take revenge. I have to say it was difficult watching Lin play an abused wife who ends up viciously stabbed to death. She looked as beautiful as ever...the Chinese consider her the most beautiful actress that ever lived. Lin is a true actress who can really emote from just her lovely eyes. Just watch \\"Deadly Melody\\" and see her famous icy stare of death. Great film!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Clock too small","review":"When I received the clock yesterday I was very dissappointed.

However, it does represent a very engaging style."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not bother","review":"The author of this book watched Waiting decided to write a book and cast himself as Ryan Reynolds role in the movie.

It recalls the more expansive searching music of 60's jazz (check out Dolpy's Out There). There seems to be an avid direction in terms of theoritical abstraction in the writing as well as a sort of classical refinement. Eric Dolpy, Booker Ervin, and Ron Carter are very competent in this area as can be seen in their balanced interpretation for both their approach to individual improvisation and the group's cohesision, more specifically Mal Waldron's \\"Quest\\". There are plenty of blues, avnat garde, and mr. charles mingus himself here...you're not harming your mood and understanding of blues by buying this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Guaranteed to please fans of adventurous hard bop","review":"Mal Waldron does a great job showcasing his soloists on this outing, and, oh, what a band he has assembled: Booker Ervin , Eric Dolphy, and Ron Carter on cello. Ervin, whose stark yet soulful phrasings recalls Ornette Coleman at times, at others, Sonny Rollins, appears in top form here, as does Ron Carter. Yet Eric Dolphy steals the show (as he does on Andrew Hill's Point of Departure, Oliver Nelson's Blues & the Abstract truth, etc. etc.); his solos are rarely less than thrilling, and his clarinet solo on \\"Warm Canto\\" is positively gorgeous. Waldron's polite abstractions benefit tremendously from such stellar company.

The novel explores the hatred of gays often propagated by those who are supposed to be our \\"moral leaders\\". Andy and his friends abuse, belittle, and humiliate Stephan Jones and Frank Montgomery throughout the book, and, ultimately, the wind up killing Stephan. There is a valuable lesson to be learned from this work, which will undoubtedly raise numerous questions in the reader's mind. Apparently, Mrs. Greene is willing to answer her readers' questions though, as she has established a website with the intention of informing her readers about her books and life. You can visit it, and email her from bettegreene.com."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stereotypes abound","review":"Story about a gay man who is killed by a bunch of teens because they're homophobic. The main character is a girl who is part of the group that kill him. She's horrified by their actions and learns to stand on her own two feet.Pretty terrible. The aim of the book is good (homophobia is wrong) but the execution isn't. It's poorly written and horribly paced. Key scenes appear to be missing. The whole trial about the murder isn't even described--only the outcome! The girl standing up for herself is also never described--you hear about it afterwards. Worst of all are the atrocious stereotypes. The gay men are portrayed as obnoxious and verbally vicious or spineless cowards. Oh yeah--and they run an antique store!!! The Christians are all one-dimensional Bible thumpers. It all leads up to an ending that wasn't believable for one second. The intentions are good but the book is terrible."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Drowning of Stephan Jones","review":"My daughter needed this book for a school report and we could not find it anywhere in bookstores near us because it is out of print. I looked on Amazon and found a dealer who had it used and we ordered it and it came within 7 working days a little longer than I expected but yet still timely. I was very happy with how everything went with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well written","review":"The book was well written as is most of Bette Greene's works. I think it is good that she covered a touchy subject in today's society. However, I read the book and found it to be very depressing. I don't think I will read it again like I do most of my books."},{"rating":"1","title":"A banned book in Horry County Schools, Horry County, SC","review":"I have problems with the stereotyping of Christians and gays in this book but I do not think it should have been banned from our county's media centers. It was as of June 12, 2002.Even evangelical and fundamentalist Christians could have learned something from this book: walk the talk!!! You can't love homosexuals and call them names and inflict violence upon them."},{"rating":"1","title":"one big cliche","review":"Under advice from an acquientence at school I attempted to read this book-and ended up hurting his feelings by laughing at it. The gay couple in this story seem to fit every single stereotype of homosexuals available. I got nearly hysterical reading the descriptions of them.The main character was a weakling with no backbone who went along with everything Andy said just so he would like her.She was annoying and unlikeable.Also annoying and unlikeable is the writing style of this book.The author was obviously trying to write a novel showing today's teenagers the danger of hatred, which was a good idea. The plot was a good idea, it was the execution that was disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stereotyping While Trying to Teach Against Bias","review":"The majority of characters against the gay lifestyle in this story are screeching namecallers. This book just didn't work for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"JustAProfessor","review":"I have used this book in the investment class I teach for 4 years. I have had very little negative feedback from students. Most seem to like it, otherwise, I would have switched books.Maybe Justablokes problem is he thinks he is reading an economic textbook, but it is actually a financial investment book."},{"rating":"1","title":"This is one of the worst economics textbooks ever","review":"I have to say that this is one of the worst economics textbooks that I have ever read. The font is tiny and reading it strains my eyes. The book is not written in a clear style at all. In fact, I often have to reread paragraphs just to understand what's going on. Sometimes, the authors go into needlessly long and complicated tangents to explain simple concepts. Someone needs to seriously condense and clarify the material in this textbook or else it'll become the bane of every college economics student's existence."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent book","review":"\\"The Geology of Fluvial Deposits..\\" is an outstanding book on this matter. Mr. Miall, as usual, has got to achieve the main and crucial points regarding fluvial environment. This book is the best reference on fluvial sedimentation I have ever read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Misleading publication information","review":"This is a book that is being promoted as a first edition, even though the first edition came out in 1996. If this is a second edition with significant updates and additions, then that should be made clear in the book description."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Movie with Great Extras","review":"When i first watched the ordinary dvd of rushmore....i was in awe of just the movie alone. its a hilarious movie but not with the kind of crappy slapstick humor we see in martin lawrence or leslie nielson movies. its subtle dudes. by the way the plot is one of the best ever, so different and unexpected. and with the criterion collection, they've added interviews, shorts, audition tapes....its awesome. P.S. when watching the audition tape, go to the one with the twins, jason swartzman (max fisher) is hilarious when portraying mr. bloom"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Movie","review":"This is one of my favorite movies of all time, and I love the Criterion Collection DVD. The movie is both interesting and hilarious, with incredible and memorable characters. All the actors do an excellent job here.I recommend this DVD for fans of the film. Besides an excellent commentary, there are several bonus features such as a making of documentary, interviews from the Charlie Rose show with Bill Murray and director Wes Anderson, audition recordings, commercials done for the MTV movie awards, trailers, you name it. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Way overrated","review":"Did not come close to living up to the hype. Bill Murray was totally wasted in this film. Ferris was much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype","review":"This movie has a lot going for it, including my all time favorite Bill Murray. But its not a Bill Murray movie. Its not even a slap your knee comedy. It gives you a wry smile every now and then, and a few smirks out of interesting scenes. Its a movie about a precosious(sic) kid and crush he has on Isabella and on the lonely man, Bill Murray. Its a story thats OK, but not as some say, great. If this was a drama special on TV, it would be great. But as a feature film that you sit down with refreshments and your family to watch excepting a hollywood produced film, well its just too small to please."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better than any sleeping pill!","review":"I read the reviews of this movie and heard it was good and I loved the Royal Tenebaums so I rented it. The movie had no momentum to it; it was just boring all the way though. I don't recommend watching movie unless you want to fall asleep!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Puuuhleeze!","review":"I only watched about 35 minutes of this piece of crap. I haven't felt such a violent physiological reaction to a movie since I stomped out of \\"All That Jazz\\" many years ago. Pointless. Incredibly banal. The lead character is absolutly sickining. The scene where he is blubbering (from eyes and nose) while being chewed out by the authorities for cutting down the trees, was the precise moment when I couldn't take anymore. Yeah, the critics found it different and arresting. So is a pile of fresh manure."},{"rating":"1","title":"Stay FAR AWAY","review":"Words cannot describe how bad this movie is. Don't waste 90 minutes of your life; you will never get them back again. This is an absolute boring, dull, dud of a movie. You have been warned."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL MOVIE","review":"I was truly disappointed with \\"Rushmore\\". I had heard so many good things about this movie and about Wes Anderson. WHAT A HOAX! Bill Murray did a good job, but every time I saw Jason Schwartzman, I felt like punching him in the face. His character is a compulsive liar, a bad friend, and an arrogant jerk. How am I supposed to LIKE someone so vindictive and mean? To go from bad to worse, the movie dragged unmercifully. All I can say to Wes Anderson is: you took 93 minutes of my life from me; I want them back!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie stunk","review":"I cannot belive that I managed to sit through the entire movie. I did not find it funny or even amusing. Murray was bland and Schwartzman was irritating. What was the plot anyway? How did Max end up with so much influence over Murray's character? What was the purpose of this film? I cannot believe it was in the comedy section- it should have been in horror for how terrifying it was in it's blandness. Don't waste your time or money on this one folks."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing","review":"I couldn't sit through more than 40 minutes of this movie. It says its a dark comedy but I didn't see any 'comedy' in it at all. Would not recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Boring and pretentious","review":"I really can't believe that a person would find this movie interesting. The story is unbelievable and simply stupid. I cannot describe to you how little sense this movie makes. One reviewer felt it necessary to use Latin, so why shouldn't I add to the pretention? Hic est malus, Pater optime (in the spirit of Julien Sorel). This movie has no plot. The lead character is not even intelligent enough to shoot himself."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please! Make it stop!","review":"I cannot add anything more that hasn't been already said about this terrible, terrible movie. I actually walked out on it as it played in my living room. As I sit here, the day after, my brain is still afire. I don't think I've ever felt so much contempt for a fictional character. He reminded me of another loathed nerd that has been thrust apon us: Jonathan Safran Foer! Ha! I suppose the same people that like his books would sit through this wretched mess of a movie."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quirky but satisfying","review":"You wont see many films like this. No matter how odd the concept everything is so beautifully real. Neatly packaged story of success (well kind of) failure and resurrection set in school. A schoolboy crush, and old man's fantasy and everyone living a dream. It is like looking at life through a distorting mirror but seeing more clearly as a result of it. The characters are great the dialogue is wonderful. It leaves you with that uneasy realisation that life is all about making the best of yourself and never denying others the opportunity of experiencing the real you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Flawless blu release","review":"This disc is perfect. The transfer is crisp, and the audio is crystal clear. Add to the collection if you are a Wes Anderson fan as its one of his best!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of my favorite films about adolescence","review":"The film that established Wes Anderson as a major American independentfilmmaking voice, after his very promising debut with 'Bottle Rocket'.Quite simply one of the most original films about adolescence evermade. An unlikely love triangle between a unique oddly brilliant 'cool geek'teenager, his teacher and a local business tycoon that'ssimultaneously funny, absurd and heartbreaking.Jason Schwartzman is great, and Bill Murray may do his best work ever -side-splittingly funny, but with a damaged, sad, sometimes dangerousedge just under the surface.As in all of Anderson's films, terrific use of songs as score,wonderfully inventive transitions and visual framing. And a lot of fun.The Criterion version has notably betterpicture quality, and some terrific extras (the regular release ispretty bare bones). It's more expensive, but worth it for a filmyou're likely to return to repeatedly."},{"rating":"2","title":"an instant classic","review":"Rushmore belongs in the pantheon of great film comedies (you know, that VERY short list that includes Annie Hall and precious few others). A film of grace, humor, and unexpected warmth. It's a damn shame those clods at the Academy didn't nominate Bill Murray for best supporting actor.In short: I have seen the future of American cinema, and it's name is Wes Anderson."},{"rating":"2","title":"An honest romantic comedy finally!","review":"This movie was reccomended to me by a friend and so i decided to give it a try. This movie was one pleasant surprise after another. Wes anderson has created a beautiful film that shines a new light on the tired genre of romntic comedy. This is a movie that doesn't gloss over how incredibly awkward and debilitating love can be. It is and honest movie that allows the viewer a look at the darker side of the \\"good guy\\" and the lighter side of the \\"bad guy\\". I would reccomend this to anyone who is sick of the typical romance flick and wants too fall in love with an oddly lovable cast of characters"},{"rating":"2","title":"Worth Repeat Viewings","review":"A very funny quircky comedy, loaded with character development. As a video store employee, I am encouraged to take out 5 free rentals a week to give customers an honest opinion. Normally the videos only get 1 quick screening. Rushmore got 2 screenings. I tell the customers that it reminded me of The Graduate. I found myself relating to both Blume & Max Fischer. It is not a commercial film, so those expecting Dumb & Dumber or There's Something About Mary would probably be wise to keep clear. Those looking for an intelligent, character-driven movie with real characters should get a kick out of this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"NON-ANAMORPHIC! Avoid if you have a widescreen TV","review":"This has nothing to do with the movie, but this particular DVD. Unlike the Criterion version, this version of Rushmore is non-anamorphic, meaning the picture quality isn't real great. Further, the movie will not fill the television screen unless you employ the zoom feature on your TV or DVD player. I loved watching this DVD on my old 19\\" television, but when I switched to a nicer 42\\" set, the poor quality of the video was so evident that I went out and got the Criterion edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Oh relax, you nitwits.","review":"Relax, it's just a movie. The only thing more annoying than the constant feeling that the movies can be too smart, and weird for the sake of weird, is that the overly critical reviewers are SMARTER than Wes! Some of these reviews are so smarmy I want to puke. I've enjoyed all of Wes Anderson's movies, and I put this one at a close second to the Royal Tennenbaums. But all of these exhausting one-star reviews all read the same way .... \\"you think you're so clever Wes, well you're not. I could have made the movie better if you'd just let me help you write and direct it\\". Chill out people. His movies are pleasing to the eye, funny, and unique. That's why most people enjoy them, and the self-annointed \\"clever\\" critics feel threatened by them."},{"rating":"2","title":"ahhh......criterion","review":"I would like to start off by saying, what an excelent film. It shows the struggles of growing up, trying to find where you belong, and falling in love. All of those things in one film, and to highlight them so well, shows only the immense talent of Wes Anderson and the cast.This DVD is amazing. Only Criterion could to this movie the justice it deserves. There is nothing else to put on this DVD. Except for maybe Wes Anderson's telephone number.If you buy this movie, buy the Criterion edition. It maybe pricey, but its worth every penny."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is my Rushmore","review":"One of my favorite movies, after i saw this movie I insistly became a fan of Wes Anderson. Altough his other movies never came close to this one he is great at making dry humor movies."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated and over done.","review":"I kept hearing about this movie - in fact, the Criterion Version made Entertainment Weekly's top 50 DVD list. It is not without it's critical acclaim. So I rented it... I fell asleep during my initial viewing. Thinking I was just tired, I tried to watch it the following afternoon. I almost fell asleep again. This movie is painfully boring! The characters are shallow and unlikable, and Jason Schwarzman plays Max Fischer as a sour, one-note, Holden Caulfield wanna-be. But what annoys me most about this pretentious piece of garbage is the fact that I can't get it out of my head! I keep running it over and over in my mind trying to see why anyone would find this movie worth recommending. I've had no success. My recommendation is for you to save yourself the aggravation. Buy something worth the Criterion treatment; Branagh\`s Henry V for example. Rushmore is just plain terrible."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yawn, wake me when its over","review":"Well what can I say, the critics loved it, 5 star reviewers here all sing its praises. Subtle dark humour, character based humour, intellectual humour. Oooh its so clever.....Whichever way you want to critique it - the comedy is NOT FUNNY AT ALL. And it is boring as well. If it wants to be a story driven vehicle fine, but lets not pretend it succeeds in being funny in any way. Its overlong, convoluted and dull dull dull.Im sure the \\"intellectuals\\" will say I'm not clever enough to understand its nuances. Trust me, I know where this movie is coming from and that is \\"up its own backside-ville\\".Critics loved it.....that should tell you everything you need to know about this anally retentive exercise. (And this should also warn you about The Royal Tenenbaums....ooh admire the acting, its got Gene Hackman in....but it is also dull and unfunny)."},{"rating":"1","title":"How boring can one movie be?","review":"I heard this movie was spectacular and very funny. So I rented it and boy were the critcs ever wrong on this one. The movie never really goes anywhere. Max (Schwartzman) has crush on a teacher (Williams) and when Bill Murray intervenes then Max and Murray's friendship is broken up. There are hardly any funny moments in the movie, it is boring as hell, and 5 minutes of the movie seems like 1 hour.How I sat through the entire film is still a mystery. Save your money and buy a better movie, there are tons and tons of better movies out there then Rushmore.However, if you suffer from insomnia then this is the movie to buy because it will put you to sleep faster then you can say \\"BUY SOMETHING ELSE!\\"0 out of 5 stars. Hell, -10 out of 5 stars."},{"rating":"1","title":"These reviews are more entertaining than the movie!","review":"How can all the four and five star people find this boring heap of film funny and entertaining? You're all way too easily amused. You definitely need to get out more. This Jason kid is about as interesting as a bowl of oatmeal. Next time, rent something a little more profound."},{"rating":"1","title":"What's the big deal?","review":"This movie was lame, and I couldn't stand the main character. There was little comedy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great Modern Comedy","review":"I was originally drawn to this movie not because of Wes Anderson, but because of Bill Murray. I had not even heard of Wes Anderson at that point. But after viewing \\"Rushmore,\\" I want to see both \\"Bottle Rocket\\" and \\"The Royal Tenenbaums\\" immediately. In the age of Adam Sandlers and Jim Carreys, it seems as if so-called 'smart comedy' was beginning to die out. This film keeps it alive. This is subtle humor at its finest. Jason Schwartzman is fantastic as Max, a young, ambitious, oddball at Rushmore Academy. Bill Murray stars as an older tycoon who is vying for the same woman as Max. The comedy here is subtle, but that's not to say you won't laugh out loud. Also, much of the humor is of a darker tone than you see nowadays. A great cast, screenplay, and also an interesting soundtrack are enough to make this movie one of my favorites."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect!","review":"This is one of those movies that after watching it for the first time I realized I needed to own it as soon as possible. I had rented the bare bones version. After doing some research on Amazon.com I discovered that there was the holy grail of DVD collections available for this cinematic masterpiece. The Criterion Collection! I purchased this DVD with no hesitation and I couldn't be happier. If you've seen the movie I'm sure you will agree with me that Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson are a blessing to movie buffs everywhere. This DVD collection is perfect! I don't think anything is missing from this DVD. A must buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Outstanding","review":"This is a great flick. Everything about it is good. If you think you'll hate this flick, then you've got to see it for the scene where Bill Murry does a cannon-ball into a swimming pool at his sons birthday party. It was a melancholy cannon-ball, summing up all the emotion of a father who realizes that his own son is a pathetic waste of skin.to summarize, get it for the cannon-ball, watch it for the qualiity film making."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Innovator","review":"Hmmm. There have been enough movies now about self-assured exceptional oddballs in school that \\"Rushmore\\" seems a bit pale compared to some of the films it inspired. It definitely has it's moments, though. Quite a lot of them. And some fine performances including the always reliably interesting and off-center Bill Murray."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a boring movie.","review":"When I saw the trailer for this movie, I remember seeing 2-3 funny moments in the trailer. I had no idea that those 2-3 moments were the ONLY funny moments in this f***** movie. The five stars are by critics - no need to say anything else - or people who lost money on this film and want you to lose money also."},{"rating":"1","title":"Please....","review":"This film starts out very dull and boring and goes downhill from there. I love comedies and after reading the reviews I expected something as good as all the films it was compared to. No dice. It is badly written, terribly cast, poorly acted, and horribly edited... it should have been chopped down to 3 minutes. It has nothing going for it, so if a zero were allowed, that would be my rating. It is now on my list of the 10 worst films I have ever seen. Avoid at all costs unless you like cruel and unusual punishment. This film should be used to torture prisoners of war... after fifteen minutes of this crap, they would confess anything not to watch any more of it. If you like watching grass grow, this is the film for you... but then, on second thought, it is more boring than that. Grass has beauty."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of Bill Murray","review":"I can't believe the number of people who think this movie was good. I think they read the press too much who said it was a \\"smart\\" comedy. Well, if smart means dull, then yeah, it was a smart comedy. Someone actually compared this to Ferris Bueller. Not a chance. Buy Ferris and actually laugh."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth my time.","review":"I am a really big Bill Murray fan, so when my husband was given this movie for a birthday present, I naturally wanted to see it. I'm sorry I did.Jason Schwartzman played a fifteen year old egotistical snot who was failing his academic courses at the prestigious Rushmore High School. He was involved in all kinds of extra-curricular activities, but he just couldn't make the grade as far as science, history, etc. Instead of being a nice person, he has to be an obnoxious son of a gun just because he doesn't get his way.When confronted by an equally obnoxious Scotsman, Jason quickly states that he did ugly things to his little best friend's mother.Then Bill Murray, a married man, cheats on his wife with the best friend's mother, and that made me not like HIM very much.The entire movie Rushmore should be canned and started over again, this time with a little more good attitude than bad.I would encourage people not to waste their hard earned money on a movie of this calibre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Take out Max Fischer and you have a good movie...","review":"After watching the brilliant Royal Tennebaums, I felt I should watch Anderson's earlier effort, Rushmore. Every character is lovable except for the main character Max Fischer. He is an obnoxious jerk who doesn't get punched nearly enough. I can't undrstand how the other characters could put up with his rudeness, arrogance, and all around terrible personality. Also, there is no way he would have survived in a public school. They would have crushed him. I love teh Royal Tenebaums, but this movie left me waiting for Max's defeat that never came."},{"rating":"1","title":"I missed something, obviously.","review":"Aftre reading good reviews of this movie, I went out and rented it. I didn't get it. I watched it again. I still didn't get it. I watched it a third time, and fell asleep halfway through. I then gave up. This is just another contrived high school angst movie masquerading as a hilarious indie spoof. They're not fooling me; this movie is a total waste of time and money. It's not original, it's not snappy, it's not a \\"breath of fresh air,\\" and most of all, it's not funny."},{"rating":"1","title":"This film will gag a maggot.","review":"Two thumbs up for Bill Murray, but two big toes for Jason Schwartzman, Talia (Adrianne!) Shire's goofy son and wanna-be-actor. One thing Schwartzman did for me in this film, is warn me that whatever he appears in will be 100% box office poison."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ho Hum","review":"I tried, I really did. I rented this based on the majority of positive reviews here and at IMDB. I couldn't get past the first fifteen minutes. Rarely can I not sit through a movie; I even tried to watch it again and I think I hit twenty minutes.I don't hate this movie as some do; I just found it completely uninteresting. The dialouge was at times painfull and almost alway tedious.Maybe it gets better, but I think I'll pass on a third sitting."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't RUSH see this flick","review":"Had vaguely heard this was popular cult-type flick about a 15 year-old coming of age. Movie starts out with some clever Schtick and some mild laughter over protagonist, Max Fleishman's chutzpah. But how many times do his antics save the day, NOT MANY. As additional characters Bill Murray, and easy on the eyes school marm, enter the scene, the plot thickens into a love triangle, then thins back into celibacy. Max's glibness and my belief that there must be some BIG moment to justify all the critical acclaim did keep this writer watching until the end. None of the others in my viewing made it that far before nodding off.Some high points include those involving Max's barber, come neursurgeon father. We do learn another whole side of Max when his downfall results in his following in his father's hair cutting footsteps.I had hoped this would be another Napoleon Dynamite type independent film, but alas I learned too late that its was just another loser like the Royal Tannenbaums."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is it me?","review":"I felt guilty for the longest time because I didn't like this movie while everyone else I knew did. But today I'm liberated. I'm telling the world, \\"This movie is boring and pretentious and nepotistic [find out who the lead actor is and how much previous experience he had], and I don't care who knows it!\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"a 'high brow' dog is still a dog....thank you.","review":"This is really a pretty bad film. One gets the impression critics were over-identifying with the geeky main character, or at least that the film's direction was different enough to merit accolades based solely on this.Save your money. It's a different kind of film and the acting is good-particularly Murray's and female protagonist. But it's skillet deep. Weird kid has crush on teacher, competes with friend, has irrelevant or at least undeveloped romantic subplot with an Asian student. The is as ponderous and heavy as a three-legged elephant. It doesn't matter to me if a main character is antisocial as this would exclude many great works of art (Crime & Punishment, the stranger, Goodfellas), but the character's struggles are overwrought. It's like if Beverly Hills 90210 decided to have a 'Pained Intellectual' Episode. It would produce jason schwartzmann at the Peach Pit.that's it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed.","review":"I looked forward to viewing this DVD. I had heard good reports of it. It was not engaging on any entertainment level. Viewing seemed interminable. Why continue to watch? you ask. In case at some point it might turn out to be funny or interesting. And it did have Bill Murray in it. A waste."},{"rating":"1","title":"This was Filmed at My High School!","review":"This movie was filmed at my high school. We all clamored to see it and enjoyed watching it because there were several of our friends in some scenes. However, when I watched a second and then a third time, it lost all glitter and glamour for us, and we began to see it as just another bad movie. I recommend seeing it maybe one time, just to see it, but definitely not twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Good","review":"Not nearly as goo as I thought it would be.

Waste of time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not great!","review":"Before I watched this movie I checked out the reviews for it.I thought it looked pretty good, but I was very disapointed. I almost turned it off a couple of times but I did watch it all the way through. I didn't think it was funny at all, I thought Max was obnoxious. In fact the whole movie didn't ring true. My husband also disliked this film and so did my teenage daughter. What a waste of time!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Love's Labour Really Lost","review":"I love edgy comedy. I love independent movies. I love arthouse cinema, foreign film, Elvis Mitchell, the collected works of Pauline Kael and Bill Murray's serio-comic performances. And oh how I hate this movie. An amusing 45 minute sketch drawn out beyond endurance. Tried it in the theater. Tried it on DVD. Alas, alack, a loser."},{"rating":"1","title":"The unfunniest \\"funny\\" movie of the year !","review":"I found this movie to be one of the unfunniest \\"funny\\" movies I've ever seen. There is no continuity in the plot, the characters are shallow and the sexual references are only there to get ratings. Murray is pitiful and the other actors aren't much better. If you want to waste your money, see Rushmore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Another Wes Anderson Hit...","review":"Great performances, if you're a fan of Wes Anderson then this is a movie for you. Histerically funny, witty. A great Bill Murray movie, he's done great things with the director. A truly must see film."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unique, intelligent, absolutely amazing ...","review":"Pure brilliance! It is not for everyone, however, that is also what makes it so special. You either get it or you don't. If you understand the underlying themes of the movie, which are outlined in the first 5 minutes of the film, then you are in for a wonderful experience. Jason Schwartzman's character Max Fischer is one of the most unique characters ever seen on film. Schwartzman is brilliant in the role as well as the entire supporting cast around him. However, Bill Murray steals the show. The fact that he wasn't nominated for a Best Supporting Actor Nomination is not only a joke but almost criminal.There are a lot of people out there who will think that this movie is boring, too eccentric, etc... However, for those of you who are for the most part tired and disillusioned w/ the same recycled, sterile, over-produced Hollywood crap then this movie is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"This movie is fresh, silly and has heart.","review":"If you love quirky characters and stories you will enjoy this film. Created by the same team that made BOTTLEROCKETS you will find, charaters that are flawed but interesting. I am thinking of getting the soundtrack because it is so different but enjoyable to listen to. Bill Murray was perfect in this."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Loved This Movie!!!","review":"If you liked Harold and Maude you'll love this movie. Bill Murray is hilarious, and the movie has some touching scenes as well as the usual Murray-hamming-it-up scenes. I saw this movie in the theatre after reading some really good reviews, and it was wonderful. It also helps that the soundtrack features a lot of Cat Stevens tunes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fine film","review":"The acting, writing, direction, cinematography, and production work in this film are all excellent. The story is very good, the main character is superbly rendered and extremely entertaining to watch. I found myself saying 'OK, that was the best scene in the movie' to myself again and again. I liked it very much - a must see."},{"rating":"2","title":"Witty movie with great style","review":"I definitely loved this movie, from the very beginning, you will notice a stylized approach to your average story. After all we've all seen teen angst movies before, but this had some great elements which made it memorable. Jason Schwartzman made a great consistent performance. This is definitely a movie which works on several levels, it has a great ending with enough double-talk to make it watchable a couple of times. Overall i would rate this as a great sleeper comedy, which many people haven't seen, and should."},{"rating":"2","title":"EXCEPTIONAL PACKAGE!","review":"Criterion does it again! Besides the multiple commentaries, excellent technical quality and the rest of the \\"goodies\\", the packaging (including the map) is hilarious and sweet- as befits this amazing little movie. \\"I wish that I knew what I know now when I was younger\\". Five stars and a gratuitous explosion!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Maddeningly Good!","review":"I loved, loved, loved, loved, loved this movie, a film like no other with shining performances and visual imagery, sparkling dialogue, it's just so brilliant I could kill myself. I've never seen a film to match this in originality and tone since and I never tire of watching it due to its abundance of quirky details. Example: Bill Muray's Budweiser swimming trunks, the excellent soundtrack full of 60s gems, Max's stage adaptation of Serpico, replete with Dirk in Nun's habit, Dirk and co's crazy costumes when attacking Max, Blume drinking minibar rum and Diet Coke and smoking cigarettes in the hospital elevator, the crazy looking extra kid in the pool at Blume birthday party, and with sparklers in end scene. So great! You can really see the Anderson/Wilson talent developing and tightening since Bottle Rocket into a compelling and thoroughly original pespective. So Fresh! I'm also awaiting Jason Schwartzman's next project with eager anticipation. What a find!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What the hell is wrong with you people?","review":"Would you rather see Katie Holmes and James Van Derbeek (again)? This is an original, well thought out, and funny comedy that actualy tries to make us laugh, rather than show us the same cliche awkard high school sex/dance/date/whatever scene over and over again. Although I prefer Wes Anderson's first film, the very undertared BOTTLE ROCKET, I liked RUSHMORE very much. It is comforting to see that someone out there is realesing a high school movie without resorting to following left-over cliches from the 1980s. Save the hilarious ELECTION, this may be the best teen/high school comedies to come out of this decade."},{"rating":"2","title":"My Favorite Film of ALL TIME!","review":"Simply an amazing movie. Wes Anderson rules and I can't wait to see his next film that I hear he is working on with Owen Wilson. RUSHMORE is for anyone who roots for the underdog, for the odd man out, for someone who seems unlikely to have his stuff together but does it 10 times better than anyone else. Bill Murray finally plays a mature role. He's great in this movie. If you want to see GHOSTBUSTERS, don't see this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing,unique but went nowhere.","review":"Max captures us right from the start as an outrageous paradox. Nerd who gets bad grades, ability to talk his way to anything but gets nothing really done. Movie then doesn't do much with him and Bill Murray. A couple of good scenes then drag into a mean spirited, baffling last 45 minutes. I was expecting much more from the hype. Obscure Who and Stones songs are very cool though. Definitely a rent, not a buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"i'm all about that kid","review":"that kid, i'm either going to adopt him or marry him. it's all about the kid."},{"rating":"1","title":"???????","review":"I think I've figured out that everyone connected with the making of this over-long skit (the bad ones are always over long)wrote the rave reviews.

While there were a few (very few) funny scenes, this movie had no continuity at all, and was a waste of time and money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Can you rate a movie zero stars?","review":"... I did not laugh a single time at this movie. It seemed tome to be written and directed by a fifteen-year-old who had justdiscovered that being quirky is cool. My idea of subtle, quirky humor is \\"Cold Comfort Farm\\" or \\"Chasing Amy.\\" \\"Rushmore\\" is a movie about high school that seems like it was written by a high-schooler. By the way, if you want to see a great movie about high school, see \\"Election.\\" END"},{"rating":"1","title":"This movie blows","review":"What a terrific waste of time...I watched with several other people and we all hated it!

I immediately went back to my video store and requested a refund. 1 star is way too generous."},{"rating":"1","title":"What was all the hype about?","review":"Really disappointing. Bill Murray is wasted here. I only laughed because I thought I was supposed to laugh. I did like Max's quirkyness but it was not enough to carry the whole movie. I feel cheated out of $30.00. My best advice is to rent before you buy."},{"rating":"2","title":"not what you expect","review":"From the previews, this movie looks like a laugh out loud comedy, but the truth is, its not really that funny. It is quite a dark comedy, and you really laugh after watching the whole thing and really getting some of the subtle jokes (part of director Wes Anderson and writer Owen C. Wilson's style). I recommend watching the first film by this team... \\"Bottle Rocket\\" before watching this, that way you'll get used to this style of filmmaking. Great performances in this movie by jason schwartman and Bill Murray who should've gotten an oscar. Max's plays will make you wet yourself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Off beat, quirky, and an unusual movie. See it!","review":"This is an entertaining and intelligent movie. Unexpected and different than the typical \\"Hollywood\\" movie. Refreshing and fun. Give it a chance and stick with it...it is worth it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Subtle Classic","review":"Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson have chisled themselves into my conscienceness as the duo who can do no wrong. Rushmore is a beautifully crafted and wonderfully acted little film who's impact left me feeling joyous for days after viewing it. Murray is subdued yet frequently hilarious AND he manages to mold his charachter into the most sympathetic tycoon I've ever seen portrayed on film. Equally good are Schwartzman and Williams. A lot of people have been labeling this flick \\"quirky\\" which is beyond me. Anderson and Wilson create charachters with depth and humanity. Perhaps this is too much for people who would rather watch cars explode with dinosaurs driving them through a computer generated atmosphere but for those of us missing the heart and truth in filmmaking, Rushmore delivers in spades."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rush to see Rushmore","review":"As a videostore employee, I get videos out before the official release date. Usually I give it a quick screening so I can come up with a snappy review for the customers. This movie I watched twice. I found it haunting and funny. The characters were believable for their motives even if some of Max's achievements required suspension of disbelief, mixed with frank admiration. Probably the dest comedy released this decade."},{"rating":"2","title":"Humanity test","review":"If you don't choke up when Bill Murray says, \\"I'm a little bit lonely these days,\\" then you are a robot and have no heart. This is a small, beautiful, sad, funny movie. Bill Murray gives the best performance of any actor in 1998."},{"rating":"2","title":"Meoweriffic","review":"My name is black cat and I'm a cat. My housemate watched this movie and she loved it. I thought it rocked too. The music was really awesome and the story was great. I was nervous that things weren't going to turn out the way they did. Magnus was a great character and we got to see him in a kilt, which I liked very much. Bit like Catcher in the Rye if it was a movie and if it was funny."},{"rating":"2","title":"Original under-rated gem","review":"Thoroughly enjoyable quirky film with standout performances by the leads. I'll watch anything Bill Murray is in - this film is not a laugh riot - is is an intelligent, original perceptive movie. I've watched this about 5 times. Worth buying."},{"rating":"2","title":"Rushmore Criterion Collection is Amazing","review":"Wes Anderson and Owen Wilson have unvailed a masterwork. This will be a movie to rival The Graduate and many others. Bill Murray, Jason Schwartzman, and Olivia Williams are fantastic. I've watched this movie so many times before purchasing the Criterion Collection and can't say enough. If you like the movie and wonder if the cost of the criterion vs the regular release is worth it, yes. This DVD is almost perfect. A must have for DVD collectors."},{"rating":"2","title":"I Like Dry Wit","review":"I like the comedy style of this movie. I believe this movie belongs in a class by itself. I have yet to see the previous movie from Anderson and Wilson but will be looking for it soon.If you are looking for the average punchline style of comedy this movie may not appeal to you. If you want to see comedy filmaking taking a stretch try Rushmore. The film is slow paced, a bit pretensious and unrealistic. But its good. What's so funny? A fifteen yr old boy and a millionaire competing for the same woman. Murray is hilarious from the start of the film when he advises the not so wealthy students at Rushmore to \\"take dead aim\\" at the rich kids and \\"take them down\\" because the one thing money can't buy them is a backbone! The soundtrack is excellent. The writing and the music are consistantly good throughout the film. I think Jason Schwartzman played the heck out of his character (O.R. they?)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Too few funny moments","review":"Based upon all the accolades heaped upon it by numerous critics, I was led to believe that the movie would be different, challenging, and extremly funny. While it met the first of these, there was little challenge in the typical Hollywood \\"everyone falls in love ending\\", and the abandoment of what makes Max so fascinating...that he is so different. At the end, I was halfway expecting there to be multiple wedding scenes, when, Max sabotaging his own play with dynamite and bees would befit his character. As far as the humor goes, the funny moments and sight gags were too far inbetween. Max at dinner and Bill Murray at his son's birthday party were comedic highlights, and likely to be some of the funniest, wry humor moments you'll ever see in a film, but the rest of the movie was bogged down by almost mechanical feelings of love and romance. For a movie championing the outcast, it sure made conformity look good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Critics praised it, audiences hated it.","review":"This movie has no climax and a lead actor (Jason Schwartzman) whose quirkiness is a little comical at first but soon gets annoying. Bill Murray has an encouraging start as a businessman who tells prep-school students to find the rich kids and \\"take them down,\\" but generally looks like he's sleepwalking. For a while it appears that Schwartzman is going to make things interesting in his jealous rage against Murray, but his revenge tactics are no more inventive than the ones attempted in the Norm McDonald flop \\"Dirty Work.\\" Then everyone gets kind of depressed, then there's that ho-hum ending, then the credits roll. Naturally, the critics went gaga over it, as if it was the greatest thing since sliced bread. Here in the real world, I haven't seen as many people tromp out of the theater before the movie ended since Madonna's 1993 fiasco \\"Body of Evidence.\\"Only decent line: Surgeon: \\"These are my OR scrubs.\\" Schwartzman: \\"Oh, are they?\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your time.","review":"It's been 24 hours since I've seen this movie and I'm still wondering what was the point. If this is classified as a comedy, I'm sorry but I forgot to laugh. Thirty minutes into the movie, I was wondering what the significance of the scenes were. I was still wondering this at the end of the film. It was like watching a 90 minute positioning of unrealistic characters. The movie went nowhere and the characters weren't complex. The only saving grace for this movie was the closing sound track title, Oh la la by the Faces."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dull ... Dull ... Boring , Bill Murray at his worst","review":"We could not wait for the movie to end. In fact, we didn't, although my S.O. hung in to the end hoping it would improve. She said it didn't. Bill Murray was abused by his embarrassing role as a rich man with mouth hanging open, dumb, lost look in eyes, catering to an unrelated 15 year old's whim's & wishes. The notion of a 15 year old who acted and looked more like 22, who was the class nerd but also the bad sheep and at the same time the head of every extra-curricular school activity was not only far-fetched, but appeared to be written by a real 15 year old class nerd with poor writing skills on an extreme day dream away from reality. Poorly written, unbelievable characters, and drawn out and slow, and only one semi-funny line in the whole affair."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't believe the hype!!","review":"I'd rented this movie because I heard a lot of good buzz about it. Why do the critics and some of the reviewers on this page like this movie is beyond my understanding. I hated that Max character and the movie took too long to tell me what would become of him. The only thing that I liked about this movie was Murray's Mr. Blume and his two evil twin sons."},{"rating":"1","title":"It was about as good as a good kick in the Head","review":"I laughed for roughly 2 seconds when I watched this movie. That was when he just about had the tree fall on the Man. The play at the end wasnt all that bad either. Other than that I would gladly take a good beating rather than watch this movie again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad, really really bad","review":"I saw this movie in reaction to such wonderful critical praise. I was deceived. This movie was not brilliant or wonderful, nor was the story any good (and the acting for that matter) I found the plot completly unrealistic and the characters unappealing. I could not figure out the plot, and moreover, I could not figure out why so many people liked it. Also, can anyone tell me if it was a comedy or a drama? It wasn't funny or very dramatic, so I couldn't really qualify it in any catagory. If you want a movie about a disfuntional teen, I would like you to see a good movie like maybe A Clockwork Orange say. Another good Malcolm McDowell vehicle that is more along Rushmore lines is IF. Personally I think it is a better film than Rushmore, and is what Rushmore could have been."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for a rainy day","review":"Max Fischer( Jason Schwartzman) is the most industious 10th grader of all time. He has founded seemingly every club at Rushmore, a prestigious private school, where he has a full scholarship. The only problem: Max is a horrible student and is failing most of his classes. Add to the mix a pretty kindergarten teacher (Olivia Williams) that Max and one of his teachers (Bill Murray) fall in love with, and you have all the twists and turns of a high school soap opera.I was not impressed with the ending, but at least it was realistic. Most teenagers would enjoy the goofy humor, but parents may be wary. Not a bad movie for a rainy day.Mr.F"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Pile of Horse Dung","review":"Alright, this is one of those random comedies. The humor is supposed to rest in strange, witty comments and actions. But I've seen funny random movies, and this does not do the trick. Max is basically just a jackass that runs around thinking he's brilliant. It just didn't strike home for me. I know that others disagree, but even if you do find this movie entertaining it is by no means a masterpiece."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Movie I have ever seen","review":"This movie kicks b***.

The first time I thought the plot was a little disjointed, and didn't get some of the jokes. The second time around, everything was much clearer and funnier.Although I wouldn't go so far as to say it's funnier than Pulp Fiction, it is, for my money, one of the funniest movies of the last half of the 90s.The best line: \\"Would you like perfect attendance or punctuality?\\" \\"I'll take punctuality.\\"In the hotel scene look out the hotel window and you'll notice, to the far right, Richardson College, (a dorm at Rice University), where I happen to live."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent","review":"You like Wes Anderson films or not, maybe you're white and you do?

Great menus, lots of interviews and ancillary materials, it's a dream come true for fans of the film.There's only one thing I'd fix: the commentary of co-writer/director Wes Anderson, co-writer Owen Wilson and actor Jason Schwartzman would have been much more interesting if all three had been together for the taping. Often, the commentators bounce off each other and share reminiscences (as in, say, the CHARADE or FIGHT CLUB commentaries), and it would have been nice to have that here as well.But that's a minor quibble. Otherwise, this is a great movie, and a superb DVD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Buy this elaborate DVD","review":"The DVD includes interviews with Bill Murray and Wes Anderson on the Charlie Rose show. Both are incredible. The commentary over the movie is weak. Owen mostly talks about his life and Bottle Rocket and Jason mentions some bland anecdotes. Wes gets some good points in. I've heard much better commentaries on movies such as Platoon and Pleasantville. I've yet to watch the rest but I think the interviews make the purchase worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"An infectious gem of a film.","review":"Wes Anderson has attained to something difficult, rare, and genuinely edifying in \\"Rushmore\\": the power to conduct, as if by the most effortless whim, its audience playfully about themes that we otherwise feel to be the stuff of unmitigated heartbreak -- yet without diminishing the gravity of those themes."},{"rating":"2","title":"ONE OF THE BEST FILMS","review":"Amazing cast, music and story.

I find them all to be superior to any other instrument stands I've owned.The soprano sax stand is light and strong with legs that fold out and lock into place. The center stem easily threads on -- and also fits on other Hercules bases. The entire stand folds up neatly and fits in the supplied travel bag with its handy pull cord.The design of the stand is very sturdy and the materials are strong but lightweight. The non-skid feet are a real plus on bare floors. The soft surfaces that gently contact the instrument offer excellent protection.

Oh, and last but not least, the inside jacket is jam-packed with career bios of each artist. This is a must-have."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bossa nova tunes","review":"This is a selection of tunes any jazz lover or party goer will be able to groove with.

I placed an order for several cans because they are not available in the area where I recently moved. Upon opening the first can I was thoroughly disappointed to find the contents to be broken into little pieces. Not one of the cans had any piece more than 1 1/2 inch long.

Voice quality is goot after changing the channel with much statics... Yet there is a catch. The other side of the line hears echo (of their won voice). I testes extentively what could be the cause, but failed. I even blocked the microphone of the bluetooth since the earphone itself is not a snug fit to the ear, and may be the sound from the earphone may be leaking to the microphone, but nothing worked. The other side still hears the echo. It's a real pity... 'cause it looks so good, and matches prefectly with my phone, but can't be selfish to keep using it when whoever I talk to complains every time about the echo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fair at best","review":"I thought I'd try the WEP150 since the Motorola 850 I had was choppy when the phone was more than 10 inches from the headset. This one does the same thing though. I wear my Samsung A920 phone on my left hip and the headset on my right ear. I'm not fat, but the short distance it must go, though my body, between the phone and the headset just seem to be too much, and I get choppy reception on my end. People I'm talking to have not complained. The headset is OK when within line of set, from my hip to the headset, but it gets choppy if I move my arm in the way. I'm thinking it may not have enough power, but I really expected it to have sufficient power.Perhaps it is the phone's fault, since both the Mot and the 150 do the same thing, but I have no way to test that at this time.I bought the headset locally, at Best Buy, just so I would be able to return it if I didn't like the performance.

While giving some very interesting information about how air traffic is controlled, the book is more about people; the people that succeed and fail as air traffic controllers. Of particular interest are the sections devoted to the 1981 PATCO strike, and the acrimony leading up to it. Of less interest appeared to be the stories about what a great guy X was, or what a jerk Y was, but in retrospect, these stories serve as useful pieces in the overall picture of what it is like to work as a controller.I recommend this book to anyone interested in gaining an understanding of a very special job and the people that do it. If you are interested in learning the nitty gritty of how controllers do their work, or in riveting prose, then you had best look elsewhere."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good, if you can find a copy","review":"I found this book at the local library and picked it up on a whim. It's very good, and I highly recommend it if you can find a copy. Like another reviewers said, it doesn't include details about how air traffic control is done, but instead paints a picture about what it's like to BE a controller, particularly in the 80s before and after PATCO's strike. There are some great near-miss stories and tales about eccentric controllers that are some of my favorite parts of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Collaborations - One Heart","review":"Marina Raye's music offers us a piece of Heaven on earth.

Through her divine music, Marina gifts us the eternal Love we all seek. To listen to her music is to be embraced by the Divine, to feel our true home and Spirit, and experience profound peace. I meditate with this CD, and play it for friends and family during Reiki sessions, who are instantly transported to another place the moment they hear Marina's music. A true spiritual treat!

This is the only other black-and-white G-film in existence, and a very rare one at that. Probably due to the VERY poorly received American version. Thankfully, Classic Media one more comes through, even including the Japanese version. This film was decent at best, no where near as powerful as the first. The four fathers of Godzilla weren't all here, Honda and Ifukbe, probably a major factor in the sharp contrast. The score by Masaru Sato wasn't as striking as Akira Ifukube's score, but it was still all right.The quiality of this DVD from the case to the supplement special features are just epic for G-films. there is an awesome commentary by Steve Ryfle and many other guest appearances and this is a must for fans."},{"rating":"2","title":"I rate five stars ONLY for the Japanese version","review":"The Japanese version of this movie is spectacular. I hate the way the English version was. They mixed up the monsters' roars, Godzilla was called Gigantis, and there was so much pointless diologue, pointing out the obvious, making it more of a movie that won't shut up! The Japanese version had more of a quiet theme to it. The American presenter of the English version must have been out of his bloody mind when he changed everything. Compare and contrast on the two versions and you will see what I mean."},{"rating":"1","title":"Godzilla's back!","review":"This is the 2nd Godzilla movie ever, but it isn't as good as the original.POSITIVES:1.

Anguirus!!!","review":"I like this sequel better than the original because it has a better storyline and Godzilla gets to fight a monster equal to him. For the 1st half of the movie, a different Godzilla is fighting a new monster named Anguirus. (In the American version, Godzilla has been renamed to Gigantis, so stick with the original Japanese version) I love the epic battle toward the end with the jet pilots trying to put Godzilla on ice once and for all.

That's \\"Godzilla's Counterattack\\" in Japanese. Then, it was titled \\"Godzilla Raids Again\\". When it came to here in the US of A, it was called \\"Gigantis, the Fire Monster\\". Confusing, right? The plot is that Godzilla is back and this time he's in Osaka rather than Tokyo. Anyway, Godzilla fights a monster that looks like an Anklyosaurus with TONS of spikes on his back. This monster is called Anguirus. Another name for Anguirus is \\"Angilas\\", but I call him Anguirus. Anyway, this was a fine movie. Its kinda campy, and the dubbing is terrible, but that's the only bad thing. Enjoy this movie. WARNING: This movie contains very violent scenes, including Godzilla (basicly) rips out Anguirus's throat. So, only let kids about 8 and up watch this movie. Nuff said."},{"rating":"1","title":"GIGANTIS???!!! WHAT KIND OF NAME IS GIGANTIS??????!!!!!!!!!!!!!!","review":"Okay, the movie itself isn't THAT bad, but it was completely ruined by the dubbing. GIGANTIS? GET REAL! what kind of name is THAT? WHY DID THEY HAVE TO CALL GODZILLA GIGANTIS? WHY? WHY? And WHY does Godzilla sound like Anguirus?!This film could have been good, but due to the poor acting, the fact that Godzilla sounds like Anguirus more than himself, the fact that Godzilla's origin was changed from being a Godzillasaurus turned into a mutant dinosaur because of the atomic bomb testing to being a species of a \\"fire monster\\", and (worst of all) the fact that Godzilla is called GIGANTIS!!!! Gigantis. What kind of idiot decided to call Godzilla GIGANTIS?!

I first saw this movie as a child and loved it, I still do. A very mysterious and eerie story is told in a dramatic way that completely pulls you in. As for the cast, it is quite good and it seemed like a TV movie at times. I sort of knew this going in, but I saw this when I was a child and it really affected me because it is such a creepy and mysterious story.Acting was good but a bit dry. There was an emotion that was expected and an energy between many of the characters. Not a scary film in the traditional sense, but far more of a murder mystery to me than any horror movie because of the aforementioned themes.Thought I'd see how it held up all these years, and it did hold up well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great bra!!","review":"This bra is soo perfect.

My students (undergraduates, some with no science background) had a terrible time with it.

This show is not for the faint of heart or the seekers of moral high ground. It is just hard core and fast the \\"six flags\\" of cop shows. This was my favorite season.

We're counting down for season 5, which sounds like another stellar run."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the best...","review":"This show is still one of the best 2-3 dramas on television and the addition of Glenn Close to the cast has only added to the luster. Faster paced, more intense than almost anything else on television, The Shield benefits tremendously from DVD viewing, with multiple episodes consumed in a short period of time, where the intricate plotting that carries over from episode to episode can be appreciated. The reviewers who are rating this with low to middling scores are trying to make some misguided point as to their preference for other seasons to this one. The simple fact is, this show is a monument to television making."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Sheild","review":"This was purchased by Brenda Deadwiley for her husband Jim's birthday.

They tried to make it work with many many subplots, but it just didn't mesh this year.Wasn't a big fan of Antwan Mitchell either. Not the greatest villian in the world. He had nothin on Armadillo (arm-a-dee-o) from season 2.I've just become so used to havin those \\"OHHH DAAAMN\\" moments watchin this show, this season just didn't produce any emotion from me. Maybe two or three episodes at most. Hopefully they'll recapture the magic of season 1 & 2 next year. Btw, people bash season 3, but I liked it. Good storyline, good actin, good action. What more do you want? Anyway, guess my order goes 2-1-3-4.Also, I agree that Tony Soprano is the best character on tv. He just has so many layers it's great. Then Vic Mackey, then Jed Bartlet. That's my two cents."},{"rating":"2","title":"The I Love Lucy Book","review":"This book is one of the best books that I own! It is surely a must have for all Lucy fans.

I am currently on my second copy of it, my old paperback now replaced by the latest updated version. Stands up beautifully a quarter of a century after it was written.

The 1990s had everything, colorful characters, great storylines, the Monday Night War. It also had ECW. However, there is not one ECW match on this DVD. ECW, if Eric or Vince wanna admit it or not, was a fighting company that was on the verge of greatness. Paul Heyman and his goons, fought hard to get PPVs, TV time, and attention from then WWF and WCW.The wrestlers of ECW are and still legendary. Such icons like, Terry Funk, Sabu, The Sandman, Tommy Dreamer, Rob Van Dam, and Tazz himself. I am not denying that the already amazing superstars on the list do not deserve to be on there, I am only saying that 9 hours is not enough time to do the most exciting time for any wrestling fan.

His unique chord-melody technique shines in many numbers, and his underrated single-note playing is completely masterful. Excellent backing from piano, bass, drums (different personnel from two recording sessions, 1960 and 1961). Material ranges from swing era (Gershwin, Rodgers-Hart, Ellington) to showtunes and even to Monk. My only beef with this disc is some minor intonation problems toward the end of one recording session -- I find myself saying \\"come on, Johnny, tune to the piano\\" on a couple of cuts. OK, so maybe this is a 4 1/2 stars, but this representation of the REAL Johnny Smith makes it more than worthwhile."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT SOUND","review":"Johnny Smith was first known for his gorgeous guitar sound when he made one of his first albums called \\"Moonlight in Vermont\\" which I heard on mono Lp 50 years ago. His gorgeous technique was the envy of all jazz guitarists. We studied his books, but couldn't make head or tail of them.There are 20 tunes on this CD, & you'll probably recognize most of them. He is a jazz guitarist, but one who is very easy to listen to....I loved his ballad style as well as the tunes he does at breakneck speed.I particularly liked his rendition of the Duke Ellington compositions, namely \\"I got it bad;\\" \\"Prelude to a kiss;\\" & Monk's \\"Round Midnight.\\"Get this album, & you won't regret it. If you're new to jazz, this is a great place to start."},{"rating":"2","title":"Extraordinary45","review":"This was a replacement of my original one that we bought 17 years ago for my kitchen.

It is all pop instrumentals recorded between 1956 and 1962. Generally, pop instrumentals recorded during this time period were kind of dull (see anything by Jackie Gleason). But for this CD, the wildest and swingingest tracks were selected (although there is nothing by Esquivel, the King of Space-Age Pop). Most of the tunes here have bizarre instrumentation and crazy stereo effects. Which, of course, is exactly what makes this CD fun to listen to.

I'm a very big Depeche Mode fan, and I think Dave Gahan has more potential than what this album displays. Not only does it drag on and on with the same bland style of music, but the lyrics are poor. There's no poetry and/or insight to any of the verses.......they're more like bad nursery rhymes. And I dont think its Gahan's fault entirely. It sounds like someone didnt look into this project, collaborate and direct it properly. My expectations were that he was going to pursue some new directions....maybe do some non-synth oriented. Instead, you get a can of Diet Depeche Mode. Half the calories with half the taste."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't Buy This CD!","review":"This album is being promoted as being from the former \\"front man\\" of Depeche Mode. Therefore, I purchased it thinking that it would have at least a modest level of the Depeche Mode sound. It doesn't. There is not a single track on this album that I was even remotely impressed with and it certainly bears little resemblance to the music of Depeche Mode. Luckily, I purchased it with a gift certificate so I didn't feel completely robbed after having purchased it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Love Depeche Mode, didn't like this albumn.","review":"Love every Depeche mode albumn, even the much maligned Exciter.[]passed on seeing the concert when it came to Atlanta. It is so sad to see this happen. The truth is that together, the three men that made up DM worked together to put out a very well done product. Cut that into it's separate parts and you have three guys who can't do much good. Dave Gahan cannot write to save his life (as evidenced in this albumn) and Martin Gore's singing doesn't have power without Dave along for the ride. Andrew Fletcher is a great keyboard player, but...well you know the rest. Weak lyrics, weak beats, no emotion make for a painful listen.Avoid this if you love Depeche Mode, buy it if you are in love with Dave...sorry to say I am not."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately, very weak.","review":"I understand Dave's effort to make a solo record, and I admire it in some small way. However, this simply does not cut it. This album is truly disappointing and fails to spark the same feeling that Martin Gore's solo album does. The music is simply un-interesting. I'm getting tired of reading reviews from all these Depeche fanatics that will praise ANYTHING released by the members of Depeche Mode. Do not listen to them - this album sounds NOTHING like DM.Why did I give it two stars and not one? Because a couple of tracks on this record are decent - 'Bottle Living' and 'Black And Blue Again'. Obviously, two songs are simply not enough to make a strong record. If you are looking for some really mellow tunes to listen to (and that is the only thing this album provides), purchase Martin Gore's album 'Couterfeit 2'.Dice"},{"rating":"2","title":"I liked this album","review":"I personally thought this album was a tribute to the growth of Dave Gahan both in his music and his personal experiences. Granted it doesn't carry the same dark and moody feel as the early DM albums, but I see that as a good thing. This is his way of breaking away from the image he has as the lead singer of DM. It's also a personal look at the struggles he's been through and what he's overcome. It's like getting a look into the man behind the music and fame. The tunes are catchy, the beats will move you."},{"rating":"2","title":"I really liked this album...","review":"I personally thought this album was a testiment to Dave's growth both in his music and his personal experiences. Granted it doesn't have the same dark and moody feel of the early DM albums, but I believe that's a good thing. This is his branching off from that whole scene. And this album is quite personal, almost like getting a small peek into the man behind the fame. This album made me laugh, made me cry, made me wanna dance the night away. I can't wait to hear what he comes out with next, whether it's another solo album or one with DM."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well done debut solo album by the frontman of DM","review":"I knew I had to buy this, eventually, since I'm a huge fan of Depeche Mode, mostly due to Dave Gahan's performances, and I wanted to show my support for his solo activities. The music is actually even better than I expected. But the real sweetness is him performing these songs live. Pick up the \\"Live Monsters\\" DVD, as well as various bootlegs."},{"rating":"1","title":"what did you expect?","review":"There has been a lot of talk over the years about the fact that it was only Martin Gore who had songs represented on Depeche Modes albums. Well here is why! There is not one single song on this album that really leaves an impression on the listener. Several of them are okay and can be heard more than once. But the majority seems to disappear after you have heard them once. The production is absolutely great and lifts several of the tracks a little bit higher, but the album does not come anywhere near Depeche Mode or Martin gores soloalbums!! The absolutely worst thing about this album is the lyrics, they really drag the whole thing down. If only Gahan had asked someone else to them, I would probably had given this album an extra star!! Sorry Dave!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Greatly disappointed!!!","review":"I did not get what I ordered at all. I ordered the 3-step treatment form and rec'd the 2-step treatment form.

It's really a great product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not pleased","review":"I ordered the item shown, but another item was substituted although the invoice showed the item that was ordered, sending two of the substitutes to nearly equal the price of one of the item ordered.America RX credited back the money, I sent back the item.I STILL HAVE NOT RECEIVED THE ITEM ORDERED AND INVOICED."},{"rating":"1","title":"The 1-step version blows","review":"The original version with the dropper is great! But this version with the pre-moistened applicator totally sucks. With the original version, you put a few drops on, and there is plenty to cover a skin crack. But the pre-moistened variety must have barely a quarter drop in it. It practically evaporates dry between the time you open the package and bring it to your skin."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perfect for difficult cuts","review":"These liquid band-aids are perfect. If you have a small cut on your fingernail and want to avoid the unsightly and \\"germy mess\\" of a wrap, these are your answer. The only drawback is the amount of packaging, but at least it keeps them sterile. It rather expensive, around 70 cent per application, but they can really be useful."},{"rating":"1","title":"I ordered this and got the new version, which is USELESS","review":"This is the only liquid bandaid that is worth buying. I've tried others that smell and feel like nail polish and strip off in a minutes. This one is invisible, stays put...is simply excellent. The catch - I think it's discontinued and when I ordered it from here the last time I got the wrong product, which is the individually wrapped pre-soaked sticks that are a total waste of money and time. Others had posted the same thing, but for some reason those reviews have disappeared from the site. Worse part, you cannot return it because it is a medical-related product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Product note","review":"Note that this vendor can no longer obtain the two-part liquid bandage.This is now the same quick applicator sold by other vendors.

Use dropper bottle to moisten dry sticks before applying. This version with the pre-prepared moistened sticks just doesn't work.

He loves the various pieces that come with it that weren't in the larger set he bought first. This allows him to be even more creative in his designs.I can't tell you how many hours he has spent playing with this. He usually will play with something for half and hour and come looking for something else. There have been times he has been up in his room creating for several hours. There are enough pieces in this bucket to create several projects at once or something HUGE using all the whole set.I love the fact that everything fits right back into the tub. There is a much better chance of the set staying together that way. I just think it's a great set."},{"rating":"1","title":"Looks nice, but that's it. Dangerous.....","review":"We bought two of these for our home. I wish we hadn't wasted our money. Had to buy better ones to replace these. I agree with the other reviewer that if you tighten it too much, the you have problems with the latch opening and closing properly, but if you loosen it slightly, the whole thing can be pushed by yourself or a curious toddler. Not to mention what I consider the worst defect - there is a frame of wood at the bottom that you have to step over each time you cross the gate. Everyone who has been to our house has tripped over this at some point. I have tripped carrying my baby and have almost lost platefuls of food. My 16 month old trips over it when I do let her out of the room. You're better off getting a gate that is either hardware mounted or doesn't have a bottom frame."},{"rating":"1","title":"our third one - but not for good reasons","review":"We bought this gate and loved it at first until it broke, the wood split on a seem that wasn't glued together properly at the factory. So we returned that one a got another, well the latched just snapped and broke into a whole bunch of pieces so we brought that one back. The third one broke the same way the first one did, we won't be getting another. This gate is a piece of junk and not worth the money. It can't handle kids hanging on it the way kids do. Isn't that the whole purpose of a child safety gate? To keep your little ones out of a place that you don't want them and they are going to be on the other side of the gate trying to get in. I wouldn't NOT buy the wood one again, maybe we can try the metal one with better results."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice to look at, but a pain to operate","review":"This gate does look very nice and matches our golden oak woodwork in our home. That's probably the only plus I can give it. When it is pressure mounted tight enough to not slip along the wall, then it's too tight to close and lock by itself as it is supposed to. It also makes a very loud click when it does close. When it's loose enough to close itself, then it's too loose and slips back and forth along the wall. Even when it does close, the bottom is not secure and and moves back and forth when pressed upon. Not an item that I'd ever recommend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Piece of garbage","review":"Yes, the wood finish is nice. It would have looked great in our home. But it's flimsy and not stable at all. You can extend the screws up to 3\\" on each side... at 2 1/4\\" it is very unstable and would never hold back a child."},{"rating":"1","title":"I was injured by this gate","review":"The locks were defective. The door partially opened - enough so I started to walk forward, but then the bottom locks did not release so the door snapped back at me and caused me to fall forward, over the gate, with my hands still holding the swinging door (and therefore unable to break my fall). I fell on my face on a hard floor and had to have stitches and $$$ dental work. It was horrible, just glad I wasn't holding my baby when it happened. If you own this gate and the locks don't seem to release properly BE CAREFUL!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Defective product","review":"I bought this product and paid the expensive next day delivery which is almost as expensive as the product itself. It was very disappointing to receive the product and see that's defective, the door doesn't close and the parts don't even fit together. Maybe this one missed the quality check, now I have to put the time that I don't have and the effort and send it back"},{"rating":"1","title":"It broke--dangerous product","review":"I bought this gate because it seemed sturdy and was nicer looking than most. Within 6 months, the main part of the gate fell apart and the pieces that hold it to the frame snapped. Had it been at the top of the steps instead of in the kitchen, my daughter would have fallen down the steps. Please do not waste your money on this gate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"I agree with most of the other reviewers. If you tighten it too much the latch doesn't work, if you loosen it then it falls down. People regularly trip over the bar at the bottom. Because it has fallen down several times it has marked up our walls quite a bit. I originally bought three and I have taken them all back.It is as if they created this product but never tested it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good and reliable sturdy gate","review":"When you pull it out of the box it looks defective. Since it is pressure mounted it will straighten up once installation is complete.Easy to use. Looks good and looks like a quality gate."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"The gate really does look nice. That's about it, though. The quality is very poor and the hinges are made of very cheap and flimsy black plastic. Because of this, it's easy to open the gate and not realize the bottom portion is still \\"locked in\\". This is because the plastic hinges are so flimsy that the gate door can kind of \\"twist\\" so that the top portion moves outward a good distance while the bottom portion is still closed. Also, the description isn't very clear (nor are the details on the box) about the extensions. The gate's advertised maximum width of 40.5\\" includes the extensions.If you want a similar design with a far better build quality, get the First Years Hands Free Gate instead."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Gate","review":"I like the gate, very easy to install. After putting together umpteen differnt baby items, I have come to the conclusion that not all assembly instructions are created equal. These instructions were well written, and didn't read as if they were translated into english. The woodwork is nice on this unit. I have one problem, it says in the instructions that there are optional mounting cups that can be ordered on the vendor's website. I really wish they would have just included these. It couldn't be more than a 50 cent item. I need them for my installation for our particular door opening. I can't find them on thier website. I'm going to have to call them. Again, we are pleased with the function and appearance of this door."},{"rating":"1","title":"The gate was defective.","review":"This gate was made about 2 inches out of square, it would not close or latch, and would not fit properly in a doorway. At first I thought it had been damaged during shipping, but it was just made improperly. I would not recommend this product. I saw where someone else had this problem too, and I thought I would take a chance, since I liked the color and style, but no luck."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Hidden Cost of Being African American: How Wealth perpetuates Inequality","review":"Finally, a book that acknowledges the historical inequalities of any people, in this instance, African Americans.

As a result, politicians currently have very little incentive to court African American voters. Somehow, this minor detail slipped Shapiro's mind.Not a lot of credibility here.Moreoever, Shapiro grew up a middle-class white Jew. Normally this wouldn't matter, but when discussing poor black communities, I'd like to hear it from the source. I know Shapiro is well regarded, but I had a hard time with this book.

And even after the first chapter of this book I expected it to be. However after the first chapter, the new information was simply repeated for 15 pages using examples that are misleading, and often not even accepted by the author himself. Shapiro talks of how white families understate the amount of help they recieve, but does not even hint at being suspicious of the same answers by african americans.

This is the perfect size for travel...when he got too big to put it on the side of his crib (because he could look directly into it and hurt his little eyes) we moved it to a dresser propped up on a towel which works great!

One of her first smiles was directed at the little orange toy...we think.Maybe we don't use it that much, but we have only replaced the batteries 2 or 3 times in 4 months. Also, we use the swing with a Boppy Noggin Nest so she doesn't get \\"flat head.\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A SERIOUS waste of money","review":"This swing gets one star because it's easy to fold up and store. That's it. We loved it when we first got it. Then we discovered that it went through 4 D batteries EVERY WEEK. We used it anyway, and paid out our ears for batteries for a couple of months. Then, after about 2 months of use, it started slowing down. A week later it wouldn't go at all. Now it sits in our storage room while I think evil thoughts about sending it to the dump. It's a classy LOOKING swing, but a piece of crap. I'm still mad that I spent $100 on that useless thing. It's been almost a year and a half since we got it.But who knows? Maybe ours was just a faulty one. Or maybe they all just suck. Not a risk I'm ever going to take again. Seriously, don't buy it. If your experience is anything like ours, you'll regret it for the rest of your life. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Just like what was shown on PBS","review":"I took a class on Dealing with Difficult People and the instructor showed us the video.

The duet with Wyclef Jean is something that should never have happened, and if the gods are merciful, will never occur again. THERE's a few minutes of my life I wish I could get back. Also, they left off the duet with Sheryl Crow and Kris Kristofferson doing \\"Me and Bobby McGee\\", which I though was fantastic. IF this ever comes out on DVD, it'd be worth owning just to see the look on Willie's face as Wyclef Jean is massacring \\"To all the girls I've loved before\\". He's staring at him like he had just stepped off a spaceship. Pretty funny scene there. All in all, this CD is worth owning...they should just have left off the \\"unlistenable\\" and kept on some of the better performances. Happy 70th, Willie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A non-review","review":"I almost saw him at Billy Bob's. It was an all-day affair for the 4th of July, lots of groups with \\"Wille and Friends\\" headlining. The whole day was underscored by bad performances - only one group did very well. This type of lineup always sells out at Billy Bob's, but I don't think they ever got to 60% capacity at any part of the day. Getting towards Willie's 11:00 PM slot, I noticed a lot of people leaving. I asked a few why and all of them told me that they had seen him last year and that he wasn't very good - that he was getting up in age and couldn't sing very well. I got on my smartphone and started reading reviews that seemed to concur. Like Willie, I am getting older too, and I had to go to work the next day, so I left too - so I do't know how well he did.

This is a poorly produced album in which the sound is all but lost at times due to audience noise.

Its an impressive gathering of artists but its a disappointing grouping of songs and performances."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointed","review":"I was not impressed at all. Some of the songs really sound bad. Off key and if you really like the origianl \\"Of all the girls I've loved before\\" you will be extremely sick hearing this version.

Willie needs to be in the studio when he records."},{"rating":"2","title":"in-depth theoretical approach with very little bias","review":"This book is a great textbook for any beginning anthropological student (whether or not you're in school) though it is very dense and tough to get through. First, you get a paragraph or so explaining the background of the person whose theories are being presented. Then you get the basic reactions and opinions of the scholar and their theories, followed by an explanation of the theories themselves. In some cases, you also get other scholars' criticisms and then the original's rebuttals. Morris seems to have a pretty liberal approach to the field, and it is rare to see his biases show."},{"rating":"2","title":"GREAT PRICe!","review":"This was a great price for a large package of heavyweight cardstock!

This book was awful... unless you're an amateur author looking for evidence that anyone (and I mean anyone!) can get published. The dialogue, the names, the plot were totally unbelievable. I never write in books, but by the time I was done, I was going through marking it up like I was in a creative workshop to make me feel as if I had accomplished at least something by reading it. Nothing about this book flowed. The only thing I liked about this book was one vague reference to JAG, my favorite TV show. Other than that, this book was a complete waste of time and money. It was full of cliches, plotholes, and bad, bad dialogue. I've read better written fanfiction."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not having the greatest luck with this one...","review":"I got this a few months ago & my laptop constantly drops its wireless connection. The only way to get it back is rebooting the router. This sounds very similar to the issue another reviewer was having. An email to support has so far gone unanswered (sent it 5 days ago). No documentation online other than their manual. Pretty disappointed in this one - I've hooked up my old DLink router which is probably worth about a tenth of what this one cost me & it's running like a champ.

That didn't happen.I was told by bountiful then that they had my router ready to ship to me immediately. after 4 days, I called and asked where my router was and was told that a supervisor at bountiful had cancelled my router and sent the unit to some other customer.I have now been told that bountiful is overnighting a router to me.

I would NOT recommend this router to any one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy it!!!","review":"I bought this router for the promises of distances of a quarter mile even though I just wanted it to connect straight out the window about 75 yards a way in another building. Not only in the end did the router not even go the distance, the installation was thoroughly disappointing and not even remotely up to par with other brands. Some parts of the manual don't work if you are using MAC, the auto run for the mac does not work, and once you get the instructions working, they are confusing, not detailed, and sequential. Then once you get it running the fan noise reminds of me my 1994, 486 computer. If you have a couple of hours to spend remembering the configuration old days where everything was manual, you don't mind that the range is no further than a normal router, you have over $250 to spend, and you don't want to hear the person on the phone because the fan is too loud then this router is for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down!","review":"I've read other books by Judith Lansdowne and enjoyed them, but with this book I had to read it completely to the end in one sitting.

(We do a lot of gardening and need to seal the cuts on our hands against dirt after applying antibiotic cream.) When we later try to remove the entire dressing, the 3M tape peels off easily, but leaves the bandaid in a terrible mess underneath. The top layer of the flexible fabric bandaid separates from the mesh grid underneath, and shreds into pieces. We're left having to individually peel off tiny pieces of fabric and mesh, which takes some degree of time and effort--something that doesn't happen when we use standard bandaids under the 3M tape. Granted, we don't use the flexible fabric bandaid alone the way it's designed, but we can't because it doesn't seal well enough to keep cuts clean so that we can do our work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Fabric unraveling!

The inside sterile pad extends to the edge of the bandage on both sides; there is no adhesive to seal around the wound.

Probably not.I wasn't expecting Depeche Mode, but I wasn't expecting it to be so dreary and uncompelling either. The title track is ok, as are a couple of other tunes (the lyrics are still bad), however the remaining tracks go nowhere, slow.

Overall, the game is a little difficult, but after an hour or so, the game becomes much easier. Unlike the other people, I found the controls very easy to get used to. Also, some of the things that you have to do in this game are pretty tough, but not unbeatable. I also loved the variety and tunability for the cars.

But is completely horrible when it comes to protection."},{"rating":"2","title":"An absolute necessity for the PSP","review":"Unlike the Nintendo DS, designed with its own cover, the PSP has NO protection whatsoever. It is a fairly fragile system at risk for damage or breakage if dropped. The Logitech Playgear Pocket is a great solution to this problem. For the price, it brings peace of mind and serves as a storage case, a frame that allows films to be viewed 'hands free' and it does not interfere with gameplay or recharging the system.It is fairly heavy, but that may be inevitable as it has a decent lining that cushions the system in the event of being dropped. There is no extra storage space for games, but the decision not to include extra space may have been an effort to limit its total size and weight. I highly recommend this to any one with a PSP."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply Excellent","review":"This is one of the best cases available for the PSP. The rubbery inner lining holds the unit firm and secure and the hard plastic-like outer shell provides excellent protection from any drops, knocks, or bangs. It is very versatile, allowing the PSP to remain in the case while being played or charged and can prop the unit upright for movie/video viewing. Only cons are that dust can get into easy access areas (headphone and power adaptor ports for example), there's no storage space for extra umd's or mem. cards, and it adds a little weight and size to the PSP (making carrying the PSP in your pocket only slightly uncomfortable). Overall though, the Playgear Pocket is definitely worth buying and should be considered a must have accessory for the PSP."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not compatible with psp 2000","review":"The openings do not allow access to the headphone jack. Meaning if you wanted to use headphones with this case you would have to take the psp out. Kinda defeats the purpose. Also the switch for wifi in the psp 2000 is on top and there is no access hole for that either. Functional only for old psp edition."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good protection, but not for psp slim","review":"I bought it and it's a good protection for the regular psp, and it was a shame, because I got the slim one ...

The cool thing about reverse macro work is that the mount is irrelevant (filter threads are universal, after all).

It perplexes me why one would need to reverse a specific EF lens. Just get a superb old Canon FD lens, or Nikkor, or Olympus Zuiko, or Pentax SMC, etc...That being said, I've tried this on a whim in a camera store, and it does work quite well (hence the two stars).

For one thing, it was much more watery, with significantly less of the concentrate at the bottom, and for another, the color was a much streakier orangey hue than the pink it used to be. Don't know if the manufacturer is trying to cut corners by offering up a sub-par, cheaper formula or if I just got a bad batch, but I was deeply disappointed. The new product doesn't really work, either, whereas before it was effective almost immediately.Why mess with a dependably successful formula?

One excellent thing about this book is that he gives you lots of examples, so that it will be easier for the readers to understand. He gives you a excellent VB6 overview. I also bought Sam's teach yourself vb6 in 21 days before I bought this book. Sam's book was the worst vb book I have read, and there was not much examples and it was hard to understand the code properly.

I was checking out the Smiley books down at the B & M stores, but they seemed to be a little too fluffy for me. I like the idea of code you can look at and concepts presented to you in a logical manner, and this books seems to do a pretty good job of that.My only complaint is the example code sometimes uses stuff you don't learn until later on, which I find very confusing because I like to understand the entire page before i turn to the next one. But once you run into the formally introduced code down the road, it makes a bit more sense.But on the VB scene as a whole, I'd have to say that the books are pretty easy to read, but starting from scratch is a much more daunting task. The only reason I'm learning is to debug, so I'm probably going to have to go out and get some VBA books and some reference materials (probably an o'reilly nutshell book)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cookbook of Abruzzo!","review":"My family is from the Abruzzo region and I just recently visited.

Which is too bad, really, because there is such promise in the premise.Basically this album tends to be explorations on only a couple sets of music ideas: rock and roll. Steve sets up a simple rhythmic foundation (kept in strict metronomic fashion by his son, Dylan, who knows not how to play drums with any style or substance), and then proceeds to noodle around with solos.It's rather like the most boring jazz. There is little structure and arranging here.I think the reason why this was such a let-down is because TURBULENCE, his previous all-instrumental album, was such a masterpiece.

I had never heard of this band! So I picked up the CD, and I can't stop listening to it! The band channels the spirits and passion of Al Green, Sly Stone, Stevie Wonder, Jimi Hendrix, with a bit of P-Funk for good measure. The outcome? Soul like you've never heard before. It is so darned good. Buy this disc. You will not be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic funk and soul...","review":"The Soul of John Black is a band...not a man. No gangsta-rap crap here. Their sound is classic funk and soul with a dash of hip-hop, rock and even some folky interludes with an acoustic guitar. You can hear many various influences hear but I think the most prominent are Sly Stone, Stevie Wonder, Al Green and Lenny Kravitz.

I've been disappointed with other flimsy tracks before but after reading the reviews, I thought this one might be different. When my son opened it for the first time, some of the hinges were missing and one actually had broken off on opening. It was not as sturdy as it had sounded. Perhaps if we didn't get a defective/damaged one, my review would have been different; the racetrack itself is a cool concept. I'm disappointed that it was broken upon opening and I caution potential buyers to tread cautiously."},{"rating":"1","title":"Keeps falling apart","review":"It looks convenient and easy to use doesn't it? How much simpler can you get? Well, every time we go to unfold it, it splits in 1/2. The piece attached to the tower doesn't fold out smoothly, the secondary support constantly collapses, and then the middle hinges come unhinged. My son - who is very gentle with his toys - can make a few runs before something gives out, but he gets frustrated and soon bores with it.This is not worth the money I paid. The only good thing about it really is that it does fold up and is easily stored.I think most of the reviews must be fakes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very, VERY flimsy","review":"I bought this, but soon returned it because it was so incredibly flimsy.

It's easily knocked over, and when it falls, several links of track usually fall apart. The plastic is rigid and the parts fit together (more accurately, stay together) poorly.

Even when it is set up, one small bump the wrong way and it starts to fall apart. This could be a great toy, my son has a wonderful time with it until its in pieces on the floor."},{"rating":"2","title":"kind of flimsy but really fun","review":"Our three year old got this for Christmas and has been playing with it everyday. He loves the racing action and trying out all different cars on it. He also loves the fact that the number \\"flags\\" at the bottom of the track tell him which car won each race. The one downside to this toy is that it is somewhat flimsy. It falls down really easily when it is set up because there is only one bracket in the higher portion and it moves quite easily. The track sets back up quickly so this would not be a deterrent to my buying this toy again since my son seems to love it so much. The track folds up easily and compactly for storing. Overall, a fun toy that I am happy we purchased for him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great toy, but not for $85","review":"I bought this last year at Toys-r-Us for $19.99.

Design and quality of materials leave a lot to be desired."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ok toy","review":"I really like this toy and I would buy it again, but I do wish that it wouldn't come apart so easily. It is fine for the age stated and my son was 4 when he got it and he had no problems with it. But, I also had a 1 year old, and it was too fragile for her to be in the same room with it! So, just be aware that although it's fine for young kids, it will be demolished if they have a younger sibling in the room! It is easy to put back together though, so my son tends to play with it when his little sister is down for a nap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Way better than other Hot Wheels tracks","review":"Most Hot Wheels tracks are fragile, gimmicky set-ups that lose their appeal in a few days. Not this one. Every time your kid gets a new car, he's racing it on this to see if it's faster than his old cars. This means you can buy a couple cars for a buck each every other month and still get value from the track a year from now. And it's fairly well built -- it's 98% plastic, and it's designed to separate should a 9-month-old little brother happen to go Godzilla on it.One suggestion: pick up some extra plastic, orange, Hot Wheels track to connect to the end of this raceway. There are connections there for extra track. And the extra track is a great way to bleed off some speed with a nice ramp. That's my 4-year-old's favorite part."},{"rating":"2","title":"simple design works well","review":"the most complicated thing about this track is the way it folds up for travel and storage, and that isn't hard to figure out. But simple is often underrated. I don't think that any number of twists and turns and gadgets and doo dads can beat the thrill of making your little cars go really fast. We bought this for our three year old son and had it out and racing only three minutes after we got home with it. He can't set up the track by himself (from the storage position) but he can put the cars on, reset the flags and start the cars himself. But I really enjoy playing with him, too. this set is supposed to be linkable with other hotwheels race sets, so it is expandable. I am really glad we chose this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A lot more fun than you'd think","review":"I purchased this for my 4 year old daughter for Xmas. Her and her 6 year old old sister are in love with this toy. It seems quite durabale as they have both fallen on it and stepped on it numerous times. Most of my daughter's cars are of the Disney Pixar variety and were either too wide or too tall for use on the track. Be sure to have plenty of thin and low profile cars on hand.I decided to make it an educational toy by having the girls tell me why they thought certain cars kept winning races. To my surprise they grasped the concept quickly and really got into the experiment phase of the game. I was also surprised that they would much rather play with the race track than their dollhouses or video games.I paid $35 for the race track well over MSRP but it was worth it.I whole heartedly reccomend this toy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Another cheap hot wheels set","review":"I think I may have hit my limit with Hot Wheel sets. This one collapses NON-STOP. I have to tie it up with wires, but that only solves the top tier problem. I have yet to find a Hot Wheels set that doesn't become a pile of plastic in our game room. My best Hot Wheels suggestion is to just get the orange track with the piece that screws it (temporarily)to a table and let your kids build their own cool tracks."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun Track","review":"We bought this track for my son's 4th Birthday and he loves it. He's almost 5 and loves it more.Generally well put together. Falls apart all the time but is easy to put back together. Even a 4 year old can do it :).My only problem I can see is the button used to release the car and send it on its way tends to interfere with the cars located closest giving the cars on the ends an unfair advantage (we are all about fairness in this house). Also, the space from the starting barrier to the back of the track is not long enought for some of his longer cars. Not a big deal but worth mentioning.It's very portable and a very, very fun toy. We are constantly trying to find the fastest car. Race ya!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Endless fun...","review":"I bought this for my 4 yr old nephew, and he send cars down it over and over and over again...It folds up for easy storage, fits four cars, cars go pretty fast, finish line.

In this sense, Balakirev's First Symphony is not only a Beecham classic but classic Balakirev.The nuance, portentous flexibility, fairly exotic and well known of febrile orientalism may be felt all the way through.So this recording is not only highly recommendable for any serious hard listener, but specially for all those Beecham' s fans; due the simple fact this work would go unnoticed if not by him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed","review":"If you have an interest in emptyhand fighting this is a soild portion of filipino traning techniques that will transfer into your martial arts training DVD 1 & 2"},{"rating":"2","title":"I LOVE IT!","review":"I love this cd!

Basically, it's \\"cute\\" - the songs are from the first season of Sailor Moon. I've been wanting the songs like \\"Oh Starry Night\\" and \\"My Only Love\\" ever since I heard them on the show, and I was so excited to hear that they came out with a CD. I like almost all of the songs, except for maybe one or two. Bonus: you get the lyrics, which is useful, because there were some lines I wasn't sure about. I recommend it for young girls, and anyone who enjoys watching the show. I think the soundtrack really goes well with the dubbed show, and I think shows need soundtracks to make them more memorable.

Having painted all the woodwork white, now where the hinges are, they leave a black powdery metal residue all around the hinge turning that area black and the black powdery residue also falls to the floor from opening and closing the doors.

We like it so much we order a case each month. We've done this for the last year. BUT, we are sooooo tired of getting a case where the majority of the cans are dented. In the last shipment, every single can was dented in some manner. It was not Amazon's fault because it was packed properly, so I can only assume that the vendor sends dented cans for those who order cases. So, this is how they treat their repeat customers?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Top quality! Well made!","review":"Top quality. Cuts well. Little bit bulky, heavier than others but it is the quality of the cut that really impresses me. Note that it is the trimmer that is cordless, NOT the clipper. The minor downside is that it doesn't include a case. When you turn it on initially, it has a beginning clattering noise which is gone after one second. You have to follow the instruction and adjust to remove the clattering sound. So don't be alarm by the clatter which sounds like a piece of plastic just shattered. One more thing, the clipper attachment's plastic is not as sturdy or thick of plastic as some of other ones I had but it doesn't affect the quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for home hair cutting","review":"This is a great set of clippers. I had a cheap set for many years, and finally bought this one. Wow, it makes all the difference! It's so easy to use, and cuts very cleanly. The guides make it very easy to cut my husband's hair. I have saved hundreds of dollars by cutting his hair at home over the years. I do wish it came with a few longer guides (the longest is 1 inch) because now my daughter is cutting my hair with the clippers, and while I have short hair, it's not quite that short! But she still does a good job by pulling it away from my head, and it cuts well enough that it's pretty easy to do that smoothly. Overall, if you are willing to try to cut hair, you can do a great job with this - everyone in our family gets haircuts from these clippers, so they do save a lot of money in the long run."},{"rating":"1","title":"HORRIBLE DO NOT BUY!","review":"Only last for like a month!

Most \\"travel\\" bags either had no room for a computer or no protected room for a computer and most computer bags were really geared for only computers, the associated cables and perhaps a file folder or two.There are plenty of small pockets for small things so they don't get lost inside and it has a clever document pocket for things like tickets that is deep and open right near the top.This bag does it all and still fits within airline size guidelines for carry-on bags.

No better, no worse.Better suggestion: The Harolyn Blackwell recording of these with better orchestrations by Jonathan Tunick (Mr. Hochman's make the orchestrational error constantly called \\"masking\\" and tis irritating\\".)

Exception to the Rule, The Back of Your Hand, and Planes and Boats and Trains are all highlights. The duet with Wilie Nelson is also good, although not exceptional. Late Great Golden State is probably the song the album could do without. The sad thing is that you will most likely have to buy the album to hear these songs - \\"country\\" radio probably won't touch it.

I am very excited about this release and find it much more satisfying that his last two albums combined. I look at music this way. I had much rather have quality music than a long disc that you're ready to throw away half way through.In this day and age when country has become watered down pop it is refreshing to hear an artist stick with his roots and that's what you get here. Pure unadulterated, Dwight Yoakam."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poop-ulation Me","review":"Make no mistake -- I am a huge Dwight Yoakam fan. Unfortunately, his latest effort contains few memorable tracks. Asside from the gritty honky tonker, \\"No Such Thing\\", most of these tunes strike me as either over-produced or bland.The lyrics in track one, \\"The Late Great Golden State\\", are liable to make even the most hearty Dwight devotee cringe. It's so cluttered with bad rhymes that it makes you wonder if Dwight didn't order a rhyming dictionary from Amazon.com the day before he recorded this clunker.From then on, there's little to hold your attention. You may find yourself skipping tune after tune until you sit back in your chair and wonder out loud -- oh, is that it?For your money, \\"Tomorrow's Sounds Today\\" and \\"Long Way Home\\" are much stronger offerings. However, if you're like me and you insist on owning every Dwight album, this one will at least satisfy your Bakersfield fix until the man himself comes to your hometown."},{"rating":"2","title":"His Second Best Album","review":"This is an outstanding album. My favorite Yoakam album is Dwight Yoakam Live...and this is my second favorite. I like every cut on the album. If you're a Yoakam fan you will love this album. Yoakam has a country rockabilly style that is very original and I love his style. I think this is a contender for best country album of the year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Stands out amongst sound-alike country artists!","review":"When so much country music sounds like over produced pop, Dwight's music is powerful enough to attract fans from diverse backgrounds. I personally spend most of my time listening to artist such as Tom Petty, Peter Gabriel, Mark Knopfler, etc. However, I've been a fan of Dwight's music since the first time I heard \\"Honky Tonk Man\\". For my money, \\"Population Me\\" is Dwight's best release since \\"This Time\\". After listening to this CD for two days, my favorite tracks are \\"An Exception To The Rule\\", \\"Population Me\\", and \\"If Teardrops Were Diamonds\\". If you are a Dwight Yoakam fan, get this CD!"},{"rating":"2","title":"On of the best CD from Dwight","review":"I only bought this cd last week and since i bought it it hasnt been taken out of the player the best song has to be The back of your hand i buy every Dwight Yoakam cd and this is on of his best"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of his better....","review":"This is one of Dwight Yoakams better albums! I just love the last track, The Back of Your Hand. I guess I like the slower songs on this album, like Population Me, just a lovely track and his voice carries the tune so good. He has a nice mix of country stiles, some slow and some faster but all are very good. Track #8 is also very good, duet with one of country music's biggest stars, Willie Nelson. You might say that Dwight Yoakam is famous for his special voice; I mean, it has a good country twang to it... I really recommend this album and I give it 4 stars out of 5, I would have given it 5 stars if there were more tracks like the last tune on the album, simply the best song on the album!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I'm not old, just out of date.....","review":"Yes, it's only 32 minutes, but 32 minutes from a great musician is better than 60 minutes of attention-wanting stereotypical cartoon buffoonery, no not just 50 cent in the hiphop arena, but also it is what Toby Keith is and part of the reason I don't listen to the majority of country music. However, even classic soul heads like me who enjoy the genius of Donny Hathaway and Raphael Saadiq recognize incredible talent when they hear it. For me, the Burt Bacharach cover, the title track, \\"I'd avoid me too\\", \\"Late Great Golden State\\" and the first single \\"The back of your hand\\" resonate the most with me. Honestly though, there isn't a throwaway track on the album. I promise Mr. \\"Boot in your posterior end\\"/\\"Insert foot in mouth\\" doesn't make an appearance, just good singing, songwriting and the musicianship that will keep this \\"soulhead\\" a fan for life."},{"rating":"2","title":"pleased to find this item","review":"I was glad to have found this!

Not only that it wasn't powerful enough as well.H11 is very unique fitting and it is hard to find in local dealers because only few vehicles use it. Like my 2006 4Runner. So you dont have much options.

Instead I read about a lifestyle that was so strange to me I couldn't stomach finishing the book. The book goes in to great detail about a lifestyle having nothing to do with products from the hive, like exercising hours a day, eating raw meat and checking your bowel movements each day. I am sending the book back to Amazon and have never sent a book back before. I have never written a review before so I am not that critical of a person."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bad zero stars isn't an option","review":"This is quite likely the worst piece of fiction--gay or otherwise--I've ever run across; at least, none worse jumps to mind. Even if it were meant to be mere erotica, I think there is some requirement that the material be mildly erotic. This book fails at every level. There is no plot; no character development; no interesting events; no mildly praiseworthy elements of prose; no good reason for reading this book.Worse yet, this is an example of self-loathing gay fiction. The chief character (I refuse to use the word \\"protaganist\\" in describing anyone at all in this book) is at best a festishest. The only thing this book seems to try to convey is that all straight men can be had, a rather flimsy, not to say unlikely, premise."},{"rating":"1","title":"A complete waste of time","review":"I enjoy gay fiction as well as gay erotica. However I have a hard time classifying this as either. The plot was boring, and the sex scenes were just plain stupid. By the time I was half way through, I realized I really did not care at all what happened to any of the characters. I forced myself to finish thinking that it might \\"pick up\\" in the last part. Now I wish I had just dupmed it in the trash at that point instead of wasting my time. If you are looking for a good read, look someplace else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Absolute Trash","review":"When someone writes a book, it is assumed that they want people to like it.Perhaps this was not the case with this.Or perhaps I have standards.There was graphic sex, every other page, with no redemption to the characters. There was no reason for them to do the things they did and had I known any of these people in real life, I would have reported them for the criminal acts they committed.If you are looking for a good, quality read, then this is CERTAINLY not the book you want to read. I suggest anything else...a magazine, an advertisement for Jiffy Lube, the back of the toothpaste container...anything but the trash that is encompassed between the front and back covers of this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun & Capable DSLR at Point & Shoot Price","review":"A new camera won't make you a better photographer, but taking more pictures might, and that's where the E-330 shines. It's rewarding to use and the tilting LCD with live view encourages experimentation.The E-330 feels solid and all the buttons are well-placed. Image quality is generally excellent, although there are better cameras for low-light, flashless photography. Focus, frame rate and overall performance is plenty fast for action at my son's soccer games, but USB file transfer is slow so get an external card reader.Do not underestimate the usefulness of dual-mode live view on a tilting LCD. You won't think it's a gimmick once you have it. Also, the E-330's built-in flash can be used for fill-in with a shoe-mounted flash; another feature that's proven to be much more useful than expected."},{"rating":"2","title":"Travel Motrin Pouches","review":"It's nice, with todays travel, to have daily pouches for almost all personal needs.

This book didn't provide as much opportunity for character relationships due to the situations they found themselves in. Janeway is definitely missed, but it gives the others a chance to shine, especially Chakotay, who was definitely underused in the series. And seeing Kes brought back in such a lovely way, and providing an excuse for the strange episode Fury, was just great. It was also nice to have an excuse for the confusing season 5 premiere, Night. This is a great trilogy, and I recommend it whether or not you liked the series, because at times, this is better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"3rd book-Star Trek, String Theory by H.

It does the job of closing the series for sure but I was rather disappointed with the story teller."},{"rating":"1","title":"Action Kate is missing in action","review":"I know it is not easy to write novels, so I will try not to be too critical here. As a diehard Voyager fan, I was instantly disappointed that the author left Janeway out of the entire book, and just when things with the Nacene battle started to get good, the author takes out Torres! The 2 biggest heros of the series are MIA. The book was narrated too much. It got boring. I loved the first two in the series. This author needs to watch Voyager a few more times to understand the appeal. (especially the appeal to female trekkies) Other than that, God bless her for trying to write star trek... sci fi is difficult."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nikkor Optics for your Leica M","review":"Novoflex built this slick little adapter so that you can take advantage of your vast collection of Nikkor lenses. It fits like a charm, and works well with Leica's in-camera metering systems. I used this on a Leica M6TTL as well as a Leica MP. There were no conflicts. I used a variety of lenses from the 13mm f/5.6 Nikkor AIS exotic ultra-wide to the 58mm f/1.2 Noct-Nikkor (head to head testing of the Noctilux by Leica with the Nikon high speed lens). No problems with mounting nor conflict issues. While I did mount my Fisheye-Nikkor 7.5mm f/5.6 lens on the M6 successfully, I did notice some image cutoff. Will test that again with the MP. I have no idea why that would happen. For the most part, this adapter is not a problem. Of course, the focusing cam is non-functional and focus should be via the manual method or using hyperfocal rules."},{"rating":"2","title":"Blue Monday Never Sounded Soo Good!","review":"I saw a commercial for Kylie's new album \\"Fever\\" when I was in London.

They are wide enough that if you put a sheet protector in the binder you can still see the tabs perfectly. The plastic is very durable. Yes, in time, my son has torn some of the dividers but I know they have held up much longer than paper dividers would have. I prefer the 5-tab to the 8-tab, since the tabs are bigger.

The only complaint I have is that the strings tend to slip down a note and I have to constantly keep tuning it through jam sessions. However there have also been times when they stay perfect. Not sure if I'm doing anything wrong, as I'm only a novice player, but the guitar itself is beautiful, sounds great when tuned, and plays like a champ.

There is no redeeming value in the music - it is a clutter of poorly captured, tedious sequences with repulsive sound quality, even for its day, and Ginger's addled narration is an embarassment.Could any family or others with an interest in his legacy, please immediately retrieve whatever stock remain and, very thoroughly, destroy them all ...

The scenes are beautifully constructed - sharp black & white - that bring you into the characters of both cities.

I actually bought it with the intent of using the device as an extra data drive if I didn't like the player, so it's not a total waste of money if you buy this and then decide you don't like it.I would have to say that for the price, this little guy packs a good wallop, but I wouldn't buy it for a child with small hands or an older person as their first-ever MP3 player, because the buttons are just too much of a hassle to use easily and intuitively."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good for a while...","review":"My mom bought this for me for my birthday in 2007.

No matter how fresh the battery was, it would only last about 30 minutes.When I went to replace it, I couldn't find many that were in a similar price range with the same features, so I bought a second one, hoping the first one had just been a bad apple. However, my second Sansa did exactly the same thing as the first, this time after only 6 months!Once could be an anomaly; but twice means there's an inherent flaw in the way these things are made. Never again!"},{"rating":"1","title":"BEWARE Piece of JUNK!!!!!!!!","review":"Had this mp3 player for about 2 months, with very light use. I would basically use it when my other mp3 player was too bulky or for easy FM access. Well the thing short it out, like with many of the other users who have rated it. Now I only get sound from one headphone. Contacted customer service and they told me to update the firmware, I did that, still not fixed. Well they basically told me, in a nice way, \\"too bad.\\" So im stuck with a mono mp3 player. DO NOT BUY THIS!!!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My first mp3 player","review":"i'm an old fart at 37 years old and a little behind in everything except desktop pc's. was very frustrated with this gadget when i couldn't figure it out in fifteen minutes after receiving it. the next day, i slowed down, relaxed and figured it out in 15 minutes. didn't know what the hype was about these mp3 thingamajigs. i do now! how did i go so long without one? over a 1000 of my fav songs and a radio into something this small.... absolutely incredible. it has motivated me to start exercising because of its great company. i highly recommend! btw, you print the 16 page manual from the cd included. print the manual before you do anything!"},{"rating":"2","title":"my son loves it","review":"it's small, it's easy to operate and best of all it's cheap. My son says the sound quality is just as good as or better than his ipod touch and if he loses this one, it's no big deal. Love that it has a rechargeable battery and the ability to add a microSD card too."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great mp3 for the price","review":"It's very easy to use, and I can quickly add and remove media from it. For the price, it works great, although I was a little disappointed with the sound quality, but again, for the price it wasn't a big deal. The sound was just, not very crisp--no matter what quality of headphones I use with it, the sound doesn't change."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best choice","review":"I have had other Sansa MP3 players and loved them. With the kind of work that I do I use these things A LOT! I don't get much use from this player and here is why.1. Battery doesn't last that long when charged and has to be plugged in a USB port to charge. A huge hassle.2. Screen contrast is awfull. If you have any vision issues at all this screen will be almost impossible to see.The buttons are fairly easy to use and the sound is good. But with the other problems I would skip this model and find one a little more user friendly. I still like Sansa just not this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Satisfied customer","review":"This was my first mp3 player, and the hardest problem I had was taking the battery cover off ..lol honestly its rough going getting that sucker off.

Really a poor design unless you never go outside."},{"rating":"1","title":"No MSC mode","review":"The only reason I bought this device is that it claimed it has \\"MSC\\" mode. Apparently there is a version 2 of the device that has only MTP mode. The point of this limitation is lost on me and it is very disappointing (in this instance specifically, and more generally, for the future of mankind). If I want to treat it as a drive (right click on a file - send to), why not?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Design, Really Bad Sound","review":"I own an iPod but I was looking for a small, lightweight, inexpensive device that supports to-go services for use on bike rides and at the gym. The c250 meets this criteria and the transfer rates were great. I thought I made a great choice...but then I listened to the output. I tried a fleet of headphones but none could make the sound quality even close to adequate. It's a little worse than AM radio quality. I tried to justify it because the design meets my needs, but in the end I need a device that plays music. Perhaps the iPod has spoiled me. I wouldn't mind giving this device to a nephew under twelve or a grandmother. In the end, I owned it for six hours.I ended up going with a Creative Zen V Plus. I think I like the weight and design of this device better, but the Zen offers much better sound quality. Not great, but adequate sound for activities."},{"rating":"1","title":"Waste of money","review":"Purchasing that player was total waste of money. I didn't have a chance to listen to it even once before it died. My laptop running Windows Vista had trouble recognizing the device (my other Windows XP computer did find it and I was able to upload 2GB of songs). I was obsessed with making my Vista laptop to recognize the device so I tried different suggestions from official sandisk website plus other ones I found on forums. The last solution I tried was uploading firmware from sandisk website. The firmware was loaded, the player reported that it was rebooting itself and ... died. Now I'm able to turn in on and off but display is dead (gray color). I spent hours searching for suggestions on how to bring it back to life but holding all these buttons, connecting/reconnecting to a computer, etc. didn't work. The player has all these great features but it misses one of the most important ones - ability to work."},{"rating":"1","title":"OK player if you dont use the extended MicroSD","review":"The player works fine, but the mp3 materials I loaded on the two MicroSD could not be read or played."},{"rating":"2","title":"hey, it's nice.","review":"the sansa c250 mp3 player i received, promptly, and have been enjoying since the beginning of sept.08 is my initial foray into the marvelous technology of personal and very compact music players. it's so easy to learn to use, recharges with a usb plug into any computer and it really does sound great (i purchased earbuds for comfort). i like it, especially, for the wma support (and now i've let the cat out of the bag); which many other player manufacturers are giving up on. i feel as if i should buy a couple of more and store them if i ever need another but i suppose i'll just stay with this one until it gives up the ghost. real good price and everything else about this little player i'm really like enjoying, dudes."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissatisfied","review":"I thought this device could use a 8 GB microSD card.

Neat little machine but if you expect to use the functions get a more evolved model. Hard to set, easy to mess up, no battery life, buttons are a design flaw/not user friendly. The older battery version (m100)is easier. Save your money and get a good ipod or zune when you decide what music format you will keep (forever) but leave this alone. Looks great, nice idea, just needs work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Usually when you purchase an item like this one, you receive a manual or owner's guide that gives detailed instructions on how to use it. This is not the case with the Sansa c250 mp3 player. I have had to hunt for information on the Internet just to get things done. Information that's missing:1. Albums folder: what is its function, how can I populate it?2. MTP mode: the only reason I know about this \\"mode\\" is because I found out about it on a few sites that have help forums. I don't know what MTP stands for, and the message \\"USB connected MTP\\" does not show up when I go into Auto-detect mode and then connect the c250 to the PC.3. How about telling the user what MTP nd MSC mean? It would be nice to be told this stuff, especially if you're new to devices like these.4. Where are the instructions for creating playlists?The owner's manual for my toaster oven is the size of a small book in comparison, surely SanDisk could have come up with a more detailed instruction manual."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good but only for awhile","review":"Overall it is a nice mp3 player, however, it only lasted 6 months. I lost sound from one of the headphones, and then no sound at all.

For the life of me, I couldn't get it to play tracks in the order that they appear on the album.

It's my first MP3 player purchase, so I really can't compare it to others, I can only say how much I really like this particular model. It is extremely easy to load songs onto, playing music is easy, I have even hooked it up to our home theater system and played it via our home speakers. I do recommend this to anyone looking for an MP3 player. My only con for this player is that it doesn't come with an AC adapter to plug in at home, only the USB cord to charge via computer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review after 2.5 years usage","review":"I got this Radio / MP3 Media Player in January 2009.After I received it, I filled the 2 GB of space with music.Not long thereafter I noticed that the media player would reset or lock every time it started playing some songs (I suspect WMA files).After that, I stopped using the MP3 Player feature alltogether and only used it's radio and voice recording features.You can also download pictures into it, albeit using a special software which converts the files to a smaller size which can be viewed on the player's screen.Getting the software to work was very tricky, because you have to know which option to select after you plug the player to your PC.The battery stopped working (after being fully charged it discharged completely after 2 minutes) in 2 and a half years.All in all, I'm not too dissatisfied with this product due to its very low price.I would still be satisfied if the battery wouldn't have died on me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not bad","review":"Works well. Battery life is decent. Sometimes I forget that I leave it on and the batteries die. Rechargable via special USB cable. It's not an iPod, and I wasn't looking for one.

She tried working with customer support online but found her emails and inquiries unanswered for weeks at a time. There was always a new suggestion but never a solution. Finally, after months of this run around, I called the company. I was left with the impression they were far more concerned with completing their data base regarding defects than providing the customer with a product that worked. Now, in November, I have a promise of a new product- with warranty. I had to push to get the new product and then had to push harder for a warranty in case the new product was also defective. My daughter(17 yrs)is an emerging consumer and has already written Sansa off her list, I know I have."},{"rating":"1","title":"MicroSoft DRM is a Joke","review":"This is about to go back to Amazon. I have spent literally hours trying to get this player to work with content downloaded from the New York Public library using OverDrive Media Console. First I needed to upgrade the firmware, whatever Amazon sold me was outdated. Then I had to change some settings (they weren't available in the earlier firmware version). Then... still have problems. I hate Apple's fetishization of COOL but at least iTunes works. Digital music players would NEVER had taken off if the industry needed to rely on Redmond to figure this one out. Total frustration. I think I'm going back to cassettes.Oh, some other stuff. THe player looks much better in the picture than in real life. It's very light and looks to be delicately built. The switches have that cheap feel and the controls are not well located. The screen is OK. I'm too old for this kind of thing and have no trouble reading it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, but hard to use","review":"Bought from Blueproton (via Amazon) got a version 2 of the c250, so sadly it is not yet compatible with the much better Rockbox firmware.

Felt a little flimsy and cheap when taken out of the box. After the installation, this supposedly plug and play device caused my computer to keep disconnecting and then reconnecting with the player. Two updates later I was able to transfer some files. Everything worked fine, however not with audio book playback. Unlike an Ipod, the player doesn't remember where I previously paused the current track after turning it back on. Also, when fast forwarding for longer than a minute of the track, the player switches to fast-fast forward, however re-starts the song when the fast-forward button is released!!! Really annoying. So between a cheap feel, poorly written and documented software and everyday problems with the interface I returned the item after 12 hours of trial."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice inexpensive MP3","review":"This is a great MP3 player for my son.

The price is about as low as it gets, sound is good, the memory is fine and the controls are pretty intuitive. My only concern is that the expandable memory port seems to be only for show. I did quite a bit of research when I couldn't get mine to accept a 2 and 4 gig microSD card and I found it to be a pretty common problem. I found that no patches or even reasons why it would not work can be found on the internet and that it isn't covered under the warranty. 2 gigs is nice and all, but in this day and age, a little more would be nicer especially if the expansion is advertised (and was a primary selling point for me).Long story short: I love this little MP3 player but I wish I could upgrade the memory like I should be able to."},{"rating":"1","title":"No battery life","review":"We bought this player for our daughter (in pink) a year ago.

The first one did this after about six months, the second after four days, the third after a couple of months. I have given up and bought an iPod Nano - while I'm very sorry to lose the FM capability, I'm hoping for more reliability from the iPod.

A friend purchased the same brand, but his has video capabilities for another $50. I don't need video capability so not having that feature isn't a big deal.

Great battery life too.I can't really explain the negative reviews this player has gotten, my experience has been great. I find the display easy to read and I've had no issues with XP compatibility.

This is not a player that is truly mobile in that you will not be able to drive a car, bike or exercise while using this because the menu system is very counter-intuitive and has many unnecessary levels of nesting.No nice features such as speeding up or slowing down playback.I am glad that I didnt actually buy this poorly designed unit but was given as a gift from an apparent enemy.Please note that there are a ton of these for sale used, this should tell you something."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy this","review":"I bought this MP3 player because it allowed for an external microSD card. It's not good for listening to if you're walking. I put it in my pocket and the slightest bump made it freeze. The only way to get it to work again was to take the battery out. It also skips occasionally for no apparent reason. It's supposed to be capable of viewing photographs, but the screen is so small it's not worth it. The description didn't say that it can only be charged by plugging it into a computer. Perhaps there's an adapter, but I didn't see anything for one.This MP3 player is so small that it actually fell out of my pocket and I lost it after having it for only a few days. I didn't have any kind of warranty or anything, so it was $100 to listen to music for a week. I decided never to have such a small MP3 player again and now have an 80g Ipod, which works great and is small enough to be portable but big enough not to lose it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sansa c250 keeps breaking","review":"The price is right, the features are great, but I'm on my third c250 in the space of about 6 weeks.

I previously had an iPod mini and never had a problem in over a year - now my teenage son has the mini and its still going strong."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor firmware","review":"The c200 has some very good features (its replaceable battery is probably the feature I found most attractive). I enjoy listening to recorded books on long journeys, and this activity highlights its major failings:It cannot keep track of its position in a long WMA file. It resets if it is charged, or if you play another audio file.Its fast-forward function hardly qualifies. I have resorted to using a spring clip to hold the FF key depressed for about 20 minutes at a time to resume a story somewhere in the middle(most books are about 10 hours) and the chances of resetting are very high.It really needs a firmware upgrade to address these problems. If all you want to do is listen to music then it is fine as is."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Alternative","review":"One of my pet peeves with the ipod is that it doesn't have built in radio. I always thought if you gonna pay so much money to play your own music you can atleast enjoy FM radio. But as an alternative device, I see that the sandisk player is great with MP3's and radio which should be good enough for a music lover that desires a portable device. (the memory card option is also a nice touch) Though the screen resolution isn't that great and making an organized playlist is yet to be discovered...this device is great.

We were excited to plug it in and use it right away, but had some trouble getting my computer to recognize the device. A colleagues did, so we knew it was not a problem with the mp3 player. Finally, after contacting technical service at Sandisc, we fixed the problem (needed to download new drivers) and it has been just great. Technical service was very helpful and prompt, which I appreciated. All in all, a great buy for the low pricetag."},{"rating":"1","title":"Quality is very bad","review":"I have owned a C250 for the past five years and loved it. I used it for at least eight hours a day during that time. When I lost it, I ordered a new one. The quality of this C250 now is NOT what the old one was. I use it on the road and the light kept coming on every time I hit a bump in the road. It wouldn't always turn on and would shut down and pause with no one touching it.

The native controls are easy to work with and navigate, there is a SD slot for expansion, the player is amall, and the battery lasts a long time. Add Rockbox, and the player gets even better. My player ended up being a dud. After a few months of use, the headphone jack stopped transmitting sound to the left ear. This is not normal, as I have owned a few other sansa players, and they have all been pretty durable, looks like I got a bad one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never got it to work","review":"Received this from Blue Proton. They said it was new, but didn't come with cd or proper paperwork, don't know why? Couldn't get it to hold a charge.

I tried updating firmware and everything else the help boards suggested. Nothing helped. I tried to contact Blue Proton for suggestions, but got no response at all. I eventually sent it back to Amazon, who took care of it with EXCELLENT customer service. I have 2 other types of Sansas that I love. So I suppose this was just a bad one or maybe even a bad model.

So now I await a replacement."},{"rating":"1","title":"The worst!","review":"I picked up the Sansa c250 for $12 and I paid too much for it. It is one of those pieces of technology that, instead of working for you, makes you work for it. Most of my complaints are against the OS, but the physical build was nothing to brag about. The volume reset to halfway everytime I powered it on, so my ears got blasted if I wasn't paying attention. The display is impossible to read in sunlight. The software, however, is what made me finally smash the unit on the floor. It was a constant struggle to get it to do what I wanted. There's no way to play files by directory, so you have to make sure all your tags are correct. I tried installing Rockbox, and that was, if possible, even worse. I will never buy another Sansa.

I had a Micro SD card for my phone which I barely use, so that's an extra 2GB of storage I have for backup if I need. Currently I have just under 2GB full of songs.The sound is great, with deep base and long battery life.

Rhino either lost their enthusiasm for the project on this one or ran out of money to purchase song rights.

How about \\"Reminiscing\\" by Little River Band? \\"Children of the Sun\\" by Billy Thorpe? And, a song that is referred to numerous times in liner notes of previous volumes -- \\"Baker Street\\" by Gerry Rafferty? Rhino rallies a bit in Vol. 25, but this one is a stinker.

I was \\" lucky \\" to find this late volume recently , and cheaply at a longtime record store that is still open for business. I bought it to have as part of the series, even though it's weak, and only contains a few big hits - EMOTION, FEELS SO GOOD, a few others. It's a reflection of how bad late 70's pop got. Pseudo-disco, fluff, schmaltz and schlock make up the bulk of the tunes on here.

Angela Bettis (MAY, the CARRIE remake) is effective as Creel's submissive wife and ZACH RAND and CARRIE ANNE STANLEY do well as the teenaged children. But THE WOMAN is a mess. The plot jumps all over the place and its \\"Who is the real animal\\" theme becomes a moot point by the film's preposterous climax. What transpires in the \\"doghouse\\" makes no sense at all. This is not entertainment, merely a repulsive example of glorified torture and violence.

Incredible personal sacrifice, but won.Most inventors, and those who really change life, fall victims to the \\"Second Mouse Syndrome\\".....that is, it is the SECOND mouse, not the first, who gets the cheese.This man refused to let that happen.

I truly wanted to like this movie about Bob Crane.","review":"Greg Kinnear is a talented actor but even he cannot save this movie from mundane. I first became interested in this movie when I read an obituary about Bob Crane. What an interesting character. He was an inventor that claimed he was wronged by the big 3 automakers and lost his marriage, job and nearly went mad trying to prove it.I thought this movie could put flesh and bones on the page turning article I had read in the New York Times. Sadly it didn't. It disappointed just as John Grisham movies disappoint if you've read the book first. It doesn't seem to be true to the real Bob Crane who was a cantankerous man fixated on a revolutionary invention and how it should be manufactured. Greg Kinnear was just way too likable in this movie.It is slow, long, boring and I just plain didn't care at the end. I do appreciate that they took a stab at trying to tell the story but the ho hum factor just can't grab another star from me."},{"rating":"2","title":"I can identify with this movie!","review":"This movie really hit home because my ancestors invented the wheel, which is today used in just about everything that rolls.

Dr. Kearns pays a high price for the fight on a personal level, with a marital separation and some angry kids left in the wake of it. But he keeps at it anyway so the corporations won't be able to do the same thing to someone else.The likeable Greg Kinnear plays the determined and meticulous Kearns sympathetically, with support from Lauren Graham as his lovely but frustrated wife."},{"rating":"2","title":"Give Engineering credit............","review":"I have just watched this informative movie regarding Prof Kearns battle for recognition of his invention. I found it interesting that the reviewer of the movie called him a physics professor.........wrong. He was an engineering professor. As usual, engineers are confused with scientists and there is a difference. As for the movie, it is a sad but true tale that taking an auto company to court (or any other industrial or governmental giant for that matter) is a long, frustrating and often unsuccessful event. So credit must be given to Dr Kearns for sticking to his principles."},{"rating":"2","title":"FLASH OF INSANITY!","review":"Whenever I'm watching a based on a true story movie, I always wonder just how much of it is true. Flash of Genius is a well told story of the inventor of the intermittent windshield wiper. The film takes us from the first thoughts of this invention or \\"flash of genius\\" through the deal with the Ford for use in their cars and then through the long court battle with Ford after they screwed him over. What happens along the way is both inspiring, but very sad too. Kinnear does a fine job as this inventor and the story purposely focuses on his determination to right the wrong that these unethical scums have bestowed upon him.This is a very good film and it engrossing to watch and when it's all said and done, you may ask yourself was it worth it? Money is a nice thing to have, but family is irreplaceable. You'll have to decide for yourself. This film is well worth seeing and Kinnear shows he is more than just a pretty face."},{"rating":"2","title":"Being genius is costly","review":"\\"Flash of Genius\\" movie was made after article about inventor Bob Kearns published in the New Yorker magazine. Last time I read compelling personal story, it was about the \\"Orchid Thief\\". This time around the story was just as good. Greg Kinnear's performance in the film is amazing.It is when someone sees movies like this one, about the middle-class man with one great idea who gets cheated by the major corporation that we all get thinking that perhaps big corporations deserve to suffer after decades of abusing their power against a regular man. It is a story of a man who would not settle for anything less than acknowledgement of his due credit ofr the intermittent windshield wiper idea he came up with. His hard won battle came at the steep price.This is a story about a man who had principle, drive and compulsive desire for recognition of the best invention of his life. Film drags at times, but actors provide story that is both inspirational and cautionary."},{"rating":"2","title":"Real Life Drama","review":"A true story of one man's fight against the automobile establishment.

This specific one is being used in my home theater system to connect a component to a switch box. It did not need to be pulled through any walls or stressed in any other way, but it's been fine for my use of it. Some people think they are not the best of quality but I have not ever had any go \\"bad\\" or break or not fit correctly.

It's different, but feels like a natural progression from 'Dagger and Involver. On the second disc, the sound does cut out on the first track, but this is intentional, short, and simply part of the music. Remember this is a live mix. Considering this, Sasha mixes seemlessly and the rare crowd noise is a nice reminder of Sasha's formidable talent.Avalon is more in your face than his earlier sound, it's music you can dance to and trip to. Disc 1 has a more tech house feel, trance fans should head straight to disc 2 for a fresh take on progessive house.Despite being 2 discs, the mix is a bit shorter than I would have liked. It's a fast, hard hitting listen that you will enjoy though. And like with Sasha's previous work, you stand a good chance of growing to love it."},{"rating":"1","title":"I WAS THERE, AND I WAS DISSAPOINTED.....","review":"Maybe my expectations were too high, or maybe the Avalon was simply ready for a really thick, funky night.

I guess I thought he would have been able to sense that vibe and adapt accordingly. I have heard him do mindblowing sets that were pretty high energy and intense, but that did not take place on that nite. The DJ that was on before him was twice as good and probably got about 5% of Sasha's fee. Too bad.

This one has beautiful singing but that's where it stops. It is modernized and the villain wears a suit and sun glasses. In no way is he sinister or frigtening. The sets are beyond belief. The Barcarolle has to be seen to be believed. No water, just rows of undulating theater seats surrounding the singers. The worst sin if the casting as most members just don't look the part. Though Suzanne Mentzen sings beautifully she looks awful in the pants role of Nicklausse. And, at the conclusion,in a very brief stint as the Muse, she destroys it as she looks nothing like a Muse should. Many other cast members look like they walked in from Lulu or another opera. This is a Hoffman that would be better heard than seen."},{"rating":"2","title":"nothing wrong with it","review":"I am baffled that so many people don't like this production.

These freedoms include, but are not limited to: freedom from hunger and disease, political freedom, and economic solvency. The measure of a nation's development stems from the extent to which its citizens enjoy these freedoms. One of Professor Sen's areas of expertise is the study of famines throughout the world. He demonstrates that famines do not occur because of a lack of food, but because of a lack of economic resources to purchase that food. In addition, he makes a strong case that famines do not occur in democratic countries, no matter how poor they might be. This is a must-read book for anyone interested in pondering a fresh perspective on the meaning of development. The only criticism I have of this book is that the prose is at times convoluted and does not make for particularly smooth reading."},{"rating":"1","title":"Trite yet obvious","review":"I was disappointed with this book.

For example, I was appalled by the amount of space the author devoted to a beginner's introduction to C++ concepts and syntax. (That chapter is longer than the one on the use finate state machines in UI implementation...)Finally, the author's approach to the whole process of UI software design is very ad hoc; it's not a methodology at all, and what he does is certainly not \\"engineering\\".A much better choice is Ian Horrocks' \\"Constructing the User Interface with Statecharts\\".

Then to cap it off, the compiler he wrote the examples for is very old.

While it is true that the DS already comes with a charger, one may be wondering why one is on the market to sell. To be truthful, you really won't need to buy one unless you happen to lose yours. Or you may happen to damage yours in some way and therefore you need another charger. This works well, too. It'll take a couple of hours to charge your DS, but on the plus side, you can play your DS while it charges.However, there is one note I must caution users of a DS charger on. Much like most machines that have to be charged, if your DS doesn't need to be charged but you've got your charger plugged in and the power is on, it'll start to decrease the battery life itself. The battery already last a fairly long time to begin with, but if the battery doesn't need to be charged, and you happen to have the power on, don't charge it. Charging a fully charged battery with the power on will only drain the battery life."},{"rating":"1","title":"Does Not Work","review":"The original charger for my Nintendo DS broke so I needed a replacement, and I purchased this product. This product claimed to be a brand new Nintendo product but it is not, coming in nothing more than a small white box devoid of any writing, the writing on the product itself does not match the original Nintendo product, and worst of a, it does not fit into my DS (which is the original model, not the DS Lite). It is not a DS Lite charger either though, being far too large to fit into a DS Lite. This product is garbage that cannot fulfill the needs it was designed to do, and not even worth the low price you would paid. It is garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly written & organized","review":"I am a pacifist on practical, rather than religious, grounds, but I wanted to read this booklet (not really a book-- only forty-five pages) to ground myself in the Christian concepts.

Yes, the book provides excellant information, but the most valuable part of titles like this is the included example software.

Within the allotted timeframe, the duck's hard quacking mechanism was broken and duck's tail was next on his list. Like another reviewer, it was fun to watch the sheer 20 seconds of joy but the toy does not stand up to my dog. As a caution, the toy is much smaller than I expected and could be swallowed and cause a choking hazard for any but the smallest of dogs.I've purchased other toys by this manufacturer and they have been winners.

The sound of the duck scared him though, but the great part is if they don't like it you can just remove it and they still love just the plush toy.

I am new to exercising (mid 50's) and I had no trouble doing her routine. I did get some 2 pound squishy balls and find them more fun to use than dumbbells as it seems to use different muscles because your grip is different. If I just make myself turn on the DVD in the morning before breakfast I WILL do at least 20 minutes with this DVD. The A.M. warm-up portion is an energizer and makes my day go so much better. My husband also enjoys doing this DVD but uses heavier dumbbells. If HE can follow her then anyone can! Karen is very encouraging and gives cues well (after the first viewing you will know to what she refers). I love that she is shown in the studio and also brief shots of a woman doing these exercises in her own home. The time flies! A great workout! FIVE STARS!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Big fan of Karen Voight!","review":"I have used The Body video with Elle MacPherson and Karen Voight on and off for years and wanted another workout with the same effectivenss and easy-to-follow instructions.

In the past I've really enjoyed Callanetic's videos (Callan Pickney), but I found this video refreshing and upbeat. I do also recommend Callanetics, but found that she's not very motivating, and it's nice to have Karen be someone to keep you going through the tough moves - but not in an overly cheery or annoying way! I sweat tremendously in this video and feel like it gives me an excellent overall workout. I like to do the am portion in the morning, along with the first 10 minutes of the pm video (abs) for a very complete workout in 35 minutes... I like yoga (the second part of the pm video) but usually do it at a later point, or with friends. It's a wonderful video and highly recommended for anyone who wants a good challenge and wants to feel like you're getting a thorough workout!"},{"rating":"2","title":"this workout really packs a punch!","review":"I really like this workout and love Karen Voight. As others have said, she is wonderful--good with her cues and very pleasant to workout with. I own \\"Sleek Physique\\" and was looking for a little variety so I thought I would try this DVD out. It's a tough workout for me and I REALLY feel it the next day. I love that between the A.M. and P.M routines it's a full body workout and that you can combine the A.M. and P.M. into one longer workout or do them separately.

It's great strength training but I don't feel like I'm getting my heart rate up too much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Fast, Effective Workout!","review":"I got this for Christmas in the Body Sculpting Kit. I am a former aerobics instructor and personal trainer who no longer lifts weights- only yoga and pilates. That said, I did not want the green genies in the kit, but after doing this workout I really like it! It is fast and it burns. The first workout has an energizing warm-up and then goes into a fast series of exercises with the green genies- I was sweating and I felt the burn. The second workout really gets your abs and is a great workout for the lower back- great core conditioning. Then it ends with some wonderful yoga stretches. This is a great total body conditioning video (there is no cardio!) and I love the fact that it is broken into two 30 minute workouts."},{"rating":"2","title":"The strap?","review":"Decent bag, holds a lot of my stuff not too big not too small. The material is kinda thin, though it doesn't look that way in the picture.The main problem is the strap. The thing isn't long enough. I extended it so that the bag would hang below my 5'9'' frame but it isn't long enough. Don't get me wrong, I like this bag and I use it often in my urban lifestyle but that darn strap...!When I sit down with the bag around me (in NYC thats the only safe way to wear a bag.), the thing hangs so close to my torso i have to wedge my hand around it to reach inside for my ipod and i dont even have a pot belly. It probably works better if your female though. I'm a rugged man and I give this bag 4 stars for effort but if I find something better with a longer strap and more durable material i'm giving this one to my 15 yr old daughter."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute bag <3","review":"I really like this bag, it's thin but that is to be expected, the flap when closed didn't fit quite so snugly and perfectly as seen in the picture, it was a little baggy and looked slightly awkward but I still think the bag is super cute and perfect for me. I don't carry that many books and the strap didn't really put too much pressure on my neck or shoulders but if you're looking to carry a lot of books, this might not be what you're looking for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"This bag came in way before I expected it to, and it's actually a really decent material for the price. The strap could be a little longer, but that's not too much of a factor in my personal preference. It's great for a chromebook or something of similar size, notebooks, kindles, as well as basic everyday items. I also really like the little twist clasps on the bag. Really keeps the flap in place. If this had maybe one more pocket, it'd pretty much be perfect for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Clasp failed","review":"The bag was used three times within two weeks. On the fourth use one of the twist clasps broke off. I haven't bothered to send it back as the shipping cost would be half the cost of the bag itself. I'm not sure what I'm going to try now. I'm a bit gun shy."},{"rating":"2","title":"canvas bag","review":"Nice bag- a little more vivid yellow than shown in the photo, but plenty of room for notebooks for school, rp games, to use as a purse, or, like I did, fill with dvds as a Christmas present. The closures are a little fragile -- you'll want to inspect them closely to make sure they didn't snap off during shipping -- but the adjustable strap isn't too wide to be uncomfortable, and it seems durable enough to take normal abuse for at least a few years. good bag. good buy. lotsa colors!"},{"rating":"2","title":"love it","review":"really like how much this bag can hold without being huge, the only thing is if your a little on the tall side then the strap wont be long enough to throw over your shoulder and have it loosly hang it will fit but its a snug one, overall great bag!"},{"rating":"2","title":"It's all BUTTER baby!","review":"Shades of Color & Buttervision team up to bring you a sexy and exciting journey into the urban glamour scene with hot soundtracks to complete the experience.

This book is one of those that enjoys tearing down the character of someone so dead they can't defend themselves. It takes a detailed study of Martin Luther's psychological makeup which is embarrassing, weird, and untracable. I would recommend burning your copy if you have one.

I hope the cocktail party accolades you received were worth the effort."},{"rating":"1","title":"A very sour account of an exemplary life...","review":"Richard Marius has written a biography chock-full of untempered, atheistic fervor. Martin Luther was an extraordinary man and his legacy, and theology live on in the hearts of millions of followers. Why would a biographer choose a subject he seems to care so little for? The seething sarcasm and anti-religious sentiment in this book make it difficult to read. This book is more a presentation of the author's atheism than the life of Martin Luther. I detect hypocrisy not from this departed Christian man (Luther) but his biographer! If you are an atheist, then by all means, stick with subjects who share something of your lifestyle and beliefs (or lack thereof)."},{"rating":"1","title":"an atheist review","review":"The inside jacket of this book states that David Marius' thesis is that Martin Luther was human and afraid of death.WOW. How long did it take him to come up with that one? And this guy teaches at Harvard, that's pretty sad.This book manages to tell the story of Martin Luther's life without being sympathetic to either Luther and the people who believed in him or Luther's enemies. Furthermore, as a practicing Catholic, I don't know if I find it more insulting or pathetic that the author consistently uses the bigoted term \\"papists\\" to refer to Catholics.I wonder if he plans on writing a book on the civil rights movement using the \\"n-word... David Marius is obviously an anti-religious bigot and an atheist who has absolutely no business writing on any topic that has to deal with religion..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok as a beginner's book but connoisseurs want better","review":"I think that Marius is simply wrong on a number of points and his disdainful attitude toward Protestant Christianity in the present makes it difficult for him to really understand what was going on in the Reformation. If you want a more even-handed and multifaceted picture of Luther, look at Heiko Oberman's book, where Marius obviously got some impetus for his title, or even Roland Bainton's older but still useful book, Here I Stand.

I understand that this is not intended to be a classy light fixture, and it's simple to the extreme, but the \\"stainless\\" casing is just cheap, flimsy, metal, it is just not a solid product. Plus the packaging had exactly no cushioning so when I opened the package there were about 5 or 6 noticeable dents in the metal casing. I don't have the time to return and get a new one, so I took a pair of pliers tried to fix the dents...I didn't get it perfect, and frankly, the fact that I had to do this at all on a new product is really annoying. And then it doesn't even come with the little plastic electrical wiring connectors... Again, really annoying. Considering that you can buy a solid light fixture at Lowes or Home Depot for less than $20, the fact that this product approaches $30 is a little nuts. Two stars was generous, but to be fair the lights do work, and it was fairly easy to install."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great New Baby Gift","review":"I received this book from a dear friend about 8 years upon the birth of my daughter.

If you liked Cactus in the early 70's, this one is a good gamble. The playing is as energetic as you remember and the sound of this CD is really good, even on your crappy old stereo with the twenty pound speakers. So give this one a try if you want to relive some raw, kick-ass rock and roll. I bet you will like it. If not, keep on trying. The music then really was better than the music of today."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome Find","review":"Searching for obscure rock in the era I was born into, I stumbled across this gem of a band. CACTUS were an original, tight, hard rockin' juggernaut of a group who were on par with the rest of the 70's rock pantheon (ie Zeppelin and Skynard). In fact, their sound is akin to both those groups. Why they faded into obscurity is beyond me because every tune is a flawless heavy rock song. It's a shame really but to me this greatest hits collection is a time capsule, an archeological relic from the 70'S. \\"Rock-n-Roll Children\\" is an anthem if there ever was one, and should be a standard on classic rock radio and \\"Rumblin' Man\\" is a dense, killer track, evoking MC5's level of chaos and power. I like to think that when I was born these guys were rockin' out somewhere out there. It'd be a shame if they went unheard. Awesome road trip music, by the way."},{"rating":"1","title":"A COMPLETE NIGHTMARE!","review":"Man, this band was HORRIBLE! I must have unfortunately seen them about 20 times because they kept opening for bands in Buffalo where I grew up. Talk about obnoxious. I remember the one time at Gilligans when Rusty Day, the lead singer, said \\"Yeah, right now we're going to do a little country\\" and I was thinking, oh man, they are going to quiet things down...thank you! And then Jim McCarty, the guitar player, hits this GINORMOUS power chord that nearly broke my eardrums, and Rusty Day yanked the microphone off his stand and placed it down by his zipper and started to walk around on stage like he had a giant H.O. sticking out of his pants.

There was a little ditty about Cactus. I listened to the snippets. I bought it. Mano-o-man!! I was blown away. Most of the songs are really good. Parchment farm live is as good as it gets.

Towards the end of recovery, we took a trip, flying from the North West to Florida, then on a cruise. The cane worked great being able to fold up and stow away in a day-pack during flight or when traveling in a car. One down side was that it made a clicking noise when using it. The stacked tubing, held together by bungy cord, compressed down on the next tube level. So when walking down a fairly quite hall or room, you could hear the cane. All in all, it fit my need perfect. The cane will be easier to store away, then my daughter's crutches, for any future mishap."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not Your Grandmother's Cane","review":"Whether it's temporary or permanent, having to use a cane isn't the most fun, proud dependency. With this cane, however, it doesn't seem quite as bad. This cane is durable, adjustable, whimsical and pretty. There are so many colors in it that I find it easy to match outfits, which is a nice perk to having to use it. As if the good-mood inspiring flowers aren't enough, this cane actually folds down to fit into your purse, travel bag or other carrying case, which is incredibly convenient. I couldn't be happier with this purchase, unless, of course, there wasn't a need for it in the first place, but since there is, I'm happy to have this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"folding cane","review":"I get a lot of compliments on this cane.

The handle has a nice wood feel and fits comfortably in my hand. It is easy to fold/unfold. I feel very secure and solid when I use it. Bought an oversize purse to put it in when I go out to dinner and a hairband(to hold it together).I hope to one day not need a cane, but let's face...really...canes are classy and this one is very sharp.I have had it for only 2 weeks and my only complaint is that it needs a strap. In the kitchen, I can stand without it's support but anywhere I set it, it falls to the ground. That's frustrating and difficult. Amazon sells straps, (2 for $10). This seems high to me and is something, I think that should have come with it. And is the reason I give this 4 stars instead of 5.Also the height adjustment might be a problem for anyone under 5ft 5inches."},{"rating":"2","title":"Duro-med cane floral Out of stock.

It provides some information genealogically and describes the historical perspective of the region. I bought both the Carolinas and the Tennessee book and found that there was repetition. Therefore, I recommend buying one book on the Scotch-Irish written by Mr. Kennedy. I preferred the Carolinas book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Handle with care","review":"This book is attractive, but it has many flaws in content and in many ways is just plain sloppy -- poorly written and poorly edited. The author has no notes, so it is very difficult to tell his sources unless they are from very well known individuals (generals, religious leaders, etc.), and when one compares the original words of these people with what Kennedy quotes them as saying, one finds that Kennedy often misquotes them. Much other information is inaccurate as well, so this book cannot be trusted by genealogists or anyone else. The book is full of statements like \\"Davy Crockett was elected to represent Tennessee in the White House\\" (no, he was elected to Congress) that show that the author either wrote too quickly or did not have anyone review his work or worse. Too bad, because the subject matter has great appeal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaves me thirsting for more","review":"I bought this book because my ancestors were mostly Scots Irish and I wanted to lean more about them.I loved the background information in Billy's book that tells about the character and beliefs of the Scots Irish and the Presbyterians.I thought that more data about the common every day Scots Irish Immigrants to America shoud have been the main focas of the book.It's interesing to know that many of the immigants became famous, but I'm not as intested in them as I am the ordinary people. After all, we can read about them in almost any American history book.I stopped reading the book after the background information.

Ms. Gould's book really takes the Catholic perspective of this Jewish Tradition and blends it beautifully, using the Gospels as a basis. I am really looking forward to celebrating it with the Passion and Resurection in mind. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Try","review":"I bought this book, hoping to find in it a seder that incorporated the rich traditions of both Judaism and Catholicism. I unfortunately did not find what I had hoped. The seder and explanations contained herein seemed to in many cases diminish the significance of the Jewish celebration of Passover and not sufficiently detail the continuity of the last seder of Jesus with the celebration of the Mass and Catholicism and its development. I would not recommend this book to anyone who did not have a thorough familiarity with and appreciation for the Jewish traditions. My husband, who is Jewish, and I (Catholic) ended up writing our own seder for my parish seder. The thirst from the group we celebrated with was for authentic Judaism in the context of Catholicism. Despite my high hopes, I did not find this in this book and could not in good conscience recommend its use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lonetree Ranchers: Colt","review":"I was very happy with the third book of this series.

In that sense, it had a tragic feel similar to The Olympian, another running book I liked. As you would expect from a runner of Middleman's caliber, the training and racing descriptions are dead on. He also lightens the dark subject matter with some funny sections involving college pranks, drinking, etc."},{"rating":"2","title":"An unvarnished view of the world of the student-athlete","review":"\\"Pain\\" lets the reader into the hardcore world of the student-athlete at a major university. From wild parties and nude relays to a tense relationship with an older woman, the story is set against the backdrop of competitive track and field, and the anxiety of Richard Dubin, a 5th-year senior and potential Olympian. The story moves quickly, encompassing funny scenes worthy of an \\"Animal House\\" sequel and disturbing, painful (hence the title) scenes of depression and anxiety. The characters are well-drawn, and the dialogue, authentic. The story winds inexorably toward a tragic ending, but the reader will be surprised at the twist it finally takes.

This is the original EMI References recording, however, which is in much poorer sound. (See my review under the reissue.)I just wanted to add a note about the 1952 Double Concerto. Furtwangler conducts the Vienna Phil. in a radio broadcast that has been captured in dismal, edgy sound, not even as good as the Lucerne Festival sonics for the Violin Concerto. The soloists are Willi Boskovsky and Emanuel Barbec, first desks in the orchestra. This is a work that benefits from a spirited, not-too-rugged approach. Unfortunately, Furtwangler is ponderously slow, and the soloists dig into every note like a dentist going after old fillings.

I feel very strongly that this CD is one of the best of 2006. They have toned down their sound going from post hardcoreish to complete indie experimental bliss. Gabe's vocals soar on this album. I really think he has one of the best voices in this genre. I can't stress enough how much people should get this. If you are into bands like the appleseed cast, you need to own this. I am very saddened that Albert React didn't get signed by a better label, no offense to CI but the world needs to be able to enjoy this music. I would say tracks 2-5 are the best. The only complaint would be that the vocals might have been recorded too low? I don't know much about that type of stuff though. So buy this CD.EDIT:18 months later, I wish I gave this CD 5 stars.

You go from character to character knowing them and understanding their part on the story so everything turns out to be enjoyable fantastic.This is not the case with Universe X part 1. I found this first half very difficult to read because of the inclusion of several non-popular characters and realms and past stories that make it dificul to understand. There is also some cosmic talk and Multiverses (mind you DC) and Microverses and different realities that takes the love and meaning away from the original saga.I just end up this one to continue with Universe X part 2.

Maybe it works for fewer pages/subjects, but it must have over 100 pages of paper and within the first week of school the front and back covers have fallen off and about 20 pages are about 1/2 way on. None of them have torn, the binding system is just not holding them together.My second issue with this notebook is each subject does not have a file sleeve in the yellow separator. Not sure if that makes sense, but the first yellow separator has a little file sleeve that holds extra files, like my syllabus, but it's the only one. The other 4 subject separators don't have that file sleeve.On the positive side, none of the pages that have become exposed have torn.

It came with City Navigator 7 installed. Version 8 is available for free after you register. Takes about a month to get it.And the price? Less than $500.00 bucks! My friend paid around $1200.00 just last year."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buy another Vehicle Navigation System","review":"On the positive side the unit works fairly well for navigation in most situations and on occasion has proved to be a big help in routing around traffic jams.On the negative side, the FM transmitter is terrible. There is an audio output if your car has a direct audio input line in. I do not use the XM feature anymore due to the sound quality and less than adequate reception when in the vicinity of trees. The unit has become intermittent on speech and the speak button has never worked properly. Sometimes the routing selects a much longer route when a shorter route is available. I wish there were more options for setup to let you customize the function of the unit better.Danger: Before you buy a Garmin product, send an email to the tech support line. You get an automated note back saying it will take 5-7 DAYS to get a response. That is beyond unacceptable customer service!

I was programming the unit at the beginning of a trip. It was getting full reception. When I turned the car on, the reception went away.

Don't worry, the game is still very scary even with the guide but there is no way to play the games of this series without a guide.

Even though the price is a little high on import singles this is well worth the purchase price. The Crows do an amazing job on the Teenage Fan Club song \\"Start Again\\" and an even better job on Sparklehorse's \\"Someday I will treat you good\\". To top it off, the Enhanced portion of the CD is the American Girls video and it is REALLY high quality. It is nice to see that bands are getting things right on the Enhanced parts of the disk.Overall, if you are a counting crows fan, you need to have this single. If you are just getting into counting crows, I would make sure you own the studio releases first (August and Everything After, Recovering the Satellites, This Desert Life, Hard Candy). They are the most band for you buck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not worth it","review":"I am a pretty dedicated Crows fan and I have all their CD's, but this one is one I wish I hadn't purchased.

I was skeptical at first, but soon realized that what Mrs. Eddy was teaching was already latent in me. As many of the testimonials attributed, it was a particular incident in my life, which led a friend to recommend the book. Amazingly, I found answers to my problem very early on in my reading, and continued for the sake of learning more. I now understand fully the concept of Christian Science, and continue to practice it with the hope of helping others."},{"rating":"1","title":"Is this truth?","review":"Are the teachings in this book true?

No one can come to the Father except through me.\\" Jesus is the Truth, the Bible is the truth, but this book is NOT the truth."},{"rating":"1","title":"Neither Christian nor Science","review":"This last edition of S&H is just as illogical and confused as Eddy's original edition published in 1875. The idea's haven't changed but after Rev. Wiggins rewrote S&H for Eddy, sales increased and a certain amount of respect was acheived. The main concept of \\"Christian Science\\" was obtained from Quimby while she was a student of his studying the Science of Man. The church has suppressed many of the books in the past that tell the truth of the history and growth of Christian Science. The textbook denies every main orthodox christian doctrine yet uses christian terms that can leave a reader confused. S&H redefines christian terms to fit their philosophy. For a good read, read The Bible without S&H and see what God really has to say to mankind."},{"rating":"1","title":"It's not what it seems","review":"I spent many years studying Science and Health when I was a Christian Scientist. The book claims to offer a God-inspired, spiritually scientific method for healing and for overcoming all of life's \\"seeming\\" problems. In fact, it leads people into thinking patterns that cause them to mistrust their senses and to live in a state of denial. Many people suffer emotionally, spiritually, and physically by practicing what they learn in Science and Health. This is a dangerous book."},{"rating":"1","title":"A new face for old evil","review":"Before reading this book (I'm not saying you shouldn't read it), take the time to learn a little about the author and her religion, \\"Christian Science\\". You should be aware that this religion advocates the murder of the sick (by withholding medical treatment).

It provides an enlightening paradigm shift by placing man in what Christian Scientists believe to be his proper context - as the perfect spiritual creation of the the most Perfect and Spiritual Being (God). For those seeking to follow the teachings of Christ, for honest seekers of Truth, this inspired text is a candle that humbly, logically, and cearly illumens the way. Regardless of the edition you obtain, the Truth of man and his harmonious relation to his heavenly Father/Mother is beautifully and rationally explained in this brilliant work by the discoverer and founder of Christian Science."},{"rating":"1","title":"don't follow this blindly","review":"A word of caution to those of you considering adopting this book and the beliefs it advocates-- be sure you keep your own faith in perspective. I have no problem with people choosing Christian Science as a religion and I certainly don't condemn anyone for their beliefs.

With the butcher job done on \\"Amie\\", this disc is a one-hit wonder as well, but what a one. The hair-raising, eerie sounds of Mike Oldfield's \\"Tubular Bells\\" (theme from The Exorcist) have never been duplicated, and that one cut makes this disc worth having.

Gone are the small illustrations by Mignola, which I wouldn't think would be a big deal..wrong. My first major complaint is the humor, it's horrible, Hodge tries too hard to slip some of the wit into the story that has been seen in the past two novels. No epic battles Hellboy manages to get in a fight with a Leviathan and do absolutely no damage, not like him at all. The story itself about the Vatican and avenging angels shows a lot of promise but sadly Brian Hodge can't pull it off. The beginning you start to see a glimpse of good stort but the rest of the book seems rushed. Passing Hellboy fans DO NOT make this the first HB novel you read. Bones of Giants is amazing, and The Lost Army isn't bad by any stretch. C-"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hellboy & Hodge: A Perfect Match","review":"Brian Hodge is a top-notch imaginative writer of horror, crime fiction, and lotsa other things you need to seek out. Mignola's HELLBOY is a pulp-flavored blend of Lovecraft and James Bond that redefines the genre.Sometimes good writers farm themselves out to shared worlds with mixed results. That ain't the case here. Seeing a great writer (and avowed Hellboy fan) like Hodge immerse himself in this dark and twisted world results in a terrific story that reads like THE DA VINCI CODE on LSD, written by David Cronenberg and directed by David Lynch.Would I rather be reading an original novel by Brian Hodge?

This was just what I wanted - an interesting book that made me want to keep reading. I purchased it on the Kindle and have to say this is one of the first downloads that kept my attention long enough to actually finish it in 2 days. My favorite characters were there - Hellboy, Abe and Liz - with enough suspense and action to make me entertained over the Memorial Day weekend. Others have commented on the storyline so I'll leave it to them. Let me just say, this purchase was money well spent for me.The hard part is now deciding which next to purchase since many other Hellboy novels have very mixed reviews.I just love the humor of Hellboy and this novel gave me a few chuckles. I'd recommend!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Beware yellowing paper","review":"Like too many conglomerates, Mead is cutting corners and it shows. These Five Star spiral notebooks seem rugged enough with their polyethylene covers, but my experience is that within a year or so the paper begins to seriously yellow from the outer edges--far faster than older Mead notebooks I have. This suggests the nifty cover are matched with cheap, acidy paper.

Especially with \\"send her ass right to the morgue\\" in the chorus. but the most obvious part that shows the saterical nature of the song is ion the third stanze when Rick mocks gossipy old women saying, \\"I heard he was displeased with her weight gain\\"If you have ever heard anything like morcheeba and liked it, buy this album without a thought.

This makes me believe that Morcheeba are nothing more than money grabbing capitalists - not the genuine creative force we so often hear them to be from their overblown press releases. Filling up the CD with 'big name' guests is merely a crafty act to distract from the fact that, boiled down, we've heard all this stuff before - back when it seemed fresh and exciting. That is no longer the case, Morcheeba know it, and before you go dishing out hard cash for this CD, you need to know it too.

I will not approve of anything that says that unless you torture yourself into a body that more resembles a half starved boy than a fully figured woman, then your husband should leave you. ESPECIALLY considering that this is the mother of his children - in the song - it SAYS she had two children and he is complaining because she doesn't look like a 14 yr old anymore.

While his cheesy sermons may work at the church mixer, true roots fans would be better served to avoid this. Not only is it bad, but the arrogance and cultural imperialism of this wolf in sheeps clothing will anger and upset those with a love of Reggae music and Jah Rastafari - King of Kings, Lord of Lords, COnquering Lion of the Tribe of Judah.

Jackson Brown...ugh...I myself have played the role of the Scarecrow...and he just degraded a role which I love so much. Roger Daltry...stick to THE WHO. Nathan Lane, actually not bad.

It definitely has some bad songs, but mostly good ones. Homey, Lover, Friend is wack and songs like Transferred and Medusa weren't good enough for me to listen to more than a couple times. I love the intro and bridge into Eat or Die; classic Rassy. Track 3 is great too, along with Better and the Alchemist produced track, also Fed Up is very good and starts with a hilarious Dave Chapelle joke that I believe is from his movie or stand up. All in all, the beats are good or solid enough for Ras Kass to make them good songs just by his lyrics. His lyrics are good as always, but not his best, so as a result this is not my favorite album of his. Still, this album is better than most new rap albums out there."},{"rating":"2","title":"Disco Diva benefits from remastering","review":"I agree with the previous reviewer that the original album was great and that this is almost the exact same CD with the exclusion of the \\"Friends\\" track. I guess it's a matter of taste, but in it's place is the song \\"Paradise Found\\" which was not included on the original album. I personally prefer this track over Friends but that's a moot point. I think the big difference here is the remastering job. I you prefer the lesser quality of the old album as compared to this newly remastered edition just because it has Friends on it, I have some advice for you. Pick up the new edition, the sound quality is much better and buy the single of \\"Friends\\" on Ebay. This CD has better sound, better artwork and is an overall improvement over the original greatest hits on Hot. Amii Stewart deserves an upgrade and this CD release does just that."},{"rating":"2","title":"*!!!!Come On, Baby Light My Fire!!!!*","review":"This is the absolute best collection ever by Amii Stewart!!! Every song on this CD is definitely worth a million dollars!!! Her best songs were Knock On Wood, You Really Touched My Heart, Light My Fire, and, my personal favorite, Jealousy. Though Amii Stewart was not as famous in the United States, she was the Donna Summer of Europe, and last year she was the Italian UNICEF Ambassadeur.This CD is worth every penny of your purchase!

You just spoon some gravy granules in a measuring cup, add boiling water and stir. That's it.

Their incessant commentary the \\"Hot babes\\" of the game certainly brings the author's maturity level into question. Secondly, as has been stated before, this guide is a lazy man's compiliation of data and information, so don't expect to find the information that you are looking for in a crunch (Especially when you are trying to change Edwina back into a male. A certain girdle is necessary for this and the author tells the gamer that \\"You don't really want this item, do you? We'll let you find this on your own). I certainly hope that Versus Books learns from this mistake.

Every time I'd get a new quest, I'd flip though the book only to find that there was not even a mention of the quest I had just obtained. It has pretty much all of the quests covered that are really important, but some of the little side adventures were conveniently left out. However, I did like the NPC info, as well as the monster, item, and spell lists. Overall, this is a really helpful guide, but perhaps they should have worked on it a bit more before deeming it \\"perfect\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Guess This'll Have To Do . . .","review":"I am just not fond of this guide. There's a breakdown of the classes, list of joinable NPCs, item list, spell list, cheats section and a walkthrough. But the Versus Books' opinions are littered throughout here, ex. they rate Edwin as a less-desirable NPC based on his personality rather than the fact he's quite useful w/ his 18 Int - I thought this was a STRATEGY guide, not People magazine. There are a few inaccuracies in the item list. It does actually have some tips for all the romances, one of the more obscure features of BG2. Since this is really the only widely-published BG2 guide, there's not much of a choice whether or not you should buy it if you get stuck."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Guide to an Excellent Game","review":"You can learn as little or as much as you want about this amazing game. you can get hints or all out spoilers through out the game, which is nice, because reading something that ruins the plot ruins the entire game.the books goes into extensive knowledge about most NPC's, items, and the different quest throughout the game. i give it 4 stars, because to me 5 stars is unattainable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not quite better than nothing, but pretty pictures","review":"Not very helpful in actually getting you through the game, since there are numerous errors and quite obvious typos (one that is repeated several times refers you to \\"page ????\\" - think they rushed into production and didn't quite finish editing). On the other hand, the full color illustrations are nice and there are a number of detailed maps, which unfortunately are not keyed to the numbered events in the text. The item list in the back is nice to have but also incomplete and with some errors.Since you're probably going to have to buy it used at this point and pay way more than the original price (I did, anyway), think about whether you want this just for the not-totally-complete maps and item lists. The text is juvenile and the plot line is incomplete, so don't buy it for that.

For one thing, as I said in another reivew of ToB's 'Perfect' guide, he is saying play the game his way, or else. Well, there are many ways to play SoA. When I wrote this guy about stats for characters he wrote back saying that my paladin with CHR at 18 \\"was just plain stupid\\" to put it in his words. I think not. CHR was not even the stat I was asking about. In my opinion 18 for a paladin, if anything else gives you fringe bennifits not found at 17, like higher rewards for quests ect. Anyway(s) he was rude and I'm blaming it on Versus. I think players can make desisions for themselves thank you.

The guide is not worty of naming itself perfect. In the FAQ sections, they say it is rediculous to try and get every quest in. This to ammounts to laziness. Due to time and space constraints is thier excuse, well people will pay for a good guide not one that is kicked out incomplete and inaccurate.

But I COULD stretch and feel it with this tape. Every stretch is about 20-30 seconds long and this makes you feel really refreshed after done as well as you can learn which part of your body is better or worse. The other thing I love about this tape is that it is very easy to do. Karen doesn't frustrate me with unattainable range of motion or positions.

I'm not used to ANY litter dust, & have no desire to start now. I can imagine how the dust will coat anything nearby. The next issue WAS THE SMELL.

It covers what most other aikido books do as fas as techniques but I especially liked the Basics and Warmups section at the beginning, as well as the philosophy. They actually expressed that aikido is not a rigid curriculum(which is how many schools are run) but that it is up to the practitioner to explore the art.As for the techniques, you could see the same thing in a book by Kisshomaru Ueshiba back in 1985(Aikido). So this book to me is just another publishing of the same techniques. I was hoping for better pictures, but I would rate them the same as the 1985 book. Kind of pixely B&W's. There are some good inserts to show detail, which was not in his previous book.I guess I'll wait for the 2nd book to come out in December 2003. Looks like it will cover more details.

This book is okay, but nothing great. (Sorry, Ms Norris, you seem like a nice person but I felt the book came up short.) I kept waiting to get to the meat of the subject; her strategies for organization. I found many generalizations like, \\"Establish Systems\\" and \\"Consolidate Activities.\\" There were many nice stories about people she helped, and those who would rather die than change their habits.She promotes her web sites and her services. That's fine, but the products she sells are very similar to what you can buy at any office supply store, although her's look very well made and are therefore expensive.Check out, \\"HOW TO GET ORGANIZED WITHOUT RESORTING TO ARSON\\" by Liz Franklin.

The book is also a fun read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great reminder!","review":"People find such humor in my well-organized life. Simply, I work well in an orderly environment.I found Ms. Norris' book very insightful.

Sure, the tasks are important and needed, but the objective is not to exclaim, \\"I HAVE CLEANED MY ROOM!\\"As the book describes, organization enables me to identify and then focus on my priorities - the things the REALLY matter to ME.

Even the music was boring!If it weren't for one of the fine male members of her class, I'd have given up much earlier!!I'd recommend Kathy Smith's Lift Weights to Lose Weight Vol One - Vol Two is good too (but for a bit of back pain in the glute section) and they BOTH have great music!

Then flip it over to the smaller rake, and that gets all the loose stuff from the undercoat. It is unbelievable how much hair you'll get off your pet! Our cat has hardly any hairballs any more (thank goodness) and the golden retriever doesn't walk around the house shedding mounds of fur either.

I will say though, I laughed myself silly watching it... really. Wally Cox in a serious role, a snicker- James McArthur as Clay-Boy, solid laughs-Henry Fonda in an idealic setting with no demons to frustrate him, rolling on the floor hysterical! Yeah, I'm jaded, but I actually enjoyed this movie for the unintended humor.

Now that I have said that, please enjoy it as an old-fashioned family movie that will not offend anyone with nasty things. Those are too rare, I agree; it is just that I don't think this is so great as a drama. Why not get a later Disney film like FOLLOW ME BOYS!

With all these things going for it, toss is some good humor and down to earth life lessons - it's a great movie!It's about family life, keeping it all together, big families, small communites. It's about love and struggle and having it all - so long as you keep things in perspective. It's about keeping your word, being honorable, and rolling with the punches.

It is one of the best books in this subject that I have seen. however the material isn't easy and for beginner students this book will be chalenging."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard to read and bad examples","review":"I am currently using this book at the University of Pittsburgh and found it very difficult to follow. I feel that the author spends more time trying to show his english and grammer skills rather than his knowledge of systems and signals. The examples that are given, don't supply enough information on how to get from point A to point B."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Unhappy","review":"I just took a class that required this book and I found it to be incredibly unhelpful.

The author assumes that we have already taken multipal signals and systems classes and that we already know how to do many of the \\"tricks\\" he knows. However, the majority of the time, he fails to mention which trick he is using, or clearly show how to work the problem in an orderly fashion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Signals and Systems 2e review","review":"This text is a little murky. There are not a lot of examples demonstrating all of the different cases. The theory is explained briefly followed by lots of problems that you have to figure out how to work out on your own. Overall it is hard to understand unless you have a detailed knowledge of the signals to begin with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Large gap between problems and explanations in the text","review":"This is my least favorite book on the subject of signals and systems. The book is very wordy, and often explains things in overly simple terms, then presents extremely difficult problem sets as accompaniment. The section on convolution (a very simple concept, really) made my head spin. It's no good to spend three paragraphs explaining something that is essentially 1+1 = 2, then leave the student to do an exercise which is more like a differential equation."},{"rating":"2","title":"signals and systems","review":"This book is really useful and covers lots of content. But there is no detail solution for the exercises, so you would better get a solution book with this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Yeah Right!","review":"The problems in this book at the end of each chapter are not even close to explained in the text. This book might be a good thing to read if you have a VERY good professor, but since none of the professors teaching the class at my school are considered by students even to be good, a lot more than this book provides is needed"},{"rating":"1","title":"Useless","review":"This book just contains tables of formulas and horrible descriptions. It doesn't help you understand signals and systems at all. Read this book if you love memorizing things."},{"rating":"1","title":"far too few (mathematical) details, too much babbling","review":"A lot of stuff in there, but it is all just scratching at the surface. If you really want to understand the mathematics behind it and what is going an, forget it. Example: Fourier Transformation. In what field are we working? Why can L2([0,1]) be identified with the nonperiodic Lebesgue Space l2(Z)? Hilbert Spaces and thus orthognalility aren't even mentioned. Example: Convolution. Under what conditions can we convolute (remember the equation of young?) Nothing about this at all. Mathematics are not at all (or not really in depth) dealt with. So it is no more than an under-undergraduate book to generally get a picture of what Signals and Systems are about. Too many trivial figures. Another problem are the 'solved problems'. Only answers to trivial problems are given; and they are no solutions but nothing more than the results. And where you really want an advanced problem solved you just got bad luck."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey other professors- don't knock me","review":"This book is extremely difficult material for undergrad students to comprehend- if a professor can't realize that another career is in order. Like many college texts this one seems to be written for other profs to read as opposed to beginning engineering students to learn the material. If your prof isn't extremely strong this book won't help! I am going to give Lathi's book a go...."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WORST ENGINEERING BOOK I'VE EVER SEEN","review":"Can we say USELESS?The book explains NONE of the problems in the back, and you basically can't use the book to help solve advanced problems.The worst part is, there are problems in the book WITHOUT ANSWERS, and I'm not talking about the odd #s or even #s, but I'm talking a huge chunk (where the real meat of the chapters are found in applied equations) lack solutions.If you're looking to use this book, I suggest you compare it with your best doorstop or table prop, and see if you really need this $75+ hunk of junk."},{"rating":"2","title":"Signals and systems","review":"The book has been arrived in good condition and spent a time less than I expect.Thanks for all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not concise, not enough examples!","review":"I have struggled through two classes utilizing this book, so I feel I do have a good sense of the material in it. It does say something about a textbook when your professor requires you to purchase a second book to fill in the gaps this book creates (Laplace transform). I feel I still do not have an adequate grasp of Fourier series - and I've read those sections time and time again. I eventually went to another textbook to teach myself the material on my own time.The lack of mathematical examples make the processes of understanding the material WAY more difficult than it needs to be. Another sore point: A lot of the understanding comes from the practice problems. Too bad there are so few answers in the back of the book. It leaves you to question what you have learned - if anything from the problem."},{"rating":"1","title":"hard for Mom to tolerate","review":"I love folk music, but this CD contains only 2 songs that I like and only 2 others that I can even tolerate. My kids seem to like it (the ones I don't hit the skip button for) but I am not going to sacrifice myself when there are plenty of other recordings that they and I both like.Why don't I like it? Zanes has a croak similar to Bob Dylan's; with all due respect to Dylan's great songwriting, I don't enjoy his singing. Zane's friends vary in talent but none of them seem able to harmonize together. The songs in a minor key are particularly grating, such as \\"All Around the Kitchen\\" which many people seem to like, though I can't see why. The instrumentation is nothing special either. Don't buy this just because you like the song \\"Jump Up\\" from Sesame Street; you should listen before you buy to make sure the rest of it matches your taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Stuff!","review":"What a fantastic album for kids, parents, and anybody who loves a blend of folk/roots/pop. The whole album is great but these tracks stand out:- Malti and Linstead Market have a Caribbean feel to them.- Wonder Wheel has some good pop hooks and reminds me of The Kinks \\"Come Dancing.- Hokey Pokey, Water for the Elephants and Skip to My Lou let parents listen to a children's song and still enjoy it even after dozens of playings.- All Around the Kitchen is a kid's song that rocks."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Savior of Kids' Music!","review":"As a die-hard music lover with a three-year-old, I am always searching for that elusive CD that my daughter and I can agree on. We've had some pleasant suprises on the \\"grown-up music\\" side, but precious few on the kids' music. Dan Zanes is the exception. This CD is clever, well performed, musically diverse, and completely singable. I will never forget the first time I heard my daughter singing along to \\"Water for the Elephant\\" from the back seat--priceless!The thing I love best of all about this CD is the infusion of different musical influences--Caribbean, zydeco, American roots, and rock, to name a few. What a great way to introduce your child to the many sounds of the world around us!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good kids music- what a relief!","review":"When we had kids we hated to give up good music in favor of high-pitched vocals and overly repetitive hooks. What a relief to find some good kids music! Our kids are hooked on Dan Zanes and Laurie Berkner, and we couldn't be happier! Bring on Dan's \\"Fooba Wooba John\\" and Laurie's \\"Victor Vito,\\" we love it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Kids music that is not painful to listen to","review":"My 3-year old and I really enjoy this CD.

Our 3 month old enjoys being danced around the room to the songs and calms instantly when we put it on in the car! We especially love the song Thrift Shop!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Two weeks...","review":"It took us two weeks to find out what our daughter was happily going around the house singing (3 at the time). And finally Sesame Street came on, and she said her song was on. It was 'Mailti' by Dan Zanes, and once that wason my daughter just danced and sang away.Since then we have embraced Dan's music into our family music circle. The lyrics are clean and catchy, and the rythm is simple enough for even a child to keep up with."},{"rating":"1","title":"Most tracks are ok, but the two by \\"Father Goose\\" are awful.","review":"My son loves the music, but the singing by \\"Father Goose\\" is unbearably nasal and off-pitch on \\"Holey Pokey\\" and \\"Skip to My Lou\\".Those two tracks make me cringe and I skip them every time my son plays the CD. However, several songs are wonderfully musical. For example, Linstead Market is just delightful."},{"rating":"1","title":"this is an amazing work of art","review":"this is an amazing work of art to certain people. i think it was th eworst thing ever. this was a total waste of money. i thiunk that is should be less. i will never buy a cd like this AGAIN!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent for children and adults alike!","review":"We learned about Dan Zanes (sad to say) from Playhouse Disney (which my kids watch more than they should). I chose this particular album because it had our favorite song (among the ones we had seen featured), \\"Malti\\" (in Spanish). Immediately, my children adored this CD and wanted to play it every day, several times a day. Oddly enough, neither my husband nor I objected; we sing along, too. A mix of traditional and original tunes, excellently orchestrated; real wit and personality come through. We'll be getting more CDs by Dan Zanes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Total brain candy for young and old","review":"This is a great disk. Every song is brain candy, such fun lyrics and rhythms. My kids (2.5 and 4.5) love it and so do we. Noggin's \\"move to the music\\" fist got us hooked on him. Would love to see a video with his music and quirky dancing gang. My kids just love #10 \\"all around the kitchen\\". Whenever they're getting into trouble I'll play it. They'll drop whatever they're doing, come running and we'll dance. I love the last song \\"good night waltz\\", beautiful song. Reminds me of something I'd hear sitting around the campfire with friends."},{"rating":"2","title":"I just like it and my kids do, too.","review":"I saw Dan Zanes doing \\"Jump Up\\" on Noggin (a preschoolers cable network) and LOVED it. It took me some digging to find out who the act was etc. Long story short, the version of \\"Jump Up\\" on this CD is not the one that aired on TV. I was disappointed at first, because the TV session kept adding more and more musicians and the disk is just Dan & strings. But I like this disk very much, and so does my 26 mo. old son. My 8 year old daughters also like it and we sing and dance to \\"All Around the Kitchen\\" together. I will admit to listening to the CD when my kids aren't in the van. I agree with another poster who felt that Father Goose was annoying. I like those tracks least, but I LOVE Rock Island Line, Linstead Market, and especially, Thrift Shop."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fun and Unique songs","review":"I enjoy listening to this CD with our toddler as it contains songs and arrangements you don't hear on every other music CD for toddlers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great for our kids","review":"Our kids (20 months and 4 y.o.) love this album.

After going through some of my roommate's tapes and finding them too difficult, I settled on Karen's tapes, since her Pilates tape was easy to follow. This tape was exactly what I was looking for - not a lot of confusing, complicated moves, but something to get my heart rate going. I have not yet done the strength training half of the video, but the aerobic part is definately wonderful. Also, there are many different body types in the \\"class\\" with Karen, which is encouraging. For those who wouldn't be caught dead in an aerobics or step class, this is the tape for you. This video does require a step, and the aerobic part runs about 60 minutes (despite the 40 minute claim)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Overly Complex - Not For The Casual Stepper","review":"How can something so complex be so boring? Karen Voight's tape will give you a solid workout, but that's about it. She's a big fan purely athletic step. She doesn't distract you from the pain with a good routine and fun music. If you're looking for a step workout where you're not checking your watch or praying for the cool down, this is NOT the one for you. For Karen, it's all about stiff execution and painfully complex patterns. She's one of those atheletes who assumes we're all there with her for the sake of achieving a more perfect state of step. If you're like me, you just want to get the heart rate up, workout your muscles, and keep moving with the rest of your busy life. If that's the case, I'd keep searching!"},{"rating":"1","title":"I can't believe how many people like this video!","review":"I bought this video because almost every reviewer gave it 5 stars and said it was a good workout and not too complicated. Some did say it was not for beginners, and that is definitely true. But I am not a beginner, and it is VERY complicated. The moves for the feet are complicated enough and when I felt I almost had the move down arms were added and before I could get that down a whole new routine would be started so quickly, and again over before I could get it down. Even the stretches were done very quickly. It was so frustrating and I felt that although I just bought it and only did it once, I find it unlikely I will pick it up again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Unexpectedly Outstanding","review":"When I purchased this tape I anticipated a typical, run-of-the-mill workout. I was unexpectedly, but pleasantly, surprised at this tremendously energetic, varied, and stimulating workout. Karen uses an on-screen sprint meter to mark the progression of the sprint sessions. Each sprint is a bit longer than the former one, and she shows various ways of doing the entire workout (sprints included) in a less strenuous manner. By using the many ways of modifying the routines, this advanced tape can be useful for exercisers of all fitness levels.Karen's cuing is superb, her moves are graceful, and her choreography is simple yet varied. Video and DVD exercise is my primary form of structured activity, and I have been doing it for 15 years. This tape has just moved to the #1 place in my large collection of VHS and DVD workouts!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent video that I strongly recommend!!!!","review":"I've tried this video and loved the results. Karen's instructions are excellent. She encourages you to work at your own level and gradually build from there. I've lost this video and am searching high and low for another copy. If you want a total body toning which includes upper and lower body along w/step aerobics this is perfect. Certainly not boring. Enjoy!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I love this video","review":"I've been doing this video for about 3 years, and still love it. It uses so many different muscles that you feel flexible and strong all over. The many power moves are controlled and Karen gives useful reminders of good form. I find the sprints fun, especially the middle 3. Karen's manner is friendly and intelligent. It did take me some time to learn this video (I'm not terribly coordinated). But it was worth it. Now I wish it would come out on DVD..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Only for experienced athletes.","review":"This video is not for the faint of heart. Everything about it is too fast paced for either a beginner or intermediate exerciser. Two of my friends hurt themselves using this tape.

His focus is signal events and social change, always well explained, with quantitative measures of scope and impact. The book is island focused -- with little attention on the Caribbean's mainland enclaves of Belize, the Guyanas, or Suriname. But it gives a good foundation for understanding the diverging paths of numerous island states. It gives a feel for the impact of anti-plantation attitudes after the Haitian revolution, the repressive terror which that revolution unleashed in planters and colonial governors across the Caribbean, the rise of community and labor organization, the diverse forms of post-colonial rule, and the difficult trials of many economic models. Though the survey ends around 1990, it's a great window on everything that came before."},{"rating":"1","title":"Buyer Beware","review":"I did not receive the item pictured which I thought I was purchasing.

He loves it, and asked me to hang it from his light in his room. We painted it black, rather than the suggested blue, and it looks great. The only issue is that the decals for the fins don't quite fit right, but he doesn't care.We have flown it, and it really goes. With the largest engines, it flys well over 1000 feet, and recovers well. I'm sure we could break it, but it would also be easily repaired. It does eject its engine when the recovery charge blows, so watch out. Overall, it is a fun rocket to fly, and according to my 4 year old, the best rocket ever."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simple kit, great altitude, wings are a challenge","review":"I bought a bunch of these for my 5th grade students.

There are two central characters but lots of minor characters, most of who, you never even actually see, they're background stories. But it's all such a vivid novel; you get so caught up in the plain sheer energy and power of the author's voice, which is amazingly unique. It gives me so much inspiration for what you can do with novels. I LOVE this book. I want to read the author's other works.

I recommend it especially to psychology students,professors, or anyone interested in social psychology. The moments of humor are poignant. Moritz Bleibtrau does an astounding job as the lead character!"},{"rating":"2","title":"What men can do","review":"A truly scary reflection of the way a small amount of power, in this case being made a Prison Guard, can change normal people into monsters - or so it would seem. However what I gathered from the film was that the experimenters knew that the two leading protaganists would end up at each others throats. Perhaps not literally but they were chosen with that in mind.Obviously there has been quite a bit of spicing up of the original Stanford case and the addition/distraction of the gorgeous girlfriend seemed a little out of place as well. However the film is very well directed and equally well acted. After the initial setup the tension is gradually racked up until in the second half of the movie you realise that things are spiralling out of control.So its a riveting watch, but not a film I will want to see again quickly as it is a sad reflection on our humanity (or lack of it)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Experiment in prison becomes all too real!","review":"An advertisement invites men to volunteer to take part in an experiment. They say no one will get hurt and their cameras are on twenty-four hours a day. out of a group of men, some will be prison guards, the others prisoners. Those as the prison guards must not play guards, but be real guards. They do and they get too caught up in the prison play. The \\"prisoners\\" must fight back. The experiment becomes real. This film contains male nudity and some female nudity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Average Movie","review":"I am not sure why people write the story of the movie in their reviews instead of actually writing a review.This movie is neither good nor bad; the acting is good in most parts but overall this is a normal movie in terms of story and sript.To compare it to \\"Run Lola Run\\" is unfair and if you are interested in watching more movies along the lines of human psychology I would recommend \\"Cube\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"terrific, great moves and music to get you energized more","review":"Simple and low-impact moves that are very effective.

Must-have for your workout video library!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Aerobics section is great","review":"The aerobics section of this video is beginner/intermediate level and great! It's fun and Karen is an excellent instructor. I also like that it's short. If you are an advanced exerciser, use this on your easy days or try something more difficult. Perfect for the average exerciser. Unique set makes it more interesting to look at than some other videos. I've had the video forever and still enjoy getting it out, although the bar section (I even bought the bar) never thrilled me."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for beginners","review":"Agree that this is an excellently produced video, however, overweight/ beginners stay away from this video.

I am not a big fan of aerobics (I hate to sweat!), but I really enjoy this routine. Mostly I like Karen. She gets me motivated to work hard, even though I have to pull out the towel and turn on the fan. :) I also love the bodyscultping section. I can feel the burn, and it's a great all over workout. I don't do both sections in one session, simply because after aerobics I can't concentrate on more focused moves like weights. Karen is one of my favorite two instructors, and I would definitely recommend this video."},{"rating":"1","title":"cute...but they hurt","review":"I bought this for my two boys, one 3 1/2 and the other 1 1/2 years old, matching coz the look cute, but they have a border in the back that when you put the feet it slides in, so unless u buy it a bigger size, too hard to get in. Have to be worn with socks for the same reason. the width is not wide enough. the velcro barely closes on my kids. but very cute and sturdy, even though theyll not wear it much, they end up with blisters everywere.

The kids in the digiworld battle Leomon, Bakemon, Whamon, and other digimon. For some reason, the animated versions of these stories felt less disjointed - in the manga it just feels like too much is happening too fast, with digimon of the moment appearing every few seconds. The battles are also a lot better in animated form. The artwork just doesn't seem to capture those or digivolving (the transformation of a digimon into a more powerful form) very well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"I loved how the book was shipped quickly and that the book was like new or brand new.

This CD is the one of my favorites and all my clients love it! The entire disc features nice, slower tempo songs, perfect for \\"de-stressing\\", and the volume of the recording is consistent throughout the CD. It also features the peaceful sound of ocean waves between songs. I have the \\"Somewhere In Time\\" movie soundtrack, which is beautiful, but the volume of the orchestra varies so much that I find it less suitable for massage. This disc, with it's beautifully subtle classical pieces, puts my clients at ease and definitely enhances the massage experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Somewhere in Time music review","review":"Somewhere in TimeThis CD is so soothing that I listen to it each night before falling to sleep.

The only thing is... Symphony of Enchanted Lands 2: The Dark Secret blows this out of the water. Don't get me wrong. The time and effort put into this had to be tremendous.

Anyway this album contain my favorite song ever, and that is the Seige Of Aina, where it seems the best person on this album Thomas Rettke (Heavens Gate) Proves why he should get the most face time on this album. He is an amazing villian, and his tracks are by far the best on the album.Now I gave this CD only 4 stars because the only way to listen to this cd and enjoy it is to skip a lot of the songs.

The quality of the recordings is first rate (as usual with Rhino). The first 2 discs are fantastic but the third disc falters as it documents the rather sad tail end of the career of the Drifters after the death of the great Rudy Lewis.

May contain spoilers:I really liked this book. Luca had issues and was bitter, but was not overly cruel like some Hs, and he really tried to redeem himself when he realized he was wrong. I liked Shannon - a feisty, non-doormat h who wasn't a brat, which sometimes happens when authors try to have an h stand up for herself.If there was one criticism, I was annoyed by how the selfishness of Shannon's sister was dealt with in allowing Shannon to be the fall guy and wreck her own chances for happiness. I can understand that now that the sister was dead, it was best to let it go. However, I found it hard to believe that while the sister was alive Shannon never once resented her sister and instead saw her as someone who needed to be loved too much. I think a little resentment would have been natural. But overall I still really liked this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A True Love Story","review":"This is one of the very best books I have read in a very long time.

It made me cry a lot it was so sad in some parts but the reader knew that because of a misundertanding and coverup there was a love not to be denied. Michelle, you've done it again. I loved it, loved it even though I cried but knew it would all come together and have a happy ending. This is a sure read for everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing singing","review":"Caballe sings these songs with a great deal of emotion and apparent joy.

I have only in the past year began to get addicted to this particular CSI series. When I started out I had to buy all of the previous seasons to catch up with what was going on. Then since David Caruso is such and interesting character, I looked up and bought NYPD Blue because he starred in it the first season.I love the scenery, being a north Floridian I appreciate the beauty of the area and envy the tropical follage that grows there.

This book is simply a re-hash of DREAM MAN (fantastic -- get that one instead). Very disappointing and FAR below Howard's talent."},{"rating":"1","title":"if you don't mind the anti-choice message...","review":"Howards is easy to read, a light mystery with romance thrown in. The beautiful artist with a strange ability to paint murder scenes before they happen, and a super-rich love interest didn't turn me on - but that's just a personal taste.My only objection is her condemnation of anyone who has an abortion. It is morally correct for the love interest to divorce not because his wife was an adulter but because she aborted his child. Wifey is not a sympathic character, but deciding anyone who aborts a fetus is evil? It wasn't a necessary part of the plot and seemed like a way to force her anti-choice message."},{"rating":"2","title":"This was the first time I have read LH and I'm HOOKED!","review":"I just loved the combination of mystery and romance, realistic romance not the \\"sappy\\" kind.

I enjoyed the interesting plot and the accompanying love story. Although the speed with which the characters fall in love is unrealistic, this is, after all, fiction. One word of warning, the love scenes are steamy and somewhat graphic - so caution to those who want a slow fade out and the next paragraph a change of scenary."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Must Read!!!","review":"This was the first book I read of Linda Howard's and I must say it was great.

It will send ppl swooning with how even bad things turn good . Plus there's a hint of metaphysical in it with psychic and spirtual things going on.

It's Great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good pleasant read, but not one of Howard's best...","review":"As a long time fan of Howard's, I know never to start one of her books unless I have time to finish it in the same sitting. This novel meets that criteria. However, the lack of actual coversation and character interaction in the book left me with the impression that the lion's share of the book was left on the editing floor. The characters in this book are a far cry from the type characters that she has previously written. With the exception of the hero and heroine, the characters are a slap-in-the-face look at the darkest of human motivators. It's evident, and highly commendable, that Howard is exploring her talent and genre instead of staying 'glued' with the safe and familiar, like so many authors tend to do."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing!!!","review":"I give this book 2 stars only because the author had a good plot idea.

This came as a very big disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"predictable","review":"in the beginning, the novel proved to keep my attention. but somewhere in the middle, i got bored. the plot became so transparent. first of all, there wasn't a wide array of suspects to consider. even the most amateur sleuth could make a reasonable guess about who the perpetrator was. i actaully skipped over many chapters just to get to the ending so i could confirm my (accurate) guess. i love a romantic suspense, but this was nothing i could sink my teeth into."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Impressive","review":"My first Linda Howard book was Mr. Perfect and I was hooked. I was sure I would love anything written by her and immediately picked up Now you See Her. I was bitterly disappointed.There is little interaction between the characters and no rationalization as to why they fall for one another. It doesn't flow but just has sections of sensual get togethers with no real meaning behind them.I found it hard to follow and not a good read. I'm starting All the Queens Men and hope I enjoy it as much as Mr. Perfect but if I don't, I'm done with this author."},{"rating":"1","title":"BORING, DON'T WASTE YOUR EFFORT, SUB-STANDARD","review":"I couldn't get into this book. I read through the first 10 chapters and still was waiting for the story to take off. The characters were weak, the plot (although unique) left me cold. I had to stuggle to get through the ten chapters that I did read. I am a real big fan of Linda Howards, and this just seemed below par for her. But, I will continue to read Linda Roberts, even someone with Roberts' talent can have an off day."},{"rating":"1","title":"Porn disguised as a romance/thriller","review":"Dreadful!!! I do not read romances, so I don't know if this book is the norm. It is supposedly a thriller, but the thrills are few, unless you count the numerous graphic sex (and almost having sex) scenes. A murder finally happened--I knew who was going to get killed at least three chapters before it finally happened. The killer was so obvious it was pathetic. If you are looking for a good who-done-it, go elsewhere. If you want to read all about the girth of a certain man's penis, by all means jump right in, you will get plenty of that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Plain Creepy","review":"I've been a Linda Howard fan for years, but that seems to be changing. Her latest offering is something I never would have read if the author hadn't been Linda Howard. Ms. Howard's shift into romantic/suspense books is starting to take a turn for the worse. The author should stick to what she does best, writing books filled with rich characerizations and compelling plots--not to mention great love scenes. We simply don't need the creepy murder and paranormal stuff."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could have been great","review":"About three fourths of the way through this book I realized it was not going to end well. There was just too much going on for everything to be tied up by page 325. Sure enough, I felt someone had torn the last 50 pages out of my copy. Of course, if it had not been a good story I would not have cared. But it was a good story, and different. I was caught up in it. I wanted all the ends tied up, all the mysteries solved. Unfortunately, the epilogue added nothing to the story. Was there a scandal? What happened to the senator? Most of all, what happened to Sweeney's gift? Was it lasting, could she help people before they died? Or was her gift to help solve the crime? Since she could see and talk to dead people why didn't she ask them why they were ghosts? What happened to her health? And what is the meaning of the title? I wanted more from the epilogue. Maybe Linda H. will revisit Sweeney in the future. P.S. I liked the romance between Sweeney and Richard. (...)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow! What a thrilling read!","review":"This is my second novel that I have read from linda howard and would not have missed it for the world. It's action packed and has romance to it. My favorite types of novels. Even though the couple in the book get together in a shockingly fast amount of time it did not ruin the book for me. I'm glad that I discovered this author since I was starting to run out of good author's to read. I'm going to have alot of fun reading her books.

Compared to her other books this one was too...sappy! I knew who the killer was, and in reality I didn't even care. I was not worried about the killer because the characters were not worried about the killer. They seemed more interested in the moral dilemma of having sex.Not worth buying but if you can borrow it from the library, knock yourself out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Red-hot!! Must read!!!","review":"I don't think Linda could ever write a bad book. This book has some sex scenes that will make you want to find someone just like Richard. The only drawback I find is that it seems to be a recycled book (a copycat of her previous book, Dream Man)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, but not up to par for LH","review":"Another pretty good one by Linda Howard. Good plot, interesting and likeable characters. I'll have to say that the suspense and action weren't quite as good in this one as previous ones I've read, but it's still good. Actually, it started out really suspenseful - had me raising my eyebrows first thing.... however, the further along in the book I got, the less suspense there was. She didn't fool me at all with the twist at the end - had it figured out. Still yet, I enjoyed it.... the romance was good, the paranormal aspect was interesting (although I never had my questions answered), and it was an original plot. If you like LH, go ahead and read it for those reasons, if not the suspense. Honestly have to say that it's a 4 star romance, but only a 3 star suspense."},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite Linda Howard book","review":"I've read quite a few Linda Howard books, but 'Now You See Her' is my favorite out of them all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just the outline","review":"While I have always enjoyed Linda Howard books, I believe that she is now writing short stories. Now You See Her (& Kiss & Tell) appeared to have been rushed to the publisher while still in outline format. There is little or no character development and the plot is extremely thin.

Wow!!","review":"Linda Howard - you certainly have not lost your touch! This book grabbed me from the very first page (or I grabbed it!) and I polished it off in a day and a half! It was FANTASTIC!! It was so easy to picture Sweeney physically.She was so cute and vulnerable. Her relationship to Richard was very well done: I could feel the electricity from the two of them jump right off the page. Howard always has been good at sex scenes and she certainly does not disappoint! The suspense was taut and exciting. The paranormal was a great element - it reminded me of SON OF THE MORNING, which I believe was her finest effort. Even though that novel was about time travel, this one had the same kind of \\"supercharged, supernatural suspense\\" to it. Gosh! I loved it!! My heart is still racing from the excitement. (I just finished it half an hour ago!) Excellent and highly recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"not that good!","review":"After reading all the reviews of Linda Howard's books, I thought she would be a really great author. However, I was pretty dissappointed once I started reading this book(I have finished about three-fourths of the book)The sexual tension for which the author seems to be so renowned is certainly lacking in this one.There is hardly any interaction between the lead characters,the story focuses on the secondary characters as much as the lead ones.I found no reason as to why the hero fell so suddenly for Sweeney.I feel nothing for the hero & heroine as their is no real development of their characters. Overall, it is a pretty mediocre book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great story idea.....disappointing story!","review":"This was your basic paint-by-numbers, fill in the blanks plotted story. This is my first Linda Howard book. I bought the hardcover, based on the flap copy...it sounded like a great story...painter who paints murder scenes before they actually happen...Unfortunately, the story never really went anywhere. The characters were never fully developed, just predictable cardboard stereotypes. The hero was instantly in love with the heroine, so there was no real conflict or growth there. The soon to be ex-wife was cheating and promiscuous for no apparent reason. I just didn't buy into any of it, and felt a bit cheated..There were no surprises and I really would have liked to have seen the psychic element explored a little more too. The whole book overall just seemed simple and shallow....if this is representative of her work in general, I will take a pass...."},{"rating":"1","title":"Definitely NOT her best work....","review":"There was something missing throughout the book....I can't place my finger on it. It was too fast paced and also highly predictable."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crazy!!","review":"Everyone else is right, I get 4 packs of Doubleshot Light at Target for $7 each. You would have to be crazy to buy this! I kept reading it over and over thinking I must have misread the product info, but I didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ridiculously Overpriced","review":"This is actually, unbelievable.Safeway and Target sell this same item, regular price for about $26 cheaper. $24 for 12 units (three 4-packs, total 12 pcs.).Not to mention, they often go on sale for $7 ea., or $21 for 12, or $29 cheaper.The coffee is good, thats why I buy it, but the price on Amazon is astronomically too high."},{"rating":"1","title":"What are you thinking?","review":"I thought maybe it was a CASE of twelve four packs. That would make more sense at $80 list price... but it's not. You shouldn't ever pay more than $6 for a 4-pack of doubleshots (which would be $18 for 12 cans). Target and Safeway are way cheaper. Odd that anyone would buy these! Even buying ONE can out of the fridge at Starbucks is cheaper!"},{"rating":"1","title":"14 Packs(3sets+2bk) Lc41 INK for Brother Dcp-110c,dcp-310cn,mfc-210c,mf c-410cn, Mfc-420cn, Mfc-620cn, Mfc-3240c, Mfc-3340cn, Mf","review":"This 14 Packs(3sets+2bk) Lc41 INK for Brother Dcp-110c,dcp-310cn,mfc-210c,mf c-410cn, Mfc-420cn, Mfc-620cn, Mfc-3240c, Mfc-3340cn, Mfc-5440cn, Mfc-5840cn, Fax1840c, Fax1940cn, Fax2440c.

The positive thing I can say is that it usually works. The negatives are that it's not well made and the display freezes up from time to time. To fix the display requires unplugging from the wall charger and removing the battery. Davis customer service confirmed that this is a problem and recommended a surge suppressor on the wall charger...didn't make any difference.If I had it to do over again, I'd look for a better made system."},{"rating":"2","title":"I only feel Holistic","review":"My dogs love this food.

Theres better options on the merket, they make cost little more, but at least you're not getting jipped."},{"rating":"2","title":"Auzzie4185","review":"Athena my toy fox terrier was having a lot of problems with chewing on her feet, course hair and noisy scratching just after she turned two. She had always shed a lot. If you wore a black shirt her white hair would cover you. If you wore a white one her 3 inch patch of black fur was enough to cover you in black fur. I was about to make a vet appt. for the chewing and itching. I stopped at a dog food store and was just going to pick up a good dog brush for the shedding. The salesman asked what was wrong and then guided me to this food. She didn't love it at first but loved the dog treats. I think the treats hooked her on the food. No more chewing after about a week. Hardly no scratching and her shedding is less then 1/4 of what it used to be. Not to mention people now comment on how soft she is. I love this food. However for a dog that has NEVER had bad breath she now has fish breath. Thus the four stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Dog Food!","review":"My dogs absolutely love this dog food.

This is the first food in her 4years that I have been able to keep her on for more then a couple months. I buy the large bag and have two dogs that it will feed for almost a month before needing more and both my dogs look and feel healthy and happy. No more chewing paws or stratching like crazy. Both dogs also run to their feeding spot as soon as I get the bag out. Fishy smell is nothing compared to the help it gives my dogs. Shipping is always fast and hassle free. Love this product.
