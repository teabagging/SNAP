I was wrong. There is no character called Butchie, Bruce doesn't have multiple endings, and this Bruce doesn't go around parading the Chinese and the superiority of Kung Fu nor does he kick arse. This completely different movie is kind of about Bruce Lee but this Bruce keeps losing fights and the movie is just plain bad.Besides being mistaken for another movie, the DVD is very plain and bare bones. The video and audio quality is expectedly poor."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Dragon Lives","review":"First, Bruce Li is always very entertaining to watch. Second, the fight scenes did have good choreography.On the other hand, the actual plot of this movie makes Bruce Lee appear \\"goofy\\". The director made Bruce Li (Ho Chung Tao) who plays Bruce Lee, overact his role. Normally, Ho Chung Tao is a very good actor. In this movie, the plot is a bit weird. the director shows Lee actually laughing in an exagerated manner while dying! The director portrays Lee as an obsessive and compulsive person who is very hyper and sleeps around on his wife.I like Ho Chung Tao, but, I did not understand what the director's point with this movie was.Was Bruce Lee goofy? Was Lee crazy?I rate this movie with 4 stars only because Ho Chung Tao has some good fight scenes.I would like to add that the director even manages to make Ho Chung Tao look a bit \\"wimpy\\" and unskilled in the fighting scenes.This is another example of a movie that has a great cast and a horrible director."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utter Junk","review":"I purchased 3 of these in 2010. They came with a 2 year warranty. They all failed. The first one failed after about a year. First it made loud buzzing and clicking noises (even when switched off), to the point where we had to cut the power to be able to sleep in the room. It also would refuse to turn off, so that the light would be on all the time (not good in a bedroom). The second one failed the same way, and the third one failed quietly by refusing to shut off, such that I had to remove the bulb. I contacted the company to ask for my money back but they refused to give me any refund, and were really quite rude about it. They were willing to replace them, but I certainly wasn't going to install new ones when the previous ones had a 100% failure rate. I'm done with them, forever."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worse than x10","review":"I bought this because my lights in the bathroom would occasionally not work.

This is the new generation of synth duos, the days of Air, Zero 7 and such while not passing, but are stalling a bit. This is the next step towards synth perfection. \\"Gunnera\\" is one of the best songs I've heard, period. Any genre. And i do listen to a few. The middle of the album is explosive with pretty agressive beats while it starts and finish in a sort of experimental ambiental groove of sounds in unison. I think \\"Meet next life\\" is a far more complete album than \\"Lucky Cat\\" The sound enhancement, melody ingenuity and near perfect fixtures of beats and a billion sounds over their other albums has to be obvious.

When I heard Isan were incorporating new instruments into Meet Next Life and trying to expand their sound I was a little excited, a tad nervous. So they got a guitar and a a glockenspiel (which is REALLY making a comback now) to add texture to their tunes. Aside from \\"birds over barges\\" which works well, the rest of the album is a pretty dull affair. Lucky Cat was a really emotive piece of electronica while Clockwork illustrated some of their more quirky works which are quiet engaging. Meet Next Life though has nothing on these two albums. It's a really nice record...which is precisely the problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"ISAN - Meet Next Life","review":"Bucolic is always a word that will apply to Isan, and their album MEET NEXT LIFE fits it to a tea, from the folk guitars of \\"Birds Over Barges\\" to the slow wind-up to \\"One Man Abandon.\\" The rhythms are, as always, gentle and the melodies soothing. The hazy electronics of \\"Gurnard\\" recall a lazy summertime riverboat ride, while \\"Gunnera\\" is a brisk breeze on a cool day. The dreamy \\"Snowdrops and Phlox\\" conjures up more icicles than plant life, but it's still achingly delicate. The final, title track twinkles out like stars from distant galaxies.

The paddle is nicely curved and grabs well on the pants. It can be tough to remove from loose fabric such as linen or khakis, but then again you won't have to worry about having your carry gun fall to the floor in front of a startled waitress.The rotation feature is the best part, I can set the holster to different positions as I drive, walk, sit, whatever; it's always comfortable and stays in position.HT to the Outdoor Bunker for quick shipping."},{"rating":"1","title":"Won't fit 5906 or 6906","review":"I am very unhappy with this. Why they would say it fits Smith and Wesson guns is a mystery to me. The slide release gouges into the holster and it doesn't fit either my 5906 or 6906. Not even close. Waste of money. Typically I am very happy with Fobus Paddle holsters and own many of them. I suppose I can use it if I ever get a Sig 200 series."},{"rating":"1","title":"returned it","review":"Fobus makes a great product at a great price but I had a problem since I had installed a taller front sight to compensate for the adjustable rear I installed. This hight difference prevented me from being able to holster my piece which is a P229 .40 S&W w/o rail. If it hadn't been for that I'd have kept this holster."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice holster, but DOES NOT fit a S&W CS9 properly","review":"I purchased this holster expecting to be able to carry my S&W; CS9 (Chiefs Special) 9mm semi-auto. The trigger guard area on the holster is too narrow to accommodate the wider trigger guard of the gun making the seam of the plastic holster separate. While it does technically fit, because the seam is actually 2 pieces at that point, it is extremely difficult to draw without pulling the entire paddle portion up out of your pants.I returned it in hopes to find something a little closer fitting."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Golf between the ears\\" with little in the book!","review":"I bought this book as an Easter gift for my golfing Husbad and both he and I were very disappointed in the content.

Warm water used with sterile pads or tear-stain products are the only cleansing products one should use near the eyes.#2: The wipes are also recommended for feline stud tail, but they do absolutely no good for this annoying malady.The main remedy for stud tail is to remove the build up of oils on a daily basis and unless one rubs vigorously with the Malacetic wipes, the grease does not budge.

Because the wipes foam up, I feel like I am taking a second step to rinse off the sticky residue it leaves behind.

As he often does, Kafka uses his alter reality as a metaphor for our reality. In The Penal Colony is a peice about a machine that punishes criminals by slowly enraving a script into the criminals body spelling out their crime and eventually killing them. He details the workings of the machine; from it's bed of cotton and bitting felt, to it's harrow, where the sharp needles lie in wait. Holding true to his metaphorical style, the machine represents a broader machine in our reality; the justice system. He subtley equates the the workings of the machine with the processes and workings of our own systems, obviously denouncing their mechanical ways.

Then, while applying the product, one must maintain that heat in the barrel long enough to make that application smooth and bubble, overlap free. Frankly, after reading those instructions, I chose NOT to use the product out of fear that I would stain the barrel in an erratic and undesireable way. It may be easier and less prone to mistake than the instructions led me to believe but to those wishing to use it, I would first consult someone who does this for their livelihood or at least someone who has truly had some experience with it. It may be a lot easier than it seems to me but I didn't want to chance blemishing my heirloom rifle with the combination of the product and my own amateur restoration abilities."},{"rating":"2","title":"Playhut megahouse fun!","review":"I got this megahouse for my three children aged 6, 3, and 1. They love it! They can set up a train track inside and still have room to play around. It's really tall too, which is nice-helps it feel bigger even. It does take up a lot of space but it is totally worth it! However, I can't seem to ever get it taken down right-it's really bulky and I am pretty small-the directions just do not help! It folds though so we stick it against the wall. I gave it 4 stars just because I wish I could take it down simply and easy as everyone else seems to be able to do. It's a great buy!"},{"rating":"1","title":"An unimaginative, pale, pathetic echo of an imitation","review":"When I considered the idea of symphonic Pink Floyd, I expected the awesome power of the orchestra to be unleashed in a kind of breathtaking glory that cannot be achieved with mere electric guitars and synthesizers -- the original tools of Pink Floyd. Instead, what I got in this CD is a pathetic attempt to make the orchestra sound like a four-man band. Adding insult to injury, they chose to include vocals and chorals to stupidly intone snippets of the original Pink Floyd lyrics in between the inane orchestral passages -- the effect is of someone humming a tune without quite recalling all the words. Extraordinarily mediocre."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hardly symphonic.","review":"This CD suffers from the number one ailment of most symphonic tribute albums; it is only symphonic in the loosest, most liberal sense of the definition.

When I took this blanket out of the package, there was a strong smell, and since it would be close to my head and nose, I washed it in warm water as it said. The blanket disintegrated like a buffalo molts all in my washing machine, and the smell was worse. There were pieces of blanket lining my machine. I left to do errands and my husband put it in the dryer so we could send it back, and the head ache and the dizziness I immediately experienced was incredibly intense. I thought I was ill, until I went outside, and then realized that whatever was causing my 'illness' was in our studio. The blanket continued to disintegrate in our dryer into blue fuzz. So now both of our machines were compromised....We had to vaccuum out with a shop vac.DO NOT BUY THIS BLANKET!!!!

I expected a fleece-like feel of softness. It is soft if you just touch the surface, but the fabric itself feels more stiff like a piece of foam. The edges of the blanket aren't finished at all, just like a piece of foam. If you gather it up, it feels stiff, even after washing. To me, this feels cheap and isn't comfortable.On the good side, I didn't notice any smell and there was only a little lint in the lint trap after the initial wash and dry of this blanket.

The new blanket I received is nothing like the previous two I own ... it is thinner than before, scratchy and unpleasant to touch (unlike the velour feeling of the previous ones), and a horrible chemical smell remains after washing. I was not comfortable breathing in the smell and loose fibers (which appeared after washing) all night while sleeping. The blanket will be returned to amazon.com this week.

This blanket is not plush feeling nor pretty to look at. If you are trying to buy the old velour blanket of times past, dont waste your time or money on this one.

I've washed it once and it came out just the same. LOVE it!! Subsequently I ordered a China blue version. The China blue is also a nice blanket but it is very different than the pink one. The blue one is substantially heavier, not as soft, and hemmed on all four sides, not just top and bottom. I prefer to have the softer version near me and will use the blue blanket as weight if it is very, very cold. But they're not the same, at all.The other thing I noticed since then is that these blankets consist of more like a foam layer, and if you have a cat or you catch the blanket on something, small chunks of the blanket can come off. This has happened with both of them. So it's not like a cloth blanket. Still, the pink is lovely (i.e., feels good close to the skin)."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice Blanket, Great Value","review":"I purchased this blanket for my daughter, and she loves it.

One of the best blankets I have ever purchased in my life. It is extremely lightweight like foam. It is very warm. It washes very well. I love it ! Nice color assortment. Good price. I had been looking for this blanket for about 5 years after I had slept in a hotel on vacation and loved the blankets on their beds. Could not find this blanket in the stores.

I bought the dark brown, and when I washed it the inside of my washer and dryer were completely covered in little brown fibers. Okay, it was the first wash, so no big deal. The thing is, about 10 washes later, the same thing is still happening, and most of my blanket is just a thin layer of foam, and not much fiber, probably because all the fibers went down the drain. Not only that, but after having this on my bed, I'll wake up with tons of brown fibers all over my white t-shirt, and anything light-colored in my bedroom is always covered in fibers from them flying around every time I move in bed. These are quickly moving out to the garage to be used as drop cloths when painting, because I'm tired of cleaning up after my blankets. By the way, the \\"Made in China\\" tag says to wash them every SIX MONTHS. Um, I'm sorry but I like to be a bit cleaner than that!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not White","review":"I purchased the \\"white\\" blanket and it is a definite yellow...not even a pale yellow.

You can really get into it, but don't try to jump right in, like I did! I didn't even know how to begin till I went through the tutorial, it is a must for first timers. Then I spent 2 days on the first game, really intense!!

Inside the box is a highly abridged manual that says on the cover 'complete manual on disc 3'. Well, no there isn't. I called the publishers support line and was told there were no manuals on the cd's and I should google it. The only thing I found was some pirate sites. Great. The publisher of this game is sending me to pirate sites for the documentation that should have come with the game. This is NOT a game you can understand and play without a thorough manual. Good luck with that."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sid Meier's Civilizations IV: Gold Edition","review":"I was very impressed with this game and so glad that it was designed to be Windows Vista compatible.

I have thoroughly enjoyed each and every new release. However, Civilization IV is, plain and simple, lame! I hate it. The interface looks like a little kid game and it just feels terrible. The tech tree is far too over-cluttered now. As soon as I developed a religion and saw the separate temples for each religion, I exited and uninstalled it. Too much can sometimes be a bad thing ... Civ4 has WAY too much going on now ... they should have just fixed Civ3 ... it's a shame ... a dedicated Civ Fan just walked away!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Giant Step Down","review":"I was extremely disappointed in Civ IV compared to Civ II and III. Civ IV plays extremely differently than its previous versions. Did Sid have a conversion experience because Civ IV seems to be all about religion?

We see alive prorate with much of it illustrated by Joseph Campbell himself.While we are in the process of viewing Campbell's discoveries we make a few discoveries our self. We see a different view of God and our relationship through today's myths.As usual the book is more in-depth but this presentation makes a good introduction to Campbell and the people that influenced his Hero's Journey.Joseph Campbell and the Power of Myth"},{"rating":"1","title":"Signifying nothing","review":"After all the shouting has died down, the truth is that Campbell's work looks great - as long as you're sufficiently young at heart that you cannot see how shallow his ideas are.This is a classic example of Western-style religious rebellion, especially in the 1950s and 60s - rejecting one's own traditions in favour of sanitised, homogenised, exotic Eastern teachings. It is romantic, defiant, and ultimately vacuous. Yet for many people, especially, perhaps, those with above average intellect, a flirtation with Campbell's work may be a necessary stage in their development - a part of their own \\"hero's journey\\".Though fun while it lasts, like all of Campbell's writing there is nothing here of any lasting substance. As Shakespeare so eloquently put it:\\"It is a tale, told by an idiot,Full of sound and fury,Signifying nothing.\\"It just takes some people longer than others to spot Emperor Campbell's nakedness."},{"rating":"2","title":"A torch in the dark","review":"At last there is someone who provides a solid basis for overcoming the schism between religion and the age of enlightenment. I have never seen a deeper and more detailed analysis of what religion and myth really is all about. Anyone who as a child of our age of science has ever asked the question: How come humanity has believed in such strange things as myth and religion during all its history, will find an answer in Campbell's books.Unfortunately there are still the ones like \\"Diogeneze\\"(a bit further down), who out of fear believe that reality can be grasped by a set of dogmas, and despise someone like Campbell, who tries to look deeper than that and get to the core of the conditions for our existence."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I had expected","review":"I am a huge fan of Campbell. That being said, I was a bit disappointed by this DVD. First, I thought it would be an in depth discussion of \\"The Hero's Journey\\". which is a truly important concept in my view. When I determined that it was more biographical (I should have paid more attention to the description), I settled in for learning more about the man. Although there were some interesting biographical scenes, the movie lacked focus as it bounced around between early years, an award ceremony, and lectures/seminars with student groups. I would have been happy with an in depth biographical study, or a concentration on the ideas in the seminars. A much better DVD is Finding Joe, an exquisite analysis of his ideas."},{"rating":"2","title":"new perspective","review":"Campbell unites the different concepts of all the world's religions into his philosophy, not favoring any particular one.

I really liked \\"Invocation of my Demon Brother\\", it's the film I heard most about and it was well made. The problem is that you have to listen to the commentary at the same time you watch the films, to gain any understanding. I found Anger's voice boring and I found myself fast forwarding the disk, looking for something exciting to focus on. The movies are just too symbolic for its own good. I've read so much about Anger over the years that I find it pathetic that for someone who practices magick, he can't perform an effective protection spell to avoid getting mugged in New York five times as he has said. He also has tax problems. Prosperity spells? I think there is more hype than reality in Anger's history, however I still find him an interesting individual. Just not his films."},{"rating":"1","title":"Frye's 2,500 Nursing Bullets","review":"I have been studying for the NCLEX for 3 weeks now.

It takes the bitter cold off and gives a warming location. Nice that you can run 1,2, or 3 burners on low, medium, or high for a variety of heat levels. Nice and solid mount on the bbq tank. Burns through the tank about as advertised, maybe 10 - 12 (guessing from limited use) hours or so on the high setting with all 3 burners on, scale down from there with the lower settings or less burners.The only negative I see is that once you start more than one burner, and want to go to a lower number of burners running, you have to shut the whole thing down and let it cool and then light the burner(s) you want.

I bought my Dremel because I had built some drawers for a chest of drawers and forgotten to route the dado for the drawer bottoms into the drawer fronts of four of the drawers before I glued them together. I was able to use my router to get cut most of the dado, but I needed the dremel to get the last 2\\" by the edge that my router couldn't reach. These bits and the little Dremel worked perfectly.I recommend the router bit set as an accessory to your Dremel for small tasks where your full size router won't fit.

When a future reader approaches this lovable little collection of bits and pieces of Groucho's life, he will be well served to remember Groucho's own philosophy regarding his cinematic career: despite the critic's urge to find some deeper meaning, the heart of a Marx brothers picture is pure, unfiltered fun.

Instead of those pages, the previous 30 pages had been repeated. Since the first copy I bought (not through Amazon) was so unsatisfactory (had extensive water damage) I feel chagrined that this copy is also unsatisfactory.As to the merits of the book itself, it is amazing that Groucho was a grade-school dropout.

Although he tells much about his early life struggle with poverty and vaudeville, Groucho is unwilling to reveal his later life honestly and so the last third of the book descends into funny stories and a comic routine, which really is neither funny nor autobiography. For a real honest autobiography, read Ragman's Son by Kirk Douglas."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Secret word IS Groucho","review":"Groucho and Me finally gave us a little insight into the thoughts of a true and unique comic talent. Today he is becoming forgotten, but for those of us who remeber or happen upon his work we discover a World of 1st rate comedy. In this book Groucho never seems to be giving much away, but we can read into this his great dependance on comedy as a way of life. For all he ever did was be funny, on the stage, radio, film, TV and in print. He was compleatly clued into humanity and it's absurdity, and it's on clear display here. Rather than bore us with dates and names, he knows the real pleasure in a read comes from the stories, and all his stories have many a good punchline! The dialogue crackles and you hear his voice in every line."},{"rating":"2","title":"Groucho's own voice","review":"This \\"autobiography\\" is largely anecdotal and is far from a scholarly study of the Marx bros. and their contribution to American cultural history. That said it is a rare opportunity to \\"hear\\" Groucho tell some hysterically funny stories and voice his opinions on a variety of subjects in the process. It is valuable as a document regarding the vaudeville years and the early days of Hollywood. So if spending a few evenings reading Groucho's musings isn't enough incentive there is something to be learned here as well. Groucho's writing style is very much like his public personna and he always goes for the laugh in every circumstance. After reading this I visited my local video store to rent some Marx Bros. films. The young lady behind the counter didn't know who the MArx Bros. were !! Either I'm getting really old or she should find a different line of work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Too bulky, not particularly sleek","review":"These things are huge - as in more than 8 1/2 inches from bottom to top.8 1/2 inches is big, bulky and limits the types of bottles you can use the produce for. For example, looking to use these in a bottle of Port - probably too long for that or most other liquor height bottles.Also does not fit tight in bottles without standard rims (like twist off caps).As far as sleekness, there is something to be desired here - they look very plasticy on top, again much bigger in person than in the picture - and the pink hue is more pronounced as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Attractive & affordable- a must have","review":"This set of wine pourers is a must have. They are so easy to use, look attractive and do the job. I gave this as a gift to a few people last year along with thePinzon Penguin Wine Opener Gift Set.

Highly reccomended."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor design for a pourer","review":"This was not as I thought it would be. I have another wine pourer which is one solid piece plus the stopper that fits in the top,(made out of stainless) This was a piece of plastic with a long piece that went into the bottle, how do you get the last of the wine out. You have to see it to know what I mean. Anyway I would not suggest this as there are better more solid ones out there."},{"rating":"1","title":"Eh. . .","review":"Well as much as I love everything that Kevin Smith is associated with this was not that funny and just over all boring.

If you are a Kevin Smith fan just borrow it from a friend and don't waste your money."},{"rating":"1","title":"a waste of time","review":"This film is a bit like \\"blair witch\\" meets \\"clerks\\".Unfortunately, it's the worst of both worlds. The film fails at having any sort of suspense or real drama, and at the same time fails to have any witty dialogue so characteristic of view askew's most famous film: \\"clerks\\".The story is razor thin and uninteresting. The characters, despite being played by those well known to Kevin Smith fans (e.g. Jason Mewes), are undeveloped and pretty dull.If you do insist on wasting your time, at least save your money. If you're a big Kevin Smith fan who just have to see this, go rent it - save your money for a movie worth watching twice."},{"rating":"1","title":"I Really Wish I Could Say It was Better","review":"I love Kevin Smith and all his View Askew films. This is not at that level. The low-budget style does not work like it did in Clerks. Besides Lee and occasionally Mewes, the acting is week and dialouge is messy and not as strong as a typical View Askew film. I went into this movie with modest expectations and really wanted it to be another View Askew classic but alas it is not.Acting: 3 star (Lee's charecter is quite good and he pulls it off nicley, but no other actors resenated with their charecters)Plot: 1 1/2 star (perhaps the poorest execution of a potentially funny story, just didn't match up)Production: 2 star (knowing they had little resources it wasn't bad, but still not even the same level as Clerks, audio is terrible)Overall: 2 star (I have to be firm but fare, I wanted it to be good, but it really wasn't)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Difficult to watch","review":"Even for the most diehard Kevin Smith fan, within the first ten minutes you are wishing that the audio boom operator had a clue."},{"rating":"1","title":"A novelty to own, at best","review":"This film is often billed as the \\"lost\\" View Askew film. Despite the production credit, make no mistake, this is not the kind of material you'd get from Kevin Smith.While it's kind of cool to own another movie that has all your favorite Kevin Smith alumni, this film has none of the clever dialogue or hilarity you'll be expecting. The plot is basically nil, and the entire movie seems a sad excuse to show people sitting around smoking copious amounts of weed.Jason Lee's performance is great, considering the writing he has to work with, but his then wife's performance (Carmen Lee) takes [her attitude] to a whole new level.If it's really cheap and you want it for the novelty of having the \\"lost\\" View Askew film, then go for it. Just don't expect to be entertained in the least."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Cemetery Information","review":"I work for a Cemetery District, and I have been purchasing DVD's about cemetery information to increase my knowledge.

For the price, I'll get another pair to keep in the shed.

I put them on in the morning to do landscaping, gardening, tile laying, household chores, construction projects, and painting. And 10 hours later, my knees are still ready for more work. I scrub them off each evening with a brush and soap and water. The strap wraps below the bend in the back of the knee which makes them so easy to wear. I even forget that I have them on. Mine are 3 years old and going strong with possibly 3000+ hours of use. Use good common sense for their use and cleaning and you should have knee friends for a long time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Are these even designed for women?","review":"The elastic is placed too far apart, for someone with a larger leg. Now, I'm not skinny, but I'm not a football player either. I'm about a size 16 and the elastic is designed for someone with larger legs. They aren't snug at all. I broke my ankle last week and figured scooting around on my knees would be easier at home to clean things, which it is. However, these keep flopping over and when I'm on ceramic flooring---boom! There's the pain because they are always slipping.If you get these, have a decent pair of safety pins to make them snug because the elastic is placed too far apart and seems to be designed for people with larger legs."},{"rating":"1","title":"For large knees only","review":"I was disappointed that the velcro straps on these pads have a very limited range, and are suitable only for large knees. I have an average man size knee, and these pads fit too loosely. Also, the felt lining inside the rubber is starting to peel around the edges after only five days of wear."},{"rating":"1","title":"Truly Awful","review":"This book is so horribly written that at times I had to wonder if the author suffered from some sort serious mental illness that inhibited any attempt at a rational discussion let alone a consistent sentence.

The music made me want to laugh when I should have been taking the film seriously. The synthesized music clashed HORRIBLY with the black and white film and the vocals took away from what was happening on screen. However, the music is not bad. In fact, I think it's very good music, but in no way does it fit with this classic film. The music is more what I would call an interpretation, meant to be listened to while thinking about the movie...

In this tape, the instructor guides you into the pose verbally, then says \\"repeat on the other side\\", and then nothing; she leaves you no time cues about when she's ready to move on to the next thing. This ruins the tape for all practical purposes. Also, there's lot's of useless advice like \\"be limber\\". And lots of flowery imaginative suggestions that are distracting and counter productive to emptying the mind of thought. Plus she doesn't give you enough time to develop those fantasies if you're inclined to do so. The two stars are for the beautiful photography and the creative mirroring of poses by the instructor's look-alike sister."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sparkly, lightweight , and delicate earrings!","review":"These earrings dangle about an inch below the earlobe and sparkle prettily as you move.

Handle these earrings very gently, though, as they are quite delicate."},{"rating":"1","title":"My experience","review":"I agree that this is a beautiful product; however, I returned these earrings not long ago.

The gears on my machine started smoking when used on just a regular whole wheat. Customer service tried to put it down to my technique and would not have anything to do with it.

To start with I didn't do much baking but when i did ( making Brownies or cakes) this was worth having and the money. Clean up is as easy as running hot water over it. Recently I have started baking breads and I have heard taht this model wasn't good for mixing dough. I have to totatlly disagree. This thing will need a 1.5 to 3 lb loaf from 5-30 minutes with easy. I am now making bread loafs from rustic, bagguettes, sourdoughs, and others, two to three times a week because of the ease of this machine.

It will not turn on (I have no electrical problems in my home, it's not the outlet, I've tried many). I've called KithenAid customer service and their only resolution is to take it to a local repair shop since I purchased 13 months ago (the repair shops have quoted me costs, just to look at it, not to fix it, that equal 1/2 of what I paid in the first place). After checking out a few other websites, I found that KitchenAid stand mixers have been performing very poorly over the last few years. I thought I would have this mixer for at least 20 years (since I only bake for special occasions and have used the mixer less than 15 times in less than one year of use). Beware of the limited one-year warranty, these mixers are not as reliable as the brand would have you believe."},{"rating":"2","title":"Kitchen Aid Mixer","review":"I have wanted one of these for a long time and I have not been disappointed. It has a lot of power and is heavy so that there is no vibration. The shield on the bowl is a great idea..cuts down on splashes.

ALL OF US LOVE IT , we ended up putting it in any small bedroom and, while it takes a few minutes for it to warm up a bedroom, it does fine , and we could get around 5 days of use before having to fill up the tank again.

You get the heating capacity you pay for, and this thing is simply wimpy. I use it in a standard 2-car garage which is finished and somewhat insulated, near Sacramento California in the foggy winters. It took 2 or 3 hours, at full on, to raise the temperature of the garage by more than 5 degrees. That was with a small fan blowing across it to circulate the air, main and side door closed, with 4 small screened openings for ventilation. The instructions clearly say to provide ventilation but don't say if it produces CO (carbon monoxide), so I'm going to get a detector.This model doesn't have an ignitor so get some matches or a handheld ignitor.Do not use near animals or children!!

I did manage to not freeze to death while working in a garage years ago in the middle of our wisconsin winters (-10* to -30*) with it while bundled up in lots of snow clothes though. I'll be going with a 35k btu convection style this winter and passing this lil guy along to whoever needs it.Pros-It's cheap.It kinda works.Did I mention that it's cheap?Cons-It makes things warm via infrared, not the area it's in, aka you move and you're cold.MOST of the heat heads straight up from it, not straight out.It's fragile, don't toss it into the back of your truck because you'll bend tubes/etc.If you live above the 40* latitude line, get something better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hey....

Inside this book we are bombarded with the same set of stale pictures from album covers, etc.. The description of Gate's playing method is shallow and ignores his e-form capo approach.

It's what I think of as Ice Cube's g-funk album. I say that because I think this was his answer to \\"The Chronic\\" and \\"Doggystyle\\". A few tracks I don't care for much, but the better ones make it worth owning. \\"Really Doe\\" and \\"Ghetto Bird\\" are both great, and \\"You Know How We Do It\\" is a cruising classic. \\"Bop Gun\\" is a sweet party track, because of it's length, and the fact that George Clinton is on it. I also dig the groovy \\"Make It Rough, Make It Smooth\\", \\"Down For Whatever\\", and \\"When I Get To Heaven\\". All on the mellow side. As for the bonus tracks, I don't think they're half as good as the bonus tracks on \\"The Predator\\", but with the remastering I'll take 'em. This is also another Cube disc that's heavy on the pro-black/anti-white thing, fyi. Still though, a must for bigger fans, others can probably stick with the \\"Hits\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"At the height of west coast \\"gangsta(g)-funk movement\\" this album was a let down.

Being an avid reader, I purchased the book and had it autographed. This was one of the wisest things I have ever done. I have found what I believe to be one of the best Louisiana authors in a long time. Mr. Sledge describes southern Louisiana flawlessly; the humid summers, the voodoo culture, the corrupt politics, even the lifestyle of the Vieux Carre'.

The original recording engineers were Bill Schwartau and Tom Dowd. I have a very revealing high-end system that clearly demonstrates the audio shortcomings of this album.

I liked her in the first book. But Ben deserves way better. I'm normally very anti-men because the majority of them are lacking. Ben is quite the opposite and any woman would love to be his partner.

Spacek and Gibson are both lovable, in different ways of course. Historically the movie is kind of flimsy. There are things in in it that could be the 1930s, other htings that are more like the 1980s and 1990s, and the blend is not convincing. We are sopposed to see a kind of merging of oppressed factory workers and oppresed rural folk, 'the people' against heartless forces that do not respect their dignity. Dramatically, the film works, especially the epic struggle against floodwaters."},{"rating":"2","title":"Melvin Gibson In A Stunning Departure From Stereotype","review":"The River was an unbelievable histrionic stretch for thespian Melvin Gibson. His complex portrayal of a struggling taciturn farmer required him to be absolutely expressionless, monotone, monosyllabic (lots of grunting) and emotionally flat throughout the entire movie -- and, by golly, he pulled it off like a real trouper. The essence of Melvin's performance in The River was this: He was acting as though he was NOT ACTING. He was, in fact, pretending to be that egregiously bland actor whose name I can't even remember (who starred with J. Lo in The Wedding Planner, Connor McMathews or something like that) and deliver a complete non-performance -- it was Oscar-quality, genius-level non-acting. Die-hard fans will recognize and applaud his relentless, painful efforts to similarly not do any acting in all of his subsequent films, but the fact is, Melvin Gibson's non-acting performance pinnacle was, quite simply, The River."},{"rating":"1","title":"Except for Spacek and Glenn","review":"As much as I enjoy Sissy Spacek, this movie proved disappointing. She and Glenn are excellent (so are the 2 kids) but there was nothing about Gibson's character that made me care and his acting is so dreadfully dull. The only chemistry in the entire movie existed whenever Spacek and Glenn were interacting. The scene where he tries to convince her that she could (and could have) done better was very well done.. is there a more \\"real\\" actress than Sissy Spacek? She is so believable in everything she does. Gibson's character is such a wimp. In the scene where the \\"scab\\" workers are leaving the mill and taking abuse (understandable) from the striking workers, I kept waiting for Gibson's character to take it for just so long before screaming out \\"I have a family too\\". He was pathetic. The happy ending with the family of four enjoying a wagon ride was too Hollywoodish. For a far truer look at farmers in difficulty, \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" has never been improved upon."},{"rating":"2","title":"heat last a long time","review":"These are the only patches we use for neck strain, cramps, or arthitis pains in joints.

Removal felt like taking a bandaid off of a sunburn (which to me is not as bad as being stung by bee's), I guess I'll stick with the hot/cold patches I've been using. Thank you seller for taking pride in keeping your customers happy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't waste your money","review":"The darn thing only made a bad thing worse. There should be a warning on the packaging: \\"On removal, will rip all the hairs off your lower back!\\" (That is if you're presumably male and/or have even the lightest amount of hair on the place that you position it.

I now have a nasty red mess on my lower back where the huge patch was.The patch came of easily because I used Green Soap to help it along.

I applied one to the back of my leg where i have hamstring and muscle pain. I left it on for 3 hours and never felt it heat up or anything at all. Finally, I decided to remove it and OUCH, the thing was nearly impossible to pull off! I thought it would yank off my leg skin along with it. Got no relief at all from these, just a giant red painful looking patch on my skin from the adhesive. I tried it again 3 days later and the same thing...

I had used another of the patches on my arm, did not have the reaction, but found the patch very difficult to remove.

They are much smaller, about 4x5\\" (guessing). They get super warm and last for at least 8 hours. I use them on my back/hip area. These \\"Hisamitsu\\" 10 pak patches from Amazon are ridiculously HUGE. I cut them to the size I need. But... they DO NOT get nearly as warm as the \\"american\\" Salonpas. I barely felt the heat and the heat I did feel lasted just a few hours. In addition, these large amazon patches do not stick very well. They would stick for a short while, then I would have to keep pressing it on.

To try and recapture the Boston magic through a compalation album was a nice idea but the true mojo that fire's the fan's cannot be cloned through an album such as this one. To apriciate the journey you simply cannot leave out a song such as 'Peace of Mind' and hope that no one will notice.

It was awesome! Huge paintings and a large variety of smaller portraits mesmerized us with his original point of view and paint handling.After exiting the exhibit, we went right back in again to look a second and a third time. I was also taken with the fact that David Hockney is alive today - a living master showing his work in a major museum.This DVD, David Hockney at the Tate, has Hockney walking around his major retrospective at the Tate, talking about his work. It is enlightening and delightful to listen to him discuss his work - from the earliest portrait of his father to his most recent work. How often do we get an opportunity like this? I was very much moved by this successful painter.A must-see DVD and a must-have if you are interested in hearing a master artist discuss and describe his work in person."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hockney at the Tate","review":"Hockney at the Tate is a CD available through Amazon.com.

I had my Mr Heater just over a year before I trashed it in frustration!!!!! It would go off for no reason and the many parts that make it function also make it susceptible to any little dust particle that may clog the system and there is no way to bleed the lines to get rid of air in the lines so you may spend quite a bit of time trying to get it to light.

There are a couple nits: if you use the 12' hose you must introduce the gas verrrryyyy sloowwwwwllllyyyy or it trips a pressure switch and you'll have trouble getting it fired up.The biggest nit from my perspective: good luck using the thing over about 5000' elevation. The oxygen safety sensor, while well intentioned, is so sensitive that the unit shuts itself off. Once it does that, good luck getting it re-started or to stay lit even if you thoroughly vent the enclosure or take it outside.

They are great for ice fishing, camping, power outs, anytime you might need some heat but you don't have a furnace. It took me a while to believe that I should spend more than $20 or so on a heater, but these things do kick out the heat pretty good for a small package. They are designed and built pretty well too.

I diagnosed my problem to be the regulator, not the control valve. The guy's statement about using a trap (filter) for 20lb tanks is incorrect. If what he said was true why isn't there a trap (filter) on every gas grill, outdoor heater, and any other appliance that normally uses a propane tank other than the 1lb tank? The reason for the trap (filter) is when the gas supply is delivered by iron pipe. Initially the pipe has oil inside it due to the manufacturing process and to prevent it from rusting before it is put into use. The viscosity of the oil is heavy so the trap (filter) collects this oil and later any scale that may occur from the inside surface of the pipe. Without the trap (filter) the oil or particles of scale could end up in the control valve preventing it from operating properly. If you use copper lines or a rubber gas line there isn't any need for a trap(filter)."},{"rating":"1","title":"Better off just burning the money","review":"If I had rated this product during the first season, I'd have said it was great.

The ad says you can use it inside and it used propane which burns clean. The small print says you need to leave a window or door open. It stinks of fumes and suckes up a single tank very fast. The heat does not radiate out but rather goes straight up. Not very useful anywhere.

We bought fuel from three different places and the same thing happened.Both units would run out of fuel on the small cyl. in about 3 hours. A 20 lb. cyl. would only last 3 days.If your trying to heat a small shop with this there's a fire hazzard if there's saw dust and if any type of air born sprays are used, such as paint, WD40.

I have found no need for the recommended filter and have had no problems even after prolonged use and long term storage of the heater. I use it regularly with a 20lb refillable bottle.

No way I'm going to run this in a smaller space with my wife and kids. Also, this unit has no fan so there's no way to circulate the heat the element is producing. I could hardly feel the heat a foot in front of the unit because it was all going straight up. Going to try to Coleman Pro Cat next."},{"rating":"2","title":"The purpose of the fuel filter....","review":"Once and for all, here is the purpose of fuel filter for this heater. When you use this heater with a remote tank & rubber hose, it is imperative that you always shut the tank off first & let the heater run until it burns off all the fuel in the lines. YOU MUST DO THIS EVERY TIME. If you simply turn the heater knob to the off position, what you are doing is trapping 100 PSI of propane in the rubber hose. When high pressure propane just sits in your rubber hose, it literally causes the rubber to leetch a light oil that is part of the chemical composition of the rubber. If this oil forms and you have the filter on the heater, the filter will catch it and seperate it from the gas. If you do not have the filter, the oil will quickly work its way into the heater & destroy both the regulator & control valve. The heater can be repaired, but these two components will need to be replaced."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed in altitude restriction....Above 6500'....","review":"This heater works really well for lower altitudes!

This is a excellent guitar, with rich sound that's easy to fret and easy to hold. The neck is thinner than other acoustic guitars.

This is a superb companion to WCATB, which was one of my favourite LPs of 2006. If you're a fan of 'cosmic American music', I suggest you get into MEC pronto. They seem to tap into something which is entirely timeless, channelling The Band, Neil Young and the aforementioned Will Oldham in equal measures to provide a deeply satisfying listening experience that references nothing in modern music and is all the better for it. The only downside is this recording is a mere 28 minutes long.

He soon gets caught between opposing clans of European and American vampires, giving Juan Padron the opportunity to spoof virtually every ethnicity he can think of. The sheer whackiness of it all, combined with the strikingly original animation style and hot Latin jazz soundtrack, keeps the stereotyping from offending most.

Once you combine it with train pieces and the road pieces which are 2x wider than train tracks, the set quickly takes over a whole play room floor. This is not a piece for a train table. One thing I didn't realized was that the train can go to the upper deck, but only if you have bridge pieces for it (not included).

They are faded and sometimes a bit jumpy. All that beautiful scenery I remember is faded yellow/brown. Like watching a 20 year old VHS tape. I would love to see this digitally remastered.

The potential for this film seemed good.It's already available on DVD here in the UK, so I hired it, and was only too pleased to be able to give it back. How anybody can rave about a film that spends two hours showing a bloke on a lawnmower, with NO comedy sub-plots, very little humour and a REALLY irritating tune that plays through the entire film, well, I guess I can understand why the mental health institutions are still well stocked.I also made the mistake of inviting my family round to watch the film (my father had expressed an interest) ...

How Disney could have bungled the marketing of this great film is beyond reasoning. It is rated G but is no more of a \\"family\\" film than \\"The Tigger Movie\\" could be considered porn. Children could never understand its deliberate pacing and complex emotional core of patience and moral responsibility. By the end of the film I was choking back tears and so moved I could hardly get out of my seat. Richard Farnsworth and Sissy Spacek give performances that make you remember what acting on film used to mean.

Especially suitable for older viewers or anyone with sensitivity to the process of aging."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Sleeper","review":"In the movie business, a sleeper refers to a film that is not well known, but turns out to be a great film to see. The story talks about relationships in the family. It is so uplifting to see the desire to become close again after a rift has occurred in the family. I loved watching the main character drive the lawn mower because I tried to picture myself doing that, and I don't think I'd be quite as brave. But he was determined to see his brother, and he did whatever he had to do to make it happen. My husband refuses to go to movies because he said he doesn't need to pay to fall asleep. We decided, however, to go with friends to see this incredible movie. I was touched to see my husband not only stay awake, but have tears in his eyes. It is my husband's favorite movie. I recommend it wholeheartedly. It'll make you feel good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Straight Up......","review":"\\"The Straight Story\\" is a fantastic mood generator, and David Lynch does an awesome job of casting a magical spell upon your soul as you melt in the breathtaking visuals of midwestern landscapes, and are soothed by the score of Angelo Badalemente. The acting by Richard Farnsworth is brilliant and heart-wrenching to watch (knowing he was in extreme pain while filming this, and then later taking his own life). The Straight Story is a mellow movie that is great to unwind and relax to. It's a peaceful journey with an important message at the end of the ride. Unconditional family love."},{"rating":"2","title":"The lawnmower man","review":"After his skewering of American suburbia in 1986's \\"Blue Velvet,\\" you'd hardly expect a love letter to Americana from bizarro director David Lynch. But that's just what we got in 1999: a G-rated slice-of-life telling the true story of Alvin Straight, an elderly man who traveled from Iowa to Wisconsin to visit his estranged, ailing brother--via riding lawn mower. As Alvin, veteran character actor Richard Farnsworth etches a fascinating portrait of a man in the twilight of life with the resolve of a pit bull. He also has one monologue about World War II that is more powerful than anything in \\"Saving Private Ryan.\\" Couple that with fine support from Sissy Spacek as Straight's daughter, and director Lynch has made a quiet triumph."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not For Everyone","review":"A dying Richard Farnsworth gives the performance of his life as the dying Alvin Straight--a simple (but far from simple-minded) man who wants to put right as much as he can, and take one last long look at the world, before he moves on. If that doesn't sound like your cup of tea, then it probably isn't--this is the kind of movie that you really have to be in the mood for, and for which some people never are. I happened to see it after a tough week of work, struggling to fix things that really shouldn't have been my responsibility and dealing with duplicitous managers who seemed to spend most of their time shifting blame. This gave me a wonderful sense of relief from my own stupid little problems, and some perspective about what really is important."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you have no room in your life for sentiment","review":"you might as well be dead.

I recognize these people. They aren't fancy pants Hollywood stars made up to look like midwesterners; they're genuine, the neighbors, aunts, and uncles that I grew up with.The pace could be called slow, but to me it feels serene and peaceful. It's a calming balm after a day of fast-paced west coast life, like a trip back home to remind me of who I am."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Real Gem","review":"This movie came recommended to be by someone who in my opinion wouldn't have had the brains to appreciate it! I'm grateful to him for turning me on to one of the most perfect little gems of a movie to come along in years. I rank it right up there with THE STATION AGENT, another quiet, small picture with very little plot and oh, so much heart and soul! If you like a film that takes its own sweet time to unfold, letting you come along for the ride, then get this one. If you're looking for car chases and gunfire and special effects and all those other big-box-office necessities, then stay away and leave this for those of us who value beauty."},{"rating":"2","title":"What a story!","review":"The acting is superb from everyone abd especially Sissy Spacek.

Usually G-rated stories do not have much depth or complexity, but this one most certainly does. My whole family sat through the entire movie and thoroughly enjoyed it. Of course, it helps that Richard Farnsworth is familiar to all of them, having starred in another family favorite, the Anne of Green Gables series. The kids even asked that we buy this movie, which I plan to do, Lord willing. Highly recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"A different Lynch movie, but well-worth watching","review":"One of the most inspirational movies in recent memory. Lynch takes his time telling this true story of a man who rides his lawnmower across several states for one last visit with his sick brother. Why a lawnmower? Because he's almost blind and this is all he's got.Lynch lets the story unfold slowly and some may be put off by the lazy pace. \\"Why isn't anything happening?\\" was a frequent complaint I heard. I found the pace a welcome change from the MTV-style editing that is so prevelant. Straight Stories' slower style is a perfect parallel for the mower's crawl across Midwest America. Lynch lingers on shots and fully develops his protagonist while also tossing in some strong supporting characters. Farnsworth should have won an Oscar for his multi-layered performance. The ending is a bit weak after such a long build-up, but there is a certain poetry in the last shot. Give this unconventional story a chance, you won't be disappointed."},{"rating":"2","title":"Encouraging True Story","review":"We enjoyed the true story very much. Heart rendering and encouraging but very slow moving. Only a 4 star because it was slow to watch."},{"rating":"2","title":"its possible","review":"the theatrical and artistic aspects of this grand movie enhance a very deep story line. the slow seeming pace of action, the intimacy of conversation,the straight across acceptance of the characters for each other,all give us a look at that elusive goal we all seek of peace in our lives. this is not being still or inactive, but having peace with our history,, life and yet being still on the journey with whatever is at hand. this portrayal reminds us that life is indeed a school and if we learn the lessons we can achieve a sense of self that is beautiful, is powerful in its effect on others and will result in transformation in many ways wherever we go. thanks david lynch."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poignant and Moving","review":"In my book this is an excellent movie, but one you just have to relax into and let unfold. The movie isn't so much about Alvin Straight as it is about the people he meets and how they interact with him as he slowly journeys to see his brother. I think it's one of David Lynch's best movies, but one for which the average Lynch fan will probably walk away shaking his head. Nothing much happens and a lot happens. The things that happen have to do with how people see each other and how they change. Richard Farnsworth, who was old and sick himself, plays with great dignity the old and sick Alvin Straight. If you watch this movie with an open mind, I think you'll be affected by it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"A few weeks ago my 18-year-old son asked me if I had ever seen a movie about an old man who drives his lawnmower on a long trip to see his brother before he dies. I said it sounded vaguely familiar but no, I couldn't recall actually seeing that movie. He said he had watched it on tv late at night and it was about the best movie he had ever seen. Last night, it was on again. I had to stay awake until after 4 AM to see it, but it was worth it.

It's one of those movies where you wonder when it's going to pick up. But I feel it never does.It does have a nice story line. And I think my Grandma would enjoy it, because it's nice and simple, and not too fast. I didn't find anything original in it, though.

Sissy is good, yes, but she plays a marginal role--generally we see the road, the man, and his machine. with background music of course, which dominates the entire film--largely because nothing else is going on. the dialogue seems trite, sometimes beyond corny, and the best thing about the movie is that the long lost brother ends up being stanton. besides that, if you are prepared for a movie in which 2/3's of your time will be spent looking at the broken yellow lines of the highway, as well as a man sitting on a lawn mower looking straight ahead, then you at least know what's in store."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing content","review":"I saw this Movie on Television when it first aired and I loved it.

It's terrible!Whoever this Guetta character is, he CANNOT make decent dance music. What he's done here is, basically, just sampled the line \\"We can be heroes just for one day\\" and repeats it all the way through the track ad nauseum and beyond! And, worst still, it barely mixes cohesively with the extremely tacky, simplistic beat.Trust me on this: Nobody really needs this for their music collection, Bowie fans or otherwise. It's pathetic and yet another example of the latest \\"big name in the world of club DJs\\" who are just a load of hype and have little to zero creative talent.DAVID GUETTA HAS KILLED A CLASSIC!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This record sucks","review":"Reviewer from Germany is right.

I found the geography somewhat hard to follow, though. Ged was very well drawn, and the conversations between him and Tenar were satisfying. I was a little disappointed at the ending--what became of Tenar? And am I the only one who entertained hopes that the two would marry? This is a good book. It has a very unusual haunting quality, and if you don't remember the plot a few years later, you remember the mood."},{"rating":"2","title":"Too strange for my traditional fantasy likings","review":"I thought that this book was great, the only let-down was the minimal magic usings and mainly featuring Arha, who for me, was not nearly as fun to read about as the bright spirited Ged, Vetch or the other super-interesting characters from book one. Don't get me wrong though, I loved this book!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stands alone","review":"Perhaps the greatest testament to LeGuin's abilities is the fact that I was profoundly moved by this book as a child, and until about 15 minutes ago I never knew it was the second book of a trilogy. A dark and sometimes brooding book, its mood and characters have stuck with me well into adulthood. It's a powerful little story about isolation, loss of self, fear of adulthood. Mythically and metaphorically it addresses the horrible passage from the relative spiritual freedom of childhood to the often overwhelming moral and social burdens of adulthood. It ends with an earned and mature freedom from darkness, and an understanding that all of life is a journey. This book stands alone, but I can't wait to see what the other two parts of the trilogy are like. If you have a child, particularly a daughter, niece, etc., entering into a difficult passage of life, this book would be a great gift."},{"rating":"2","title":"could be better","review":"I found this book to be rather dissapointing. Ged from the first book really only played a minor role in this story and the main charecter tenar is droped at the end of this book and mentioned in no more than three lines of the third book. I did find it a nice story though but it seems to throw the focus and disrupt the story from the first and third books which I found to be much more enjoyable."},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge letdown to a somewhat promising series","review":"After reading Wizard of Earthsea, I was interested enough to continue with the second book in the series, but just barely. My hat goes off to anyone who can get through this short, yet mind-numbing book. I see now why it took LeGuin so long to get her first novel published. Her endless, run-on sentences are often totally devoid of any real meaning or interest, and leave you only with pain and regret for having invested time in this series. Do yourself a favor and cut your losses by not starting this second installment.Try George R. R. Martin's \\"Game of Thrones\\" or Julian May's outstanding Saga of Pliocene Exile for some truly rewarding reading in this field."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ellison not on tape.","review":"I ordered this tape specifically because Harlan Ellison was listed as a reader.

Because the tape was not as advertised, I am returning it to Amazon and I am requesting my moneyback."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't put it down!!","review":"As a faithful lover of sci-fi/fantasy, I found this book irresistible. I read it twice in the course of 24 hours. Ursula LeGuin's vivid description of Arha's dark life as The First Priestess, her inner struggle, and finally, the underlying hints of what she feels for Ged, the young wizard who rescues her, all make for a can't-put-it-down plot. It would be great for teenage readers who love a good fantasy (like myself). I highly recommend it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"tombs of atuan: not as good as expected","review":"The Tombs of Atuan was not as interesting as I expected it to be.I wanted a good, exciting, action-packed book, and the second book of the Earthsea Cycle trilogy didn't do that for me.it was exciting at places, such as in the labrynth maze. but all in all, i wasn't impressed.the story line was great, fresh, and original, but Ms. Le Guin could've presented it in a better form. the order in which the events happened wasn't exciting. it wasnt like a book that i couldnt put down, such as the Pendragon series kind of realistic fantasy. i read the wrong book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Through the tomb and a short beginning.","review":"The story takes place after few more adventures of the mage, Sparrowhawk, who is already known as the greatest wizard and only Dragonlord of all Earthsea. He travels to the north east and enter the scared realm of the Tombs of Atuan, where the Darkness lies and workshipped by the people. Sparrowhawk plans to steal the greatest treasure hidden in the tombs, however, a young priestess called Arha hesistates to stop him... and kill him.Overall the story is well written and a great ending as the first book of Earthsea, but it is not as exciting and thrilling... Due to the many chapters of long descriptions of the sacred rituals and temples. Everything is very slow until the mage enters the story. But it is still worth reading and complete the Earthsea Trilogy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Epic fantasy for all ages","review":"The Tombs of Atuan is the second volume of Ursula K. LeGuin's \\"Earthsea Trilogy\\". Although I recommend reading the first volume (A Wizard of Earthsea) first, you may find the Tombs of Atuan to be both understandable and enjoyable by itself. It focuses less on Ged/Sparrowhawk than the first book did, but he plays an important role in the second half of the book. While volumes 1 and 3 are global in the scope of the protagonists' epic travels, Tombs is much more local - taking place almost entirely in a complex of underground caverns. Its difference makes it a breath of fresh air as far as epic fantasy goes. The overall theme of the trilogy is that of fighting the darkness within oneself and becoming a whole person - a bit like the Empire Strikes Back. Recommended for fans of Lord of the Rings, Harry Potter, Forgotten Realms, and books by Terry Brooks, Michael Moorcock, and Stephen R. Donaldson. Adults and children alike can appreciate this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"on audio","review":"The Tombs of Atuan is very different from A Wizard of Earthsea. It focuses on a young woman who has spent her life cloistered in the tombs of gods who she serves but doesn't know. Just as the reader feels completely miserable at the state of this disillusioned young lady, Ged (who nobody would describe as particularly cheerful or up-beat), arrives and brings with him a much-needed ray of sunshine, even though he spends most of the book under the earth. After Ged's arrival, things start to slowly make more sense to Tenar and it is interesting to watch her well-developed character gradually move from darkness to light.This is a slow-paced book. There's not a lot of action until the end, but Ged's quest in the tombs is related to the rest of the Earthsea series, so it's valuable in that sense. And, of course, an Ursula Le Guin is always a pleasure to read and this audiobook version is very good. --FantasyLiterature.net"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book, even better series","review":"I first read the original Earthsea trilogy over 20 years ago, and it has stood the test of time. If you like your fantasy with action, this will not be your cup of tea…but LeGuin is a master and a unique voice. The best part is that the books keep getting better and more moving. If you read and enjoyed Wizard of Earthsea, you need to read this one to continue Ged’s story. Read this so that you can get to Tehanu, which I think is one of the best books ever written about the nature and meaning of love."},{"rating":"1","title":"Broke after using it one time","review":"I bought this for my son for Christmas.

There is way too much repetition in the book, almost word for word describing the actual events of the murder. WE GOT IT THE FIRST TIME!

Now the live stuff - The arrangments are decent but they won't blow you away. Don't Bring Me Down, Boom Boom, Don't Let Me Be Misunderstood are played well but I'm Crying just didn't get it.I've seen Eric Burdon and the Eye Band and the New Animals who turned out to be the same band. I'm not sure if that is who is backing Eric on this album, it sounds like the same crowd to me.If the energy that was put into the studio cuts carried over onto the live cuts I would have given it a higher rating.

In mid-cut, I felt the tool jam. Examination of the blades showed that the cutting edges were deadheading against one another and had created a razor sharp burr of metal. At this point I stopped using the shears.Fiskars needs to improve their hedge shear design to resolve this jamming issue.If your Fiskars jam I recommend you call their warranty line at 1-800-500-4849. I did, and a new set of shears are being sent to me, free of charge.

Three times they jumped a tooth and I had to take them apart to realign everything, then after another 5 minutes of use they slipped again.

I bought this model at Home Depot thinking it would last me forever. I live in a new home and my shrubs are very small but were needing some minor trimming. I was using these shears for about 10 minutes and all of a sudden they would not close all the way. I thought maybe a small branch was caught in them. When I looked at the blades there was a slight groove/nick on each blade and they were biting each other. As another review wrote, the blades are too soft or something. I took them back to Home Depot (having just bought them like 30 minutes earlier) and got the cheaper Fiskars shears. I finished the job with the cheaper shears with no problem."},{"rating":"2","title":"Saved me the hassle of buying an aftermarket head unit with Aux. audio imput.","review":"Saved me the hassle of buying an aftermarket head unit with Aux. audio imput.

That is how interesting this work is. Not only does the text provide valuable conceptual clarity, but also exercises for students to help them along the road (God help them!) from research to writing the ethnographic report. Also of great value is the attention the author gives to writing as method: both in terms of writing up fieldnotes and the final report. Students need to grasp the importance of writing within ethnographic research. Dr. Goodall (I think they call him Dr. Bud) provides! I plan to use this text in an undergraduate class on the sociology of everyday life.

The Fiskar's saw was exactly like the Chinese made generic bow saw's sold at your chain hardware store for about $7.00, the only difference being that the Fiskars name had been added, right above \\"Made in China\\". In my opinion, the idea that this product is built to last a life time is laughable. Held together by flimsey rivits that, even though new, looked ready to fall out. When actually using this product, it felt as flimsey as it looked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointed in Fiskars","review":"I picked this up because Fiskars normally makes high quality products and therefore is a respected brand, and also because it was very inexpensive. I expected high value from this saw. Instead I got the quality I'd expect from a no-name Chinese saw. The worst part, as others have mentioned, is the rivets. They seem delicate and flimsy, like they would break or fall out over time. I may replace the rivet that holds the blade with a bolt and wing nut. This one will get the most stress and I don't want it to break while I am out in the bush.I am actually embarrassed to use this cheap saw. Fiskars is normally a great brand and I love many of their other products. This one is low quality and I am highly disappointed in Fiskars."},{"rating":"1","title":"cheaply made","review":"This saw cut easily, but after about 2.5 months of moderate use, the little tab that hold the blade tight snapped off. This piece is not replaceable.

I should have examined this saw before I bought it instead of just looking at the brand name. The blade is held in by a little rivet and it fits like a mistake on the assembly line.

They are so simple and lame, it seems Silkk slapped them together in 2 minutes. ie. \\"All Because of you.\\" \\"MR. 99\\" and many others that I can't remember because nothing on this album is worth remembering. 2 stars for It aint my fault, and the Snoop Dogg song, because Snoop is immortal.

MISTER P IS PRETTY CRAZAPPY AS WELL, THOUGH. I CAN SEE WHERE SILKK LEARNED HIS INFERIOR SKILLS. IT'S A SHAME, THEY'VE EVEN FOUND A WAY TO DIMINISH THE SKILLS OF SNOOP DOGG AT NO LIMIT. I THINK SILKK'S STYLE IS REMINISCENT OF A 2ND GRADER IMITATING PUFF DADDY. NO LIMIT USES THAT STAGGERED DELAY EFFECT TO TRY TO STREGTHEN SILKK'S FLOW BUT IT JUST ENDS UP MAKING HIM SOUND LAME. A LARGE PART OF THIS IS THE RUSHED PRODUCTION SCHEDULE OF NO LIMIT. THIS ALBUM WAS OBVIOUSLY HURRIED, AND BELIEVE ME- IT SHOWS. IF YOU WANT TO HEAR A GROUNDBREAKING CD PICK UP OUTKAST'S AQUEMINI OR GOODIE MOB'S STLL STANDING.

His second effort fails to live up to the standards set by its predecessor.Packed with appearances from Master P , Jay-Z, Snoop Dogg, Mya, C-Murder and Mystikal, Silkk is often lost in the mix. What is missing is the intensity displayed on Charge it 2 da game. For example, there is no soldier anthem, and even the guests are dissapointing.A few good tracks like \\"Somebody like me\\" with Mya or \\"Southside playas\\" with big bro C-Murder can't save the album. The entire thing seems hasty, as if it has been thrown together in a single day.This marked the collapse of P's once invincible empire. Most of the original soldiers jumped ship and P's releases went virtually unnoticed by once die-hard no limit fans. These days P is trying to re-build the empire he created 7 years ago.

As usual on this cd, Silkk shows that he has absolutely no skills on the mic. Also exposed is the Beats By the Pound crew for their lack of originality. No Limit certainly was a lot better when they weren't releasing 5 cd's a month, all with 20 or more songs.

(It's not my favorite style, but in the hands of actual, talented rappers like OutKast, it can be cool.) Silkk, however, just stumbles all over the track at random without any meaningful flow or syncopation. It's embarrassing.His previous album at least had some half-decent production. Not this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"Could Get An Award For The Worst Rap Album Ever","review":"I never felt Silkk the Shocker, and don't think he has any skills. I'm not a hater, I just tell the truth. He raps for a few seconds, takes a break and raps again.His lyrics is bling bling and stuff you heard 100 of times before from Cash Money. And the beats is very weak. It doesn't fit the \\"rappin\\" at all.I mean I don't think No Limit is talented either, but they do indeed have something. But Silkk on the other hand might be one of the worst rappers ever. The only reason he sold was 'cause No Limit was hot back then.Mase and even Loon is 10 times better than this.Stay away and buy something by those who deserve it.AZ, Nas, Cormega, Rakim, KRS-One, 2Pac and Mac Mall will get your money well spended."},{"rating":"1","title":"BOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO!","review":"This CD was horrible and I pity anyone that buys it. True story: I personally threw it out of a car and it was run over, and I really didn't care.

The origional Batman The Animated Series had unmatched design and style. It seems that Bruce Timm and Pual Dini have gotten lazy while basking in their success. The \\"New Look\\" looks like a half effort; sloppy. Batman, once one with the shadows now struts about in full veiw, his once huge cloak wrapped about him (Looking very cool) now hangs limply from his back. Superman seems slow witted and unaware of his potential, using one power at a time, instead of an effective combination of strength, speed, invulnerability etc. Not to mention the fact that he is battered back by mere bullets. Growing up with Batman The Animated Series, I expected a better effort from Timm and Dini. Stop hiding behind more violence and explosions and turn out some quality work, guys. Thanks for your time"},{"rating":"1","title":"Violence on Women in a Warner Brothers Movie?!!?","review":"Unbelievable that Warner Brothers would produce a \\"Family Entertainment\\" movie that includes violence on women.

It's all about personal prefrence!!! John, do everyone a favor and DON'T WRITE ANYMORE REVIEWS.On to THIS review... I just watched this movie this past weekend and LOVED every minute of it, although the overall experience leaves you wanting more. I continue to be amazed at the quality of these DC comics animated movies and shows that they keep putting out. Also see Batman Mask of The Phantasm; Sub-Zero; Mystery of the Batgirl; as well as Batman Beyond, and the Justice League movies (plus a few more titles), ALL GOOD, and highly recommended, however some are better than others."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Batman Superman Movie","review":"On Amazon's site, when viewing the product details are written in language that the DVD features the audio in Portuguese (Dolby Digital 2.0 Stereo), but this option does not exist.

My husband and I both found the story line to hold our attention and be entertaining, and our son was instantly addicted. I especially enjoy how the characters seem to be more adult than their 1970's conterparts, without being too grown up for kids to identify with their heros."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good compilation, but legitimacy of CD is suspect!","review":"This is generally a good compilation of Dickey Lee's hits; unfortunately though, several of the songs on the album (including his most famous: \\"Patches\\") are only in mono, even though they were originally recorded in stereo as well as mono (one wonders where the manufacturer got its source materials). The sound quality is somewhat less than perfect, but certainly acceptable for songs originally recorded around 40 years ago. My main concern with this album, however, is whether it is LEGAL. Although labeled as an \\"import\\", there is absolutely no information on the jacket or CD with any sort of address for the \\"Blue Tulip\\" label, no copyright dates of any kind noted anywhere, and no UPC code--which makes me suspect that this album is virtually a \\"bootleg\\", and that poor Dickey Lee (actually: Richard Lipscomb) is not making a dime off of this!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not a single - 30 great tracks","review":"This is a full length CD of all his great pop hits.

I've used the various tools to clean electrical contacts and car battery poles and watches while changing batteries, and the rotary sandpaper is perfect on the dog's nails. I gave it 4 stars because it could have included a brass brush (which I bought separately) and they supplied only one polishing compound which produces a high luster finish, but not a mirror finish. I recommend testing each tool on something out of sight or of little value before using it on anything good. But, if each tool in the kit were bought separately, it would have cost 4X as much. All in all, it's a very good deal.

With that info I would never find a venue. This book only taps the surface on how to set up and run this type of service.

You really can effortlessly cut anything that fits in the jaws. The negative side is that the jaws are flimsy and separate sideways. On small 1/4 twigs they don't cut, they just wedge between the jaws. On large branches it cuts through everything except the last piece of bark leaving the two pieces still joined. The whole point of the loppers is to cut through branches, and when it leaves the pieces connected with bark, or wedged between the jaws, it doesn't do its job. I even tightened down the pivot bolts hoping this would hold the jaws together, but that didn't work either. I don't care how powerful it is when it doesn't make the cut. I am returning this and buying a different brand."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best lopper on the market.","review":"I have used other loppers before and nothing can compare with these.

There were several scenes throughout the book that were not realistic and others that were incredibly boring, such as the entire first chapter which focused on Hammond's trip to the SGC. Do we really need to know Hammond's history? There were also some blatant mistakes such as Carter being referred to as a Captain and a Major in the same chapter. I hope that they find a new author to continue this book series because McConnell is not doing the show justice."},{"rating":"1","title":"Somewhat disappointed","review":"I am a HUGE fan of the Stargate Sg-1 TV series so I eagerly await the new novels but I feel that although Miss McConnell seems a very capable writer and does her research, she does NOT capture the characters of the TV show well at all. They all seem a little too different to me. She focuses on one little thing that is popular about each character and repeats it over and over. I agree with one of the other reviewers that they should get someone else who KNOWS and understands the characters better to pen the Stargate books!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Nice Info, Not Much Action","review":"I learned things I've never known about NORAD and I really liked seeing how the fictional SGC worked in conjunction with what I assume is real info about NORAD. McConnell's clearly done her research. The characters, as with all of her SG books, ring true, but the late-story action comes off as second banana. The aliens this time are Bug-eyed Monsters reminicent of 1950s s-f and the final event feels a bit contrived. McConnell's writing is smooth--as is her speculation about what could happen if the Gate was exposed felt realistic. If you adjust your expectations, it's well worth the read."},{"rating":"1","title":"Dissapointing first read","review":"I have always been a massive stargate fan from the beginning, so expected this book to be something it isn't. The actually story needs time to take off and then this is ruined by the blatant flaws. Sam Carter seemed to change rank three time on the same page and you can't quite decide which team is coming through to block Morley (SG-3 or SG-9). Even the smaller characters changed rank. I think the business with NORAD sat on top of the SGC was just silly, McConnel should have done a lot more work before trying to sell us this."},{"rating":"2","title":"wheel kit is great","review":"This is a great wheel kit that's strong and easy to install.

I couldn't find what I wanted locally, so went on line and decided on the Supermat after reading reviews of several products. This has been a great buy. The old treadmill sat on concrete in the unfinished basement, but with this mat under the new one, it is completely silent upstairs. This is a blessing! The mat is not as thick as I thought it should be to muffle sound, but it does the job! We are very pleased. Quick (expensive!) delivery got it here before the machine was delivered and set up, too.

I never cracked a book in high school or college unless the exam was taken from it or unless it was written in a user-friendly style. Although I have a Master's degree in Social Work, I have not had the opportunity to study Jung individually and in depth.

These could include thorough, not dismissive, consideration of Jung's strong leanings towards Naziism; his sexual relationships with his patients, including some who may have been in psychotic states; the real question (ask before you go into analysis!) of whether even Jungians believe in the 'collective unconscious'; the issue of large numbers of Jungians who practice psychology in North America without psychological training. Until such questions are answered or at least seriously engaged, as they once were (see titles by Stern on JUNG, THE HAUNTED PROPHET, or anything by Richard Noll), I feel that we are engaged in a sleigh ride over a snowfield of superficialities and--to be blunt--market-share building for a fringe movement capable of some good, certainly, but also of much serious damage."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great show, very informative, will be handy for son's education","review":"My husband loves history so this was a perfect Christmas gift for him.

The History Channel really missed a great opportunity with this video."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good series, a great introduction to the book","review":"I enjoyed this series, it is a typical History Channel presentation, more just a basic overview and rote knowledge, but that's ok. I think it is a great introduction to this time period in American history, and I wish I had seen the series before I read Ellis' companion book, I would have had been able to bring that prior knowledge into the reading. The series is well done, I just have one complaint, the actor who played George Washington! Washington was a striking individual in life, the actor who plays him here, well enough said. I wish they had gotten the actor who played Washington in The Revolution, he looked more the part. Oh well, this is a minor complaint."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surface Material","review":"If you're 12 or under and you'd like to see a rudimentary telling of the early years of United States history, this is the DVD for you! Completely skipping over the ratification of the Constitution, this two-volume series jumps right into the first presidency of Washington from the Declaration of Indpendence. If that doesn't sound skant enough for you, it completely skips Madison's presidency, while devoting about 10 minutes to Hamilton's duel.

And when the sound does come in stereo it's quite hollow and lacking the richness and depth I know my headphones normally produce.

Yet, I found this story engrossing, despite the cliches. The characters are a mixed-up group of whites who grew up in Africa and expatriates from Europe who live and love in close proximity. The setting in Nairobi and in the bush of Kenya gives the book a fresh feel. The characters are either simple or tortured, yet they are an interesting lot."},{"rating":"2","title":"An Engrossing, Well-Written Romance","review":"If you read Rules of the Wild as a literary work with deep philosophical meaning, you will be disappointed. The only conclusion reached at the end of the novel is some vague highly romanticized circle of life stuff. But if you read Rules of the Wild as the romance novel it is, you will love it and will not be able to put it down. Esme is a totally convincing character and so are some of the other characters in the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Highly recommend this book","review":"I picked this book because I was interested in the idea of a single woman living in modern Africa. I have never lived or worked outside of the USA, but know people that have and I have always found that fascinating. The story started off slow but it kept me interested. Then near the middle I got rivited. Marciano became very insightful and there were several well written passages describing the character's revelations. I also liked that she kept asking \\"Why?\\" She showed many sides to Africa that I did not know, and has got me interested to find out more. I loved the romance angle, and how her friends kept questioning her and her decisions in this. I also like how she and those around her are not perfect, and is ready to admit this. I also like how she is not afraid to change her view on people and things and actually sets out to do so. And above all you can see that she holds the beauty and nature of Africa above everyone and everything else."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bright Lights, Big City Set in Africa","review":"This is a terrible book about petty, self-absorbed people who go around feeling cool about living in Africa. The high point is when Esme gets pregnant by a guy she likes, kind of loves. She suddenly feels she has a purpose in her life (we were wondering since this is half-way through the book). When she loses the baby, she is sad, but more than anything miffed at her ob/gyn for snubbing her. The best thing I can say about this book is that it makes the most ordinary of us feel profound and heroic for taking out the trash compared to these cardboard cut-out characters. The editorial reviews were very misleading. One reviewer compared Ms. Marciano to Jean Rhys. Anyone who has read The Wide Sargasso Sea would consider that a howler."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rules of the Wild","review":"Boring. Reminded me of the Bonfire of the Vanities only set in Africa. And it only seemed like Africa from a concocted movie set. The characters were soap-operatic. Esme, the main character had all the other characters telling her how deep she is and yet her actions throughout the book are sophmoric. The idea of juxtapositioning the raw nature of Africa against the violence of the humanity that actually occupies Africa as home is what drew me to the book. But not enough description of the beauty as well as not enough explanation/focus of the political events. Only the drivel of drinking, drugging, sex, and unreal dialogue of the white privileged class."},{"rating":"1","title":"Who needs men?","review":"I thought this book was disgusting.

And it gets boring very quickly. If you're looking for insight into the human condition (isn't that why we read fiction?), forget it. We don't even get insight into the annoying and shallow stick figures that the author tries to pass off as characters. Not for a moment did I ever care about one of them.If you're interested at all in white people in Africa, read Peter Godwin's \\"Mukiwa: A white Boy in Africa.\\" It's non fiction; witty, charming, insightful, entertaining, and you'll feel that you learned something."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Days of our Lives in the African Bush\\"","review":"Although Ms. Marciano has a way with a phrase here and there, this book is irritating in its pseudo-political correctness. While her character rails against the First-Worlders who never bother to learn anything about their African neighbors, she herself limits most of the reader's contact with them to servants and \\"wise natives\\" who work on her car! The main characters are trite and two-dimensional...oh...and don't forget incredibly beautiful and endowed with talents I never quite learned to appreciate! Who would want to know any of these people...longer than the one-night stand, at any rate??"},{"rating":"2","title":"A MUST read","review":"Captivated by the book within the first few lines, I read the entire first chapter standing in the aisle of the book store. I could not put it down and upon reading it, reread it a second time. The book does a marvelous job of weaving the tale of Esme's love life together with the tale of white's in Africa. The intricacies and pure honesty of the characters not only draw the reader in but are tantamount in their truth. Anyone who has ever been in love with either a person or a place can identify. \\"One had to learn to love without feeling safe and secured to the ground, to accept being cast into the darkness, where no one knew what it was going to be like, at that dangerous place where the winds meet.\\" Marciano does a beautiful job of manifesting the beauty of not only Africa, but of love and one's struggle with identity as well."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rhetorical questions sink this one","review":"When Marciano sticks with the rules of the white society in modern day East Africa, she's on: her writing is toned and honest and it's loaded with rhythm. When she aims for the true meaning of romance and attachment, her prose falls into one rhetorical question after the next, and the grace of her language fails her. The reader never sees the whys and hows of Esme and Hunter falling in love; the reader is only pounded with the endless chat about how wonderful this phantom love is.As a writer, Marciano should have trusted her instinct and written the compelling story of contemporary East Africa. She should have left the painterly instincts behind, because as she needlessly aims at Dinesen territory, and even as Esme soars through the air in a small plane towards the end of the book, the reader is reminded not of Marciano's story so much as Dinesen's unparalleled prose that so perfectly captured the region over fifty years ago."},{"rating":"1","title":"SHOULD BE RETITLED RULES OF MARKETING","review":"That a reviewer would actually dare compare this vapid \\"Melrose Place in Africa\\" with a book like The English Patient shows how desperate the state of publishing is. Is the reviewer trying to get the film rights? This is sad drivel. If you want a good romantic read, choose the English Patient. Already read it? Read it again. Save your time, money, and intelligence. Marciano should write travel articles with a romance twist for Cosmo."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful!","review":"Shallow, narcissistic characters living directionless lives. A disconnected sequence of events that cannot be called a plot. An ending that introduces loads of new information and doesn't jibe with the established motives and substance of the characters.

Guess I finished the book out of sheer determination."},{"rating":"1","title":"oh no, not another, I'll do anything for my man book","review":"Please. I realize in the western world genocide and starvation are minor in comparisons to a car breaking down, or god-forbid a hangover. I found this book insulting.

I can't afford to have an opinion or a job or a reason for being in Africa, but the reporters are soooo good looking.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Very enjoyable","review":"Even though I may not quite qualify this as literature, I enjoyed this book very much (especially after reading a string of bad ones). I love books about Africa, always had a fascination for Kenya and read Blixen, Hemingway etc so I was delighted to find a new, more modern one in that vein. The characters can be frustrating at times but the story is interesting and it's the first time I ever see mention of the genocide in Rwanda in a book of fiction. The dichotomy of the ex-pat is well expressed also, when a single country and culture can no longer feel entirely like Home."},{"rating":"1","title":"Raw land, raw emotions. . .","review":"While a bit too much like a soap-opera for my taste, the descriptions of emotions, landscape and culture of expat Nairobi made this book worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thoroughly Enjoyable","review":"\\"Rules of the Wild\\" is romantic, lush, descriptive, and a little maddening. Marciano's style takes me right back into Nairobi, and aptly captures the feeling of being a foreigner there. At the same time, Esme's imperfect character, so fully portrayed by Marciano, makes the feminist in me want to reach into the world she lives in and help her get over her desperate need for companionship. The irony and symbolism in the book are captured by the emotions it evokes in me. Somehow my feelings for Esme parallel my feelings for Africa: affection and respect, mixed with frustration and futility."},{"rating":"1","title":"Leaves much to be desired.","review":"The promising premise and beautiful marketing of this novel are not ultimately fulfilled. Instead the reader is forced to experience contemporary Africa through the eyes of a selfish, pathetic Italian woman whose constant complaints about white priviledge never transform into a coherant critique of either whites in Africa in general or the main character in particular. Her dependancy upon the men in her life and her melodramatic reaction to her own bad choices do not make her endearing but annoying.

This gives author Marciano the opportunity to make nasty anti-American remarks about the people who go on safari. Esme cheats on Adam with a journalist who is assigned to cover the massacre in Rwanda. Marciano digresses from the main plot and goes on about the situation in Rwana which has nothing to do with carrying the characters or story along.

I think someone should come out with a DVD with the complete series on it, also with the origional japanese on it, including dubbed americain for when your eyes hurt and are too tired to read, but overall I am dissapointed, I rated it accordingly with the content, 24% of the show (about 1/4) so 24% rating (about 1 star) overall if fox or anyone decides to release the full season in dubbed and japanese subbed, I would buy it in a heartbeat, but this I will not buy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sorry it's bad...","review":"Sorry, to say this but this anime series it's bad, it's boring,not intersting, it has horrible and a very cookie-cutter likeanimation, this is definetly the worst anime series that ToeiAnimation had bought us, by the way to all Digimon haters, if you wantto hate even more digimon, check out the spanish dub, ....

Unfortunately the writing doesn't hold that strong through the story but it starts strong enough to carry the story through to the end. This was probably the better of the books I have read in the series and one I enjoyed more than any of the others.But Cam seems less real in this story and the sisters more separated. And I struggle some with Sersee and reality of her character. There seems to be an issue also of poor continuity between characters in this book and prior ones. There personality's don't seem to be consistent. But still I liked this one.Although there is a lot of threats and fire breathing at the end I found it a little weak and the characters unreal.

We really liked the one we bought for our son a year ago and bought another one for our daughter. I like the color selection. The only complaint is that food gets caught in the seat and it can be diffucult to clean after everymeal. I would recommend this seat to any others out there. This was my 4th booster seat I purchased for my son. The only one that I was happy with. My children's sitter also has these booster seats and she loves them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Doesn't work with all table tops.","review":"We can't use this at our table!! Our table has a support that runs along close to the edges that drops the clearance by about 3 inches. This is not a problem when you are sitting on a chair but when you use the booster seat there is only an inch or two for our son's legs to fit through and it will not work. I guess this would be a problem with any booster seat but still - it would have been nice to know. So the booster seat we bought is sitting in the living room right now and getting no use whatsoever. We can use it at our outdoor table which has a tabletop that extends out past all the supports but at this point our 20 month old would rather sit on a regular chair even if his shoulders barely clear the table. I think I will just use a phonebook when he needs a boost."},{"rating":"2","title":"Seat is better than the others!","review":"I own 3 of these chairs and use them instead of high chairs.

My only omplaint is that the latches sometimes get stuck but the tray still locks into place so it's really not a big deal."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cheap piece of junk","review":"I bought this seat to travel with my toddler and found it extremely annoying and difficult to use. The tray stuck and never loosened up and was difficult to get my child in and out of. Also, it was close to impossible to keep clean, unless you unstrapped it and took it completely apart after every use. It was very unwieldy to travel with. It folded up, but didn't stay together and so was not very portable. Because it was so cumbersome, it ended up getting dropped on a laminate floor and promptly broke. The cheap plastic its made of shattered at the bottom corner where the side and seat fit, so now it is in the garbage where it belongs. I only owned it for five months and used it barely three times a month for the average. Yes, it was cheap, but as they say, the poor man buys everything twice, and now I'm out fifteen dollars and have to buy another booster."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great booster seat","review":"This has been a great booster seat.

I will be buying these beans again! The beans are kosher, in case it is helpful to know that.The Garbanzo Beans are a fantastic value for this excellent quality product. The beans are organic. They are very low in sodium only about 100 mg for the entire can of 3.5 servings. They are also much softer and flavorful then other brands I have tried. They are lovely on their own, eaten one bean at a time as a snack. This particular brand is excellent in hummus.

I was expecting a mediocre documentary based on the quality of the cover which is my only gripe here. With that out of the way, this has by far some of the best nature cinematography on film that rival's the nature series Planet Earth, Life. This series takes you to the African Serengeti, Botswana, Alaska etc. I liked the fact that this series has much more African Serengeti animal footage, than Planet Earth, and Life combined.No nature series is ever complete, or as exciting, without the African wildlife experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing nature","review":"What a series to watch.

However, there's not that much new in here, though there is a greater effort spent in linking the event to how it affects the different species. Would have liked to see new events, such as the butterfly migration in America; right now, it mostly comes across as material that's been done before. Still visually stunning, but not particularly new."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is cool","review":"This is cool. I have it. I have 11 of the BBC nature series blu rays. Visually amazing like the rest but this one has sweet content. It has all this wild stuff that happens in nature. Like when sardines migrate, sharks come and these diving birds that swim and then fly again trying to get the sardines. There's also these birds that live on this ledge for a month a year to raise their new babies. Then the babies have to fly off the cliff. If they don't reach the ocean, then foxes eat them.The good thing about this one if that it's a gripping narrative. Some nature shows are just like, \\"check out this sick forest\\". \\"Yo isn't this a cool looking reef?\\" This one tells a story of fascinating wildlife behavior.Great audio as well."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eye-popping great masterpiece of nature at its core!!!","review":"What the title says, is what it delivers in your TV screen. This is how you'll see how small you are compared to the Circle of Life in Earth, so small, that as the designated guardians of our home planet, it IS fragile & needed to be taken care of, not to be abused & corrupted for greed of money or of power purposes only. These nature's events should be expected not go extinct for our own sakes & survival of our planet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very cool, but not Planet Earth","review":"Overall, I really like this set. I don't have problems with the packaging as mentioned by others, and I really like the behind-the-scenes that are included behind each episode. The photography is amazing, and I love getting the whole picture of each story instead of jumping from place to place like Planet Earth did (although that was part of what I loved about that series too, so go figure).My only problem with this is that several times throughout the episodes the shots are blurry--almost like they weren't shot in HD.For the price though, who can beat watching the mother seals trying to protect their babies from storms, or the humpback mother supporting her baby over their long trek, or the thousands of mating dragonflies, etc., etc. A great addition to your collection!"},{"rating":"1","title":"NOTE: NOT IN A BLUE-RAY CASE, it's a low quality card board carrier.","review":"I wish Amazon would warn people up front and in bold textthat the item mentioned is in a non-standard case, especially\\"eco-friendly\\" cardboard carrier.

Doris Day is perfect as Calamity Jane as she thinks that even a cowgirl can get her ways, too. Even though she tries, she can't get her \\"secret love\\" Bill Hickcock (Howard Keel) out of her mind.

They sure don't make them like that anymore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Musical of the 50's","review":"This is the movie that made me fall in love with Doris Day and Howard Keel. It was so much better than Annie Get Your Gun where Betty Hutton sang to herself or to the last row in the audience. There was so much chemistry and great songs. The Black Hills song is great and I thought all the songs were meant for Mr. Keel and Ms. Day. She was great in both \\"characters\\" and he is my hero! A must have."},{"rating":"2","title":"A VIBRANT DORIS DAY.","review":"The infamous Martha Jane Canary - otherwise known as \\"Calamity Jane\\" - was in reality a morally \\"loose\\" woman who looked rather ugly and dressed like a man (Doris Day she wasn't!). However, this film was meant to be a fantasia on Canary's life, and the result is a thoroughly delightful movie, with a youthfully beautiful Doris Day energetically doing bouncy numbers as both a tomboy and, later in the film, as a \\"lady\\". The music score, which was supervised by Ray Heindorf has Keel and Doris sing the pleasant BLACK HILLS OF DAKOTA and Day was never more radiant than in her singing of the AA winning song SECRET LOVE. Filmed in vibrant Technicolor, this thoroughly fun confection was given first-rate treatment making CALAMITY JANE an amusing classic Western-Musical for viewers of all ages to enjoy time and again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Whip Crack Away, Whip Crack Away, Whip Crack Away","review":"Filled with the excitment of songs you'll never forget, a whole new generation can discover this family-loved classic! Doris Day plays one of her best roles ever as Calamity Jane; a wild cowboy-woman who roams the West. She doesn't need no man...until love blooms when least expected. Check this movie out if you like those old fashioned tales with good morals, good music, and bad bad guys."},{"rating":"1","title":"Calamity Jane","review":"My movie does not play because apparently it's a Region 2 PAL disc. Am I the only one in the world that didn't know what that means?

Most of the songs are great sing-alongs and will end up sticking in your head, \\"The Windy City\\", \\"Take Me Back To the Black Hills\\" etc. Sure the whole thing is hokey (and don't think that any of it has any real historical accuracy)but it provides some fun entertainment."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the............","review":"I ordered this movie set after looking for it on DVD for so long.I was excited to finally get my hands of my own copy of Calamity Jane and as an added bonus, I would be getting My Fair Lady and Seven Brides for Seven Brothers.True Hollywood classics!!!Not only did I have to wait a month for my order to come in, but I recieved the wrong DVD.To be fair, they did apologize and give me my refund without question and quickly.

(The albums were never released in CD format, so this is the next best thing). I'm sure it was hard to pick the 10 songs which would make the cut to get on this CD, but they did a fairly decent job. The problem is there are many more than 10 great songs between these three albums, so some of them are missed.Hard Rock Cafe was a charting single from Simple Things, so of course it needs to be here. Other selections are very melodic, reflective, and inspiring. Main Street is pure fun.My only suggestion is that you may want to purchase the newer 'Two for One' CD, which combines this one with \\"Pearls\\" -- the early 80s album where Carole went back and recorded some of her biggest hits from the 60s that she wrote for other artists with her then-husband Gerry Goffin."},{"rating":"2","title":"WONDERFUL!","review":"This book is a must have.

The translation is a particularly accessible one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Translation of a great work with really sorry notes.","review":"Dorothy Sayers produced a wonderful translation of this work. I confess I do not read Italian, but her translation is fashioned in wonderful verse attempting to recreate the original poetry. She has created a fun and enjoyable book from a brilliant piece of religio-political commentary. I withheld one star for Sayers' notes. She is a strong moralist who, while commenting in her introduction that Dante refrained from hitting his readers with hammers, opts to use the notes as her own hammer to bang home her own, very conservitive morality. I would that there was an edition with her notes edited for the modern reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Supreme Version","review":"Well,I just had to write this since reading Hell and Purgatory.I used 3 versions.I read both books using the Sayers and Mandellbaum version.The sayers version is the BEST of all version,especially the notes.The Sayers notes and her commentary is the finest,and trying to view this book from a christian point-of-view,her notes are essential to any reader.Now,I will say this,the Mandellbaum version is not as beautiful as Sayers,but it is more literal.You get a better view of what is happening.So...I would reccomend reading the book from sayers and mandellbaum together.Or get some Cliff notes,to get a literal version.But...you absolutley need the sayers book,at the very least for the commentary and notes,or you'll never know what truley is happening in the book.Yes!...the sayers version is christian,and non-compromising,....but what do you expect?Its a christian book!If you want a humanist secular view get any other version."},{"rating":"2","title":"Book is for the more theologically minded","review":"The book is a classic, and for those who are willing to spend time going through the explanations that follow the poem's text, it's an interesting read. In his poem, Dante comments on church history, theological topics like free will and determinism, and makes what were then scandalous comments about how there was corruption within the papal system of the time. It's tough to read, but if you are patient and interested in allegory on purgatory, it's for you!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A second to \\"Scent\\"","review":"Having lived abroad in Asia for 4 years, I have enjoyed Butler's \\"A Good Scent from a Strange Mountain\\". The fact that the author lived, ate and spoke among the natives effuses throughout his books. So my disappointment couldn't have been greater when I picked up this book. The action, which the author wants to depict as breathless is listless and the characters come across as pathetic and pitiful when they should be portrayed daring and poignant. As his earlier work, this novel confirms that the author only got better with age."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Accessory","review":"I use this with a small propane heater to keep my boat cabin warm during winter fishing.

Even though these only cost me a couple of bucks, I regret making this purchase because I could've bought something of a better quality for less.I use these to apply toner. They begin to tear as soon as I apply friction and rub the pad gently against my face. These pads are quilted, and in-between each section of cotton is thin paper that, when wet, tears extremely easily. It's like they made these pads not knowing that people would wet them with a substance and rub it against their skin; that's what cotton pads are for! At the end of the day, they do get the job done, but it's annoying trying to hold a shredded pad together as I'm trying to rub it against my face to apply toner.

The spare tire holds the weight well, good balance, etc. I'd give 4.5 stars but the system doesn't provide for half stars; or 5 stars but for one thing. I only felt 80% safe with the provided attachment hardware, worried that it might pop off over a rough road. I tied it down with a little rope and we're all happy. The hardware holding the bikes to the rack is well-designed; holds the bikes firmly yet with fast release."},{"rating":"2","title":"Super easy and sturdy for '99 CR-V","review":"I purchased this after reading many reviews here on bike racks. This rack was only $79 (!) and it works like a charm. Easy to mount on tire and doesn't budge once it's on. Based on recommendations on Amazon I also bought the Allen bike adaptor for my womens commuter bike and it made loading that bike a breeze. I also racked my daughter's old Schwinn banana seat bike - could have probably used an adaptor for that too (had only ordered one though!) but tilted it and it worked fine.

I initially thought I would have some problems with the lower anchors but managed to find two places to hook them.

The carrier itself takes less than five minutes to install and folds up to fit in a closet when not in use."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very easy but be careful!","review":"I bought this bike carrier and overall I like it. It's very easy to put on and take off and holds the bike easily enough. The stirrups that hold the bike are on the small side, so if you have a bike with a frame that's wider in diameter, like a mountain bike, you will have to buy a tension bar for it. Also, it doesn't come with any padding on the lower part that rests on the spare, so it has put some scratches on my wheel. Also, the top part that goes behind the tire should be more padded. It's taken off my paint in that area. Just be sure to rest it on some padding or try to position it so it's not touching paint."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Rack for 2008 RAV4","review":"There aren't many spare tire bike racks that fit a 2008 RAV4, but this one works great. I've taken several trips with no problems. The rack is easy on and off, and holds 2 bikes very securely. I'm not sure about 3 bikes - might be a tad heavy for the RAV4 spare tire mount. Be sure that the lower mounting straps are attached to the RAV4's frame, not plastic trim.I chose to deal with two small fit issues, but you might not. The left side of the rack is very close to the wiper arm - I flattened the rack slightly with a hammer at that point for more clearance. The bottom of the rack rests on the spare tire - I slipped pipe insulator over the rack at that point to prevent scratching the rim.Overall, a great rack at a great price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good rack.","review":"Works great with my 2011 Jeep Wrangler.

But I have done several trips and no lost bikes yet!I just fold it up and put in the back when I am not using it. It says it holds 3 bikes, but it seems like a tight squeeze. I have tried it with 2 adult mountain bikes and it just seems to fit fine."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Quality but doesn't for","review":"I purchased this because many people had luck using it with their toyota rav4. I have a 2012 rav4 and this DOES NOT work with the spare tire. I took the cover off, but the windowshield wiper prohibits it from sitting on the wheel fully.

The \\"bottom foot assemly\\" (lower piece in product photo that has a yellow sticker on it) is bare metal, and designed to rest against your (aluminum, chrome, etc) rim. Bad idea in my opinion. Yes it seems to hold the bike well, but rim will be cosmetically damaged in the process. I wrapped the contact point in sports tape to avoid damage to spare tire rim, but seems like a mickey mouse solution to an obvious design flaw."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy and effective","review":"This rack has a bar on top that rests between the car and the tire and a bar in the middle pressing against the tire and a bar on the bottom also pressing against the tire as well as 2 straps on the bottom which you secure to something metallic on the bottom of your vehicle. I had a RAV4 and this rack worked just as I wanted it to.It was really easy to set up - and equally easy to take it apart and its relatively compact so it doesn't take up much room in the closet. I bought it because I was moving to a different state. It carried one adult road bike about 750 miles over hilly terrain and going speeds of 60-80 mph. I checked it every time I stopped and it was still secure.

I have a 2008 Wrangler with the upgraded alloy wheels. The bottom of the rack sits directly on the wheel, its metal on metal. I probably should have noticed this when I installed it but I followed the directions and removed the tire cover. The vibration of the rack against the wheel while driving etched the wheel very badly and wore the paint off the bottom of the rack. There was nothing in the instructions that warned of this possibility. I destroyed a $600 wheel. I would not recommend this rack for the Wrangler or any other vehicle with a large diameter wheel."},{"rating":"2","title":"12 yrs old and still using","review":"I've used this rack on my '98 jeep wrangler with 30x9.5R15 tires for 12 yrs.

The first time I used it, it fell off the spare tire and both of my bikes were damaged.

There are no ajustment for the on the carrier to make it fit different size tires.

My tires aren't over-sized, but this carrier still didn't quite fit as it was advertised.I never felt safe driving my Jeep on the highway carrying my bike on this thing. The nylon straps unbuckle quite easily -- which is not what I was hoping for. And, you can't leave your bike on this and run into a store -- there's no way to lock the bike to the carrier or the carrier to the spare tire.The carrier doesn't hold the bike far enough away from your spare to keep it from rubbing on the rim or tire. And I had to place some rags between the carrier and the tire where it touched or it would scratch up my rim, as well.I used this carrier for a month before replacing it with a Yakima SpareTime bike carrier, which offers security locks and rubber strap downs.Kinda feel I wasted my money on buying this one first.

It takes some care. Removal was easy and folded up compactly.My Trek 7200 womens bike fits well and I didn't have the bike tire overhang problem from the CRV spare offset because my bikes' fork angles inward toward the car folding it neatly. My daughters 16 inch frame was difficult because I had to balance it in the rear fork and the front. She'll be growing into an 18 in frame soon which should fix this problem.I didn't take it for a spin yet, but I think for normal driving conditions this will be fine compared to my Trek sedan trunk rack (for my old Neon.).

The rear windshield wiper is in the way while installing. The spare tire is recessed into the door and there is not enough clearance between the tire and the door to get the rack seated securely. The rubber bumpers on the top hooks are not long enough to prevent the door from being scratched by metal. The cross bar in the middle rests on the outer part of the spare rim and scratches it. There is no place to securely attach the tie down straps. The rear door cannot be opened if you secure the straps under the door. There was no easy way to secure the straps around the spare itself because it is recessed into the door.

The instructions say to clip the hooks onto a metal edge under the rear bumper... well, there is nothing metal under there to clip those hooks onto. So the alternate instructions say to hook them at the bottom of the rear door, so I did that. The rack seemed pretty secure, so I closed the door. The rack still seems secure... but then I open the rear door. The metal hooks come flying off the rear door at a high velocity hitting my leg and taking off a couple chunks off of the bottom of the rear door. So not so secure afterall.

I can't get an adult bike mounted on the spot closest to the tire.Note, if you have a RAV, you'll want to hook it to the metal under the door, not to the bottom of the door that is plastic.

When I placed my bike on the middle rack slot, the entire rack came right off the car. Also, the straps that hold it to the bottom of the car are not very secure as a means for supporting one bike - let alone the three this can supposedly hold. I have returned this item.UPDATE: As I went to send my package back I see on the back of it that it says it was not mean to fit my CRV. Amazon should really post it - the back of the box is really vital info when making this purchase. it doesn't fit many SUVs at all."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for Honda CRVs","review":"I bought this thinking it would be perfect for my Honda CRV, which has a spare tire on the back. It even indicated it was for my car on the package. However, when attempting to set it up, instructions indicate to attach it to the metal under the bumper. But, there's no metal to attach it to...the CRV has a plastic bumper, and crawling under the car, I saw no way to attach it. Guess I will have to get a permanent mount type instead. This one was a waste of time, and I returned it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent Buy","review":"I ordered this bike rack on a Sunday afternoon and it was delivered on Wednesday.

If you keep turning the crank while the illuminator is on one of these settings, the light levels are greatly increased.

Anyone inspired by Theli or Vovin-era music from this band, will certainly be grateful to see the return of some of the earlier elements with this new cd. The variation in vocals from brief Death Metal to classic 80's metal crooning to the odd but hypnotic vocals on Lemuria (can't quite place what era you'd put this guy in) from the same vocalist and drummer from the Theli cd -- this cd has it all. I've been listening to it for over a month now and still am impressed with how well it ages. Only Theli and Vovin had the same impact. There are a few songs that could have been left out, but overall I'd say that 19 of the 23 are solid.Buy this cd if you are adventurous or just like excellent music, these guys deserve more credit than they've recieved -- I hope this cd does it for them. Hat's off to Nuclear Blast for actually promoting this one..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bland, dull, uninspiring","review":"I like Therion quite a bit. Perhaps not as much as I have in days past, but they are still up there. That said, this album was a complete bore to me. It lacks the sheer depth of Deggial, nor is it as interesting and catchy as Secret of the Runes. Absolutely nothing stood out for me at all. If you like Therion, you will probably like this album alright, but it just doesn't cut it for me, I'd much rather pop Deggial, Theli, or even Vovin in the CD player than this one. If you are looking for a first album from Therion, Theli would be better if you want something faster paced and heavier, and Deggial if you want someting slower, more dramatic, and darker."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good stuff","review":"I was so happy to finally get this CD, I was waiting for a long time.Anyway just to be breif... it's a terrific album, it blows my mind.Therion is different than your mainstream bands, but you won't be dissappointed if you're looking for a different kind of metal."},{"rating":"2","title":"Two great albums albums in one.","review":"Lemuria and Sirius B, while being sold together, vary somewhat musically. If you are new to Therion here is what you should expect: symphonic metal with different vocalists in each song. Also keep in mind that Therion has a whole orchestra on its side from which they pull vocalists into their songs.Lemuria is the heavier album of the two and offers more emphasis on the guitar work. Sirius B has a lighter touch to it and has a higher focus on vocals (the vocals on Sirius B are mostly from the orchestra that they use).There is not a bad song on either of the two albums and I would recommend you to get this if you are a Therion fan or want to have an introduction to the band."},{"rating":"2","title":"everyone should listen to this album!","review":"There's not many scenes as closed-off and inaccessible as the metal scene, and as such it may seem like a foreign, weird world to non-metalheads. But there's some great, great music that virtually everyone can enjoy. This album is one of those - it's just an amazing piece of work, stunning, beautiful. Everyone should listen to it, whether or not they are a fan of metal. There's not a whole lot I want to say about it, its better to hear it than hear about it.

The original is nowhere to be found on the cd. The original single, which I once owned but had stolen, is an amazing CD. The one I received is okay if you're looking for remixes.

Again, this is one of those films that won't work for you if you've only grown up on typical Hollywood fair. This has it's own tempo and visual language. It's best viewed with an open mind. Trust the filmaker and relax and enjoy/learn from this documentary. At times its touching, sad, enlightening. This isn't just about people surviving as scavengers. That's some of it, but it's also about people making art from left objects/trash, and some have philosophical views on the waste our society produces. Also, I really enjoyed the asides about the filmakers aging. There is an elegiac thread woven through this, a homage to aging which is both somber and clear-eyed.

Otherwise a very enjoyable read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Story Worth Listening To...","review":"This is a very good book. Ms. McMillan has researched it carefully and diligently included Marina's views on Lee and their relationship. The reader gains by seeing inside the mind of a determined assassin. It fails in terms of an over-emphasis on the psychological makeup of Lee Harvey Oswald and in the memories of Marina that occasionally conflict with the facts of the case. It is, nonetheless, a worthwhile read (unless you believe in multiple gunmen, CIA hit men and space aliens on the grassy knoll).It is definitely a well written book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just awful !","review":"What can you call a woman with a Bryn Mawr education who makes fun of a 10th grade drop out from the south because he, like about half of the other people from his socio-economic background, mispronounces the word \\"ask\\" as \\"axe\\"...?

And one who knowingly and for profit perpetrated an indelible stain on an American tragedy, and further muddied the waters for future researchers.And unlike contemporary audiences of this unfortunate work, the modern reader now has access to the knowledge that both McMillian and her husband have been exposed as known CIA assets and propagandists.This book is a good way to waste 6-8 hours of your life that you can never get back, is based on what the writer knew to be bald-faced lies, and is presented in an insultingly smug manner.

There's very little one can do to ensure the type of Infused Animite that one gets from a battle. Battling to gain experience is difficult when one needs to move on to the next area to level up fast. The single energy battle system means one cannot use up a creature's special attacks and expect survival. Fortunately the inns are free. The story line feels bland at some points. For someone who is good with strategic battling, this might be worth a look. But for true RPG fans, its either to dull or too frustrating.

He really does bring out the point that Iran is like most progressive democracies; in fact, he points out that the country has everyone in the political spectrum, from communists to monarchists. From reading the book, I do think that he has ambitions to be the leader of Iran. The only weakness that I find about the book is that he seems to be an advocate of a constitutional monarchy instead of a full blown republican democracy. But his basic point was made in the book; democracy has never been given a chance in Iran and it should be and the clerics should go back to their places of worship. It's very well written and should be read by anyone interested in reading about the political situation in one of the largest countries in the Middle East."},{"rating":"2","title":"This excellent book shows us the way","review":"As an Iranian citizen, I have read both persian and english version of this book a few times and have sent the book as gift to many of my friends simply because this books shows us how to fight the good fight against the clerical regime of Iran and it also tells us why the struggle must continute.Crown Prince Reza Pahlavi is a good man with a good heart and intentions and I believe this book explains a lot about his highness's dream about a free and democratic Iran.

Need I say more?Well, ok. Let's not forget that this individual has been since childhood educated in posh swiss schools, and he has actually spent only a small portion of his life in Iran. And that he has been living it up in the US since the revolution, preoccupying himself with such crucial endeavors such as indulging in 'haute cuisine', thanks the the billions daddy stole from the people of Iran, while refusing to even lift a finger to contribute his share and improve the lives of millions of Iranian expats the world over.As for the book itself, what a waste fo time!!!

The \\"dynasty\\" goes back to his grandfather who ousted the centuries old Qajar dynasty and crowned himself Shah. Up until then, he could barely feed his family. Reza's father, the late Shah, went hungry as a child, but he made up for it by ripping off the Iranian people for millions when he wasn't busy brutally suppressing dissent.What Iran needs is a good constitutional government that separates Church and State and separates judicial, executuve, and legislative powers of government."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nonsense","review":"The son of a has-been overthrown tyrant and third-world tin-pot dictator has found a new song-and-dance about human rights and democracy as a convenient and transparent disguise for ambitions of power and a return to the throne."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Wind of Hope","review":"As a Pakistani, I am very concerned about what is going on in my region.

These is no \\"Pahlavi dynasty.\\"Nonetheless, the author of this book about democracy puts an imperial seal on his web site. His mother calls herself an empress on her web site. She has no royal blood; neither did her husband, the shah, who was ousted for being a tyrant. Her son, Reza, the author of this book, gives interviews saying that Iran may not be ready for democracy, and if asked to be king, he would do his duty - he wishes!In light of his public stance, his writing of this book is cynical pandering in an attempt to gain U.S. support.

Every game contains an idea, but there is no advice on state of the art (back in 2004) for that line.The book design is quite poor, games moves are not visually apart from the comments (yes they are written in bold, but difficult to distinguish from the rest).There is a rich bibliography, but not a variation table.Compared with books like \\"Play The King's Indian\\", by Gallagher, or \\"Play the Nimzoindian\\", by Deering this book is a waste of paper."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best, and most frantic, of the entire series","review":"Volume 4 is definitely the best of all 5 volumes currently available of Ayumi's non-stop mega mix collection, Ayu-Mi-X. Volume 4 goes in a far different direction than any of the other in the past have gone: 18 of her greatest tracks, and each is a combination of up to 6 different producers and DJ's interpretations. So, in actuality, each song is remixed by up to 6 people resulting in a frantic hour-long mix that's sure to get you up and moving. Styles of the mixes included vary from trance, house, trip hop, breakbeat and even hip-hop. Some remixes include: Junior Vasquez, Johnny Vicious, Keith Litman, Thunderpuss, Hex Hector and Jonathan Peters. Songs include: Evolution, Trauma, Endless Sorrow, Surreal, Vogue, Dearest and Appears. This release also contains a second disc that includes the full-length versions of 7 of the mixes included, including: Dearest (Jonathan Peters Mix), Still Alone (Warp Brothers Mix) and Dearest (The Implication Dub Mix)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Time to mix the mixers!","review":"This NSMM album took an interesting turn. Instead of having individual remixers work on each track, many of the tracks are remixed by multiple artists! Some of the songs will sound quite familiar - since this album goes under the guise of \\"Selection Non Stop Mega Mix\\". For example track 12 starts as the Thunderpuss remix of Surreal from NSMM3, but quickly diverges to include several other remixers (I don't have their names offhand). Similarly, they use a mix of Junior Vasquez's \\"Appears [Junior appears on the air] mix\\" (as seen on NSMM2) as part of the bridge to \\"M\\".As with all other AyuMix NSMM CDs, there center few songs are slow, and detract from the overall great dance feel to the disc, which, is why I gave this a 4 instead of a 5."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thought Provoking","review":"This was one of the best series on World War II that I have ever seen.

After they did the graveyard classics ACDC thing I kind of gave up on them and figured that Chris Barnes was just fading away into redundant lameness. Then they released the album 13 and I was really impressed with the brutality of the songs. Now with Commandment, Six Feet Under prove that they are far from washed up and still have plenty of Deathmetal in them. This album Commandment is in my opinion their best one since Maximum Violence. This new album is exactly what die hard Barnes fans want from him. Sick low growling vocals and thick chunky pure old school DEATH metal riffing.

And, with the sheer amount of stuff out there with Compact Flash connectivity (modem, networking, CF cards, etc), I think it is inane that Compaq didn't at least include it with the iPaq. Or, better yet, build a CF slot into the machine.Still, it is necessary for what I think is the best PDA on the market. While I think the idea is dumb, it works great and isn't all that expensive.

Not as slow and tedius as Clockwise Man or typical weirdness of 7th & 8th Doc novellas Monster Inside was. Winner Takes All is fast paced, down to Earth, and yet captures the same sort of otherwordly magic of the series.That's not to say this book is perfect. Some of the Doctor's reactions seem a little left field, and the realistic life traumas of Rose's family leave you wondering how she can continue her high-flying adventuring while they toil in the muck.But the interplay of modern Earth-life and alien-life is very well done.If you've been enjoying the series, ignore the critics.

I can pick up Love and War and read it 12 years after it was written. This novel will seem painfully dated in a few months.Also, going back and visitiing the family and stumbling into an adventure has gotten pretty stale.For a second book, it read as fast as a Telos novella, but without the quirkiness.

For example:(1) women don't need to wait to have ALL the facts before they speak!(2) state your achievements(3) dress for success... and the list goes on and on.I absolutely agree with Gail's position that women are not in star positions because they haven't yet learned how to play the game.

Her advice is often contradictory and may leave the reader more confused than enlightened. On the one hand Ms. Evans offers simplistic, pat solutions to gender-based misunderstandings, and in the next breath she allows that every situation is unique and that women must rely on their intuition.

I guarantee that even if you're already a successful business-woman, you'll find at least a few things here that are helpful and surprising.Sexist-sounding or not, men do see the world differently than women, at least when it comes to business.

It looks awful. New intertitle cards have also been added. Most of them try to make the story easier to follow, but too many of them try to be funny but fail. \\"Twilight\\" is Maddin's worst film, a failed experiment, but \\"Heart of the World\\" is one of his best.

He explores relationships in such a real and intimate way that each character draws you in to their life.

Quicktime suppled on the CD is version 2.x from 1996. The software will NOT RUN on a stock Dell that is six months old.The software also does not run with the current verion of Quicktime.Given the age of the software and its inability to run on a current machine with Windows 98, this is not worth the premium for the CD.

None comes close to be this hard and it is worth every penny. There are three sets of practice CAT on the CD-ROM. I took each set twice. It preps me up for the real CAT. And in the end, I got the score of 700. I strongly recommend this product to anyone serious. It's much harder but it prepares you for the real thing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Purchase Study Guide with CD Version","review":"The study guide was excellent. It gives hints on finding short cuts to answers. It focuses on what you need to know. The only problem is with the CD rom. It didn't install successfully and Kaplan offered no support. If you go to the Kaplan web site read the FAQ ... you'll see many on the FAQs addresses GENERAL PROTECTION FAULTS and SYSTEM CRASHES. Kaplan knows the software is unrealiable... purchase the study guide without the CD. Use another software for simulated GMAT CAT exams."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good study guide for the GMAT CAT","review":"Consistent with other people's experience with this Kaplan book, the practice tests were much more difficult than the real GMAT. Therefore, the book makes the real test seem easier. What's funny is that I scored about as well as I did on the short diagnostic exam (so, was all the prep really worth it? I think so.). However, I scored well above the very first time I took the GMAT (9 years ago), and for that I am greatful. Since I was worried that Kaplan might not be a complete study guide, I bought the ARCO book as a companion, which I also recommend. Forget about the Barron's guide. I used this one the first time around and I scored horribly.There were only a couple mistakes in the book and on the CD. However, Kaplan needs to beef up its AWA section to take into account the new E-rater system ETS uses to score the AWA sections."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Techniques, but erroneous ways to practice them ??","review":"To begin with, I found the techniques proposed in this book to be intuitive. I enjoyed the examples, but it was not long before I realized how erroneous KAPLAN's assessment of your skills is!My performance on full-length tests on the CD-ROM looked great. Hence, I went ahead and took the test! I was shocked at the results. Kaplan's assessment is nowhere near REALITY !! Watch out! It is as important to have an accurate assessment of your skills as learning new strategies.I took the test again relying on Official Guide of GMAT from ETS and guess what! I achieved my results."},{"rating":"1","title":"You pay money for nothing!!","review":"I studied the book completely,and in my own opinion I found it adds nothing to one's basic Knowledge.I found the book to be misleading in some information about the GMAT CAT.Finally,the cd contains good questions, and that what makes it a two-star book."},{"rating":"2","title":"CD full length Tests were tougher than the GMAT by A LOT","review":"I used the CD more than the book, I only read a couple chapters of the book but liked it. On the CD I liked the teaching/review areas and thought the section practice tests were at about the right level, and perhaps slightly more challenging. However, the practice full length tests were a great deal harder than the actual GMAT CAT. On the practice tests I got (in order) 590, 570, and 560. This was a bit discouraging for me. I decided I had done as much as I could and took the GMAT anyway. I got a 750. I'm not certain if I'm thrilled with the book or upset at it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Great Book","review":"The book was great. It contained many different techniques on approaching problems, which I would never have though of. The CD on the other hand never worked. I called customer service and they refused to help me.

It's clear, well-written, and yeah, it's a little corny, but it got me a better score. The software loads easily and works just like the real test, so when I got to the test center I felt like I'd been there before. For the money, a good value."},{"rating":"2","title":"Some problems, but otherwise excellent practice","review":"I bought both Kaplan's and the Official GMAT prep books, and they complemented each other well. The Kaplan CD gives you a sense of what the mechanics of the CAT are like and the ETS Official Guide shows you what to the questions are really like. That said, I owe my 750 to the Kaplan CD (although the practice tests are significantly more difficult; I scored 600, 650, and 640 on the practice tests)."},{"rating":"2","title":"An important element for GMAT review","review":"I scored in the 700s on the big test, and relied on 3 resources: Kaplan GMAT CD ROM, A+ Notes for Algebra by Rong Yang and the Official Guide by ETS (DO NOT GET THE FLAWED SOFTWARE -- BUY THE ETS BOOK).My focus area was math, having not taken a math class in 8 years, but those 3 resources helped me get me where I wanted to be. Be forewarned, the Kaplan CD math questions will game you. The questions on the real test are more straightforward, and don't try to trick you with units as often as Kaplan does. So don't be discouraged if you score a 570 on a Kaplan practice test with poor Math scores, you can probably add 100 points. But that's my experience -- let the poor score scare you into more study!I was probably ready for the verbal portion without much review. If your weakness is Math, as mine was, those three resources worked for me. I found Kaplan's timed tests and quizzes to be very helpful.But study you must, young Jedi."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very much worth the investment, but...","review":"VERY GOOD RESOURCE:* The book and software are pretty comprehensive, and the testing tips and drills are very helpful,BUT:* You need to practice with real questions from the book/software put out by GMAC.ALSO:* The practice tests are very difficult -- my score was over 100 points below my actual GMAT score. That only makes getting the real past tests and questions more important. So, don't let the practice test scores discourage you.GOOD LUCK!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hard Questions but Quite Helpful","review":"Most of the other reviews are right on in that the questions on the three practice tests are very difficult relative to the real thing. Try not to get discouraged with low scores on the Kaplan tests, your actual score will be much higher. I think the best strategy is, as one reviewer mentioned, to begin with the Kaplan prep and take a couple of the ETS tests right before the real test."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good Material but the CD may not work.","review":"I bought the book because the ratings were good. I flipped through the different books at the store and Kaplan looked the best. I planned on studying using the CD. I have had a lot of trouble getting the CD to work. It keeps locking up my PC (Pentium 90, Windows 95). As mentioned in other comments, some of the software on the CD is outdated and you may have difficulty using the CD if you have a high speed CD-ROM drive. My CD drive is 24X.

It proved to be very disappointing. The title of the book is quite misleading -- the book does not contain 325 recipes that are \\"free of wheat, milk, eggs, corn, yeast, sugar and other common food allergens.\\" Many of the recipes contain one or more of these ingredients, and a large number of the recipes contain nuts, which is probably one of the most common food allergen there is.I tried many of these recipes anyway, with absolutely no success.

He has certainly heard a lot of war stories, enough to get some of the facts right. That is as far as it goes, however. As a veteran of SOG, his descriptions of operations in CCN are simply laughable. Locations are wildly out of sync. But these are to be expected from someone who obviously wasn't there. If Mr. Anderson was truly in S.F., I rather suspect it was as a clerk, cook, supply sergeant, or some other job where he could sit at the club and soak up the experiences of those who were there. My main objection, however, is in his descriptions of the hero and his friends. People might think these are accurate. SOG soldiers were just that, soldiers. Acting like these people do would get you killed, and if you survived, court-martialed and sent home. From an actual S.F. soldier, three tours in Vietnam, the last one in SOG.

It's been one of those fortuitous finds we all experience. This is a short, tightly plotted mystery novel that blends history, intrigue, romance, murder, all in small dollops that don't overwhelm. Using Ambrose Bierce as a character pays off - his cynicism strikes a balance with the narrator's youth and inexperience. Queen of Spades moves quickly and sometimes I wished Hall would slow down and spend a little more time developing relationships, or engaging in the San Francisco setting. My main criticism is the end and is talky explanation of the whodunit. British mysteries are known for their \\"sit everyone in a room and confront the killer\\" climaxes, and it seemed anachronistic in this American period piece. But all-in-all, it's a fun quick read and Bierce proves a serviceable Holmes."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intellegent and Funny Historical Mystery","review":"Oakley Hall is at his best with his new mystery.

When I put my foot inside, the shearling wrapped around and through my toes and foot. Wonderful! Even a half size too small, I didn't want to take them off. Needless to say, I returned them. I did not reorder the long boot because if you have big legs, your pants won't fit inside. I am going to order the Ultimate Short Boot so that my pants will fit over them. As always, AMAAZON service is great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Ugg Women's Classic Tall","review":"This is my third pair of Uggs, and they are just terrific.

I would definitely do it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Experience A Pleasure","review":"I ordered the Ugg Tall Classic and they were little tight on my wife's calves.

Bummer for me, because I loved the look."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why?","review":"UGGS are the least attractive shoes a woman could wear. Why are they popular? Both my brothers say the first thing they look in for a girl is weather she wears uggs or not. If she does, its an automatic NO. Uggs are ugly, cheap, and really just gross. Dont waste your $. Just drive to Macys and buy yourself two pairs of really nice boots instead for the same price as one pair of uggs."},{"rating":"2","title":"Warm and cozy","review":"Its a bit overrated and overpriced, but uggs classic boots are super warm and cozy to wear. I do like the tall boots because of the fold down looks that you can get out of one boot. Problem is that the sole support is not that great. For the amount of money, I expect to be able to walk in these boots as if they were sneakers. I am a size 7.5, but a 7 fit me perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Boots & They are real (Deckers Outdoor Corporation)","review":"I bought this for my wife from Deckers Outdoor Corporation. Later I was found out UGG Australia doesn't allow ebay selling etc... so I was afraid those are fake but after checking the official website it lists the reseller and I was happy to find out they are real!Pros:The boots are warm, Any weather they make you warm when you walk because of the movement!Comfortable, Look amazing!Cons:The straight sole you have to get used to it! But it's not a real con just the only thing I can mention!Conclusion: You have to have atleast one pair it's a must!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Way overpriced","review":"Seriously, they sell the same boots at Costco for $38.95.

I wish they didn't cost so much, but I am hoping they are durable. My girl said they are crazy warm and comfy."},{"rating":"1","title":"not sure this is a reputable business","review":"If you buy from the ugg store they will let you exchange for free. I felt this was a shady business. It took forever to get the boots and to return them. I have to return again for a refund. I am hoping this is a fast process. I had to send an email just to get them to send the exchange the last time. I would never buy from them again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love them!","review":"My first pair of Uggs were the Bailey Buttons. I had no idea what I was getting myself involved in. Once I stuck my feet inside of them, I was thrilled and hooked to find how soft it was in the inside. I bought these because I wanted some more kind and also I wanted to feel that softness again and have a choice of which pair I wanted to wear. I LOVE THESE BOOTS! It's too bad they aren't rainyproof (made up word) because I would wear them all the time. I feel like I'm walking on clouds!!! They are my favorite shoes and I prefer to wear them over my house slippers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made in China","review":"For me the advertising on this product is misleading.It leads you to believe that the product is made in Australia when in fact the boots are a product that is made in CHINA which is stated on the box when you get them.The fact that there made in CHINA is not important unless you, as I do consider CHINA made goods of inferior quality.This is a very expensive boot but it's badly constructed.Dollar for dollar you can do much better with a less expensive boot like an EMU or BEAR which I have also purchased.The name is what your paying for, this is not a top end elegant product,it is of NEW YORK street corner knock off quality.This is unfortunate because at one time, years ago this was an excellent boot that was well constructed it had a hand made attention to detail quality to it, now it's just a high priced boot thats selling on past popularity. Thats my opinion and I'm stuck with it."},{"rating":"1","title":"VERY disappointed","review":"I bought the black ones and they are horrible, they are NOT sheepskin, they have more of a synthetic feel to them. They are VERY stiff when trying them on. I already have the brown ones (not bought from Amazon) so i knew right away that these had to be fake. They are in no way, ANYTHING like the original classic tall Uggs. The fur was not soft like the ones i have, and they are very uncomfortable. I have never had a problem ordering from Amazon before, and im shocked that they would allow these boots to be sold on their website."},{"rating":"1","title":"classic tall uggs","review":"I did not like the way these uggs fit at all. i could not pull them up all the way to fit around my calves comfortably. they are too tight. i even had 2 other friends try them on who have smaller calves than me and it was the same issue for them too. since i unfortunetly don't have the box anymore i can't return or exchange them. these uggs were shipped from the company shoe parlor and they told me eventhough they are brand new and have never been worn, that i have to have the original packaging to get a refund or exchange. now i have a pair of $180 boots that nobody wants because they don't fit right!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A little concerned about them being real Uggs because....","review":"When I opened the box the tissue paper was crumbled and support cardboard in the boots were torn. My concern was that I bought a pair of counterfiet Uggs but after some research I decided to keep them and I do believe they are real. I think perhaps I got a return from someone else but may think twice before ordering again from this Seller. For $200.00 I expect a fresh product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love these boots","review":"I love these boots. My mother brought a pair back from Australia about 5 years ago and I thought they were so ugly. I finally broke down and bought a pair after listening to her brag about how warm they were - my feet are always freezing. Well, they keep my feet warm and are soft and cozy. I wear my pants over them and no one seems to really notice that I'm wearing boots all the time.

These boots are NOT the authentic UGG boots - they do NOT have the authentic UGG trademark symbol inside label or the sun type indentation/symbol on the bottom of the soles. If you purchase these for $179, you might as well purchase the real ones and get the real things which are the best quality. If you do purchase these, the size runs fine, so keep to your same true shoe size, you can wear them without socks and be very warm, just bring something else to wear if you take them off inside a house; my feet don't sweat or the material inside does not get ruined wearing no socks; I have worn them since mid December. They are light and not heavy. They are tall and I put my pant legs inside the boot when I wear them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Warm but wet","review":"Careful when buying these boots. They may look like they are built for winter weather, but most are only built for cold, NOT FOR WET. Whether it's snow, or slush, or rain - your feet will get wet and cold with most of their styles. Not exactly what you are looking for in winter foot ware."},{"rating":"1","title":"tall black ugg boots","review":"I have had Uggs before and loved them. The thing I love about Uggs is that I do not need to wear soxs. However, these black uggs are a big disappointment. The black dye comes off on my feet and it makes my feet look dirty. Not only that the dye doesnt come off easily even after scrubbing with a pumice stone. I threw the box out because I thought these uggs would be as great as the light brown. My sister and niece both have black uggs and they said there's never bled the black color onto their feet. Really disappointed if I had not thrown out the box I would've returned them."},{"rating":"2","title":"uggs","review":"Always a great product.

Although the shoes took a little less than two weeks to arrive, it was well worth the wait. These are authentic Uggs, and are in perfect, brand new condition.

Secondly why let Juliet only have 2 tame and short scenes when she is the only positive thing going for this DVD. Also Suzette looks very cheap and low class in this film when I have seen her in real life and she is very pretty.

Attempting to stage a third-rate version of 'Grease' (and failing even that), 'Delta' only succeeds in avoiding the gargantuan plotholes found in most McCoy stories (ie 'Silver Nemesis'). It's sad really, since the chemestry between McCoy and Langford had strong potential that went largely untapped until their reunion in the 2000 'Fires of Vulcan' audio adventure.It you're seriously interested in getting into Doctor Who, DO NOT buy this video.

Also its alleged anti aging effect is more than questionable. Hofmekler has some good points but ignores too many facts about modern nutrition.Also I have not found any hint as to whether he is a certified nutrition expert.

However, there is no way I would be able to maintain my size with this diet and workout routine. A lot of useful information and a few good theories, but it's not for everyone.

Buying from the books source, the minimum he advises taking, I came up with $740. for a months supply. Yes, you read that right and bear in mind this is the minimum he advises.

With The Warrior Diet, I lost weight almost as quick, but wasn't tired. I also did not follow this book 100% and had a small meal during the day instead of sticking to fruits and vegetables.

The author says his program slows down aging. How? You wouldn't know it by looking at his face. Or at least from what you can see of it. What's with the shadowy photos? It would help if this book were more research based instead of philosophically appealing to warrior wannabes. Ori states you should drink 8 glasses of water a day. Wouldn't that tax your kidneys? Dr. Campbell at Real Health states it would. Kidneys have to do with water regulation in the body. They can give you a dried up look (like the author's) if they aren't functioning well. I don't know.

Ori gives a logical regimen for daily consumption. Basicly during the day you do not eat anything (if you must, you can eat berries or a few other items) and upon the evening can eat many meals as long as they are protein based, and have a high water content. This diet is not far from Diamonds \\"Fit for Life\\" which is geared towards living a long healthy life, as opposed to the Warrior diet which is based more on \\"getting cut\\" (Lean) and being more alert due to the hunger. On the Warrior Diet I lost close to 14 pounds of fat, however, I also lost close to 12 pounds of muscle.

While all of the books seem to provide a gentile like myself an excellent understanding of the social and religious aspects of contemporary Judaism in America, the plot in nearly all of the books involves a subplot that examines temple politics and people problems in general. Poor Rabbi Small seems always to narrowly avoid getting fired. However, the Tuesday book takes on some of the larger issues of anti-semitism and campus unrest in the late 60s/early 70s. The objectivity with which the author addresses these sensitive issues through Rabbi Small is laudable.

He gets into a beef with a jock and takes off in his car being chased by the jock. Eventually goth kid drives over a cliff. One year later, the teachers and students who mocked him start dying, each one leaving a clue as to who will die next.Now, forget you read all that because you are never going to want to sit through this dreck. I took the bullet for you. Stephen J. Cannell, who wrote Dead Above Ground, used to make cheesy tv shows like the A-Team and Rip Tide. The A-Team was Shakespeare compared to this movie. It has a plot so cliched and hackneyed a first year film student wouldn't write it. Atrocious dialog and God-awful acting round out this movie's demerits. Stay far away from this movie."},{"rating":"1","title":"Makes you laugh!!","review":"Unfortunately, it's a horror movie, not a comedy, but it might as well be...I have one thought: I would think that, after hundreds of thousands of cliche, unbelievably predictable B horror movies have been made over and over, all following the same formulaic scripting, and all containing the same horrendous over-the-top cheeseball acting, that someone would say to these hopeless directors/producers, \\"gee, ya know, we've seen this before--about a bajillion times, and it still sucks!\\" This movie is BAD...very, very bad. One of the worst movies I have ever seen, and I usually enjoy bad horror movies. I think I may have even dropped a few IQ points having been subjected to this trash. The only thing that you may get out of it is the hilarity of making fun of it---this begs for the Mystery Science Theater 3000/Svengoolie treatment. Otherwise, a total waste of time. Just avoid it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Mysterious killer with an axe.","review":"Antonio Sabato Jr is the best actor in this film. It has a really stupid plot and ending. It's about a killer with an axe that offs his victims one by one. The motive behind this is that the spiky haired kid in this film is mistreated by all his classmates for his weird seance's and evil cults. His behavior is so strange that he makes the guidance counselor very nervous. After getting run off the road by one of his schoolmates, all his old classmates die one by one by this mysterious killer. While in the meanwhile, Antonio Sabato Jr (the detective) in this movie investigates and does a polygraph on everyone. There is not that much gore or nudity in this film and the ending was very bizarre. It was completely stupid."},{"rating":"1","title":"pretty bad.","review":"I know this is a straight to video release. It also has some familiar faces in it. But it's horrible. I have to respectfully disagree with the other reviewer and say that Antonio Sabato Jr was absolutely horrible. It seemed like he was reading his lines off cue cards. Granted what he had to work with was a joke to start out with, but come on. Make it even halfway believable. This is nothing more than a very bad B-movie. In this case, the \\"B\\" in b-movie truely stands for \\"BAD!\\". Don't waste your time. What a disappointment."},{"rating":"1","title":"Autobiographical?","review":"Note to Stephen Cannell: please, just stop. Even when you were at the top of your game, doing things like 21 Jump Street, no one would have called you a genius. And now, you've slipped down the ladder, Stephen. If this is the best thing you can come up with, I would suggest a career change.This movie is all about an aging Hollywood Screenwriter and his daughter. It features all the typical stereotypes, a Director who is sleeping with a Bimbo Starlet, the Kid From the Wrong Side of Town who wants to date the Screenwriter's daughter. It's like a really bad combination of \\"Pretty in Pink\\" and \\"The Player\\", trying to be a horror movie.The concept and the writing are just plain dead. It makes you wonder, when Stephen Cannell came up with the title \\"Dead Above Ground\\", was he describing himself?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Verve Remix, Vol. 3...NOPE!","review":"Fortunately I did not spend the money on this one. For me, it is the worst of the series with Volume 2 being my personal favorite.

It's just my opinion and how I feel."},{"rating":"1","title":"Its a Stinker!","review":"The First two are absolutely the best. They were done tastefully and thoughtfully and it showed.

I & II","review":"I rushed excitedly to buy this after really enjoying volumes one and two, only to find myself very disappointed... The remixes are very disjointed - there is no real common feel unlike the first two Cds in the series. One or two tracks stand out - the Sarah Vaughan / Peter Gunn theme is wonderful, but her 'fever' remix is weak... And the Nina Simone 'Lilac Wine' remix is just plain embarassing..."},{"rating":"2","title":"Never mind what the other are saying this is excellent!","review":"Speak Low remixed by Bent is just one of the best remixes I have ever heard. Beautiful and haunting vocals by Billie Holiday and the laidback beats by Bent combine to create just one magnificent remix. I have listened to the original and this updated remix is just awesome. Perfectly done! The other remixes are all top form as well. The RJD2 remix of Gentle Rain by Astrud Gilberto, Sarah Vaughan's Peter Gunn remixed by Max Sedgley, Adam Freeland's remix of Fever by Sarah Vaughan, Sugardaddy's remix of Come Dance With Me by Shirly Horn and the list goes on. I can only wish for more remix projects like this to come from all the labels out there.

This is not a re-envisioning of the original songs, nor is it \\"21st century jazz music\\". If you want to hear 21st century jazz music, pick up a Stefon Harris record. THIS record is an electronic record with jazz samples, and not a good one at that. Very little daring here, very few chanes taken, very stock stuff. The only songs that come close to meeting the original mission of this series are the too-short \\"Yesterdays\\" (Billie Holiday remixed by Junior Boys) and \\"Lilac Wine\\" (Nina Simone remixed by Album Leaf).The first volume remains the high point of this series."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Most Tasteless/Ridiculous Remix","review":"The remix is totally devoid of any taste:First the vocals are completely-off;the mix levels of vocals is far lower than the new musical dressings. Secondly,there is absolutely no respect on part of the \\"mixing DJs\\" for the great vocalists:there is no melody and absolutely no 'jelling-together' of the music with the vocals. I was deeply disappointed with this cd.If you are into remixes get The Rod Stewart \\"Do ya think i am sexy\\" single cd instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"first to worst v.3","review":"this mix is the worst remixed of the 3. the unmixed songs are good songs, but these same songs remixed are just plain boring and have no distinct style. the only one remotely interesting is yesterdays. the rest have absolutely no soul whatsoever. let me know when the verve remixed series reverts back to the v.1 formula. do yourself a favor, pick up remixed 1, light some candles, open a good bottle of wine and get close to someone that makes it hard to breathe. you can thank me later."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unfortunately... 2 stars. I had high hopes.","review":"As a big fan of Remixed 1 and 2, I was very excited to hear that 3 had come out. But upon listening to it, it turns out that I'm only keeping 6 out of the 13 tracks on my playlist. Little Girl Blue, Speak Low, Fever, The Gentle Rain, Peter Gunn and Stay Loose made the cut. Everything else was very discordant-sounding to my ears, with none of the electronic groove that I was used to on the other albums. My tastes may be too mainstream to truly appreciate the unusual choices made by the more experimental remixers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whoring of Timeless Artists","review":"This album is so artlessly remixed and disrepectful of the original artists as to be offensive. I excitedly anticipated listening to number 3 in the series. What a disappointment! There was no reason for this collection but to profit from the success of the first two. These hacks could have taken canned sound clips and remixed them to an album of near equal quality. I am pissed. Okay, there are a about three tracks that are pretty good, but that's far from acceptable as far as I'm concerned."},{"rating":"2","title":"relaxing but not sleepy","review":"I could never get into jazz because i always thought that it was boring.

I had it on at Thanksgiving dinner and people kept asking me what the cd was and enjoyed it.When I saw the third collection, I snatched it up only to be severely disappointed. This cd is in the jazz section and if there's any jazz on it, I would be very suprised. More dance music than jazz which was disappointing. Do yourself a favor and pick up a classic Verve title which wil feature a jazz legend."},{"rating":"1","title":"Volume 3","review":"The first \\"Verve/Remixed\\" focused on Divas, mostly those of the Jazz genre. This third disc - like the second volume - deviates from that enjoyable formula by expanding to female pop singers, male vocalists, and instrumentalists.VERVE/REMIXED 3 consists of 13 newly remixed songs. Disc packaged in clear jewel case; total running time: 63:38. Booklet does not include information about the original recordings (not even songwriting credits).Once again, there are two Nina Simone recordings remixed. Billie Holiday and Sarah Vaughan both have two songs each. And Brazilian singer Astruid Gilberto appears once again.While containing less music (less 1 track and 10 minutes), this is a better collection than \\"Verve/Remixed 2\\". Sarah Vaughan's \\"Peter Gunn\\" is very fun; Nina Simone's \\"Little Girl Blue\\" is nice. But (one-half of Gnarls Barkley) DJ Danger Mouse's remix of \\"Baby, Did You Hear?\\" is weak; Dinah's vocals are barely audible. Surprisingly, Anita O'Day's \\"Sing, Sing, Sing\\" is rather enjoyable."},{"rating":"2","title":"e nergy synch","review":"Great artists, great sounds - new and funky with unrepeatable classic talent, up-vamped.

It's about four dudes and a bet to bring the most beautiful date to their 10 year high school reunion. The plot is formulaic to say the least, but there's a reason it's called formula, it works!

The picture is full of blocky artifacts even at the high quality settings. I can't imagine what the picture looks like at the lower quality settings. The picture on my old VCR looks better than this. The recording A/D processor is only 10 bit/27 Mhz. That explains the low picture quality. The remote is a joke. It has buttons for your TV, but they only work if your TV is a Philips. I gave this 2 stars because it will play Divx discs. But the D/A video processor is only 10 bit 54 Mhz, so don't expect a great picture.

I've tried every dvd copy program (Nero, DVDClone, FabDVD, et al; ad nauseum) and none of them recognize the disc as a compliant format.

Put a blank in and set it to record a 1 hour show at medium quality leaving another hour of space remaining. Set it to record a second 1 our show and it sits there like a bump on a log. No warnings...nothing.Remote buttons get hung up under the case cutouts. The absolute worst thing I've spent $150 on.

It really made my hair look pretty and it really brought out my natural highlites that tend to come out in the summer anyway."},{"rating":"1","title":"wrong item","review":"this seller sent me the worng item, i recieved an almanac instead of teh book. however i am rating it at all because my money was refunded to me when i made a complain. fair enuf"},{"rating":"2","title":"new typical cats cd on october 26th","review":"the new typical cats cd is being released on october 26 2004. ive heard samples of the songs and this is gonna be a great record. deffinetly get that when it comes out. everybody should own every typical cats cd and all the solo albums. the 3 qwel cds and 1 denizen kane cd are available on amazon. as for the qwazaar cd, walk thru walls, you can get it off ebay for 15 bucks. the new typical cats cd hasnt shown up on amazon yet but its on www.galapagos4.com. everyone get that ish! all 6 cds including this one!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Listen to it with your hips","review":"A beautiful hip-hop opus that flows with poetry. It's not your typical rap album. It touches you with the flawless flow of three distinctly different MCs over subtle horns, classic piano notes, and scratch choruses. The CD cyclones through social issues, such as the dehumanizing treatment of women (one tight line: \\"the thin line between pedestal and auction block\\"), and the personal feelings and believes (\\"Any Day\\" is a moving track.) This is also a very poetic cd. One of the MCs, Denizen Kane, explodes with a great spoken word poem/song called \\"What you thought hops.\\"This is a beautiful underground hip-hop gem. Listen to it with your hips."},{"rating":"2","title":"TYPICAL CATS","review":"(ANY DAY)BY T-P POETRY..IS AWESOME..LOVE THE LYRICS..THIS IS WHAT A CALL HIP-HOP..NOT THOSE ON TV..WITH GIRLS ALL OVER..I MEAN WHATS THE POINT..OKAY, THERE'S HOT GIRLS DANCING ALL AROUND..BIG DEAL...AS FOR THIS (UNDER GROUND HIP -HOP I CALLED IT)SOUNDS MORE LIKE REAL HIP-HOP.....ENJOOY"},{"rating":"2","title":"For people who love real hip-hop or music in general","review":"I have nothing bad to say about this CD. Every track has so much to offer from the music to the lyrics. Each beat has a nice mix of jazz, blues, and classical music combined with hip-hop beats that bring it all together. On every track the lyrics are so fluid and meaningful there's no way you can't feel this music. I personally love this CD and Typical Cats. If you love music, poetry, hip-hop, and art this CD is for you"},{"rating":"2","title":"An excellent book for caregivers.","review":"I am a clinical social worker with 40+ years of practice. This has been the best resource I have found for use with families dealing with caregiving.

The material on this cd is mostly VERY old unreleased B-sides from the [Church of Acid / Calling Ov The Dead] Era's, and serves nicely as a past look into the beginings of Velvet Acid Christ...In my opinion, the sound on this album is very ' Goth ' oriented, Tracks like \\"Pain\\" and \\"Rain For 27 Days\\" show Bryan's heavy influences with The Cure, The Legendary Pink Dots, ect. Overall an excellent CD, although it may take awhile to grow on a NEW VaC fan, for die hard fans and collectors, this cd will be a great addition to your library, i'm predicting that Between the Eyes Volume 3 will be even better!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Warning - Does not include transformer!","review":"Be aware that this item does not include a plug and requires the additional purchase of a transformer.

The album that got them back in the right direction of rock!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good album.","review":"This was the follow-up to Roll the Bones and saw the band get a lot more into electrical guitar and less on the keyboards and synthesizers to back up the sound. Standout tracks include \\"Stick it Out\\", the instrumental \\"Leave that Thing Alone\\", and \\"Everyday Glory.\\" Though probably not as popular as Rush's earlier stuff, from the mid to late 80's, this is a solid album all the way through and displays what the band does best, write good songs backed up by nice guitar, bass, excellent drumming and some keyboards."},{"rating":"2","title":"Classic RUSH","review":"The song \\"Nobody's Hero\\" is haunting and reflects the sadness that too often occurs in our modern world. This song stands out above the other tracks. All in all, a good average RUSH recording."},{"rating":"1","title":"It is Rush, but not like the good old stuff.","review":"A lot of it sounds the same. I love Rush, but I believe they lost their luster around Signals. Everything started sounding the same. The explosiveness and creativity kind of went down the drain. Still would love to see them live, but nothing compares to the stuff they did prior to Moving Pictures."},{"rating":"1","title":"Counterpunch!","review":"I remember anticipating this album when it came out I had heard \\"stick it out\\" and was counting the days. Finally THE ALBUM CAME AND!.......it was HORRIBLE!!Basically I figured out in one listen that \\"animate\\", \\"stick it out\\", and \\"double agent\\" were about the only good things this album had to offer and NO I DON'T LIKE \\"hero\\" that song was awful. I'm giving it two stars because the 3 songs I mentioned were so good that it saves this poor album from being a 1 star.2 outta 5!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Rush's corniest album ever.","review":"I'm a huge Rush fan- they're easily one of my all time favorites- but this record is downright embarrasing to listen to. All the riffs and hooks are great, but the lyrics- holy crap! The cheesiest stuff you'll ever hear. From the opening track, we get this line: \\"My counterpart, my foolish heart. Man must learn to rule his tender part\\". Wow. It's unintentionally funny- your buddies will get a good laugh out of it. \\"Between Sun & Moon\\" and \\"Leave that thing alone\\" are the best tracks, by far. The second one is another great instrumental, and thankfully, no vocals on this one. Get ANY other Rush record before this one - there are about 30 of them, I think. Test for Echo is much better."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unbeliavable","review":"Unbeliavable that a reviewer below could think that the song \\"NOBODY'S HERO\\" may have been written for the heroes of September 11th,2001, when this album was released in 1993... Incredible...As for COUNTERPARTS, it's plain dumb, as most of Rush's work of the nineties. The production is utterly commecial, no wonder they brought in producer Peter Collins to do it... A shame.I really do not like this album, and put it in the same league of the dreadful HOLD YOUR FIRE, in the \\"fireless\\" category."},{"rating":"1","title":"CAn'T FEEL IT - WORST RUSH ALBUM EVER.","review":"I'm an old RUSH fan. I survived and enjoyed fully when they changed their sound, adding a lot of keyboards, synthesizers, etc, forever. It was a new way, but the point was: the energy of true rock and music was always there, always at their side in all kind of songs. But in this COUNTERPARTS it seems everything went wrong !!!!! It's \\"cold\\", heartless, overproduced, flat. Of course there are few tunes, but production (by Peter Collins) ruined the good part of them. If you wanna know, I gave (for free) my copy of COunterparts to a friend of mine. I really tried to enjoy it, but that was not possible, so bad that album is."},{"rating":"1","title":"SO BAD...","review":"RUSH reached the boittom here, mixed in absurd quantities of digital sound and overproduction by one of the masters in destroyuing the souls of bands, producer peter Collins (he did Queensryche PROMISED LAND and Gary Moore's WILD FRONTIER, both syntesized albuns lacking punch)."},{"rating":"1","title":"What is this?","review":"What has Rush turned themselves to? This is a horrible CD, only that. There's no point in trying to justify these plastic, incoherent and comercial songs saying \\"we're trying new ways\\", \\"this is our best album so far\\", \\"we do what gives us pleasure\\". One only needs to compare it with \\"Moving Picture\\", \\"Permanent Waves\\" and a handful of others Rush recordings!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still Rush, but ...","review":"The only CD by Rush that I skip a song... \\"Nobody's Hero\\", just proves that musicians, no matter how great, still lose a sense of reality now and then.

I think is the best thing RUSH did since Moving Pictures...ANIMATE, ALIEN SHORE, CUT TO THE CHASE, COLD FIRE and the hit STICK IT OUT are great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"One of Rush's greatest albums ever.","review":"Counterparts is indeed one of the best albums that Rush has ever recorded. The best songs on this album are Animate, Cut To The Chase, Stick It Out, Nobody's Hero, and The Speed of Love. Even though Rush's music has changed quite a bit over the years, they still know how to make great music. Alex Lifeson is one of the greatest guitar players in the world. The solo on Cut To The Chase shows that. Rush is one of my all-time favorite rock bands. This album is a must-have for all die hard Rush fans. On the scale of 1-10, I rate this album an 11."},{"rating":"1","title":"THE WEAKEST RUSH ALBUM EVER !","review":"I've bought this CD a long time ago and until now I can't feel it right. \\"Nobody's Hero\\" is a beautiful song, but the others seem all alike to me, over-produced, as if to hide the lack of inspiration of the band for this CD."},{"rating":"1","title":"\\"Don't swallow the poison!\\"","review":"Well, they asked for it. Peter Collins and his glossy production trying to make Rush into something they are not. Fear is not a good enough reason for prog-rockers to turn \\"Alternative.\\" I swear some of the songs here sound like hyped versions of Pearl Jam. I don't mind a change in direction, but an about-face is something else. For such heralded musicians and writers of some of the more intricate songs I have ever heard, it was truly a shame to hear the fairly conventional song-structures, cliched lyrical content, and jagged production. I remember actually liking this album for the first few spins, but after a few more I was beginning to be annoyed. I never listen to this album anymore, while I still return to their earlier albums with confidence. The only really good track here is the instrumental \\"Leave That Thing Alone.\\" That's good advice. They have much better albums than this disappointment. Later."},{"rating":"2","title":"No Rush To Judgement","review":"'Counterparts' was the strongest Rush album since 1985's 'Power Windows', though it's reminiscent of an earlier effort, 1981's 'Moving Pictures'. Peter Collins' gritty, hard and dry production helps to put the bite back into the Canadian 3-piece, giving them a 90s frisson. High points are the cut and thrust of songs like 'Animate' and 'Stick It Out' and, by way of contrast, the sweeping 'Nobody's Hero', which includes a string arrangement. The latter half of the record lacks the drive and focus of the first half, but nevertheless 'Counterparts' is a consistently pleasing listening experience."},{"rating":"2","title":"Essential Rush","review":"And I DO NOT take that review title lightly - Rush have had a few undesirable CD's over the past few years, and this 20+ year RUSH fan can attest. This CD brings them 'back to form' (pardon the overused term), with less synth and great songs. Even new Rush fans can get into this I am sure - lots of energy and catchy songs.For a band that is approaching it's '30 year together' mark, this is an awesome yet original effort."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not exactly what I expected but... GREAT!","review":"Quite a few of the tracks on COUNTERPARTS just blew me away! They definitely experimented with '90s grudge on this album. Yeah, there's a lot more \\"love songs\\" on this album than on any other albums (including the '80s and '70s). Really there's not much else I can say about COUNTERPARTS except: You'll rock-out and enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Powerful Songs","review":"This album has elements from their old style along with elements from their newer \\"electronica\\" stuff. This album seems more serious than their lighthearted \\"Presto\\" and \\"Hold Your Fire\\" albums. \\"Roll The Bones\\" lead us into this album with the style that was about to come for this and \\"Test For Echo\\".The opening song \\"Animate\\" has such a cool groove sound that it's 6 minute length seems much shorter. \\"Nobody's Hero\\", one of Rush's most personal songs yet has great lyrics. \\"Cold Fire\\", probably my favorite on the album is a nice song on the subject of relationships. I highly recommend this CD."},{"rating":"2","title":"Thurman presents lectures on the \\"Three Jewels\\"","review":"Robert Thurman, the renowned professor of Indo-Tibetan studies from Columbia presents popular lectures on the basic concepts of \\"The Three Jewels\\" of Buddhism - The Buddha, the Dharma and the Sangha. Thurman's style of teaching is light, sometimes humorous and entertaining enough to capture interest in the before mentioned topics. The video quality and sound are adequate - the lectures were recorded at Tibet House, New York, and the set of tapes provides a good introduction to Buddhist thought - great for the inquiring newcomer and a nice refresher for those who have studied this philosophy."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful book by a writer with authority","review":"Any book by Joan Silber is one that a reader can plunge into without the slightest hesitation, as opposed to those books a reader doesn't quite trust to be the real thing. This is a tale told with easy authority requiring nothing from the reader but attention. This is a wondrful novel, as are Ms. Silber's other books. She has her own particular voice, which is recognizable anywhere, but it is never a distraction; it's just one more element that makes her work so singular. Pay no attention to the jacket flap, which is glib and cute--the book is often funny, but it's never cute. This is a love story, I suppose, but that's too simplistic a definition. Lucky Us is a reflection of life as we live now, made utterly compelling by the depth of Ms. Silber's fully imagined characters. It is imppossible to put it down after the first sentence! Enjoy it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Long and shallow...","review":"There is not much of a story . Reminds me of my monotone high school teacher. Long, drawn out and utterly boring. There are no descriptions in what the characters are experiencing and nothing to grasp your attention. Definitely not a reread. If you have not subjected yourself to it already...save your time and read another book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lucky me","review":"As you can see, this book got nothing less than 4 and 5 star reviews and for good reason. Aside from the excellent writing style, which doesn't insult your intelligence like Sarah's Key, Joan Silber is one astute author and does not disappoint (Olive Kitteridge and Household Words are also excellent reads). The characters and story in Lucky Us were believable and interesting. Here's a book you look forward to picking up again. And when you remember it's waiting for you on the nightstand, you quicken your step to retire. I also appreciate books that don't introduce a surplus of characters who could have been left out. This book focused mainly on two. Although, when I finished the book I felt a bit let down. In retrospect I realize I was just plain sorry it ended. Yeah, it's one of those rare books you didn't waste your money on."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good but....","review":"This is a good durable rope swing but we did not realize how short the rope was!

It's downright entertainment! A tremendous array of types of guitars, guitar styles, and musical styles. I only hope that they keep up the good work.

She is one hot chick! I've purchased several Penthouse titles in the past, but this DVD was a lot different than them. It was a nice change to see so much beautiful skin out in public, rather than the standard set ups used over and over again. My favorite shot is this guy's reaction when he sees Alex Arden ride by on her bicycle -- topless! Nice! I was laughing and feeling aroused at the same time. What a sensation."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very boring and dry!","review":"Reviewer: A viewer from San Francisco, CA United StatesThere's nothing special about this video. Of all the Penthouse titles, this is one of the worst. Filming of the women are too short and flashy, having no time to really digest their beauty. Also, there are NO DETAILED CLOSEUP filming of the more important and intersting parts of the women, unlike in Pets in Paradise Parts One and Two and Penthouse:Pet Of The Year 2000(starring Juliet Cariaga).

If seeing a naked woman walk down the street or pump gas excites you, fine, I suppose it's an interesting concept on some level. But seeing as it's a Penthouse video, they should have put a warning label on it for me ... and I could have spent my [money] on one of Penthouse's \\"Eurogirl\\" titles or one of those new softcore movies like \\"A Model Solution\\"...

Probably most entertaining is watching where these girls expose themselves in public places - pretty bold. Penthouse has introduced us to a very original approach to the subject matter of the nude female form with interesting settings and visuals. It is almost hard to describe why I like seeing women naked out in the open. They just sorta speak for themselves.Recommended for moments of surreal poetry in motion, a rare and authentic portrayal of sexuality, often controversial, but true and valid human experiences.I think its worth checking out if you haven't."},{"rating":"1","title":"Why make Penthouse boring?","review":"My boyfriend loves Penthouse so of course we had to see this movie. It is very average. The women are naked in public and the reactions look very rehearsed. There is no mood or eroticism here.

David Lieberman touches us universally with insight into our humanity through humor, pathos and bathos. He shares with us the feelings of inconsequence and the struggle to discover our worth and our joy, with purpose and an insistant instinct for survival. From the stanza, \\"yet I have no story/(nothing happened)/& what I've seen/begets a yawn// to a line from a prelude to \\"Melvin's song\\", \\"I trod on the ice, broke through, hi ho...\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Poetry for the rest of us","review":"Poetry has such a tiny audience because so much of it appeals to a \\"spiritual\\" element in our makeup. Most poets quickly starve of oxygen in this air-fairy atmosphere. Lieberman's poems, while maintaining a solid core touching on the puzzling essences of mankind, is immediately graspable by those of us who admire descriptions of the human condition, but prefer them in the vernacular of everyday experiences.

Many people either love it or hate it, but if you love it, you will LOVE it. Several of my friends (including myself) can practically recite the entire movie line by line. It's filled with hilarious one-liners and Parker Posey is amazing. Freddie Prinze Jr. does a great job at playing a guy that seems clueless, and the Mother is hysterically floating about her own little version of the world. I normally can't stand Tori Spelling, but she wasn't unbearable in this movie, and it's absolutely wonderful to see Jackie O's interactions with her character.Be forewarned it has themes that may not appeal to all, but it's definitely worth a look. Adopted from a screenplay (it follows the script almost exactly) you can tell while you are watching that it was meant for the stage, which for me is part of the appeal. The focus is on the actors/actresses' performances as opposed to special effects and spectacular set design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible","review":"As a major Parker Posey fan I cannot begin to describe how profoundly disappointing this horrible, wretched movie is.Incompetent, inept, and unwatchable, it is the contrived story of one thoroughly dysfunctional family on Thanksgiving of 1983. While the presence of Tori Spelling should be a tip off, I never thought Parker would wind up in a mess of this sort."},{"rating":"1","title":"JUST SAY NO!","review":"I love Parker Posey, but this is bad. I remember feeling real uncomfortable watching this and wondering, \\"was it because of the taboo subject matter (incest)?\\" And then I realized that it was primarily the poor writing and directing. It wasn't provacative, just stupid. Parker fans will always be there for her in Party Girl, Clockwatchers, and even Waiting for Guffman."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful Arthouse Trash","review":"This movie encapsulates everything wrong with \\"edgy\\" theatre. It has no plot, no characterization, and no talented actors. Whoever wrote this movie really did not incorporate anything that would interest a viewer looking for a well-told story. There is not one redeeming quality about this movie.Sure, the incest thing is edgy, but it is nothing more advanced than etchings in a 8th grader's notebook. How about the Kennedy assassination? Pretty edgy, huh? Well, it would have worked if I had cared about a single character. Unfortunately, every character is extremely one-dimensional and the acting reflects that perfectly. Also, the nuances about the timing of the assassination and the death of the father would have worked if I HAD CARED. But the director lost me at the first forty minutes.This movie is terrible in so many ways. Its plot is flat and the \\"twist\\" at the end only further serves to show what an insipid piece of junk this movie really is."},{"rating":"1","title":"should be called the house of no!!","review":"this was gawdawful!! the characters strain to be eccentric. they try soooo hard to be interesting and odd that they, ironically, become forgettable. there is not one particular trait in any character that stands out. parker posey is supposed to emulate jackie kennedy. none of jackie's personality is reflected, nor are her mannerisms, nor does she get quoted. parker posey's character merely dresses like her. ooooohh! really pushing the boundaries! and then they seemingly throw in the incestous affair as the last resort bait to capture our attention, kind of like they have nothing else in their tackle box. what a waste of a great cast!! it's completely disappointing as a funny / entertaining movie, but it beats watching prime time tv."},{"rating":"1","title":"a shame that the assets here do not a success make","review":"while i lovvvves all things jackie and parker, the latter was nonetheless more stylin' & fun to watch in clockwatchers, henry fool, guffman etc. eternababe bujold (as her mother) was the Real gem in this, clad in forbidding, chic jessica mcclintock waspiness. and let's not forget to hail rolfe kent's fantastic score (i wish it had been Released! :( ), whose heady main theme recalls jerry goldsmith's ilia theme from the first star trek movie :) but like i sez, this thing don't quite work :( vt"},{"rating":"1","title":"... what can I say?!","review":"The film is awkward from the beginning to the end. I hope this bad experiment doesn't repeat itself in future films."},{"rating":"2","title":"Still good after a decade","review":"Legitimately, I believe I first viewed this film due to shock value and that it was supposed to stretch my views as a viewer. Granted it stuck with me over a decade because incest is rare and the plot was subsequently very original. However, on a testing of originality the plot and dialogue held up over the years. This is by far the farthest I have seen a dark comedy go and still get away with the laughs. I wish this film were more highly regarded as it is probably the best performance of Parker Posey's career. Watch it if you enjoy the Christopher Guest comedies Parker has become synonymous with."},{"rating":"2","title":"Parker Posey is awesome!","review":"This was a great movie because of Parker Posey's performance. She is unbelievable as Jackie-O, and even looks like her, which makes things a bit...unsettling. The movie is slightly disturbing, but the dialogue is great, the acting is great, and even Tori Spelling is tolerable. (Who would have thought?) This definitely isn't a movie for everyone, because as a lot of people have posted here, there is incest and a play on the JFK assassination, but none of that bothered me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Hail To the Freak","review":"\\"But I bake brownies.

Never, ever has there been a screen character as completely lovably nuts as Jackie-O, played by the uber-Goddess B-movie starlet, Parker Posey. And the only thing more nuts than her, is the way you feel when you find yourself cheering for this psychotic, incestuous diva to get everything she wants in life, dead bodies, sex with her brother and all. You go girl!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Stop giving me the third degree!

It tastes pretty bland, especially when the water bottle starts to warm up but I add stevia sweetener to it and that seems to help. I use 2 scoops of Perpetuem for a 24 oz bottle and add two packets of Stevia sweetener. I'm do a lot of century rides and my bike is set up for 5 bottles. I have 4 with Perpetuem and 1 with water. My routine is to drink half a bottle every 11 miles and that takes me to 88. I'll stop at the 50-something mile rest stop, top off two bottles with water, maybe take on some food and move on. If it's not hot, I won't need to take on food. In full disclosure I also use e-gel and down one of those every hour. I've done 17 centuries that way the last two seasons and it works pretty well for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Palatable, digestible, keeps me cycling","review":"Perpetuem keeps me cycling on my longer rides (50+ miles).

It's the easiest way for me to get 1,200 calories into a water bottle and still be easy to digest. I recently used it on a 300 mile 24 hour road bike ride and it helped get me through. At 2 in the AM in the cold it's hard to digest and eat a sandwich or other food. I just constantly take sips of a this. I use it highly concentrated, probably more powder than water. Anyway, great for long rides, probably anything over 5 hours or so."},{"rating":"1","title":"WORST TASTING SPORTS DRINK EVER!!!","review":"I used to use Cytomax and heard about Hammer Nutrition, and decided to go with them because they were KOSHER.After researching their 20 different products, I tried out this product in the strawberry flavor.I have to say that it is by far the most disgusting tasting sport drink that I have ever tasted. Also Cytomax really worked, I haven't tried the hammer nutrition as much because it just tastes so bad but it doesn't seem to have the same results.The first time I thought that I didn't use enough powder, no matter what I tried and what I mixed it with, it still tasted horrible.Stay away from this flavor, unless you like the taste of rotten strawberries and mud!"},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL TASTE","review":"I'm so mad I wasted money on this crap, it tastes so awful I didn't even finish one packet (and I tried it with water, then milk thinking milk might help the taste). The best I can think of to describe it, is like a bland chalky taste.. don't waste your money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal","review":"This product is phenomenal. When used during marathon and ultra marathon races this product staves the normal feelings of exhaustion from a few hours of extended exertion. All you need to do is pour it into a water bottle, add water and shake. A suggested powder to liquid ratio is on the tub. Try to mix it as close to use as possible because something happens to the flavor when it sits. You'll want to shake it before drinking too because it has a tendency to reform at the bottom."},{"rating":"1","title":"Made me nauseous","review":"My first time using it was on a 100km ride. I found that the first bottle was difficult to get down and it was just under two scoops in a 0.7L water bottle. Afterward I felt a little bloated and switched to water for the next bottle. The second - freshly mixed - bottle left me feeling on the edge of vomiting after every sip. I spent the rest of the ride balancing nausea against glycogen depletion.I might try it again just to see if it's an adaptation or heat (it was 32C and humid) problem...but I doubt it. This stuff didn't sit right and it doesn't help that the orange vanilla flavour tastes revolting in warm water."},{"rating":"2","title":"What can you say about a porcelain mug","review":"This mug holds hot and cold fluids and does not leak.

The hostess is not necessary, her dress is inappropriate, and the technical terms used by the firefighters were too much for a 3 year old to comprehend. 15 minutes of \\"Miss Kelly\\" is 15 minutes too much.

While I am not typically a brand-sensitive person, I have read some reviews that state that you should stick with the same brands when it comes to magentic media such as tape. In addition, you probably should not switch from one brand to another after significant use because of the lubricants that the differnet manufacturers use. That said, I am interested in trying Sony's HD Mini-DV tapes, even though my camer is not an HD model.

Looks and fits in the rack nicely.

They love it! I will order it again since it is a great price, but for some reason it doesn't smell as good as the bag I bought at a local chain pet store. It was the same brand and type, but smelled so fresh, pleasant, and almost fruity. I have ordered the cockatiel food on amazon and one for gerbils/hamsters, and both just don't smell as good as the one in the pet store. The one from amazon smells like any other seed food. No idea what this could be. Maybe the product offered through amazon isn't fresh or the product I got at the pet store was unusually fresh?"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The editor must have failed to read page 2 paragraph 4 that rails against the goal of project finance, namely to \\"make government irrelevant and achieve a two-tier society where government panders to the marginalized and infrastructure development and exploitation (!!!??) are handed over to private capital, free from the encumbrances of the electoral mandates\\". With that kind of bias set forward, why continue reading??Basically, a set of powerpoint slides bound in a booklet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lamerica","review":"Made at the height of the Albanian refugee crisis, Amelio's absorbing drama is a nightmarish vision of poverty, conflict, and despair in post-Communist Europe's most isolated nation. As Gino is systematically stripped of every luxury item and form of identification he possesses by the ruthless people he encounters, the irony of his situation becomes crystal clear, especially when brash exploiter-turned-weary refugee Gino (Lo Verso in an exquisite, haunting performance) joins a wave of migrants hoping to sneak across the border to the West--and a better life. Visually striking and genuinely moving, \\"Lamerica\\" is an unforgettable look at a land devastated by dictatorial politics and world neglect, and those desperate to leave."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Beautifully made film","review":"Gianni Amelio's touching and thought-provoking story of 2 superficial and greedy Italian business men who go to under-developed Albania to set up a business scam. When the deal goes sour the younger business man, with some bad luck, loses his jeep, money, and identity and lives as an Albanian while trying to flee the country. The experience humanizes the Albanians, as he sees that these \\"savages\\" are not much different then him, with dreams of love and freedom. Perhaps the best film I have ever seen, with a powerful ending which will make you cry and understand why our fathers, grandfathers, etc.. came to Lamerica"},{"rating":"2","title":"Words to bring comfort to the grieving heart -- for Christians","review":"My husband died in March of 2011 after a long illness. What wasn't expected was the sudden death of my youngest son of 34 years five months later. I went to bed one night and woke up the next day to find him dead in his room; brain hemorrhage. As a Christain mother, this is the biggest blow to my heart and soul that I have ever felt. This little book had all the answers for my breaking heart and I read it time and time again. My son was a Christian and there is great rejoicing in that. Death is a journey we all take and I know it was my son's time to go and I shall see him again. I will be buying many copies of this book to give out as I come across others who suffer the pain of losing someone they love. The heartache never really goes away, but the words bring a calming to the soul. Thank God for His love."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of God's Vessels,","review":"I have found this book very informative, easy to comprehend, showing the ever important process of grieving, one must accept and walk through to become a healthier person capable of helping a friend to walk the same path."},{"rating":"2","title":"One to read","review":"I've read many books on the subject of loss, grieving and the process necessary to work through the pain that comes from the death of a loved one. When one of my children died, I received tons of books from friends. This book was one of two that made it to my bedside and I give to others. I say that none of us get out of this alive but somehow we're never ready to let go of our loved ones. This book helped me find my way on the journey through grief."},{"rating":"2","title":"A book that aids the journey in accepting the loss of a loved one.","review":"This book was given to me when I lost my wife at 58 years of age to heart disease.

It has been placed in the bookstore of a Seattle area church because it was so well received by a grief support group."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comprehensive","review":"Grief, whether parents, spouse, friend, is devastating and complicated. Finding \\"the right\\" comfort for the bereaved is challenging. However, this book is extremely helpful, no matter what circumstances. When my mother died, I was overwhelmed with fatigue, and unbelievable loss. A friend sent me this book. A chapter a day is manageable...and so I began my \\"journey.\\" Some days I read and meditated on several chapters. At the end of 4 months, one day I woke up, feeling refreshed, and NOT FATIGUED any more! It was mind-boggling! Amazing. No one had prepared me for the physical stages of grief. This book does more than soothe the soul; it gives shared experiences in order to understand the deep process of grieving.I have given dozens (!) of copies of this book, to friends & family who are suffering and grieving!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Voice of Experience","review":"My daughter-in-law gave me this book after my husband's memorial. By the time I got to page 22 I knew that the authors had truly \\"been there\\". They had experienced the loss of a loved one & were able to express their feelings in a way anyone can understand. It helped me understand that the emotions, short term memory loss, etc. are a part of the normal grieving process - I wasn't going crazy & they were not permanent changes. What a relief!! It took me a year to read completely through the book (I kept going back & re-reading parts). Also, this isn't a book one pickups & reads like a novel. It's best read in bits & spurts. Since then I have given several to friends & family who have lost loved ones. I recommend \\"Grieving The Loss of Someone You Love\\" for anyone, both believers & non-believers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Practical and Inspiring help in a time of grief","review":"As a funeral directer, I highly recommend this little booklet.

More important, his idea of mediation really does work. The book is easy to read, clear, and convincing."},{"rating":"2","title":"WANT TO AVOID NEEDLESS EXPENSE & BLOODHSED?","review":"If you are facing any kind of legal dispute and want to avoid needless expense and bloodshed, by all means BY THIS BOOK AND READ IT CAREFULLY as you would a valuable reference source.The author cuts through legal gobbledook and speaks to all of us in plain, easy-to-understand language. It's user friendly. At the same time, it is an expose of the legal profession -- how lawyers charge what they do and control the way we think -- and how to take control back. I was surprised to learn than we have the right to hire and fire a lawyer at will, the right to question a lawyer's bill, and the right to fee arbitration.Even more, I was impressed by Mr. Gerstl's suggestions for a better, SANER way to resolve conflicts. It's about time we had a book like this."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fascinating anecdotes, but how many are true?","review":"This is probably the most detailed account in English of the court of Tz'u-hsi. You get character sketches of the prominent figures that reaveal far more of their motivations and personality than any normal history of the period. Most of the book is based on solid factual information from diaries and Chinese histories. It's a pity that this is mingled with legendary anecdotes and no attempt is made to assess their veracity. Professor Woo could have supplied some endnotes to help with this. Still, it's an entertaining read and very helpful for understanding the late Ch'ing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Reads like a pulp novel","review":"This account of Empress Dowager Cixi reads suspiciously like a scene-by-scene synopsis of a serialized (TV) dramatization of the Empress' life.The's very little in the way of documented fact but lots of melodramatic scenes and made-up dialogue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Big Deal...","review":"Don't know where the other websites are finding the stellar reviews on this one.

He attacks moral philosophy as being irrelevant for helping make important legal or any other kind of decision. Instead he advocates a pragmatic, empirical approach. To paraphrase Jeffrey Rosen of the New Republic, if we lived in a sane society, the Senate would beg Posner to be Chief Justice of the Supreme Court. Unfortunately, for our society, Posner has not only left a long paper trail, but a paper super highway."},{"rating":"2","title":"Growing Up","review":"This short book tells the story of a young man, Paul Matthew Taylor, whose drive to find God at the age of 17 blinds him to what a year later he realizes is the most important thing in life, namely, love. The crisis generated by his determination to force God upon his first girl friend, Julie, leads him to discover Seattle, alcohol, drugs, sex, a girl who wears a nose ring and boys who wear earrings. His earlier, secluded life, as an only child living in a Northwestern Washington town, dominated by the presence of the sea (seething ocean) and the beauty of nature (that damned eagle), seems to have left him poorly prepared for his new life. But slowly and resolutely, with a determination that reflects an inner strength that he probably is unaware of himself, he emerges a more mature and sensible human being. I found his transformation to be believable and a good read. A book to be recommended."},{"rating":"1","title":"not even close","review":"This is really a lot of dribble.

However, it never claimed to be. It's selling point is size which is perfect. The way to view missed alarms or calls without opening the phone is to press the button on the right side of the phone. (Read the manual, maybe?!) My photos are great, and I have printed them before. If you want a bells and whistles phone, you should probably research a little more thoroughly before complaining about features that were never claimed to exist."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love the phone, hate the battery life!","review":"Having had every new gadget imaginable I must report that I LOVE this phone because I can take pictures and make videos! I LOATHE having to charge the battery everyday! Perhaps I just got a bad battery but I've NEVER had to charge any phone daily. Keep in mind that I leave my phone on 24/7. Maybe I should turn it off. Does anyone else have this same syndrome?If you're a shutterbug like me, you will love this phone. I didn't even mention the hot pink/magenta color which all gals love.One note of caution, If you live in hurricane alley like me, you may want to carry a spare battery just in case they don't take down the cell phone towers before the storm.

I thought the Sidekick was bad, this one was worse! It gets hot as soon as you put it up to your ear, and it may be thin but it's big once you open it. I charged the phone for 24hrs before I used it, the phone never held a charge all day. AND when I would flip the phone open to use it, it would just shut off. Now maybe mine was a defective phone, but I returned it 12 days after I bought it and went back to my Sidekick. And by the way, the excitement of it being \\"magenta\\" (which it really does look like the color they show if you buy from T-mobile)...wears off about 24hrs after having it!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"My favorite phone!","review":"I have had my Razr for over a year now, and I adore it. I am not tech-savvy enough to work all of the things it can do, but everything I can use I really like. The hot pink color is SO CUTE- I love it. My grandma and I share a family plan, and she actually switched us from Verizon to T-Mobile for this hot pink phone because the verizon pink is pale and boring. I was skeptical, but now I like it. The slim size is very convenient.Things I don't like are the huge window on the front- it picks up fingerprints very easily. Another reviewer said hers doesn't give alerts on the window, but mine does, so perhaps there is a problem with that other phone? I also have a small problem with the alarm clock; it works great but I have deleted an alarm I used to need and it still goes off... at midnight each night... but this isn't a big deal to me, since it only beeps once and then is quiet :)Overall awesome phone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Love it!","review":"I got it for Christmas and I love it. I have had NO trouble with it at all. The only thing that sometimes gets annoying is that I have these one pair of pants and the pockets must be too big or something, because every time I put my phone in my pocket and go somewhere in the car, or sit down.....when I get up, It falls out of my pocket. I have \\"lost\\" my phone at least twice because of that happening........but don't worry, it was in the car(where it fell out of my pocket)! But this has nothing to do with the phone. I guess it is just my pockets because those are the only pants they do that on. But I REALLY, REALLY LOVE this phone!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"I was so excited to get my first \\"cool\\" phone. . .I've always had perfectly serviceable, but boring, cell phones and when I saw the pink Razr, I knew I wanted one. I saved my pennies and gave myself an end-of-school-year present.I have only had this phone for a month, but I am horribly disappointed. It has horrible reception (and I know it's not the network because I tested it side by side with other t-mobile phones) and drops more than half of my calls. It also turns itself off ALL THE TIME - in the middle of conversation, while in your pocket, whenever. I went back to t-mobile and they are sending me a new Samsung, but I'm sort of disappointed that my pretty pink phone didn't live up to expectations. :("},{"rating":"1","title":"DO NOT BUY","review":"This Phone looks appealing but the features are not at all. This phone is for someone who just wants to call and text. I bought this phone about the end of febuary. The camera quality is not good it looks too grey even when you adjust the settings. The video only records like 10(ten) seconds not good if you are trying to record a kodak moment :). The phone takes FOREVER to charge like 2 to 5 hours literally. The phone screen cracks easily i dropped mine closed and the liquid started coming out so i had to get a new one. ONLY buy this phone if you are only trying to text or call out.

The book is sumptuous -- filled with the recipes from this food-lovers' paradise (including the mangos flameados recipe I was hoping to get hold of) and filled with photos of the dining rooms, including all the artwork.

I was pleasantly relieved. Chbosky certainly summoned the tradition of Holden Caufield in Charlie but created a modern portrait that has reinvigorated the genre. Charlie, like Caufield, lacks the adolescent spirit of complascency and instead allows his mind to ponder truth where there are only lies. Charlie has his friends, who have clearly lived the same hell, to guide him through the gauntlet of acceptance, understanding and presence. Charlie's age is inconsequential. And while his experiences are hardly universal, he seeks and finds (most of) the answers that subconsciously trouble a generation. Charlie seeks the answers to the questions most of us will not ask. Chbosky has personified the voice of our generation."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the Best","review":"I read this book because I saw 5 people reading it who couldn't put it down, neither could I! Although it has some \\"uncomfotable\\" scenes, it's very, very well writen. It's hard to believe that an older person can write in the state of mind that all teenagers think in. I've read 3 times so far and it still hasn't lost it's touch. I applaud Steven Chbosky for his extremly gifted talent Bravo and read this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Really Good Book","review":"This book could not possibly portray an actual teen's life, but it was a really great read anyway.

You feel Charlie's pain of what he's going through. We have all lost friends along the way and maybe not like Charlie but we still have. You lose touch with them but some friends you just can't lose no matter what. I live this book because you can relate to the pain and suffering of school and just life when your a teenager.

I found myself laughing, and sometimes I felt a pit in my stomach. Definitely worth the read. Just a though, while reading, really take time to remember things taking place, it will make it easier at the end of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book ever","review":"I Absolutely loved this book. It had simple way of looking at complicated things. I would reccomend this to anyone"},{"rating":"2","title":"really good book","review":"This book was wonderful. I could really relate to Charlie, andI think a lot of other teens can too. Well, maybe I am only like himin the way I think...because I do \\"teenage stuff\\" much more than Charlie seems to. (You know, joining clubs, playing sports, being in student government, and hanging out with my friends--aka running around the city with my friends at 3am screaming \\"It's nighttime!!!\\") Still--if Charlie were real, I think we would be very good friends. But anyway, all that really has nothing to do with the book. (I started out trying to explain how real Charlie seemed, honest.)...JUST BUY THE BOOK! <---Because it is great...sorry to all the people who read this expecting a real review. PS Have a nice day everybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"poorly constructed, trite.","review":"It's unsurprising that this is an MTV offering.

I've fallen in love with this book. It's life altering... It is beautiful. I read it in 3 hours, and I read it again. I've read it about 5 times. I don't know, I love it and I could never express how great this book is. Hey, Stephen Chbosky! Come out with a sequal.. I'm dying to know what happens next! Okay to sum this all up, at the end of the book I felt \\"infinite\\"."},{"rating":"2","title":"Offers a unique perspective.","review":"Charlie's letter are singular and unique at the same time. More intimate than a diary,We may not know who he is writing. All we know is the world he shares."},{"rating":"2","title":"Worthwhile!","review":"I'd been told that this book was similar to The Catcher in the Rye, and it is on some levels. It's structured as a series of letters from the main character (Charlie) to an unknown recipient. Charlie is a delightful main character...introspective, sensitive, insightful, and never angsty (this is the big difference from Catcher). Chbosky tackles pretty much every issue that a teen could possibly face...drugs, alcohol, love, loss, you name it. While I didn't find it to be the most original book, I loved the writing style and there were a ton of great quotes. As a plus for book lovers Charlie reads a good number of well-loved classics and gives his opinions on them as he relates them to his life. Some of the titles include The Fountainhead, The Catcher in the Rye, The Stranger, The Great Gatsby, and To Kill a Mockingbird. Overall very touching and engrossing."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great!","review":"This book was awesome. Most definitely recommend. The perks of being a wallflower met every expectation that I had built up in my mind."},{"rating":"1","title":"Awful movie, I'm sure the book is worse","review":"This is 90 minutes of my life I will never get back. I cannot relate to any of this at all. There is nothing good about children getting molested, look what it has done for our tyrannical President. There is nothing good about being homosexual. Most rational people will reject every idea in this book/movie. Don't waste even one second reading this or watching the movie, you will be a lesser person for having done so."},{"rating":"2","title":"kinda depressing","review":"So this is a good read about teenage angst. The ending is sad but over all I like that it closed the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Catcher in the Wallflower","review":"I wanted to like this, I did- it's one of the original YA book! But the borrowing from The Catcher in the Rye was just too much for me. And before you protest that it's original (and there are some differences- that's why I was able to give it 2 stars) let's take a look at some similarities:- Both are well-read- Both end with the main character going to a mental facility- Both rely on teachers as mentors (and both visit their homes)- Both protagonists are very intelligent- Both have trouble making new friends- Both are very affected by dead family member- Both are self-aware (they know that they are struggling)- Both have similar syntax- Both have experimentation with alcohol/drugs- Both are intimidated by sex- Both are respectful of women- Both are from the first person narratives- Both value sibingsDrop mic."},{"rating":"2","title":"A wonderful interpretation of the modern-day teenager's life","review":"The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a wonderful interpretation of the modern-day teenager that reflects the different types of things that todays teenagers go through.

You find yourself routing for him and becoming his friend as you read. Just as you would do for any \\"underdog\\" who is trying to change their life for the better. The movie and book were both equally powerful, thanks to the genius writer of this book. He also wrote the screenplay for the movie. I didn't want the book to finish because I felt like I lost a friend in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"THIS BOOK ACTUALLY TAUGHT ME SOMETHING!","review":"I had heard of this book a while back but overlooked it. Then, I recently saw the trailer for the movie version of this book. Therefore, I wanted to read it before the movie came out to compare it. It is the beginning of summer and I was coming out of a stressful year. I found myself at this party not dancing. Then I though, wow I must be a wallflower. I downloaded the book the next day on my kindle. I finished the book that same day. There are some things in this book like drugs I do not advise. However, what this book taught me was that you can't live your life being a wallflower. It has truly changed my outlook on some things. I RECOMMEND THIS BOOK SO MUCH! YOU HAVE TO READ IT!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Insights into Meaning","review":"Chbosky uses his character Charlie's first-person narrative to explore those moments in day-to-day life that mean so much, but so often escape words.

I am looking forward to re-reading this book again and again, and would reccommend it to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"great book","review":"A coming of age book.

Until I read ...Wallflower, i didn't think a book of this kind could compete with(...). I loved it because it tells the story in a real aspect, the way teens can understand. I enjoyed how it wasn't glossed over...it told of kids doing drugs and experimenting with their sexuality and suppressing feelings and memories. It was raw and emotional, just like us teens. Any teenage or young adult could appreciate and relate to this book. I found many things to relate to while reading it, and I have never done drugs or experienced the death of a close friend. It's not just a book for suicidal or melodramatic teens, it can touch anyone's heart. Pick up a copy of this book immediately."},{"rating":"2","title":"None","review":"At first, I thought The Perks of Being a Wallflower wasn't for me.

A touching story, just did not meet my expectations. Not a book I will be recommending."},{"rating":"2","title":"On Being Infinite . . .","review":"Just when a book hits the stand with numerous reviews, many readers are born thereafter. Mine was such an occurrence. For some reason, some books are banned from U.S. public school reading lists every year. This novel happened to be one of these. I sought the book after reading the censorship article. Then, I understood the need for books that speak to our time--without regard to convention--to begin the necessary revisionist tradition.I read this book in one gulp. Chbosky's voice enters Charlie's world with depth and clarity. No one could have done this better than a gifted writer such as Chbosky who enters the halls of Charlie's mind and feelings. The novel speaks to readers of all colors and ages. This is a necessary coming-of-age novel, and I cannot compare it to any other young adult novel. Indeed, there are many \\"perks of being a wallflower.\\"...."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This book was so good I sat there and read for hours I read it in two days it was interesting and I liked how I could relate to his thoughts because I'm also pretty shy I would recommend this book to young adults it has some sexual content but not to bad and it also is funny.

It had a huge unexpected twist, at the end of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Relatable","review":"This book is a story that should be read by those who are afraid or who need inspiration about new experiences or new surroundings. This is a book that gives good insight into how to deal with situations and how to become who you want to be not who everyone else wants you to be.I absolutely loved this book and can read it over and over.

Thank you for showing me that I am a wall flower and its ok to be one."},{"rating":"2","title":"amazing","review":"this is an amazing coming of age book. It is short, around 200 pages or so, but boy does it pack in personality. You fall in love with the characters immediately and can identify with them as well. I would suggest this as a read to any teenager going through a rough time in high school. Although I read it when I was 22, and still loved it. Can't wait for the movie!"},{"rating":"2","title":"I really liked it","review":"I like the way the story is told through letters written by Charlie and how we only see things from his perspective. And I loved all of the songs and music references in the book - the mix tapes really took me back. Perks tells a familiar story but not in a cliche way. It is really thoughtful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"If I could I would give this book infinite stars. I am a teenager and this book was so wonderful I actually wished I could have gone back and lived during that time. Charlie was sweet and I like the idea of writing a book as a series of letters. It was sort of like a diary, but better. It highlighted his love for Sam and Patrick, his cluelessness when it came to Mary Elizabeth and Alice. Patrick and Brads story was touching and Sam's past was understandable. I would recommend this for young adults/teenagers. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Life-effecting","review":"This book was TERIFFIC.

The book is written in such a way, where you can relate to the main character and actually feel the emotions he's feeling. I read the book in four hours because I couldn't bare to put it down. This book definitly changed me. I think about life a little differently after I read this. There are some books that everyone absolutely needs to read and this is one of them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read!!","review":"In an age where we all may have forgotten what high school was like comes this thrilling tale of Charlies adventures through his first year of high school. I found this book very fascinating from start to finish. I bought the book because I had read great reviews and I had seen that a movie was being made starring Emma Watson. I was curious, and was not let down. Charlie's every emotion is set into writing as he writes letters retelling about the many journeys that he makes. I recommend this book to anyone looking for a new type of book to read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting","review":"I dont really know what makes this book so good. Maybe it's the fact that this boy is so messed up in the head, or the weridness of it. Whatever it is i think anyone will like it. Truthfully this isnt my type of book, but it seeemed to work out. If it would of had a different main character i might have hated it, but it didnt, So i loved it. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"AWESOME BOOK","review":"I strongly reccomend this book to any high school teenager out there. This is without a doubt the best book i have ever read. It is based on a teenager named Charlie, who is a very big outcast in High School, but during Freshman year he made friends, and he also made some bad choices. Through the whole book you will laugh with Charlie, and you will also cry with him. After you read this book, your views on how you treat people will be corrupted. It lets you see High School life through an outcast's percpective. I strongly recommend this book and think that every high school teenager should read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing ok","review":"I loved this book so much.

The only thing I can compare it to is a bad '70s 'After School Special'."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perks of Being a Wallflower","review":"I think the Perks of Being a Wallflower is one of the best books I have ever read. It is a detailed and realistic story of a boy named Charlie and his struggles. He is a 15 year old High School boy that is going through hard times. His Aunt Helen died years ago but he still blames it on himself. Stephen Chbosky gives an accurate and believable life to Charlie, in that Charlie experiences the things that the average high schooler does go through, including sex, drugs, and problems with his peers. Since the story is written in letter format, it shows that Charlie is being honest about his experiences. However, I would not recomend this book to anybody under the age of 13 because of the mature themes in this book. Otherwise, anybody over the age of 13 that is in high school, or has ever gone through and experienced high school, can easily relate to this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"love","review":"this is one of my favorite books. from the first chapter i was in love with Charlie [the main character] and although it does deal with some sketchy material, the book was relevant to my teenage life [as a 16 yr old]"},{"rating":"2","title":"Perks","review":"this book is a true masterpiece, and will soon become a classic. i have lent this to many of my friends and they have gone on and invested it themselves. it is a good book to have in your colection, and i would reccomend it to anyone who thinks they're mature enough to handle the bumpy ride of being a teenager missfit."},{"rating":"2","title":"I need to hug Charlie","review":"Ohhh man... Charlie is one of the few charecters I wish I knew. I would call Charlie any time of day if I had the chance. Alas, it was only a book. A lovable one, I might add. If I could meet Steven Chbosky again I'd probably hug him and never let go. It's so nice to hear a voice so intimate. This book hits so many different levels, it's just astounding. After reading this in one night, I lent it to a friend of mine who also read it in one night. I could never compare it to \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" because Charlie feels like a best friend, not a stranger."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Book!","review":"I read this book about a year ago, after I was sent it by my mum as a gift. I had heard alot about this book from the internet, and after finding out it was made into a movie I knew I had to read it before I saw it! I was definitely impressed by the writing that Chbosky did, and it was a really good young adult book. The plot was impressive, but at the time I was unable to get through it in one go, and kept putting it off (not that I didn't like it) It has a really good concept of Charlie, and how he is kind of a loner (which we can all relate to from some point in our life)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"Amazing is one word to describe this book in my opinion.I have read many books based on guys opinions and usually their feelings are not expressed as well. Charlie in this book is the sweetest, cutest boy you will ever \\"know\\".He seems to be very caring and he is always worried about other people's lives and is always carrying other people's problems on his shoulders.Throughout the whole book we learn about his life by reading letters he is writing to us I suppose? So we begin to see things in his eyes and feel things the way he does.I don't know what it was about this book but it made me love the main character and in a way feel very bad for him because he cared about people so much yet no one really seemed to care about him too much.I thought this was a very good book and everybody should definately read it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A beautiful book that will make you both smile and cry.","review":"This book was amazing. It is about a freshman named Charlie who is having trouble fitting in to his everyday life, since his aunt died and his best friend committed suicide. It is the story of how he learns to deal. It is much more open and raw than any novel though. This story is made up of letters that Charlie writes to an anonymous character. Charlie is so genuine, caring, and real, that I assure you that you will fall in love with him as well as this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"from smile to cry","review":"This is definitely my favorite book! It is a well written story about Charlie and his freshman year. He has a very different insight in situations and his way of thinking is very interesting. All the emotions expressed in the story feel so real and make you want to either smile or cry. It makes you think about your decisions and your life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Short One","review":"I read this book my Freshman Year in College.

Don't get me wrong some parts were in deed interesting but I felt as if the book had no meaning to it, and if it did, it should be more clear to what that meaning is. The ending was quite confusing, the writing was just plain TERRIBLE, no words can describe, and the main character (charlie) wasn't very likable (unless your the type to like EXTREMELY sensitive crybaby's who sulk all the time) The book had some potential at first, but then slowly started going downhill. The only reason I got myself to finish reading it was because I thought it would get interesting again, but of course it didn't."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Perks of Being a Wallflower","review":"This book was on a recommended reading list from a seventh grade English teacher.Though well written, I think it is inappropriate for the average young teen. The main character'sdiary, started after the suicide of his best friend, relates experimenting with drugs andalcohol and observing acquaintances having intercourse. The main character hassensitive issues in his life. Thankfully psychiatric treatment and close friends help himfind peace and maturity. Careful guidance is needed for a young person reading this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The one book I hype like no other","review":"A few years ago a friend of mine bought me this book. I quite enjoyed it at the time. I forgot about it until last November when i was going through my old belongings, and found it.

A month or so later, I read it again and still enjoyed it.I just think the novel provides an interesting look at relationships. I believe we can all relate to at least some of it.Anyway, I've now bought this book for three friends, all of whom liked it.

This was a trite piece of garbage. The prose is absoultley atrocious (yeah I know the author was trying to pull off the confessional letters of a young high school kid- but the character is supposed to be a smart writer.) The book explores the character's passive behavior is borderline autistic. And it's fine and great to have a male character that expresses emotion, but the kid cries every two pages. Jesus.I can't believe I actually finished this crap. It's rare that you really read a truly awful book. It is too much of a time investment to read a whole novel without being pretty sure it's going to be good. But I fell for some of the hype surrounding the book. I should have known better. MTV lowers the discourse a little further."},{"rating":"1","title":"There are better books","review":"This book is about a teenage boy at highschool and his problems in life. The book is written in a letter format and it describes love, drugs, homosexuality, friendship, feelings and thoughs the maincharacter Charlie is confrontated with.To me the book started good full of ideas and awaking interest for Charlie's life. But unfortunately the author didn't manage to keep his novel at this niveau, the excitement got lost and the reader - me - got bored. The more pages and letters I read, the more I disliked the book and I was quite happy when I finished it, maybe because Charlie's character made the story too foreseeable. When Charlie kissed Sam although he knew he would get in trouble, it was foreseeable to the reader.The repetitions of some of Charlie's characteristics like his being honest and bad at adapting to new situations complete the image the reader gets, but they excite as \\"much\\" as the rest of the plot.To sum up: There are better books."},{"rating":"1","title":"inappropriate for young teens","review":"I found this book to be way too explicit for young teens.

His novel echoes the heartache that is known as growing up.Chbosky introduces his protagonist and narrator, Charlie, through a series of letters written to someone who remains unknown to the reader.Charlie, a young man entering high school, intimately narrates his freshman year through his letters. He shares his encounters with friends, drugs, sex, school, family and the Rocky Horror Picture Show.By the end, readers will understand Charlie's misery as he reveals a devastating truth that forever changes his life.Chbosky uniquely describes the transitional years of young adulthood in this novel.

After reading the first diary entry, I knew I liked it, but I didn't feel connected to it yet. The story is about a boy named Charlie who is a freshmen in high school with no friends. His brother is a freshmen in college and his sister a senior in high school. I love how the book is written in diary entry form because it makes it seem more personal.The Perks of Being a Wallflower is personal, intense, and real. you get to meet Charlie, his family, and the friends he make along the way. You also get to meet his friend who passed on and his late Aunt Helen. This story never drags on and stays at a good pace.You really experience teenage life as it is today even though the book was written in 1991. It deals with deaths, crushes, relationships, pregnancies, and much more. After finishing this book, I definitely felt a connection to Charlie; it felt like we were walking in each other shoes."},{"rating":"2","title":"My First Time","review":"\\"Perks\\" was my first book that followed me everywhere.

And just to let you know, I read a lot, 7 books in the past nine days. The fact is, that this book is life and more speicifically, it was me, and everything about me. Chbosky's character development through Charlie's letters just made this wonderful humbling impression on me.When I finished this book today, all I could think of was reading this book over, like Charlie does. It was absolutely the best ever, and I strongly suggest you BUY this. It is nearly a bible for anyone who has ever been hurt,ever been in a weird situation ever been in high school or in love.This truly is a masterpiece! Read this book on the perfect night, during the perfect drive, to feel totally infinite and nostalgic, its the best advice I can give anyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"best book i have ever read","review":"i began reading this book last december, my freshman year of high school. i finished it in two days. i honestly could not put it down, i have since read it at least four more times. each time i read it, it gets better. charlie's experiences helped me understand the politics of high school a little better and appreciate my friends a little more. he seems to have this untainted outlook on life that we all wish we had. he is able to see the good in almost everyone, or maybe he's just able to block out the bad. in any case he is a character that everyone can relate to and understand completely, even though not everyone has had the experiences he has. he makes you appreciate things a bit more, and see the world a little more innocently. steven chbosky has done a wonderful job of creating an emotional rollercoaster of a book. you don't have to be an outsider to love this book. it's just wonderful."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not Very Many Perks","review":"Charlie, the main character, is experiencing his first year of high school. His friend past away during the summer and he is very nervous about high school. He relieves some of this nervousness by writing letters(the format of the book) to an annonymous recipient, whose identity is never revealed. The letter writing was recommended by his English teacher, in which Charlie has an abnormal relationship with. Charlie meets two friends who are seniors. They make his first year experiences, somewhat too mature and illegal for anyone.After reading this book, I was left with an unsettling feeling. I was very surprised and disturbed by the content of this book. Some of Charlie's experiences, I feel should not have been shared. If Mr. Chobsky felt that he needed to share every experience, then I think he should have used some discretion. I think this book is a bit too crude for young adults. I would not broadcast or recommend this book for high school students."},{"rating":"1","title":"Lack Luster Tale of Childhood","review":"im not exactly sure what i expected to read when i ordered this book. i suppose i should have known what i was getting into when the topic was \\"young adult\\". i assume now that this book in poiniant on a lower reading level and i would have enjoyed it more if i wasnt a recent high school graduate. it seemed to me like a older, more explicit version of \\"dear mister henshaw\\", a kids book for those of you unfamiliar. this book moves slowly and eventually never comes to a point. the child runs rampant with no real remorse. many issues arent explored, ie the realtionship with his teacher and his apparently disjointed family life. all in all, the book was disappointing and left something to be desired.sorry all you 5-star critics. try some classics and youll know exactly where im coming from. for a deeper taste of angst, try \\"ordinary people\\" and \\"catcher in the rye\\". thank you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Intresting story!","review":"It was an interesting story, it took a little while to really get into the book. Once I got into it, it was really good."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not expecting much but a pleasant surprise","review":"I read this book based on others reviews but wasn't really expecting much, figured just another coming of age book. It was one of those books that I couldn't wait to get back to every time I put it down. It was well written and flowed easily.Even after finishing the book, the characters remain with you"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is not for teens","review":"This book is not for teens and young adults. It was a gift for a 13 year old, but I had to retrieve the book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very disappointing...","review":"I can't believe people can relate to a 15-year-old who feels it's necessary to describe even the most mundane and common things (like swirlies), who cries every other page, and who has an unhealthy relationship with a dead Aunt. To top it off: you never know who he's writing these letters to, and if the person is as much a stranger as Charlie says he is, I hope he's been throwing them away unread. The only good character was Patrick. I really liked him and was rooting for him, not Charlie, the entire book.Save yourself the time and read Catcher in the Rye instead."},{"rating":"1","title":"Loved the book! But shipping took forever!","review":"The Perks of Being a Wallflower was a great book! It was short but still a great read. I bought the book for my book club and I received it when we had already moved on to are next book. I bought the book from this seller especially because of the fast shipping reviews and info on the seller. But I finally got the book almost a month after I ordered it. Overall the book was not worth it, I did not even need it since it came so late."},{"rating":"2","title":"great!","review":"Overall a great book! Though it took a long time to read when its not that long so I'm giving it a four!"},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting combo","review":"Loved the style of writing that let me feel like I was reading letters from the main character. Less cumbersome than traditional writing. I was at once on the edge of my seat waiting for the bomb to drop, a little weary of the humdrum random chatter, and laughing out loud. I was anxious to find out what exactly ailed the main character. Brilliant."},{"rating":"2","title":"interesting read","review":"This book was a good read overall, loved all the music references throughout as well. It was written in the form of letters, which I wasn't expecting but that did not take away anything from flow of the story. Pretty funny at parts and definitely a smart coming of age story."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not good","review":"It's too obvious that a late-twenties-early-thirties man wrote this book. The dialogue isn't what teenagers talk like (trust me, I know.) He gets in a fight at school. It's summed up in two lines. The characters are underdeveloped. I couldn't tell one of his friends from the next. Again, the language and style of writing bothered me. It was clearly written by an adult trying to write from a teenagers perspective, and that's what ruined this book for me."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTING.","review":"Personally, I was disappointed. Based on the great reviews this book is getting on Amazon, I assumed it would have a lot to offer. I found Charlie flat and somewhat one-dimentional. Chbosky's attempts to build a character based on lists of his favouriute books and songs just don't cut it for me. Nor did the ending evoke any feelings of pathos- I found it to be a cheap trick by the writer to try and make his story moving and touching with the ending he wrote for TPOBAW. I will credit him that the letter-format added a personal touch but this was annihilated because I could not become close to a character when all the time the protagonist showed through so clearly Chbosky's attempts to build him into something deep, causing him to come across as shallow -quite the opposite.I'm sure this book does have something to offer because so many reviewers have raved about it but in my opinion this book left me empty and dissatisfied."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perks of Being 15","review":"This is probably the best story I have ever read. Chbosky tells the coming of age of a teenage boy with the wisdom of an old man mixed with the honesty of a child. I felt that I was the recipient of Charlie's letters. I kept waiting to bump into him on the street. Incredible characterization. Truly a classic in its own time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Less than expected","review":"This book had me turning from page to page, however, it didn't make that much sense to me nor had much interest. I expected a lot more and don't think I would recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"i am a wallflower","review":"being a wallflower i can really relate to this book i think it was a great real life look at teenage life through that kid who sits infront of you in science class i think all teenagers should have to read it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perks of Being a Wallflower","review":"i thouroughly enjoyed this collection of letters about one \\"wallflower's\\" experiences in high school. i never understood wallflowers or why they chose to be that way, and yet now i understand what it's like cuz i realize that i'm one too! while giving you the troubling experiences of a burdened student you are exposed to many of the \\"secrets\\" of high school, ... and life. not everyone is able to go throught the growing processes that he was able to but luckily we can learn from them with out actually experiencing them ourselves!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Heartfelt...and truthful","review":"The Perks of Being A Wallflower will touch anyone who reads it. Charlie is a insightful, lovable,character, and his letters profound. This book is one not soon forgotten."},{"rating":"1","title":"The perks of being a wallflower","review":"This book was amazing. I cried when I finished 2 hours after I bought it! I encourage everyone to read this heartfelt book. Best book ever. Such a great story and I'm going to read this again and again. I loved Charlie and him explaining his life. 5 stars!!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful","review":"So lovely written and such a heart wrenching story of growing up in high school. I felt like I was there with Charlie and wanted to help be his friend. It felt real because it is a time we all go through. I loved it. Required reading for anyone with a teenager I would think."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perks of being a wallflower","review":"This is probably one of the greatest books I've ever read. So relatable, and makes you feel...well...infinite. a must read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book!!","review":"This was an amazing book. Definitely shoes the perspectives of high school and life. I'm a teenager and loved this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Suspenseful","review":"This book was very touching in that I learned a lot about being happy and developing friendships. I especially enjoyed the characters and how their roles were brought about; Charlie\`s especially. The amount of times charlie and his friends cried made the theme especially sentimental. Although there was no evident plot to the story, the overarching meaning of the novel stands out. I did like how the reader is immediately in suspense questioning if there is indeed something wrong with Charlie. Revealing in the end how he was raped my his aunt as a child completes the book and ties everything together."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very strange","review":"This book was hard to follow. Every time I thought I understood it something would happen that was peculiar again. I didn't like the format either. It is laid out as the main character writing letters to someone and he doesn't even know the person"},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting:)","review":"I loved the format of writing. The story line was inspiring, motivating, and deals with every day situations. A must read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great story","review":"Not normally a fan of YA, this book kept me captivated the whole time. I loved the characters and the story. Brilliant."},{"rating":"1","title":"Hated It","review":"I personally hated this book. I thought it was weird, written badly and too repetitive. I didn't like the style of writing either; the whole book is just letter after letter describing this poor kids life, thoughts and exeriences. The subjects made me uncomfortable making me almost find this book trashy rather than enjoyable at all. This is just my personal opinion and if you feel the same way, don't waste your money. I don't see how this book is popular at all."},{"rating":"2","title":"'An excellent look inside the reality of being a teenager'","review":"This book was amazingly true. It flowed and had witty technique along the lines. I, myself, am a 13 year old and I related to this book as much as I related to 'The Catcher in the Rye' which is my all-time favorite. Charlie in 'The Perks of Being a Wallflower' is the stereotype of a teenager. He's scared and comfortable at the same time in his changing surroundings. His life is so many other teens' everyday exsistance. I would recommend this book to adolescents or parents with teenage children. Some of it might surprise you but you will soon realize that the book is hardly fiction and that the 90s come with a price."},{"rating":"2","title":"If you're in high school, at least TRY to read this book","review":"I have been waiting for this book for a while, and the day I got it I started reading. After an hour, I stopped reading, trying not to spoil the ending and the rest of the book, but I picked the book up again and kept reading. And once I finished it, I'm reading it again for a second time. In my opinion, this book is that good that you can't leave it unfinished. However, this book should be read ONLY be people who 1. Are not teachers, and 2. Have actually been into high school (no little middle schoolers here!) Otherwise, you should really like this book. The fact that it is in the early 90's shouldn't throw you off that much. I thought that it was better than Catcher in the Rye, but that's my opinion, so you'll have to read it for yourself."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perks of Being a Wallflower","review":"I picked this book up from the school library, because I needed something to read and I happened to find this, which is also on my book list. So anyways, I just wanted to pass the time before I got on to my other books, and when I started this book I was definitely not expecting it to be this good! I honestly really liked this book. It reminds me of some people I know, mostly the quiet ones. But this book is about a teenager who has trouble finding friends and misses his aunt, and so he finds real friends and realizes that he is special.The ending was strange, but otherwise this is really good."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perk's Review","review":"I thought the book was depressing and a little hard to follow towards the end. It's sad to think that some people are feeling like Charlie was."},{"rating":"1","title":"Review","review":"Very interesting book. Entertaining but awkward and vulgar at some points. Very straight forward. However, I really enjoyed the writing style."},{"rating":"2","title":"Pretty good.","review":"Was not expecting the whole letter system. I don't know it wasn't my thing. Good story though. Three more words."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best, most realistic teen-age account of growing up.","review":"This book is a refreshing change to the \\"trials\\" of growing up. Instead of the un-realistic \\"dates are my biggest problem\\" theme, Charlie (the narrator who writes in the form of letters to an anonymous friend) tackles REAL problems facing the world. Drugs, sex, fear, guilt, parties, death, and friends leaving- even rape and abortion. Emotions and issues are illustrated, not explained.By the time you finish the book, you will be immersed completely in Charlie's world. The book is suddenly over, after Charlie's recovery from severe depression and hospitalization- even though you've known the end was coming. I hope to read someday about the rest of Charlie's life. I began to feel that I was the anonymous friend Charlie was writing to."},{"rating":"1","title":"Didn't enjoy it much at all","review":"I bought this book because of all the hype around it. Too bad that's all there is to it. This book is very cliche, the main character isn't even realistic and seems very fake, especially with the wording, to be honest. The loners at my school are more human than the main character in this story, which makes sense because they're not fake. I think this book isn't worth your time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Ick!","review":"I couldn't read this one...I got about 10 pages in and put it down two or three times. I have finally given up and won't be reading it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perks!","review":"I thought the book was amazing! The movie I hope will be just as good. I liked it a lot but for the longest time I did not know he was on drugs,or that whole ordeal with his aunt Helen. Other than that it was great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A Phenomenal Read and Emotionally Honest.","review":"A Phenomenal Read and Emotionally Honest. It will stir your emotions leaving you craving for more. Fantastically vulnerable and wickedly smart."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"This book was fantastic. I cried and laughed. My heart ached with Charlie during the tough times and soared during the good. I finished this book and just cried."},{"rating":"2","title":"Eh","review":"The plot is entertaining, tho not particularly well-constructed. The writing style will drive you nuts. The kid is supposed to be a writer, but his writing is awful. I think I wrote a lot better than that at 15. Lots of very short sentences."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dark and deep","review":"I chose this rating because of the way the story was conveyed. It really put one in the mind set of a suppressed memory holder."},{"rating":"2","title":"In shock and will read over and over.","review":"I love this book! I didn't really think it was a book for me due to my age. This is for the young and old and i can't wait to see the movie. I love how Charlie made thing's seem so real and how honest his was. It always takes me a while to finish a book but i couldn't put this one down. If i could give more then 5 stars i would."},{"rating":"2","title":"Perks of Being a Wallflower","review":"This book was not what I was expecting and though I felt it stereotyped a lot, I still loved the book. I couldn't stop reading because I couldn't help but feel it was talking to me. GREAT BOOK!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perks of Being a Wallflower","review":"I loved this book! There were so many relatable situations. The only thing I had wished for was some clue of who Charlie was writing to..

It was a great story about life And I hope this book makes you feel as infinite as I did."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read!","review":"I found this book to be a great read. I could hardly put this book down. I became immersed in Charlie's world."},{"rating":"2","title":"Honest and Powerful","review":"I have never felt as emotionally attached to a book before in my life. Charlie is a character that really feels like a human being, just a teenage boy trying to find his way in the world and the way he examines everything and his narration of life is something unique. The emotional roller coaster this book out me on was real and I feel like I've grown to love someone I don't know and I want to thank him for the words he had given me to live by."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantabulas","review":"It's written in the form of letter to someone who remains anonymous throughout the book. I thought it was good but I haven't seen seen the movie so I can't compare the two."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mature Readers Will Enjoy The Perks","review":"Last week, I was moved when I saw Mr. Chbosky at the IRA conference in Indy. He spoke beautifully about the state of teenagers today. Therefore, I bought his book and was intrigued by the sensitivity illustrated in his character, Charlie. I am, however, compelled to advise parents and teachers to read this book before reccomending it to their children. It is a mature novel.None of the sexuality issues, drug use, or language are gratuitious. In fact, they are needed for the honesty in the novel. I would caution that this novel should be used in high school and not in middle school. It would be more appropriate for that age group. I am not a censor. I loved the book. I encourage mature readers to embrace the touching tale of Charlie, Patrick, Sam and all the others."},{"rating":"2","title":"An incredibly wonderful book","review":"After reading through some of the reviews, it seems like you'll either love or hate this book.Personally, I loved this book. There was something about it that captured me from the moment I picked it up till the moment I put it down (I read it all in one sitting too).There are so many lines in this book that were just wonderful. The songs that he talks about are also pretty amazing. I downloaded all of the songs he mentioned and created my own \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" soundtrack.I'm planning on giving the book to a friend of mine and highlighting one line in particular... it sums up everything I've been wanting to say to him in just one line. =)It's a beautiful book, and I think anyone can enjoy it (even if it is directed towards a younger audience)."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perks of reading this book","review":"Being the avid reader i am, i am very paticular about the books i choose. I must say this is one of the better books that ive picked up. It focous's on Charlie, a 14 or 15 year old boy who, to begin with, just isnt very social. He is introduced some people from school and is thrown in the life of fast driving, good music, mix tapes, gay parks, and weed brownies. The book, written in entry/letter form, is easy to follow and easy to relate to. Id say that the age groups to read this book is 7th-11th grade. The fun and yet sensitive book is a must have for any teenager."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perks Of Being A Wallflower","review":"I think that it was lovely. I related to it on some levels. I felt as afterwards some things in the world actually made sense to me, which occurs very rarely. I like being able to understand things.

I enjoyed this book because how it made me feel during and after."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must-read masterpiece!","review":"With the help from OUT Magazine, I looked at the cover picture of the Golden Boys in Perks of Being a Wallflower and I told myself try to get a book to read what it is saying. I got hooked up reading the whole book in one sitting and oh boy...I got so sentimental with the characters in the book and started to understand what I had gone the pains while I was a teenager in residental school. I want to applaud Stephen Chdosky for the masterpiece in writing a novel (more likely in writing in diary proses). I recommend anyone to try it and you will enjoy it afterwards.Thanks.Kevin"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book","review":"Great book!

This is probably one of the few books in the YA genre I read when I was actually a teen. It's in the format of letters written to a friend from the main character Charlie. As he deals with high school & life in general, he touches you to the bone with his descriptions and explanations of his innermost thoughts and feelings. There are perks to being a wallflower, as Charlie most certainly is, but participation has its infinite possibilities too. I loved it and even though its confessional intimacy made me freak out a little, I was able to completely relate to Charlie's withdrawal, confusion, and fear. I \\"feel infinite\\" when i think about it:)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Was exactly what I was promised","review":"This book is obviously pre-owned and that is exactly what I was promised.

Almost every teenager would probably agree. But the books becomes so much more than that. It all starts out with this boy named Charlie who is writing letters to this person who's name is never mentioned. But basically the book covers every aspect of life as a teenager. From Charlie's first date to the first time he did drugs. I think that maybe some adults should read this book. It could answer every question every parent would ever ask. The book spans Charlie's freshman year and me, being a freshman, completely understood and felt and still do feel like Charlie sometimes. This is probably the best book I have ever read and would recommend it to all ages.

The author captures something important about the voice of a teenage boy as he deals with popularity, family issues, sex, and drugs and alcohol.My only complaint is that the revelation at the end of the book has become a rather hackneyed plot device by now -- how many novels have we read in which the cause of some problem is childhood abuse?"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic!","review":"I absolutely loved this book, it's phenomenal, amazing, fantastic, awesome!

I was glad to reach the very unsurprising conclusion. If you want a terrific, authentic novel set in high school, get Speak, Hard Love, or Rats Saw God. Perks of Being a Wallflower is dull."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quirky fun book!","review":"I love the book mostly because it reminds me of the 70's and 80's. Supposedly it is set int he 1990's but I recall the Rocky Horror Picture Show was popular in the 80's and many activities that are highlighted were most relevant in high school in the 70s and the 80s. Having said that, it is rather timeless in the themes and concerns it raises: who am I if I don't fit into the crowd? How does the environment shape who we become? Can a strong identity overcome peer pressure? Etc. I am 54 years old and I liked it. I bought it for my 15 year old son who loved it. We went to the movie after reading it.

If it does go pick up \`notes from underground.'"},{"rating":"1","title":"More teen boy and girl cliches!!!","review":"I recently slammed another \\"coming of age book\\" for reverting to silly gendered cliches about teenage girls and boys: girls are self-mutilating suicidal anorexic doormats and boys come in two types: cool druggie pretty effeminate gay boys who are beat up, and mean insensitive football jocks who do the beating up. Never, ever, ever does a girl have confidence or engage in hedonism (drug use) rather than self-inflicted pain (cutting oneself, starving). Nor is a girl ever gay in teen lit--especially not a cool druggie pretty girl. In teen lit, a football player is never gay and an effeminate boy is never straight. Basically, I am so tired of the stereotypes. Sadly enough, this book is wedded to them. You have your cool gay boy, your sad boy narrator, and your Girl He Is In Love With (she has no identity of her own except her romantic trifles). In short, its tired and tiresome, and vastly overrated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just okay.","review":"Perks of Being a Wallflower was a quick and easy read. For the most part, it was engaging.

It was slow and repatitive"},{"rating":"2","title":"It deserves more than 5 stars.","review":"\\"I walked over to the hill where we used to go and sled. There were a lot of little kids there. I watched them flying. Doing jumps and having races. And I thought that all those little kids are going to grow up someday. And all of those little kids are going to do the things that we do. And they will all kiss someone someday. But for now, sledding is enough. I think it would be great if sledding were always enough, but it isn't.\\"-The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\"That is all you need to know about this book. Read it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment","review":"I bought this book hoping to find my voice, hoping for a character to relate to. I didn't find either.The prose is painfully dull. \\"Caught between trying to live his life and trying to run from it ... \\" the back cover reads. That phrase might as well have come directly from the text, for all the action it portrays.Show, don't tell. Is that so hard to do? It's writer's rule no. 1, and usually a manuscript won't make it out of an editor's office still in one piece if that rule is not scrictly adhered to.I have to give a little credit, though. I was surprised by the end of the book when I felt a sudden bout of sympathy during its climax. I don't know how he did it, but somehow the author made me care without actually making me care.But God, was this book a bore."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"I share the sentiments of many of the commenters below. The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a sensitive and beautiful novel that has my highest reccommendation."},{"rating":"1","title":"did i miss something?","review":"Everyone else is giving rave reviews about this book. When Ichecked it out of the library, it looked interesting enough. But whenI started reading it, I was completely bored by it. I know some bookstake awhile to get into, but after reading 5 pages I knew I was never going to like this book. And the way that the book is written to \\"dear friend\\" was rather annoying as well. I surmise that the author is trying to create some sort of \\"Everyman\\" in the protagonist, which is why he writes to society, maybe (?). But it was just impersonal and trite. Maybe I'm missing something, but I recommend staying away from this book. It isn't a classic and it isn't worth your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"I bought this book based on the reviews alone, and I truly didn't know what to expect. This book has touched me in a way that few have. It just gets you at your very core. Charlie is one of the most beloved characters that I've ever read. If you have any misgivings about purchasing this book, cast them aside. Prepare yourself to be so emotionally captivated and moved by his story!"},{"rating":"2","title":"The movie is better","review":"Overall, the writing is bad. For a teenage prodigy, Charlie writes like an a 8 year old, and given that it's a book, it should've gone in more detail about some of the more serious topics in the book. The movie by far was more earnest and warmer than the book, but its still a great read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Didn't think I would","review":"I enjoyed this very easy read book. I thought it would be childish, it wasn't. It was thoughtful and the kind of book you feel with instead of just read, Your heart breaks, and then you find your self smiling within pages. I would reccomend for all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Masterfully amazing!!","review":"I haven't read a modern contemporary work of literature this masterfully written in a long time. Everyone can relate to at least some feelings that he has in the book. It's a beautiful work of art! Love love love it!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"The Perks of Being a Wallflower","review":"Very disappointed in the whole book. It was not written well, and did not meet my expectations. The story was very slow and very dismal. I am so sorry I read it. How it made the Best sellers List, I have no idea."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book ever","review":"I very much enjoyed this book. It was very well put together and funny. I can't wait to see the movie!!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good read","review":"This was a creatively written page turner. I enjoyed it. The 90's throwbacks (song references, etc.) are entertaining. It definitely hooked me and is true to its title. I never thought about whether or not I was a \\"participant\\" in \\"normal\\" high school life or not, but this book makes you think about social life from another angle. Fun read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Absolutely Beautiful","review":"This book is my favorite book I've ever read. I've read it probably 20 times, each time catching little details I missed prior. This book really took to me and I found myself not wanting it to be over once it was.I definatly recommend this book. It's so unique and painfully honest. Im sure eveyone will be able to relate to it at one point or another."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book...","review":"It made me think about the similarities between Charlie and I.I tend to watch and observe the things around me more so than engaging in them. This book is amazing and I intend on rereading it many times.."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the best books in years","review":"This book is truely one of the best I've ever read. I'm 15, and I've read every book under the sun, from \\"Brave New World' to \\"A Catcher in the Rye\\" and this easily surpasses both of them. It truely changed the way I view my life, and everyone else's around me. Read this book, because you won't regret it one bit, I promise you that."},{"rating":"1","title":"How can you honestly call this book a classic?","review":"I decided to buy this book strictly based on the reviews that were on this site. This book is far from a classic. After I finished the book I kept asking myself, did I miss something? I am not that far removed from high school and I am a high school teacher and I did not care for this book at all. I even noticed that some reviewers compared this to Catcher in the Rye. What were these people smoking? Catcher is so well written that it could not possibly be compared to Perks. The only perk of this book is to take it for what it is worth, an attempt to rip-off Catcher and update it for the millenium."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book is great and as the depht of a real teenager.","review":"I disagree with the the reviews that say this book is not what a real teenager thinks and they go into to much detail on certain parts. This teenager is from the EARLY 90s so all of the little 13 year olds going \\"this is not like me\\", that would be because you have been babied and spoiled! How would you know what being a teenager was like back when you were 4? i am an older teenager and think that this book is a true masterpiece. And for those of you that are complaing about the sex in this book, What are you? Catholic school children? about every book you will read in life will have sex or vulgure language in it. So If you want to be a sheltered little baby, my recomendation is DON'T EVER READ ANYTHING AGAIN."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do Not Understand the Attraction to This Story","review":"This is another book I read because my teenage daughter read it. I can't imagine what the movie was about, because not much happened in the book. It would have been more satisfying if the reader learned who the narrator was writing to throughout the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"sometimes the weird kid makes genuine friends","review":"This book was a fast yet emotional read. The character development was amazing. There were so many stereotyped yet unique high school students. There were many moments of reflection back to my personal high school experience that make you think about how acceptance is such a struggle."},{"rating":"1","title":"a contrived plot; read Catcher in the Rye instead","review":"I, too, read this book over the course of a few hours. It was a quick, simplistic and unfulfilling read. I found the plot to be contrived- it's as though Chbosky took every \\"crisis\\" that the evening news purports is rampant among high-schoolers, and thrust them all upon Charlie. As a current senior, I've never met anyone who has had this stereotypical high school experience. I liked Charlie, but found myself envious of him- he spends the novel reading amazing pieces of literature and I was wasting three hours on this story. I picked up this book initially because of comparisons drawn between it and Catcher in the Rye (one of my favorites), but in hindsight I realize that Holden would've called Chbosky and his novel phoney."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice !!","review":"Easy to read-and-follow narrative, which his one of its strengths. Must read, especially if you saw the movie. You'll continue flipping though it and by the time you finish you'll feel like you were there the whole time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cute..","review":"Easy reading..enjoyed the humor makes u think back to your own high school experience I would definitely recommend this to anyone that has ever felt like it was hard fitting in in high school or life in general.."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderfully written, yet slightly depressing","review":"I saw the perks of being a wallflower a few months ago, I was very impressed with the movie and even more impressed with the book. The way Charlie's letters are written is very relatable. I would recommend this book to anyone looking for a \\"coming of age\\" book without it being to cheesy."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I was expecting","review":"I was really looking forward to this book because everyone says it is amazing. I also wanted to finish it before seeing the movie. The book was alright. Nothing bad, but nothing major. It was interesting to see a boy so sensitive from a male author though."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great","review":"As a 16 year old who has been though some of the same things, I think book is absolutely beautiful."},{"rating":"2","title":"Dear Interested Reader:","review":"The Perks of Being a Wallflower, is a very honestinterpretation of life in high school through the eyes of a troubledfreshman. In this book \\"you\\" assume the role of a person Charlie has heard someone talk about at school and begins to send letters to this person, which you read. Through the book you learn about Charlie's problems, and how he recklessly tries to solve them, usually making things worse for himself. If you've read Catcher In the Rye, and you liked it I totally recommend this book, if not though, I still recommend it just as much. This book contains all the elements present in a high chool students life which anybody can relate to: love, death, fights, friends, and family. This book does get rather graphic sometimes but mostly in a comic way. So if you can handle a book of this caliber, I suggest you get this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic","review":"i found this book extremely enjoyable. a fantastic read! it was definitely one of those books you struggle to put down"},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching","review":"Touching, thought provoking. Well written.A lovely read that takes an intimate look into the fragile mind of a teenage boy."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet Tale of Coming of Age -- Truly","review":"I'll admit at first I was a bit put off by the overall \\"sweetness\\" of the main character, who I felt was created as a \\"sympathetic\\" movie-character fabrication (he loves his mom, loves his dad, loves his sister, loves his brother...it made me roll my eyes, seeing how \\"good\\" and \\"nice\\" this boy was; not since Leave It To Beaver have I seen such a \\"goodness\\" portrayed), but in the end the book won me over -- and I was moved by it. And that's what counts. The novel works! The only other book to affect me this way, despite my early misgivings, was The Losers' Club by Richard Perez. In much the same way the protagonist of that book was portrayed as a \\"good guy,\\" a hapless loser -- and I couldn't get into it until the last half. There, too, I was finally affected by the main character -- and the book as whole. So you never know until the end. I say this to anyone reading The Perks of Being a Wallflower -- hang in there. I guarantee you'll be moved by this novel!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Book vs movie","review":"I overall loved this book and I think everyone should read it. I will admit it's more of a story for girls because it has more emotion. Both the book and the moviegoers amazing but I think that if you watch the movie and read the book it will help you to better understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"Meh","review":"Wasn't what I expected, and not in a good way.

I don't even know what to say? I really don't understand why people RAVE about how life changing this book is. The only way it changed my life, is by making me angry!! I was so mad that I wasted time reading it. I kept thinking, \\"It MUST get better...\\" or that something grand was going to be revealed and I could then say , \\"AHA! Now I understand\\" It is poorly written, and is supposed to be from the point of view of a 15-16 year old boy, who is very well read! Yet, he can't write! I have seen other reviews that said it appeared the they author took every single stereo typical teen drama, and mashed them into one book. Rape, homosexuality, suicide, teen pregnancy, drinking, drugs...all covered!Please, don't waste your time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great coming-of-age story","review":"This book is well-written.

Is the author trying to be cyncial here? i mean Charlie has OLDER friends, he smokes, does drugs,and gets kissed.(fresh year!) nope, don't think he's a wallflower. Oh yeah, he's smart too. The end was a complete suprise because he hadn't talked about his Aunt Helen and he just went into a trance while he was with Sam? didn't understand that. I didn't get what he was in the mental hospital for. His whole family treats him like he's amnaeic or something! He also phrases things weird. He doesn't sound like he's very depressed, i don't believe it.

Chbosky is so aware of the parallels in the books that it's more like a modernization than anything. I've read this book about 14 times. The first time I read this book was right before freshman year, and the last time I read it was right before graduation. Charlie and friends are painted so tangibly that you can almost picture yourself showing up at the Big Boy after a showing of the Rocky Horror Picture Show and hanging out with them. I think that if you like the musical RENT, you'll really enjoy this book. It's very similar in that it is a detailed account describing scattered parts of a year in the life of an interesting group of friends.

Just gotta keep chugging along."},{"rating":"2","title":"Very moving and dead on...","review":"The book, although I was quite shaken by the \\"twist\\" ending, was still quite right. The feelings of our precocious narrator are very true to life. It does capture high school well. This one shines at times because of it's format and honesty. It will leave you feeling both happy and sad at the same time, which Charlie talks about at one point.I was reminded of two other novels, of the coming of age genre, which fans of this book might like. There is 10th Grade which was released last year and is lighter hearted than this. However, it does a fine job of capturing the lonely days of school...and on a more esoteric note, \\"Everything Looks Impressive\\" by Hugh Kennedy...which takes place with a freshman in college and a senior he befriends...All worth the read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Just Amazing and Inspiring","review":"I really can't explain how much I loved this book as well as I wish I could.

There was a lot of parts that i thought just were blah and blurred together.. Not a memerable book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Confused and confusing","review":"I chose this book because it's so popular, and supposedly written for high school age. The characters are one-dimensional, the issues never fully developed or resolved, except that the 'wallflower' is allowed to come along to their parties, and eventually is accepted as a friend, though there are very few reasons for why he merits this. His vocabulary is singularly juvenile, far below his alleged age, and his sexual view of every relationship makes him seem limited mentally. I don't know any high school students who would find this kind of person interesting or worth being friends with. Innocence and stupidity being two things that teenagers do not want to claim or seem to be. And the anonymous letters lead you to believe it will be revealed as part of the story and it never is. Who the heck does he know well enough to write to on these most personal of topics? A very strange and tiring book."},{"rating":"1","title":"immature","review":"This book was so juvenile, the characters were immature I also didn't like the way it was written. The main character is a troubled 15 year old that cries all the time, I found him very unlikable.

The way it is written through letters to an anonymous person makes it personal. It shows insight into the mind of Charlie. The way that Charlie becalmed friends with Sam and Patrick and then they support each other is touching. I love this book! Recommend it to almost anyone!(:"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wonderful story about a boy we would all love","review":"Chbosky has revealed a great deal about youth and their problems, and does so sensitively and with empathy. You have to read it closely because he weaves his facts into the story so subtly that you might miss them."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best of the genre since Go Ask Alice","review":"I wish I'd discovered \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" when I was still in high school. The main character is stunningly real and gives an authentic literary voice for millions of young adults. He goes through typical youthful indiscretions without the gloss of so many other stories featuring teens. Its short enough to finish in one read and powerful for readers of all ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing....","review":"Inspiring and perfect...this book is relatable Chbosky keeps the reader on his toes throughout ever letter Charlie writes. An amazing read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Interesting and Tasteful... yet not what I expected.","review":"I found much liking in this book. Although it was not a book that I read nonstop I found it to be very good. The main character was very relatable in ways an had a great story to tell. My appreciation goes to Stephen Chbosky for writing this story well and making it easy to follow along with. A short and tasteful book I would most definitely read again."},{"rating":"2","title":"A truly touching story.","review":"This is a wonderful story of a boy going through one of life's most difficult years. Charlie is a freshman in high school and is very intelligent, shy, awkward, and lonely. He makes a couple of friends, older than Charlie, who change his life forever. His family, English teacher, and friends help pull him out of his shell and uncover a tereible incident from his childhood. I felt everything with Charlie - his downs and ups, his feeling \\"infinite\\" with his friends. He is so sensitive and caring about others that he has forgotten about himself. A wounderfully touching, coming of age story that should be read by all."},{"rating":"2","title":"Breathless!","review":"I just finished reading this book and it is my new favorite!

Charlie is the most charming character you will ever come across. The book could make anyone fall a bit in love with him."},{"rating":"1","title":"Soap Opera Life!","review":"After reading Chbosky's Perks of Being A Wallflower, I wondered if the author had watched any soap operas. The story of Charlie, a fifteen year old freshman from Pittsburgh, offers insight on the events of his life thusfar. However, it seems as if EVERYTHING that can go wrong in someone's life does in Charlie's... molestation, suicide, date rape, physical abuse, drugs, and homosexual sex are all part of Charlie's existence. Perhaps I'm naive, but I can't imagine that anyone's life can be filled with that many obstacles (except of course your average soap opera character). Is it any wonder that Charlie ends up in a mental institution? While it's obvious that he was imitating Catcher in the Rye, Charlie's life seems almost unfathomable!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wallflower Helps Only Those in High Spirits","review":"It was hard to put Wallflower down in my post-breakup state. However what I got out of it was terribly depressing as opposed to the apparently positive and promising lesson I thought that it wanted to convey.Wallflower follows high school freshman Charlie, (who reminds me of Holden in Catcher in the Rye, minus the level of wit and appeal) through school and his experiences with different levels of happiness and abuse.I liked it. I'd read it again, but next time when I'm feeling better! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very believable","review":"If I didn't know this was a work of fiction, I would swear that these really were the letters of a teenage boy written to a far away friend. Chbosky has truly captured the voice of a teenager in this book and tells of all the emotions, experiences, trials and tribulations of oneyear of growing up. Charlie may be a bit over sensitive and his high school experiences may vary from those of your average American teenager, but this book shows that not all kids fit into the same mold. While the book spans one full year it seems like a small snapshot into Charlie's world and development. This is one I would not mind having a sequel to read."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read","review":"I rarely read adolescent fiction, but this one really got me. I think Chbosky did an remarkable job of covering all of the touchy adolescent bases without making his motivations too obvoious or cliched.Charlie, the disturbed 14 year old main character, is endearing and I appreciated how his point of view differed from \\"reality\\" and how the other cast of characters see things. Chbosky did a great job with the language and putting dialogue into the letters.I highly recommend this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"a change in my life","review":"i think the fact that \\"perks\\" has gotten 500 reader comments has to mean something.this book, to put it simply, was excellent.as a 15 year old teenager, I found charlie's life (as written through his letters) not just an inspiration, but a guide through my teenage years. an adventure through the world parties, friends, drugs, mixtapes, sex, and of course, that one ride in a pickup truck with two friends that makes us all feel infinite.three thumbs up to stephen chbosky on his amazing first novel. :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"I couldn't believe it","review":"This book was amazing from beginning to end and I was very sad to finish it. The great thing though is that I can read it again. Wonderfully written and captivating, you won't be able to put this book down even if you wanted to! :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"not what I expected","review":"Bought the book with the idea of using it for my kids. I had not seen the movie, but prefered to read the book first. After I finished it, I decided the language and content was a little too much for my tweens. I did understand the authors thoughts of bringing out the fact of being different from the others. But I would hope adults would read it first."},{"rating":"2","title":"Well worth losing sleep over","review":"A really great book. I can't believe I enjoyed it as much as I did. Charming and unexpected. I highly recommend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Was Charley mentally-challenged or just naive and slow?","review":"I thought this book was ok, but not a 'must' read.

The clues are all there, folks. There are better books to read than this one was."},{"rating":"1","title":"What kind of title is perks of being a wallflower?","review":"The title perks of being a wallflower is an interesting one, just like the book. It is about a teen who encounters new things his freshman year in highschool. He goes through sex, drugs,and abuse. This is a good book you will definitley find something that you can relate to in this book. I would consider it to teens and adults. Also it is a short read.thankyou"},{"rating":"1","title":"Probably the worst.","review":"This was probably the worst book I have ever read. It was not interesting, the writing was horrible. It was a drag to finish this book. I didn't like it at all, and was suprised at the reviews."},{"rating":"1","title":"Perks of reading a crappy book","review":"O.K., I bought this book because of all the stellar reviews on this website; (...) This MTV offering is Dawson's Creek in book form ... cliched and exaggerated to the Nth degree. Chbosky goes down the list of cliched characters like it's his life's mission - we have the gay boy who isn't sure he's gay, the lesbian, the jock, the confused but supposedly \\"innocent\\" boy and so on. There's nothing here an average high school student in America can *TRULY* relate to, I'm sorry. (...) There are MUCH better lesser-known books out there that run circles around this slush ...(...) Sorry, Charlie, but I can't recommend The Perks of Being a Wallflower."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a waste of trees.","review":"I hated this book. It's very disturbing and makes it seem like all teenagers are sex maniacs, drug addicts, and were sexually abused as children and later suffer personality twists and weird mental collapses as a result. Don't buy it: go burn your money instead, it will put the cash to better use."},{"rating":"1","title":"Terrible","review":"This was really a bad book. I mean the story line was alright its just that the characters were so uninteresting and flat. The main character kept switching back and forth between a really mentally retarted kid and a normal teenager. There were parts that were extreamly unrealistic and just plain stupid. I do not recomend this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Dawson's creek of literature","review":"This has to be one of the most cliche ridden excuses for teen-angst literature ever published, although it's popular acclaim was to be expected what with the increased \\"dumbing down\\" of today's creative litarary standards. Upon reading a synopsis of the book, I was hopeful in the expectation that the protagonist would have some semblance to myself during my formative years. I was treated to the ramblings of some pretentious wannabe Holden Caulfield (accurate so far), but, to reiterate what others have already said, no teenager I ever knew spoke like this. It reads like the script of a bad episode of Dawson's Creek. Have they had this on Oprah's book club yet?Please, if you think you might share something in common with this guy, why not try Mersault in Camus' far superior \\"The Stranger\\"."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very over-the top","review":"The perks of Being a Wallflower is just too melodramatic. The main character (I forget his name), who is basically meant to be some misunderstood genius, is faced with every problem imaginable. Sorry, but i just really didn't like it. Actually, I hate all teen fiction because either it's really superficial or trying to hard to be \\"deep.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good","review":"This book is very interesting and the author knows how to channel the emotions of each individual character.BUT...If you are not a fan of books that something depressing happens in, i do not recommend reading this."},{"rating":"1","title":"Very Disappointing","review":"I heard amazing things about this book but I must say I found it completely disappointing. I was looking forward to reading it and I will admit it had the potential of greatness or at least being semi-good but it does not live up to that potential.The main character Charlie is not all that interesting. He is actually quite boring. What saves \\"perks\\" from being completely unbearable to read are Charlie's friends Sam and Patrick. Honestly the book would have been better if it was narrated by one of them instead; their stories seem far more interesting than Charlie's.The biggest problem with this book is it tries too hard. Every difficult subject is mentioned (i.e. suicide, rape, abortion) but not explored by the narrator in any real way. Everything is glanced over and unrealistic.I've read worse books than this one but I still would not recommend it to anybody."},{"rating":"1","title":"The Perks Of Not Reading This Book","review":"Unless you were a child prodigy who could read the Fountain Head and Naked Lunch in two to three days, play a part in the Rocky Horror Picture Show and discuss the meaning of life and death among other things at your teacher's house at the age of fourteen, then this will not be the book for you. This author is in wonderland if he expects any average person (and it doesn't even matter what click or scene you were in while in high school) to believe or relate to this story. The story at times became way too \\"cute\\" and kind of left the story shallow and unrealistic. Overall not a bad book and even some decent music references but if you are of a certain age and have somewhat of a grasp of reality, you probably won't buy into this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring and hard to understand","review":"i read this book and i know that a lot of people ive spoken to have loved it but i could not grasp the meaning of the entire thing. it seemed dull, and very unrealistic. i thought charlie was mentally disabled for the majority of the book until the end when it is explained. i didn't like the ending either. i thought it was rather cliche and expected. this book just did not do it for me, but i can see where people would enjoy it. if you want to read a slightly more 2002-ish novel on growing up, this would be a good choice. otherwise i recommend you pass it by."},{"rating":"1","title":"Okay","review":"Actually, I really liked this book and would probably give it 4 or 5 stars. However, I personally never read those reviews, and I'd like this to be read. All of you who say that Charlie is unrealistic or say that no teenager acts like him should read the last 20 pages again. There are reasons he acts differently than most teenagers, and I think you missed all of them. If you didn't miss them, then I believe you're making the worst argument in the world. Also, don't write a review before you've finished the book. What's the deal with that?"},{"rating":"1","title":"No \\"Perks\\" about it.","review":"I read this in a day and it bored me to tears. It starts out with Charlie's \\"best friend\\" Michael's suicide, (which is supposedly one of the themes of the book) but it is barely mentioned. We never know what is wrong with Charlie, because he shows some sort of mental disability that can only be seen by the keen eye. I honestly don't see what all the fuss is about. I'm the exact same age as Charlie and I have no idea where he is coming from."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I expected.","review":"I've heard people rave about this novel and it was simply not interesting. Perhaps it was that I found it hard to relate to the main character or that I'm used to reading SciFi and Historical Fiction. This book was definitely not something I recommend.

It was a quick read, but still had substance. I cared about the writer of the notes and I really wanted good things to happen to him.

I think I have re-read it three or four times in the past couple of years and it has always been just as good as the first time. It is sort of a more modern \\"coming of age\\" novel just like \\"The Catcher in the Rye\\" was. I would recommend this book to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perks of Being a Wallflower","review":"I read this book last year, when i went to a very sheltered catholic jr high school where even a a whisper of suicide or death would get you detention. This book made me realize how horrible this was for a child maturing into adulthood, who would soon have to face the real world. The fact that the main character, Charlie, is so open and trusting that he tells all and holds nothing back, helps the reader find somthing to identify with. Through this book I gained an understanding of an individuals growth and the obstacles they encounter. The reader of this novel (if around the age of Charlie) realizes that the words of Steven Chbosky are exactly how they feel, and exactly what they are going through. A new outlook on the world may be developed from what you learn from this book, if you just take the time to think about its meaning and the connections to everyday life."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sweet and entertaining","review":"I could be the mother of the main characters, and that is how I took it. But I surely have been as young as they are, and found it endearing to go back in time with them. And it is well written, unlike many of the best sellers around. The drugs and sex issues could present a problem in some families. Personally, I would recommend it to my young son, but unfortunately, he doesn't like to read. Maybe he will watch the movie..."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perks Of Being A Wallflower","review":"The Perks of Being a Wallflower by Stephen Chbosky is by far my favorite book. This is the story of what it is like to be in high school and to grow up. Charlie the main character in this book writes his thoughts emotions and experiences in letters. This book can be described as a diary or journal. It discuses his experiences threw the topics of sex, drugs, love and the Rocky Horror Picture Show. This story was good because the boy Charlie was growing up then and I am growing up now and he was the same age when he wrote all this stuff. Also some of the stuff is similar to what i do or some of my friends do."},{"rating":"2","title":"this book is my bible","review":"when i began reading the perks of being a wallflower, i had no idea what i was in for. i was more than pleasantly surprised. this book touched on every issue anyone has ever experienced in high school. but what made it so special was the author's ability to perfectly describe the emotions teens know so intricately: the excitement of going to a first party, the rush of a first kiss with someone, the perfection of a peaceful moment with close friends...this book moved me. it changed the way i look at the world i live in and the people i interact with. what more can you ask for..."},{"rating":"2","title":"\\"...and in that moment...\\"","review":"I'm not extremely well-versed in the world of literature, but reading this book was an incredible experience.

Anyone that reads this can relate.

Chbosky's touching book of letters is the most beautiful amazing story you will ever read. I know more people who's life this has changed. I have bought this book on at least 6 or 7 occassions to give as gifts. Wallflowers makes me want to become an English teacher just so I can give every ninth grader this book in hopes of perhaps making them a better person. The government should pay for every highschooler to read this book. I place this amng such classics as Great Gatsby & Catcher in the rye."},{"rating":"2","title":"thought about giving it 5 stars, but...","review":"...need to give it some time. But it's an awfully good book. Sure, the kid is idiotically hyper-sensitive, but it's still a haunting and amazing look at the outcasts of high school society. I've been on both sides of that, and this is pretty dead on. read Notes from Underground next. Think Chbosky read that? You bet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome","review":"This book was an amazing read!

Although my experiences were not quite the same as Charlies in 10th grade, the similarities were exceptionally familair. Stephen Chbosky gave me the most articulate desription of an adolescence that I can remember from 25 years ago next to my own personal journals. it was a gentle nudge to recall feelings and thoughts too hauntingly distant. I so rarely do this...but I may need to read it again. I originally bought this book for my 14 year old nephew, but I'm not so sure he'll \\"get it\\". Charlie's POV is too rich with wisdom and insight only a seasoned human can savor. Perhaps for his 20th year of life, hopefully by then he will have had such experiences which this book will trigger an affectionate reminiscence for."},{"rating":"2","title":"Memories","review":"I read this book when I was a sophomore in high school (2000).

TPOBAW just didn't work for me at all; it just seemed too contrived and poseur-like for me, and I'm not even counting all the cliches .... a big thank you to the reviewer who recommended \\"Little New York B#stard\\" by Dylan Raskin - now THAT is a book written by an actual twenty-something that has more angst in it than every single one of these cookie cutter teenage lit books put together (it's also the same book that Audrey Seiler, the girl who faked her own disappearance, is claiming provoked her to pull her disappearing act) .... Go read that and forget these Music Television poseurs."},{"rating":"1","title":"unrealistic story","review":"When I first heard of this book, with avery appealing title, I might add, I thought immediately that I should read it. After the first page I was horribly disappointed, and eventually felt as if Charlie's nauseating honestymight make me vomit.

Although, on a kinder note, I did like the characters Patrick and Sam."},{"rating":"1","title":"If I could give this book less than 1 star, I would.","review":"I saw an advertisement for this book on MTV, and it looked like a good book, so I bought it. I have never been more disappointed. The prose is trite and longwinded, the plot is almost nonexistent, and the characters are one-sided at best. It saddens me that this book has become so popular while other -- better -- high school novels are barely noticed. I'd never before regretted buying a book before this one. The most irritating thing, I think, was the self-congratulatory way that Charlie views his own writing. I felt like the author was trying to tell us he was talented, when, in reality, what he should have been doing, was showing us. The whole book was just very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Totally let down","review":"After reading this book and expecting a huge surprise at the end I was disappointed to find out that the book was very predictable. I found myself getting very invested in the main character, Charlie, just to find out basically nothing at the end. At least it was a quick read."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perks of Reading this Book","review":"Because it was being touted as a \\"modern-day 'Catcher in the Rye,'\\" I didn't think there was any way that this -- the first novel by Stephen Chbosky -- could live up to its billing. I was surpised to find that it far surpassed my expectations. The short book is written as a series of letters to an unnamed \\"friend,\\" in which the protagonist, Charlie, shares the highs, lows, dreams, and disappontments of high school.Charlie is a misfit -- he's been kept back a year because of a nervous breakdown -- but he finds a niche with a group of edgy older teens. During the course of this school year, he finds that love doesn't wear just one face, that friends sometimes have to take a stand, and that the past has a way of coming back.

It also taught me that I shouldn't be afraid of what anybody thinks or feels about me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Being a wallflower","review":"I thought this book was eye opening opening and inspiring . I could relate in some ways to how Charlie felt and some of what he said made me rethink my life and how I was living it. I was confused at some parts and even surprised at others. It was so worth reading and I read it in two and a half days. I think living through certain things seems a bit less scary now knowing that others have lived or even thought about the same things. This book was worth the read by far"},{"rating":"1","title":"Teenagers, for real!","review":"I read this book waiting for something to happen, it never did! There is something wrong with this kid, obviously. Charlie does not exhibit normal, or even semi- normal teenage behavior. It's been a long time since I was a teenager, but things haven't changed that much! This cannot be called \\"a coming of age\\" story because nobody comes of age this way. Drinking alcohol, doing drugs, exploring sexuality is never given a second thought by any of the young people in this story - which are big issues, instead Charlie focuses on mixed tapes. And honestly, what sixteen year old male, who is given the opportunity to have sex with the girl he loves, would cry and sleep on the couch! The story leaves the reader with many unanswered questions, and I was quite disappointed at the end. Read it, you'll see what I'm talking about!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"A modern day catcher in the rye. I couldn't put this book down. It's an incredible work of fiction.

I orginally just bought it to try it out on my new kindle, and i think i like it so much more because its electronic convience"},{"rating":"1","title":"I could not relate to the socially challenged and unstable main character","review":"This is a book about high school from the view point of a socially challenged and emotionally unstable high school boy. I could not relate to his awkwardness. He was writing the letters to someone, but we never found out who. I am sure some could relate to this story and those that could probably enjoyed it more than me.At the end of the book there are discussion questions - so maybe this is the book that high school students read and discuss to talk about the challenges of high school - from that view point this book may have value.But as a 30 year old female - looking for a fun read. This was not it."},{"rating":"2","title":"A touching book","review":"I read Perks and was sincerely touched by the honesty and simplicity of Charlie's message of goodwill. This book has achieved much on its own terms. I don't understand why so many people feel the need to decide right now whether or not it is a \\"classic\\" or need to compare it to \\"Catcher in the Rye\\". Did people accuse Salinger of ripping off F. Scott Fitzgerald? Why not just let the book be what it is, a beautiful piece of work that has touched many many hearts."},{"rating":"2","title":"Teacher sings praises of novel","review":"As a middle-level-educator, I would recommend this novel to anyone age 13 and up. The author deals with so many situations with care and compassion...I see \\"Charlies\\" every day, and as a teacher, we need to know how special they are. Thanks for the reminder, Mr. C. -Ms. K."},{"rating":"2","title":"How Stephen Chbosky saved my life","review":"Ok, so he didn't save my life, but this is DEFINETELY thefinest book I've ever read. Mainly because the main character is somuch like me that it scares me. But I think Chbosky writes in such a way that almost anyone can deeply relate to Charlie. God, this book was so amazing. I just wish I read it sooner so I could make some of the events part of my youth (even though I am only 18)- instead of having them be wonderful nostalgia. A serious must-read for anyone 15-21."},{"rating":"2","title":"I think it's funny","review":"isn't it funny how almost everyone says this is just such a great book and then someone comes along and mentions about how hollow it is. it seems to me you people are all drowning in your own depth. if there was ever a more beautifully written book, i would love to know - because i've read catcher in the rye...and this book is better. stephen chbosky couldn't be more brilliant and i can't imagine that he's older than 16 because no one has ever made teenage life more real."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not what I thought it was going to be...","review":"Perks of Being a Wallflower is an extremely over-hyped book. Sure, it had its parts but the way people talked about it you'd think it was the Bible or something. Some parts were funny, but other parts I just didn't get. I don't think that it is an accurate portrayal of adolescence. Another thing that bothered me about this book was that sometimes the situations Charlie gets himself into are so embarrassing that you yourself feel embarrassed for him. I've also seen that the people who tend to read/like this book aren't very well read. This book is not equal to those of literary merit by any standards."},{"rating":"1","title":"Huge Dissapointment!","review":"I was very dissapointed. Throughout reading the book I just kept waiting for something to happen and it never did. There was never a true climax for me. I just didn't understand the point of the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"A classic","review":"I first read this book for a summer class in high school, and I am glad I was introduced to it. It is a great story, especially for teens, but for anyone of any age. The characters are interesting and well developed, the story is relatable, and the book is well written and keeps you reading. This was one of the few books when I was younger that I didn't want to put down, and of of the few that I can still enjoy years later."},{"rating":"2","title":"The best book in the WORLD!!!","review":"The perks of being a wallflower is such a great book it blows you away. It discusses adolescense in such a way that no other book has. It is funny at parts and serious at parts to the point of tears. I was so dissapointed when it was over, I wanted to read it forever!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it!","review":"It's hard to put into words, but I'll try...This book brought me back to High School, where most of us go through these raw emotions ourselves, and we feel so alone at times. There's little bit of Wallflower in all of us and,as I read this book, I learned more about my young self, and realized many things about who I am now... I hope this makes sense :)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Phenomenal","review":"Just outstanding, totally speechless. The ending left me totally surprised, I definitely wanted it to be longer, great job Chbosky."},{"rating":"2","title":"Chbosky's Book is HOT!","review":"The book TPOBAW is excellent. It touched on many of the issues and themes that are so universal to us young Americans, and at the same time presented in a very personal way, giving us some ownership over what is going on. There is a strong sense of style and some just breathtaking moments throuout the book. Chbosky, you keep up the GREAT work!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ehh... I could do without.","review":"I feel this book tries too hard to cover too much in too short a time. Unless the reader has decided to identify with Charlie before ever cracking this sleek MTV-worthy cover, he never will, for the author offers very little in the 'hero' to touch someone who has not lived a similar life. Charlie's no Holden, no Alice in Wonderland, no Harry Potter. Each of those character experiences things I never have, but in some way touches me. So, as a recent high school graduate, I didn't find that this novel spoke to me or my compulsory teen angst. That said, I did find that I wanted to read it until the end. But I wouldn't do it again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Most accurate book about teenage life I've ever read!","review":"I was amazed at how accurate the author captured realife incidents that REALLY happent to you as a teenager! Nothing about this book was fake.

Couldn't keep it down for more than five minutes its that good"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"This book was amazing! I couldn't put it down. I love it. This book was an inspiration. It thought me any things. And it was just all around a great book. I wish there was a sequel"},{"rating":"1","title":"cliche lite","review":"This book was glowingly recommended by 2 friends (adult males). I'm still not sure why. Highly derivative and cliche ridden, the broad and fully expected stereotypes cruising through this year of high school were a complete bore. No surprise, no complexity, not believable that an uber-genius would write this way. Were I still in high school (or better yet, jr. high) it would be an enjoyable read. For those of us closer to Charlie's chronological age, it's probably just pleasant nostalgia for gen x ex-nerds. Skip the book and listen to the Smiths."},{"rating":"1","title":"Go away, MTV!!!","review":"I should have known better - any book that is published by MTV Books MUST represent the lowest fodder the literary world has to offer. MTV has NO place in literature, as their audience is made up of teen bops from suburbia who wouldn't know a good thing if it came up and poked out their eyeballs.What can I say about this book? I think a few reviewers put it best when they said it represents every single boring and tedious cliche known to \\"teen lit\\" - sex, drugs, loserdom and the like. Why is every single \\"teen lit\\" book going over the same ole nonsense over and over again? I didn't find Charlie to be particularly interesting or easy to relate to - certainly not to the point of calling this book a \\"classic.\\" There are too many cliches and hum-drum narrations for it to be considered anything more than fodder. (...)MTV should give up the jig already and stay the heck away from books."},{"rating":"1","title":"Nothing redeeming, depressing to read","review":"I am not sure what the reviewers saw in this book. It is a depressing read and really do we think that teenagers are dealing with ALL the difficult and tragic aspects of life by the age of 16 at once? If you made a list of all the tragedies in life, then decided to put them all on one character's shoulder this is your book. This poor boy deals with death, suicide, child molestation, rape, abortion, sex, drugs, alcohol, depression, and a variety of mental disorders, while also being a social outcast and having no self esteem. I am astonished that the age for this book is 14, but at any age it is just like watching a bad car accident."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply amazing read","review":"This book soaked me in at the first page. You can't explain how it makes you feel, happy and sad at the same time. I couldn't put it down!! 5 stars very well deserved."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perks of being a wallflower","review":"This book takes you into a whole new perspective in life and shows you that life does get bumpy at times and it helps you learn about life at a whole different angle.I would defiantly recommend this book to all readers out there.

It stunned me and the end left me speechless. The whole book caries you through all the hard experiances and decisions of a troubled boy named charlie. He makes good, bad, and strange decisions.

Lohnendswertes Buch!"},{"rating":"1","title":"struck me as pretty phony","review":"Much, I'm sure, to the author's pleasure, this book has gotten a lot of attention as it has made the \\"Top 5\\" most frequently censored books in school libraries, or whatever. This is because, unlike most teen novels, the book deals with themes of masturbation, homosexuality, and drug abuse.Sadly, I don't see what all the fuss is about. This never actually struck me as the honest voice of a teenager (it's written in first-person epistolary style). The whole thing sounded more like an adult trying to sound like a teenager, if you get what I mean. In other words, it seemed like the book was filled with concerns and confusions that adults believe teenagers to be having, rather than being informed by an actual teenage worldview."},{"rating":"1","title":"When does the good part start?","review":"When I picked this book up, I expected a book to identify with. However, as I read the story, this was not the case. A majority of the book is talking about what kind of music Charlie likes, what kind of drugs he takes, or how much fun he has at the Rocky Horror show. I can't count how many times he goes to it and watches the same thing. As I wasn't interested in any of this topics the book didn't particularly give me any message.There was one interesting twist in this book. The background information to the twist makes it believable, and the way it is revealed is brilliant. Aside from that, theres not much good to say about this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perks of being a wallflower","review":"This book was a very easy read, yet it was very interesting.

I read it and instantly identified with the main charactor \\"Charlie\\". he is a quiet and fairly innocent boy who was also a fershman in highschool and going through different but paralell problems to mine. it helped me put my problems in perspective and over all was very helpfull to me in figuring out how to deal with life. that prety much is why it is my favorite book to this day (almost a year and a half later)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow!","review":"This book is a must have for all high school students. It is told from the perspective of a young, naive boy and his trials in high school. I definitely identified with his feelings and experiences.

The next challenge is to get children my age to want to pick up any book, let alone this one.

I was able to so closely relate with Charlie, the writer of the letters, and found myself crying and laughing along with him.This short novel is an easy but life-changing read.

It symbolizes so much more than rebellious, free-spirited teens. It resembles the dramatic change from teen to adult. This book is written in a beautiful manor. I will definitely read another novel by Stephen Chbosky."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, quick, easy read.","review":"I read this book in a few hours. It's a very easy read. Parts are a bit hard to follow, however, because the narrator's train of thought is so jumbled, but I guess that's the point."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good book!","review":"this is an AMAZING book. it is very well written and is now my very favorite book. its just awesome and it end perfectly."},{"rating":"2","title":"Feel good book","review":"I really enjoyed this book.

I thoroughly enjoyed the real life situations displayed in the story and the life lessons for all people to learn."},{"rating":"1","title":"DISAPPOINTED","review":"I do not write reviews for books that often but this book hardly counts as a masterpiece and it needs to be said.First of all, Charlie is not a wallflower. He seems like he is mentally retarded but he is not a wallflower. He sees things but he doesn't understand anything which makes him come off as mentally retarded. He has no problems with making friends and going to parties.Sam and Patrick are one-dimensional characters and actually, every single character in this book is one-dimensional.My main problem is that this kid goes from being a loner to being the center of attention and a druggie in the short time of a year and there are no problems. There are no internal struggles or anything. It doesn't seem realistic and it doesn't make sense.Don't waste your money. I honestly wish I could unbuy it but I can't."},{"rating":"2","title":"A teen novel?","review":"I bought this book unaware that it was a \\"teen novel\\". I still would not have known if there wasn't conterversy regarding the content at a local high school here. I found this book taking me to my \\"cool days\\" when there was a group of friends that meant everything, and did everything with. What made it more memorable was that Charlie is exactly my age, and that it took place at the same time I had a special group of friends that all thought we were \\"infinite\\". This was very fulfilling. I recommended this to anyone who has a group of friends from your coming of age years that you will never forget, even if you aren't friends with them anymore.The characters were well developed and believeable. The whole time I knew there was something more to Charlie, and was happy to read the explaination at the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly Moving and inspirational","review":"I love books that make you look back on life and compare yours to the characters.

A very introspective and thought provoking novel. Definitely worth the read. I recommend it to anyone!"},{"rating":"2","title":"For Intelligent Worldly Kids","review":"I recomend this book for anyone who is trying to make their journey on this world easier. Charlie is so perfectly innocent, he reminds me of what we all have inside of us. His fears, his faults, Charlie is honest and has the faults none of us want to admit. This book was intended for young adults, but I think that if you are open-minded anyone can enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"My teenage years?? no I don't think so.","review":"I am a child of 13. My mother had sent a review sheet to me via e-mail. It said how great this book was and it was a so-called \\"must read.\\" I read the book and I thought it was an awful way to think about all of our teenage years. I thought that the book had way too much sexual things and it's just not like that. Sure , the book had some good points of view but not a lot of them. I could hardly have myself finish. I thought it was overly disgusting. I agree with one of the other reviews. Teenagers do not talk like Charlie and his friends do. It is an odd book and I would definatly nt read it until you are at least 18. I think that because you can reflect more on the contents of the book. If you would please excuse poor grammar and spelling I am not in high school yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved this book","review":"This book was a delight to read. Brilliant and refreshing and original. Can't wait to see the movie now. Great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Beautiful Generation","review":"This is a novel that will define modern adulthood. It is an amazing story of genuine growing up and hardships of reality. If not one of the greatest books a person can read, it should be on the bucket list of novels to experience. I enjoyed each moment Charlie became an adult and thoroughly aspire to write something that can be valued to many so greatly. I highly recommend the book."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing!","review":"The Perks of Being A Wallflower takes you on an emotional journey with a young boy who is trying to find himself, and takes you through high school, along with all the problems and stresses teenagers deal with throughout high school."},{"rating":"2","title":"Funny and romantically wholesome","review":"This series of \\"Dear Jon\\"; coming of age letters from a social outsider in his early years of highschool, is funny and romantic. It hits home for all of us that have struggled with teenage insecurities and identity crisis going into highschool."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depressing.","review":"This novel, written in first person form as letters to an unknown recipient, records the thoughts and feelings of a fifteen year old, socially awkward boy dealing with depression, sexual abuse, and relationship issues with his family, friends, and the girl he loves.The author seems to want to cram in every possible tragedy a teenager could possibly face. Suicide, drugs, physical abuse, sexual abuse, depression, teen pregnancy. You name...it's in there. I found the entire novel sad with no real resolution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Awesome!","review":"I loved \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\". It is different from all the other books, which makes it unique and a great reading experience. It is written very well and even though the main character never really describes himself, the author gives you such a detailed impression of him. This book is amazing."},{"rating":"2","title":"A deep read","review":"I wanted to read this because of the movie coming out. Now I am not sure the movie could do justice to the book. Charlie is a salute to all kids who feel left out and don't know how to fix that. It's gave me a good feeling when he began to find his way. Whether you have seen the movie or not, you should read this book."},{"rating":"2","title":"My thoughts on the book","review":"When I finished the book \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" I had to think about what message the book was trying to give. It talked about everything that a teen goes through in high school through a boy names Charlie. The story is a collection of letters he write to the person he thinks can relate to him the most, but he never tells the person who he is. When the book starts out he is a nervous boy starting high school. He has no friends because his best friend Mark has just died. He does not have anyone to talk to but his English teacher. Throughout the book they form a special bond together. Along the way he meets great friends who teach him many new thing. Although life far charlie was never perfect his friends were always there for him. I would recamend that all teens read this book. It was very intiresting."},{"rating":"2","title":"the best book","review":"in my life time, which isnt that long. that is the best book i have ever read. the emotions charlie expressed and felt were so real to me. i love this book"},{"rating":"1","title":"disappointed","review":"My 14yo daughter, an avid reader of at least 4 books per month, was underwhelmed with this book. She loves to read books before seeing the movies based on them and this is the first time she has expressed this measure of disinterest. She read the book in less than 2 afternoons/evenings, waiting for the story to strenthen... It never happened. Now she says she doesn't even care to see the movie. Wow..."},{"rating":"1","title":"?","review":"This book was reccomended to me by several friends, so I decided to read it. It is a relatively brief book, and I finished it quickly. It left me unsatisfied after all of the hype surrounding it. It attempts to be deep, and meaningful, it even tries to portray the life of a 'real' teenager. Let's face it, Charlie is not 'real'. Neither are the remaining characters, such as his friends, teachers, and family. I really do not understand the great love for this book by so many. Come on, it's published by MTV!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Ok, not great.","review":"I don't understand what all of the fuss is about. I thought this book was boring. It was an easy and quick read so I finished it. Otherwise, I would not have. I guess I was expecting more based on the hype and the reviews. I realize I am not the majority here and I don't really have anything negative to say about the book besides it just wasn't that great. Decide for yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"boring","review":"Not much to say about this book. It was boring to me. Can't believe they bothered to make a movie out of this story. Hope it's better than the written word. But I won't know unless someone tells me because I have no intention of going to see it."},{"rating":"1","title":"A painful, boring read.","review":"This book takes a really bad look at child abuse and Asperger's. The main character is meant to be a genius, and yet his writing style is completely infantile, to the point of being annoying. This is one of those books where it comes across that the author does not understand his subject well enough, instead you get the Wikipedia version of autism.I was livid that I had to pay such a high price on Kindle for such an epically boring book. I think the only reason this has been made into a movie is that the name is incredibly cool.If you are planning on reading this book because you think it's about being an outsider in high school, then don't bother, that's not this book. And please, do not get me started on the premise, the entire book is anonymous letters mailed to a stranger. So lame."},{"rating":"2","title":"A must read!","review":"This is an excellent book and a must read for both teens and adults. The characters are believable and you are rooting for Charlie the entire book. I read this book in 3 days and then immediately went to see the movie. Now I want to read the book again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Brilliant","review":"Loved this book. Its a quick read, coming of age story and I loved every minute of it. Now I can go see if the moview does the book justice!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A poignant coming of age story","review":"With this coming out as a movie and my two teen daughters being interested in seeing it, I wanted to read it first. I read this in one sitting, truly engaged with the author's voice as an awkward teenager coming of age, trying to figure things out with limited exposure and little judgement. There are some very adult themes in this story, so reading it helped me decide whether to take my daughters (12 and 15) to see it. The adult themes are the only reason I give it 4 stars so that folks know it's an excellent weekend read and take time to find out why. When I went to buy it, I didn't find any reviews mentioning the sexual elements and drug use along with other adult themes that could be difficult for some to read/view."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wallflower is quiet, unusual coming-of-age read.","review":"Love the format of the novel as the way of telling the story. Letters to a stranger convey a \\"dear diary\\" mood but also echoes the real-world isolation of the author on every page."},{"rating":"2","title":"pobaw","review":"I thought this was very touching. I was crying by the end! I didnt want it to be over. I loved how it was writen in the form of letters"},{"rating":"2","title":"Bravo","review":"I personaly am not a book reader so when my friend told me to read it i was a little hesitant. Seriously after the first chaperter i coulndt put the book down. I went through many emotional ups and downs and i was amazed that i was so deep into the book. I will say this and only this this book changed my life in so many ways."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Perks Of Being A Wallflower","review":"I read \\"The perks to being a wallflower\\" I thought it was a very good book, I enjoyed it very much. I think it had alot of good points. It was a very \\"real\\" book showing what life is like for a lot of teenagers. It talks aboout all kinds things from death, suicide to girlfriends and sex. I think it also helped alot of kids realize that they'er not the only ones who feel like charlie (the main charcater)did. It is a very good book for a wide range of different people I would recomend it to anyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Unimpressive shock value - no substance","review":"I really looked forward to reading what I understood to be a quirky romantic story of a high school misfit. I found the main character detached and aloof. The author managed to throw in date rape, domestic violence, drug use (to include a character being tricked into using), hetero and homosexual sex, oral sex, abortion, and incest. It was quirky alright--a complete waste of time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Couldn't wait to read...","review":"It was as good as I expected it to be. I couldn't wait to begin reading. I recommend this to everyone."},{"rating":"1","title":"Overrated","review":"This book is completly overrated especially now with the movie coming out. The person (from USA today) who said this book was \\"in the tradition of Catcher and the rye and A Separate Peace\\" couldn't have been more wrong. This book is very stereotypical and is like every young adult book I've ever read."},{"rating":"2","title":"A good read but a bit depressing","review":"A good read. Read it straight through on vacation. You really feel for the main character - a social misfit that is brilliant academically. You do come away feeling a bit depressed, but again, I did enjoy it."},{"rating":"1","title":"not appropriate","review":"Granted, I did not finish the book, I only read the first 40 odd pages, but it is not appropriate for young adults. I was uncomfortable reading parts of it & I'm an adult. Too much sex, drugs & adult discussion for that age group. I would not recommend this book to anyone, I burnt it in my fireplace."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not all it's cracked up to be","review":"I read the sample of this book and thought it was ridiculously stupid, but bought it despite my intuition based on the reviews. I want my time and money back! I read it in less than four hours and regret buying it. I gave it two stars only because one part made me tear up and one part made me laugh, but the rest of the book was a waste. I don't see how anyone could say this is a stunning and life changing story. I honestly thought that he was \\"special\\" and didn't know it, but the ending describes his weird behavior as caused by something else entirely. I just didn't get it, and I read a lot so I don't misunderstand books very often."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would like to give it no stars if that were a choice.","review":"Sorry I bought it; sorry I read it. Will delete it from my kindle as soon as I figure out how."},{"rating":"1","title":"I would not recommend this book to anyone!","review":"This book not only touches on the biggest issues that our youth face today, it actually glorifies them! The book disgusted me all the way through it. At one point, the main character (a sixteen-year-old boy) drives his sister to the abortion clinic. After her \\"procedure\\" (a nice and politically correct way to say legalized murder) she comes out and scolds him for smoking and then they both start laughing. It sickens me how people can look at abortion like it's no big deal and actually try to make it seem a normal part of life. At another point the author describes several homosexual encounters, again in a way that glorifies the acts. Drugs appear throughout the book and are too encouraged. As a Christian, this book sickens me, our world sickens me and writers like Chbosky sicken me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Entertaining but a little intense for young teens","review":"I liked this book, but I think it is a bit intense for anyone who is under the age of 16. The adult themes brought up in the book are a little extreme, especially for someone in their pre-teens or early teens. I realize kids are growing up faster these days, but these issues shouldn't be presented in a book for teens. These are issues that need to be introduced by parents and teachers, not in the library. If you let your pre-teen or teen read this book, read it with them, and discuss it with them."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointed","review":"Read about 25% of this book, went to return for a refund and was unable to. I paid $10 for this so I am not amused.The writing style was interesting and I thought this might be a great book, but a few chapters in the story started to drag. I could not seem to care for the characters, and the subject matter and language became too rated R for my taste. I should have read more of the negative reviews before making this purchase.For those who would want to know, in the first quarter of the book you deal with swearing, teen partying, and a gay teen relationship. Further research shows there is a lot more to come if you read further."},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing","review":"This book was absolutely amazing and it captured life raw. The characters were just lovely and the book was overall inspiring. HIGHLY recommended"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very good book","review":"I really enjoyed this book. It was different from other books that are currently out there. I enjoyed how it was written in a letter format. It gave the feeling that the main character was a real person. Would highly recommend."},{"rating":"2","title":"Caitlyn's Review","review":"I loved this book. It's funny, and I can easily relate to it. It is lacking in parts, but overall, one of the best books I've read in a long time. Has an amusing main character that is new to the world of sex, drugs, and rock and roll, and that adds to the juicyness of the book. I would suggest reading this book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Such a lovely book","review":"I picked this book to read after stumbling upon some quotes on tumblr, and I was not let down. It's a great read, short too, for anyone, and it offers a great look into the angst, confusion, depression, and pain that growing up can cause. Now, and I hate to say it, lol, I can't wait to buy the dvd (:"},{"rating":"2","title":"The ONLY teenage angst book I LOVE!!","review":"First off, when authors write about any teenage angst problems, it normally turns me away. Perks of Being a Wallflower, however was written in such an excellent way that instead of being annoyed by Charlie, I felt for him and his problems with high school's social hierarchy, parents, sister, and his unrequitted love. The issues Chbosky writes about including drug usage, unplanned pregnancy, suicide, and homosexuality bring that edge to the book making it go beyond realistic, but at the same time making everything equally important to address to the audience. I love this book, and will definitely read and reread it. Props to Chbosky for writing the only book I will ever read that centers arounf teenage angst."},{"rating":"1","title":"IT WAS NOT AWESOME!","review":"I don't understand how all of these people think that this book is so awesome. It was an okay book and it offered an interesting perspective. I liked to see the world through the eyes of another, even if it was a fictional character BUT it was not that great. I thought it was nasty and I didn't relate to much of it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Enjoyed","review":"Great book definitely worth reading. I would recommend this book to anyone. It's a quick read and an enjoyable book for all"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not as good as the movie","review":"I had never heard of this book until the movie came out, but I had some questions after watching it and decided to read it. Normally, I find the books are better than the movies, with very few exceptions. Had I not known that Charlie was 15 and going to high school, I would have thought the main character was 10, since he writes in short, simple sentences. It reminded me a bit of reading Steinbeck. There seemed to be big difference in characters, even though Chbosky wrote both the book and the movie; however, I felt that taking it as an entity all on its own, the Perks of Being a Wallflower was a sweet book that made me happy and sad and also glad I read it. I wish there were more to the epilogue, but don't we always..."},{"rating":"1","title":"My view","review":"I did not like this book. It just wasnt my style, but thats just me.It was about a kid named charlie who wrote about his daily life. It tells the life of how high scool really is, abot relationships, and friends. The Author dosent hold back anything. I know of a lot of other people who like i, so if it sounds interesting to you, get it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Worst. Novel. Ever.","review":"If you're the type of person who breaks into tears at a Dashboard Confessional concert you might dig this novel -- which is basically two-hundred tortuous pages of whining by some annoying, unfunny, overemotional, pretentious kid who thinks he's a lot smarter than he is. Everyone else steer clear of this cliche-ridden garbage."},{"rating":"1","title":"Sucks","review":"There are so many excellent YA books out there. This is NOT one of them. If the author were a bit more creative, he wouldn't have had to resort to the hackneyed themes of sex, sex, more sex, and drugs, drugs, and more drugs. BORING. Maybe the author thinks it's sensational and exciting - it's not. Give us something new, please! Even better, find another job and stop writing."},{"rating":"1","title":"the perks of a wallflower","review":"oh please who wrote this crap this is the most boring book i have ever read in my life is a nightmare to even look at the cover of this book.this book suck!!!!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Yes, amazing...","review":"I am amazed at the people who favorably rated this piece of trash. Just to give parents an idea of what this book is about, here is an excerpt:\\"... she grabbed his p**** with her hands and started moving it.... the boy pushed the girl's head down, and she started to kiss his p****.... she stopped crying because he put his p**** in her mouth....\\"Yes, pretty amazing, ain't it?!"},{"rating":"1","title":"This is just sick...","review":"This is just sick!!! The author is trying to deliver a message that homosexuality is a normal thing and needs to be accepted or approved. This book is disgusting, don't ever read it unless you want to have dipression or lost apetite. Some \\"activist\\" circles are trying to push it for so called \\"educational\\" purposes.If you are finding these episodes described in the book \\"educational\\", than consider my opinion being wrong:- rape- sex of a man with a boy- attempt to have sex with a dog- sex of a teenage boys- different disgusting underage homosexual related episodes- etc, etc....FOR PARENTS: Please do not give this book to your young childrenunless you want to traumatise them.Sincerely yours,K"},{"rating":"2","title":"memorable","review":"Takes you back to high school and all the complicated relationships that are so important in defining who you are and how you define yourself."},{"rating":"1","title":"What a NIGHTMARE!","review":"I read this book at age 15, the age of Charlie, the main character. That fact alone led me to assume that I would be able to relate, or understand what he was going though, and probably love the book. I guess not. This story was severly lacking in the plot, and I found several moments when the plot nearly set me to sleep. The characters did have depth and were throroghly described, but their problems were so exaggerated and completely wrong I just couldn't relate. Many issues dealt with in this book are true today, but not to the extreme Chbosky takes it. \\"The Perks of Being a Wallflower\\" is such a disgrace to teens everywhere... it made me sick."},{"rating":"1","title":"Depth for the Harry Potter generation.","review":"One would be hard pressed to fault MTV for publishing this, as such a move was a stroke of genius, without a doubt. Unfortunately, the same cannot be said for the book itself. Trying to push back the modern onslaught of empty, sentimentalist pap disguised as hardy intellectualism would be like trying to clobber some sense into a fundamentalist intent on blaming natural disasters on widespread homosexuality, so I won't try. Suffice to say, the cornerstone of this book is more of the innocence lost with age stuff, so if you're into that as a (the only) central theme, by all means, proceed. If you want some content and some real insight as opposed to a collage of bloated daytime TV \\"observations\\", check out David Foster Wallace, Don Delillo, or Mark Danielewski instead. If you're a teenager unable to relate to anything beyond your incredibly narrow range of cultural cliches, at least pick up Like the Red Panda and ignore this. Save a tree."},{"rating":"1","title":"Just Awful","review":"The book was, quite simply, awful--a coming of age story for functional illiterates. Not only does it allude to a lot of much better books, the ending is stolen straight from The Catcher in the Rye. But Charlie's no Holden Caufield, just weepy kid with nice parents, nice friends--hell, he's bereft of angst! Chbosky should forfeit his royalty checks and start sending them to Cornish, NH, care of Mr. Jerome David Salinger."},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible!","review":"This book stinks!!! They go into graphic detail of everything!!! The author just goes on an on about subjects that should not be in Young adult books"},{"rating":"1","title":"I guess it's ok, for a childrens book","review":"Everyone went ga-ga over this book in my high school, so I figured I better read the latest pop novel everyone was saying was so wonderful.Frankly, the writing is beneth anyone with an 8th grade education. The issues dealt with in this little tome are complex but are potrayed and simple. There is so much going on that one doesn't really find anything out about the charecters or about themselves.Again, it's ok for a young adult/childrens book. Anyone who is looking for substance and not sensationalism and drama should avoid this book."},{"rating":"1","title":"Plain Story of a High Schooler; Topic has been tried before","review":"A simple dull tale about a boy's high school nightmare, this has been tried before in a numerous amount of books.

The main character, Charlie, talked about his life as a teenager in new surroundings like the high school with upperclassmen friends. I was able to picture myself in a lot of the same situations because the author made it so easy for you to \\"interact\\" with the book. There were surprises in the book dealing with friends, family and him self. This is one of those \\"hard to put down\\" books.Throughout the book Charlie is writing to a friend. He never tells you who he is writing to or who he is. He uses code names for his friends and family. He also says that the places he is writing about are made up so you cannot find his whereabouts. I thought that this was one of the reasons I kept reading, just waiting for the reveal of the person he is writing to.The Perks of Being a Wallflower dealt a lot with drugs, alcohol, sex and peer pressure which made the book a more realistic book for young adults."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not a particular good read for all ages","review":"The author didn't address a serious subject of a disturbed adolescent with a very realisticstory .

It's character development, and though written well with strong characters, prevalent lessons, and memorable quotes, I didn't like this. I own it anyway, but I find most CD books not to my liking anyways. I suppose I just need a great plot. Either way, it's rare I find a book not worth reading, even if i don't like it, so go read this. It's not supremely uplifting, and I can't compare it to the movie yet, but it's really not my thing.

I haven't seen the movie - but if it's anything like the book, I bet it's great. The quirky, honest perspective is very refreshing. I'm a high school teacher, so I enjoyed imagining exactly what was happening with these goofy kids. Fun read!"},{"rating":"2","title":"An addicting view of the transition from a child to a teen","review":"Recommended to me by my girlfriend, once I opened this book I found it hard to put it down. I was immersed into the life of a boy who desires to belong. The experiences in this amazingly written book made me hope the story didn't end."},{"rating":"2","title":"one of the best","review":"I read this book for the first time a few weeks ago after wanting to ever since it came out. I was truly amazed. I've read many books about adolescents seeing as how I am one, and I find them interesting. I like to see how well I can relate them to my own life. I'm a girl, and obviously the character in this book is a boy, but, none the less, it's easy to relate to him. The way he captures everything he feels so effetively is one of the things that makes this book so incredible. After reading it, I immediately gave it to my best friend, since I pass on all the good books I read to her. This book can be read in a day or less-that's all it took me. And I'm sure it'll be read again and again before it's put back on the bookshelf for good, if that ever even happens. I advise anyone young or old to read this book because, even if you can't relate, it's still enjoyable in its humor and seriousness alike."},{"rating":"2","title":"I adore this book.","review":"This book can actually be life changing. It really makes you think about how you look at those around you. I recommend this book to everyone who needs something to read. I hope that you get it and enjoy it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A timeless story","review":"A hauntingly beautiful novel about the pain and joy of growing up. I bought this novel on a whim and finished in a day. The characters are honest and relatable; the story is timeless and moving. I will probably reread this novel countless times and share it with my kids when they are in high school."},{"rating":"2","title":"through a different lens","review":"This book has faced challenges in many schools and communities. Check out the interview with Stephen Chbosky from Word Riot on his response to some of the challenges.My response: What's more important - a few things you don't agree with, or a powerful story about a teenage boy learning to deal the world around him? I know, what a silly question.I'll be honest, I had a hard time with this book at first. I spent the first part of the book wondering whether Charlie was supposed to have emotional problems or whether the writing was just awkward. When it became clear that Charlie did have emotional problems, I started to wonder why nobody but me seemed to notice. But then comes the big reveal... And Chbosky does it so well that it made the whole rest of the book shift into focus, and I could see why this is such a powerful book for so many teenagers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Life Changing","review":"Words can not describe how this book affected me. As a sophomore in high school myself I can relate to Charlie in that aspect but that's not why it's life changing. It is because of the underlying psychological aspect. It is right in your face but doesn't hit you. Charlie is such an amazing and kindred spirit. He's pure. He takes everything in stride and views it from an outside perspective. I fell in love with the words of this book. By far my favorite, then again it's the last one I read. ;)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Underwhelming based on the previous reviews","review":"Upon reading this book, my opinion is that the author is trying to glorify the stereotype of a \\"wallflower\\". The character is sensitive and introverted but in the book, those qualities are met with understanding and acceptance which to me seems unrealistic. It has been my experience that inviduals who exhibit these qualities in real life tend to be lonely or exist on the outskirts of their respective social circles due to the fact that sadly, very few people realize the depth that such individuals possess.In my opinion, the book reads like the fantasy of one such person in which everyone recognizes that the main character is intelligent and special and the things he says profound. I suppose in that respect, the book lives up to its title. However, as with most fantasies, the narrative of the story has a very limited perspective and the characters and events are too one-dimensional to be believable."},{"rating":"1","title":"wasted time","review":"lousy book lousy writer - have to share my thoughts. it was one of the few on the list of \\"the worst books i have read.\\""},{"rating":"2","title":"Amazing read","review":"I couldn't put it down.

Charlie vaguely reminded me of Holden Caulfield from the catcher in the rye. Charlie by far was the strangest character I had ever come across. He cried all the time. There a lot of unanswered questions. Why did he cry all the time? What was he being institutionalized for? Why did he have no friends his own age? Did his aunt Helen molest him? Why would he wake up naked at random places and not remember how he got there? Did he suffer from autism, or schizophrenia? This book left too much up for interpretation for my taste."},{"rating":"2","title":"Constantly Enthralled","review":"This is a definite must read!

The author makes you feel as if Charlie is talking directly to you. You're able too connect with Charlie and relate to him. At times I would check my mail box looking for letters from a boy like Charlie. This book makes me look at my self and see if I'm completely honest and happy. This book deserves more than five stars."},{"rating":"2","title":"Loved it","review":"In the beginning I was a little sceptical, but as the book went on I fell in love. As you get to know Charlie you realize how intelligent and insightful he was. It was a great and adorable book!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Wow","review":"I absolutely loved this book. It really made me think about life and stuff. Just wow....in a really good way."},{"rating":"2","title":"props for perks","review":"Occassionally you come across a novel so captavating that you are unable to put it down. Though this novel may appear to be one the those \\"teen reads\\" with characters who endure the hardships of high school, it is so much more. Through journal entries written by Charlie, the main character, the reader discovers that what is written in Charlie's journal is not a retelling of the prosaic drama that occures in the halls of high school. It is thought provoking and inspiring. The intospective prose enables the reader not only to understand the lives and feelings of others, but of themself. It is a book that should definitely be read by anyone in that is in high school or college."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great read, but not necessarily \\"innocent\\" or \\"classic\\"","review":"I loved reading this book. It seems that most coming of age stories have a little something that everyone can relate to--the greatest strength of this work is how it brings its whole story to the level of something the average millenial can relate to.That being said, I don't believe this work is destined to become a classic. It seems to be a little bit too much of a product of it's time, while lacking that essential quality to become timeless. While many interesting things assemble the plot, the ending is a bit hackneyed and predictable.If you're not afraid to share things like casual pot use, smoking, sex & homosexuality in high schools (all of which except the latter should be pretty tame game by now), go ahead and suggest this book to one of your 80s kids."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good book!","review":"Fast read with a great story. Reminded me of being in high school in the 90s. I'm looking forward to seeing the film adaptation."},{"rating":"2","title":"Coming of age","review":"I enjoyed reading this coming of age story. A good twist to the novel is that it is told through letters from the main character. It does address mature themes so caution should used when recommending to teens but overall the story is memorable for great characters and honest stories."},{"rating":"2","title":"Touching...","review":"This book was a great read.. really captured the spirit of the teenage narrator. Anyone who is, or has, or has ever been a teenager can surely identify with the characters in this book. You can almost taste the \\"adolescent angst\\". It is a story that makes you sit down when youre done with each chapter, and just say, ahhhh, memories! Very well written. I look forward to Chbosky's other works, as this was a pleasant surprise!"},{"rating":"2","title":"A very Touching book","review":"I feel that this book was really good and everything in it was true about life as a teen.

My friend was reading this book, only a few pages in, and told me to buy it, so after he finished it I read it. I started it at dinner time and read the whole way through. I have never once cried from a book, or even laughed out loud, until I read this. I was amazed, you felt so close to the character and when he hurt, you hurt too. There were a few lines in this book that I actually burst out laughing, and read it over and over because I couldnt believe how good the book is. My boyfriend hates reading so I am going to read this book to him, you can relate to charlie so much and im so glad I read this book, it changed me."},{"rating":"2","title":"Please judge \\"Perks\\" based on its own merits.","review":"I've noticed several reviews on here draw parallels between \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" and \\"Perks.\\" Some call it a \\"rip-off\\" of \\"Catcher.\\"Is this fair? No.I'm sorry, but \\"Catcher in the Rye\\" didn't corner the market on coming-of-age stories. Far from it. The most accurate connection that \\"Perks\\" has to \\"Catcher\\" is brilliance. Both are heartfelt, touching, insightful stories taken from a young boy's point of view as events transpire that shape his life.There were moments where I saw myself in the character of Charlie, as I related to this character more than almost any other I've read about. And when I couldn't relate to Charlie, I wanted to.If you read this book and remain unmoved, you're clearly missing something."},{"rating":"2","title":"Simply amazing.","review":"The Perks of Being a Wallflower is my favorite book ever.

The ending SO sad."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best book ever!","review":"This is honestly the best book I have ever read. I finished it in one night! It's a very honest book, written as letters to an anonymous person. You can definitely find a character in the book to relate with. I was crying through most of it because it hit on so many emotions/memories. I watched the preview for the movie and was highly disappointed. The way I pictured the characters in my mind was much different, and in my opinion, more accurate. Read this book! You will not regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"The perks of being a wallflower","review":"An honest narration of a young boys life, a short and enjoyable read. I think it has a different message for each reader."},{"rating":"2","title":"This book left me speechless and wanting more","review":"I feel as though this book, even if I am reading it after its time, it doesn't change the timeless factor; that being, no matter how you look at it, man has his ups and down, and in the end, we're here to live a new day, with new choices that change everything. I gave this book five stars just for that, because for those of us that have our bad days and good days we try to determine with \\"karma,\\" we have another chance, and in the end, we can't be perfect. So, for all you people like Charlie, be a wallflower, and try not to miss shape your life with the things you choose."},{"rating":"2","title":"Wish it would of lasted longer","review":"This is now one of my very favorite books.

HCL did not take responsibility nor would they honor the 1 year warranty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Extremely unreliable","review":"I spend a lot of time away from a desktop computer, and I spend a lot of time working with Palm software that is somewhat unstable. This means that I periodically end up needing to do a hard reset and then restore everything to my palm.Well, I figured this module would allow me to keep a backup with me at all times, and even give me a little extra room in case I finally outgrew my Visor's internal memory. Not so. After every hard reset, the module typically has to be formatted. I have no idea what causes this, but it's completely useless to me in that case, and the company was not able to help me with the problem at all, aside from recommending that the module be reformatted.If all you need is extra room, but you don't need a backup, this is probably a good module, but I'm rating it exceptionally low because of this rather stupid problem with the product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Nice product - use with caution","review":"As others state here, it is very easy to use! It's the cheapest and simplist solution to solve the lacking of memory issue. Howeve, be careful when you move your data files to the flash card. In my case, half of my applications will still function properly after the data files being moved to the flash card. The other half either crash or the application can't find the data files any more. So, you have to test each of your applications after the move.

I bought a bottle of Shen-Min at the drugstore when they were offering a free trial in the form of a full price rebate. Believe me, I would never have forked over $29 for a bottle of Chinese vitamins! But after giving it the one-month trial I was hooked. I definitely saw results, my hair was thicker and very little fell out. I've been using it about 2 years now and it continues to work (although you cannot discontinue it) . I started with the two a day regimen but now I use just one a day. I will mention, though, that you can find it cheaper on other websites if you buy more than one bottle at a time."},{"rating":"1","title":"This product made me sick.","review":"I started taking this supplement on the recommendation of my hair stylist (I have thin, fine hair and she suggested it to thicken it up and make it more shiny). At first it didn't seem to do anything. By the end of three months (recommended timeframe to see if there is an improvement) I did think my hair was shinier and nicer. Unfortunately by that time I had been having some mild diarrhea and all kinds of gurgling noises in my intestines on a daily basis for about a month, which one weekend got really bad (hope I'm not grossing you out!). I stopped taking it and it cleared right up. I tried taking JUST ONE PILL a month later and had the mild diarrhea again.

This book will go into my library; however, will NOT get recommended to my dedicants.

The experience keeps my mind on what's important...God's wonder in our lives. This newer work by the Carmelites is incredibly refreshing and leads us into a prayer life that lifts up to the Lord the relevant things of the modern day. I appreciate the \\"approved\\" works of the ICEL but this prayerbook speaks to the common person who lives in this sometimes difficult and challenging world. People of the Church are seeking a closer relationship with God...one that allows them a more personal experience. That is as it should be. God speaks to us in wonderful ways and not always in the words of over-educated, out-of-touch men that haven't lived a normal life in years. God bless all sisters and brothers who open themselves to the Spirit and share great gifts.

The commentary notes are long, detailed, extensive, fascinating. The Greek font is readable: words and accents are clearly printed. The font is small, but it seems obvious that all publishers of Homer in the original want his readers to share his disability. The 1200 word vocabulary is convenient because it is located in the same volume as the text, it is limited to Homeric usage, and it is restricted to words found in Book I.

However, the movie revolves around a sorority where the members are united by their shared racial affiliation with a single demographic. I am not of that demographic, and I find it challenging to relate enough to make the film fully enjoyable. This is by no means to imply that I have any aversion whatsoever with that demographic, but the lack of commonality in humor, horror and other movie-relevant concepts does reduce my ability to enjoy the film. So my recommendation would be to evaluate whether this might apply to you and decide accordingly. Other aspects - the movie is ultra low budget, but the director does have decent enough directing/camera work skills to significantly reduce the impact of a small budget."},{"rating":"2","title":"One of the most thoughtful travel books ever written","review":"Muir combines vivid descriptions of people and scenes with passionate discussions of socialism, unemployment, and the spiritual poverty of the Scottish people in the 30's.

Not having read any other translation, I must take other reviewer's word that it compares well. Read the other reviews, they are correct about this books quality.Now, here's why I am mad. I read the introduction. Then I read the translator's notes. The translator is quite full of himself and his cleverness. Thus he points out the sections where he was particularly clever. In doing so, he gives away the plot, the ending of the novel, and why we should think about it the way he translated it, and not trust earlier transactions.This should have been an afterward, not before the text. I reviewed the plot, including the ending, before reading the text. This somewhat ruined the experience for me. Skip the translator's notes, and you'll have a fine edition of Kafka's influntial novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Man unto himself","review":"Many critics consider The Trial Kafka's best work. As in other main Kafka writings, life in relation to the demands of the society, is an ordeal. In this novel, K is found guilty and prosecuted by a non existent Court with non existent Judges, within the framework of a not revealed Law and without explaining the nature of his crime, Kafka displays his particulary complex visión of the existence of man in a society he deems totalitarian, how man has to fight all his life against the corruption and oppression of the System. The novel reveals Kafka's own psycho, looks like he has conceived a negative view of life and that he also was extremely paranoid. The Trial has many parables and interpretations, that is why it gets worth reading, it is up to every reader to develop his own conclusions."},{"rating":"2","title":"The Trial by Franz Kafka","review":"The TrialThe Trial by Franz Kafka is one of the greatest marks in the world literature. This book has two main levels of interpretation. One has to do with how social power is based on the possibility of criticism and accusation. The critical or accusatory content is less relevant than the exercise of power in the social life; the possibility of harsh punishment making the power game even more effective. The second level has to do with how someone can be completely dominated by the worries that stem from the accusatory process, Kafka enhances further the engendered personal drama by making the content of the accusation unknown. This power game has existed throughout the whole civilization, however, Franz Kafka with a touch of surrealism makes the awareness of its existence more possible to all human beings."},{"rating":"2","title":"Prepare to lose your sense of reason","review":"I haven't read a Kafka novel before. While reading this, I always find myself internally shouting and complaining about the lack of reason within the book. I complain about Josef K's lack of ability to fight for his situation, but then again I am reminded that this is surrealism at its best. Nothing makes sense in this book. But still, I love it. As long as you are willing to understand that nothing will make sense in this book, then you will enjoy it. If you aren't willing to give up your sense of reason, then don't read this one."},{"rating":"2","title":"Demanding, Yet Well Worth It","review":"This famous novel tells the story of Joseph K, who is accused by unidentified agents from an inaccessible and unidentified agency, of a crime that remains unknown and unnamed to Joseph K and to the reader.This novel is very demanding, and it's not an edge-of-your-seat page-turner by any account. So why read this book? Well, first of all, although the language is rather simple, it is still beautifully written. Secondly, this is one of those books that make you contemplate the role of the individual against a totalitarian system, and the struggle of the individual against a vast complicated network of bureaucracy. This is not a light read by any stretch either, however, it is very rewarding for those who willing put the necessary effort into it."},{"rating":"1","title":"Surprise","review":"Ah ha!!

He creates these series of grotesquely humorous tableaux, and then steps back and lets the reader make what they will of them. Reading The Trial I felt I could perfectly picture each scene as though I was watching a film, and there's something about this sort of cold objectivity which, when other authors use it, feels secure and safe, but when Kafka does it, feels charged with anxiety and some unspoken menace that's always looming just around the next corner. It reminds me of Gogol's writings more than anything else, where you see the superstitious, old Europe clashing with the malaise-inducing bureaucracy brought about by the new Europe"},{"rating":"2","title":"this is in reference to ...","review":"This is in reference to the no good layabout and sinister subversive from new jersey who said this book was boring and a waste of time.

A friend tried them as a shortening substitute in cookies with the best results; taste was fine once she ran the beans through the food processer and added them to cookie dough - but what isn't. Blending them and then using them as an addition to soup or 'secret vegies' in meatloaf and the like may have been the best use.I did a little experimentation and evidently salt helps beans from turning unappealingly mushy.

The original play was left substantially unfinished at the time of the author's death, so what you see here is Herzog's (controversial) sewing-together of various plot elements, not to mention his chronologication.If you're unfamiliar with the material, you'll be beset by questions until nearly the end, and Herzog's direction careens from heavy-handed to indecisive throughout.As for Kinski, I'm not sure if he actually had any ideas for the role other than staring bug-eyed at the camera.

I don't think even Herzog felt this one was truly special - there is no commentary track, for example, when most of the subsequent dvd releases of his films have included this feature. Maybe it is because this one is pretty straight forward. The costumes, dialogue, and acting are all good. It just feels like it's missing something..."},{"rating":"1","title":"Woyzeck--An awkward film","review":"Woyzeck took 18 days to film and four days to edit, but Herzog claims that this was perfect.

I found the remote easy to set up and use like all Harmony remotes. My only complaint is the screen is hard to read. When you press the glow button, the screen lights up blue with black text, resulting in little contrast. The Xbox 360 version lights up orange with black text, which has much better contrast. I would recommend going with the Xbox 360 version, even if you don't have an Xbox. Otherwise, these remotes operate the same."},{"rating":"2","title":"Cheapest decent Uni-Remote out there","review":"You cannot beat the price of this thing. It is pretty easy to program as long as you don't like to customize things too much. It works with pretty much device you can think of, and lights up when it senses movement so you can see it in the dark and you don't have to fumble for the \\"Backlight\\" button. It's very thin and attractive, and suprisingly has withstandad countless spills by various liquids, and even two hot wax spills, yet it still looks great and works fine after cleaning it off."},{"rating":"1","title":"You get what you pay for.","review":"This device looks good, has a nice feel but just doesn't compare to a Pronto. Tech support from Logitech is just okay, they don't get back to you with 2nd or 3rd level support. 1st level can't really answer many questions at all. I have issues with the remote being able to turn on the correct devices for the various activities I like to use with my home theater. Macro capabilities don't really exist and for any serious home theater aficionados this device just doesn't cut the mustard. It is a good universal remote with some extra features not offered by the typical universal but it's not worth the additional price. If you are a serious home theater user get a Pronto."},{"rating":"2","title":"Why did it take me so long to buy this?!","review":"I now have a drawer full of remotes, some of them old univesal remotes that aren't worth their weight in lead! Programing was actually a breeze, and I was up and running in no time. Anyone who complains about setting up the remote obviously does not have the patience to do it. It took me 15 mins to half an hour and I have not looked back. It's extremely, intuitive to use. The real test will be when my mother comes to visit ;-)Despite its good looks it's not perfect. My only gripe is that sometimes there is a fractional delay between when I press a button and the command being executed. While annoying, I have found that it is something I can live with. I also question the usb cover. I think frequent use will prevent it from closing, but only time will tell."},{"rating":"2","title":"perfect","review":"I now have three Harmony 550s in two different homes.

Great value and it takes all the other remotes out of the picture."},{"rating":"1","title":"Utterly Useless","review":"Found this remote to be utterly useless.

But, it is minor, as I'm getting accustomed to it.

Fantastic price...","review":"I bought this remote when Amazon had the $50 price. It works as advertised. It replaced 4 remotes and is a must when you have a complicated setup with an AV receiver. I tried the Harmony 880 and liked the remote but had a lot of issues with the charging base. Other than that both the remotes use the same software and support the same devices. The only disadvantage is that the button on the 550 are on the smaller side and some of important buttons such as the volume and channel are a little harder to operate. But after using it for a few days, it is getting better.Definitely a great value for the money. It made my non-techie wife's life a lot easier.

Basically I think this remote is great in theory, but it is a little hard to use at times. When I watch a DVD , I have to switch the input, but that reuires me going through the TV to do it. The remote supposedly is suppose to do it automatically. I also can't ontrol the volume when I watch a dvd and I have to switch to the controls of the tv to do that also.

I finally got the remote to work reasonably well, but it required four hours of fine-tuning its settings. There is a tech support line, but the wait time was horrendous, and they kept dropping my call.If you are interested in buying this remote, it would be wise to call or write Logitech first to confirm that they have codes for each of your devices. Also, even when there is a code, it is necessary to reprogram the LCD display to make the most-used commands easily accessible.I don't regret the purchase, but I would only recommend it to folks who have a lot of patience and fair degree of technical aptitude."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remote not good - Support not good","review":"Just after (of course) warranty ran out, the LCD went blank. After a brief web search I found that this is not uncommon with the 550 remote. After explaining, in writing, the steps I had taken to remedy the problem I received 2 responses. The first was to try the exact same things I said I had already done. The second was a \\"Sorry, we cannot repair your remote\\"...I was give the option of purchasing a new remote, at a discount, from their online store. However, the online prices are 30% higher that any other retailer.Bravo Logitech, bravo....!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not for big hands","review":"This is a very nice looking remote and easy to set up but just not easy to use compared to other remotes. Buttons are small, too close together and do not press smoothly. Also the remote seems very delicate and easy to break.

We have had to re-sync the remote twice and will have to do it again.

It does have a great help feature and will walk through yes and no questions to help you reslove the issue."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not intuitive and buttons do not work after a few months","review":"The setup and design of this remote is not very intuitive. The computer interface requires navigation through multiple screens and many of my products required quite a bit of playing around before they worked like I wanted. However, after a few hours of setup, most things worked fine.My biggest gripe though is that about a year after buying this remote, many of the buttons don't work. In fact, pretty much all of the buttons we use on a regular basis are completely useless. This despite the fact that we have taken extremely good care of it and it still looks like new.Also, a number of our electronics aren't supported by the remote such as our Sony Google Bluray. I'm sure it would function with a lot of work on my end but since the buttons don't work it would be a waste of effort.I am very unsatisfied with this purchase."},{"rating":"1","title":"What the H*ll?","review":"This remote, two years ago, was $50. At that price, it's a great remote that has made using my system much easier.

Very frustrating. Not well thought out in design."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not as good as expected","review":"This remote really wasn't as good as expected. Yes, it can do a lot of things, but the timing is slow (it takes a while to turn on the tv and there is some lag time between the remote and cable box). I've had this remote for about a year and now the screen on the remote is barely readable (this happened after I put new batteries in the remote). I might have a defect, I don't know, but I do know this was a waste of money and I won't ever buy a harmony remote again."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Product","review":"I bought this for a customer I had just installed a large media room for. He had several remotes and he was not very remote control savvy to say the least.I did a little reading on this and decided to try it.

He also loved the help feature as well.I am buying a second remote for another customer this weekend. Overall a very nice product for the money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Never worked...","review":"As other reviewers have said, the software setup requires a little more than simply knowing the model number of the devices that one wants to control with the device. After spending a good deal of time installing the latest software and setting up the remote, there were a couple of issues with the remote. Some of the \\"activities\\" that I had set up were not working as programmed in the software. The \\"help\\" button located on the remote itself was practically useless as it asked the same question over and over without any changes to the activity. Finally, the remote would frequently \\"freeze\\" leaving no option but to remove the batteries to \\"reboot\\" the remote. After calling tech support and having the person that I talked to get confused over \\"component\\" and \\"device\\", I decided to pack it up and send it back to Amazon. Great concept, bad execution."},{"rating":"2","title":"Finally, a universal remote that works!","review":"I have purchased 3 of these remotes so far, one for myself and 2 more for friends and family. Setup is a bit complex and requires basic computer and internet skills to match the remote to your components. Initial setup took me 20 or 30 minutes, but fine tuning the functions can be a bit time consuming. I love a challenge and I love to tinker, so for me this was no problem. If you are impatient, this remote is not for you! BUT ... if you just want a remote that actually works with all your equipment and can master most of the commands you need, then this is the one to get. Everyone I have given one to, including myself, love this remote."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is truly the one remote.....","review":"Finally a remote that delivers. It takes some tinkering and adjusting here and there, but straightforward to set up.

Setup did take some time, but most of that was spent trying to collect all of the model information from my various components. The software had to down load two different sets of software updates. Their wizard was pretty easy to follow. I did customize one button because the remote doesn't have a standard \\"display\\" button for DVD players, but even that change wasn't difficult. With the exception of the one button everything worked right away. Just make sure you follow directions and you shouldn't have a problem. I was surprised to find that it even had the codes for my new converter box (to convert over the air HD signals). I highly recommend this product."},{"rating":"2","title":"awesome","review":"This remote is amazing. The set up requires you to write the s/n of the electronics you have and boom...you're basically done.

The only feature i don't like is that you can't turn off the remote, it's alway on...it's pretty awesome tho that if it senses movement, the light comes on so it's easy to read. The battery life is pretty decent, i put new ones in one and a half months ago and no sign of them dieing."},{"rating":"1","title":"PITA","review":"I hoped this would simplify my 6+ remote system, no such luck.First of all, Logitec needs to find someone to write an instruction manual , instead of a multi language cartoon.

Anyway I setup my components test it out, My receiver does not turn off (among other problems i listed on a post it to fix).I try several times to fix that and other problems with online help to no avail. The remote also has all of the button functions of EACH remote on a 6x scroll, which makes it very tedious to do simple functions.

First off Logitech requires you to log on to the web and save all of the setting to their website. You need to list each piece of equipment that you want to control. This is a manual process, so you need to have all the model numbers written down or you are going to be walking back and forth to the computer.

Unfortunately, Logitech made it as confusing as possible to properly operate. You start by hooking it up via USB to your computer, selecting your devices, and setting up certain functions that you want the remote to perform. All is well until one of those functions gets out of order. For example, if you turn off the television manually, the next time you go to use the remote control, it will think that the tv is still on because you didn't turn it off with the controller. As a remedy, you'll have to go through a cycle of questions that the remote will ask you, which will re-callibrate it. It's a decent remote, it's just so unintuitive!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Doesn't work in all situations","review":"We spent several weeks trying to make this remote work with our equipment (an HD Motorola Cable Box, Sony TV, Tivo and Panasonic DVD/VcR). We had the Cable company check, Tivo check, and BestBuy where we bought the TV came out three times. There is only one way to wire the whole system and that way would not work with the remote. We spoke to Logitech many times, but they were unable to make it work. (Sometimes it's very annoying to try to talk to someone with a thick accent who is telling you technical stuff.) Anyway, they finally agreed the remote would not work with the way the equipment is wired, so in other words, it doesn't work in all situations. My advice, try to get it set up quickly in order to get a refund if it doesn't work."},{"rating":"1","title":"Remote ok, software fatally flawed","review":"The software you use to program the remote requires you to log in every time you start it, and times out after a while, requiring you to log in again.

Most of the devices were known by the software, with one exception. Following the directions, it recognized the device it didn't know. The macros are very nice and easy to configure using the software.The one thing that took a little getting used to is, there is a delay when pressing keys. For example, tapping the volume up or down will actually queue up several individual commands that take a while to execute. Consequently, tapping the volume a couple times will take about 4 seconds to execute, which is a little annoying when you're used to the OEM controller which is real-time.I'll buy another one when I can afford it!"},{"rating":"2","title":"working great","review":"could not be happier with this remote.

The remote that came with the tv does not always work the first time I press a button either and seems real sensitve to the direction it is pointed in. I had a few minor clitches while configuring it but found the solutions online and I was able to fix all of the issues. It would not turn my dvd player on and off but raw programming from the original remote solved the problem. It now controls my cable box, dvd player, AV reciever, PC setup and TV properly at least 99% of the time. It even has some funtions that aren't part of the original remotes. I had my doubts that I could ever get down to one remote but this has done it."},{"rating":"2","title":"This Is A Fantastic Remote!!!!!","review":"This remote is being used to control a Dish Network 622 DVR, Sony A/V receiver, Panasonic HDTV, and Toshiba HD-DVD player. I even setup a shell PS3 macro which puts all other equipment into the proper mode for PS3 (this remote does not have Bluetooth, so no PS3 capability). The LCD screen is pretty easy to read, but I hardly use it since my macro (activity) commands do all the work. It is fun playing with the software used to customize its functionalty. It does take a few days of fine-tuning through trial and error, but it really pays off. The batteries are still going strong three weeks later and there truly is no functionality lost even though it replaced four remote. I highly recommend this unit to everyone."},{"rating":"2","title":"Could use a better screen and buttons.","review":"I thought that the screen on this remote was hard to read in a dim room. The buttons dont feel right either. Otherwise, this remote does great!"},{"rating":"2","title":"This remote makes it easy.","review":"Once you get this programmed on your computer, which was a pretty easy and quick process, it operates all your units with one button. The only it doesn't do is bluetooth, which means you still have to operate the Wii separately. Once in a while it doesn't turn on everything correctly, but with the help button, it fixes everything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Fantastic device","review":"This remote works fantastic with my LG hi def set, Onkyo surround sound, Comcast digital cable box, Xbox, Wii. It took some time to get it all set up but after some minor tweaks it works flawless. My wife can finally turn on the TV to watch the news without getting assistance from me!"},{"rating":"1","title":"does what it's supposed to but it doesn't hold up.","review":"yes, programming this remote is very simple and very easy to use. It only took me about half an hour to set up maybe less. I was very impressed with how the unit interfaced with everything. That said, within two weeks the bottom of the LCD display started to not display properly and I've only had this product for a little over a month and I've already had to replace the batteries. I would recommend going one step higher! I think I'm going to try...Update: This product is completely starting to fail me completely! It burned through the most recent set of batteries in two weeks and the display is now completely unreadable! As soon as I can afford it I'm going to upgrade. This remote is not worth the money at all!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"The remote works, and the activities-based interface is nice. However, if you want to control a single advice, the lack of hardware keys is a major detraction. Unfortunately, the overall experience is more frustrating than convenient."},{"rating":"1","title":"A work in progress.","review":"The reason I gave it two stars is that it is still a work in progress. I got this for my mom, because she had difficulties using three different remotes to get a DVD to play. However, the screen with the custom buttons is way too small. This also makes the Help function completely useless to her.What I had to do is map some random button on the remote to specific functions. A is Input Next for TV, B is Input next for DVD, etc...And now there is a cheat sheet for the remote.Also, I had problems syncing it to my laptop. The tech support was usefully, and told me not to have the batteries in the remote when I sync. That solved the problem.Bottom line: If you have more than two remotes, and you can read font size of 10, and you like to play around with technology, then you will like this.If you are looking to get this to an elderly individual to make their life easier, look elsewhere. One For All makes rather nice products, and that's what we went with.

Half the time, the TV doesn't turn on from the first try - same goes when I try to turn it off."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quite Good - But Some Buttons are small","review":"Setup was easy. A bit more up-front information around what the steps are would be helpful - I have setup much more complicated remotes (requiring much more programming) and I found it at times counter-intutive when specific decisions are being madel.All harmony remotes have the same capabilities. The differences are in how many units the remote will control and the button layout. The remote itself is quite good. Only complaint for this specific design is that there is not a set of buttons that easily access / manage DVR recordings. I've used the A and B buttons on the lower right of the remote - they work just fine for the task but the labeling is not intutive nor are the buttons big - and they are used all the time."},{"rating":"2","title":"Better Value than the 880","review":"This model is significantly cheaper, and functionally identical to the Harmony 880 Remote. The button placement is a little strange, and counter-intuitive, but you get used to it quickly. You'll be happy with the function, and even happier with the money you save by choosing this model over the more expensive Harmony 880. The 880 has a fatal flaw with the charging device, that this one overcomes by using batteries instead. You sacrifice the color display, but you save big bucks. I bought the 880, and encouraged my Mother and Brother to buy the 550. I've programmed them all, and if I had it to do over, this is the one I would have chosen."},{"rating":"2","title":"great universal remote!","review":"This was a gift for my husband. He had no problem programming it and I am thrilled to now only have 1 remote instead of the 4 that we had laying around before.

I have spent hours trying to fix it going through all of the Logitech forums as well as every technical web page I could find about the problem and there were a lot as this does not seem to be an isolated problem with this remote . I also tried dealing with Logitech and it just seems like they are not interested in supporting this product. Go elsewhere I have had lots of other universal programmable remotes and I have never had similar problems with any other product."},{"rating":"2","title":"Even better than expected","review":"This harmony remote was a breeze to set up and works amazingly well. The website you use to configure the remote had all the components we use in our system, even an ancient TV set (30 years old).It took some tweaking but was clear how to do it so no problems. Take the time to read the instructions, and you can even set it up on the website before you get the remote to see how it all works. Good to see this kind of throrough thinking these days!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Still the best remote I've ever owned.","review":"I don't know how I ever got along without this gadget. Setup is easy. Even my no-name DVD player was listed in the database. Even a light-up button to illuminate the keys for late-night movie watching. Controls the XBOX360 well. Great product. Well worth the extra money over a normal universal remote.

We have about as many universal remotes as well. Some work these, other will work those, none will work all.......and finding those codes!@#$. Yeesh. Read reviews on this one, liked what was said. Found good price. WOW! This is easy to use. Works with everything. And in combinations as well! Configure this is minutes, even seconds for new or additional combinations from your PC. No, its not perfect. Has a few minor drawbacks.....small buttons for instance. But is so far ahead of the others that these are not a major problem. Still have those old remotes just in case, but they have resided unused in a box in the corner for months. Bet they never come back out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Remote!","review":"This was my first time using a universal remote, and the online software setup was a cinch to use. So easy in fact, that I was able to set it up from work, and then take it home, and able to use it on the first try with 3 different pieces of equipment (Plasma TV, Sony Dream Theater, and HD cable box). All I had to do was look up the models online, and that was it. The help function has been useful, and I can't imagine using more than one remote ever again!"},{"rating":"2","title":"So smooth to operate and great 2 Month support","review":"I truly love this remote.

Not exactly the best design. I don't really have 'fat fingers' but the numbers are so small, and close together, that it makes it hard to press the numbers and change channels. For now it gets the job done but I wish I would have bought a different one, and will in the future.Otherwise, it's a good all around remote for the price."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what it is intended to do.","review":"I really like this remote, works as intended, and easily setup. I like the ability to customize buttons, so I could move some button functions to other locations for easier use one handed.They only real negative is lack of a rechargeable battery, but for the cost, I just bought rechargeable triple A batteries."},{"rating":"2","title":"About as good as it gets","review":"I just received this remote today and had it set up and completely working in about 30 min. First thing to do is make sure the remote is compatible with your equipment prior to ordering by visiting the logitech / harmony website, it is very easy to navigate and find out if you are covered.The remote itself is a breeze to set up. Make sure you know what the model number and make of all your equipment is and what input they are connected to on your TV. The program will walk you through the rest. and once you test it on your components the remote will help you with issues that come up with a simple to navigate help menu on the remote itself.I can't say enough good things about this remote. It works perfectly with my system:Samsung LN40A550P HDTV, Sony all in one home theatre DAV-DX255, and a Scientific Atlanta HD-DVR.Do yourself a favor and get rid of all those remotes and have this one sleek remote do it all for you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does Everything","review":"This remote everything that its supposed to do and more.

My only complaint is that the buttons are too small for my hands, and if I had to do it over, I would purchase the Harmony 670."},{"rating":"2","title":"Excellent concept, only a few flaws","review":"I told the guy at the stereo store that I wanted a way to control all my devices with one controller, and I didn't want to have to control each component separately as is typical with cheap universal remotes. He mentioned the Harmony remotes, and I discovered that they did exactly what I wanted. I press \\"Watch DVD\\" and it turns everything on, sets the audio mode on the receiver and the video mode on the TV, and I'm set.There are 2 reasons I'm not giving 5 stars. First, the most-used buttons, the channel and volume up/down buttons, are easy to find, but small and don't give much tactile feedback. Second, I had to return the first one of these I bought when every other line on the LCD display went blank about 2 weeks after I got it. I applaud Amazon's exchange service, which was fast and convenient."},{"rating":"2","title":"Solid Universal Remote for the price","review":"I own the Harmony 880 for my main entertainment set-up. I bought the 550 for my bedroom tv/DVD set-up and it has prefermed great. I do miss some of the features that the 880 has like the buttons glow when the remote is tilted. This helps to see the buttons in the dark quite well. The 550 will do this but only when I first pick it up, not when I have been watching a show for a few minutes. But there is a glow button that I can press so not a huge deal. All in all for the price, I think this is a good value. You must be comfortable programming it using the wizard on your computer though. The software is pretty good but it is sometimes difficult to figure out where options are located."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best Choice in this Price Range","review":"This review assumes you already know that Harmony Remotes are \\"activity based\\" and programmed via your PC. So, if you are trying to decide *which* Harmony to get, I can recommend the 550. I also own the Harmony 670 and I like the 550 better because you can program activities (e.g., Watch TV or Play DVD) into the buttons adjacent to the LCD. On the 679, there are hard pre-printed activity buttons along the top edge. The range and power is good. The remote uses regular batteries so there is no cradle to plug in. And it's less than $100. In this price ranage it's a great remote. One gripe: the Channel +/- and Volume +/- are curved switches around the cursor circle. It's just a pain that the buttons you use the most don't feel like any button on any remote you ever used before. It might make your thumb crazy."},{"rating":"2","title":"great","review":"its nice the only thing i hate is no built in blutooth so its not compatible with PS3 but thats sony's fault not logitechGo harmony"},{"rating":"2","title":"Good upgrade from 520","review":"I owned a Logitech 520 remote for two years, and recently upgraded to the 550. Overall, it is a good upgrade. I still find the number buttons a bit mushy due to their silicone skin construction. The blue screen's legibility is somewhat improved but it is still a bit dim.

The only remote I've ever found that is easy to set up and, can control every device I own with the press of one button is the Universal Remote R50. The R50 does it all and then some, making Harmony remotes look like an overpriced paperweight.Pick one up for under $80 and you will never go back to the overpriced garbage that is Harmony.

Some things are a tad misleading. For example; the power button can only be used as a power button when using the \\"Activities\\" macros and not when addressing a specific component (Like, if I select TV to use that profile for my TV, the power button is not programmable or usable. It can only power cycle the TV once I do something like \\"Watch TV\\" in the Activities macro, and then it will power off all components used in that macro - my receiver, monitor, and DVR).Aside from that, not a bad little unit. It even works with my Mac Mini. RF ONLY!"},{"rating":"2","title":"How can it get any better than this?","review":"Logitech sells several models above the 550. Honestly, I cannot imagine what else you could possibly be missing from purchasing this remote. It is INCREDIBLE. The setup is easy and thorough. You can customize it beyond what you would imagine. Want your A/V receiver to be turned on after your DVD player? You got it! Want to have the remote say \\"Annoy Wife\\" when you want to play your Xbox? No problem! Was your DVR infrared receiver blocked by the stack of magazines on the coffee table? It can handle that.

The mfr's database didn't even have a command program for my common Sony DVD carousel, and its proven a real pain in the you-know-what to try to program. Same applies to my Pioneer TV; only the most basic commands are in the database; others must be manually programmed.Problem 3:There are no generic instructions on how to program the remote so one can understand the process; its 100% step-by-step and trial-and error.This is a big disappointment since I thought it would solve the multiple remote issues.

I tried various options and whenever I changed a setting manually, that one option would work,,, sometime, but then it would negate a previously programmed function.I worked with this thing and wasted most of a perfectly good Saturday afternoon.

Each time it would work some functions and mess up others ... I could never get it quite right and I am extremely computer/tech savvy. As an example... it would insist on programming the TV to turn on when all I wanted to do was to listen to the CD player. The wizard based programming interface is really a mess and will require you to press buttons three times if you want to delete an item. Documentation is so poor that you end up trying different options and selections just to get to the feature that needs correcting. You can easily spend half a day programming the Harmony - time not well spent."},{"rating":"1","title":"Do not buy this unless...","review":"After verifying that it would work with my equipment on Logitech's website, I bought it and sure enough, it really did not work with 2 of the 3 that I had. Many hours later, I finally got it manually programmed well enough to make use of it. 5 minutes later, it crashed. So if you are lucky enough to have equipment that it works with first time out, then lucky you. If not, then you will likely throw the thing against the wall like I did. It was rugged enough to take the hit, so instead, I had to bend it in half, thoroughly completing its destruction with my bare hands before chucking it back in the box, while hooting in sadistic glee.One final thought: What kind of idiocy is it that allowed them to write software for programming the remote that must have internet access to work at all? I can see updates done this way, or occasionally uploading the settings for safe keeping, but that is about the limit. This is just too stupid for words."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great Controle","review":"This is a very nice controle. Good design with a smarter look than the more expensive models. You will most likely run into a few snags when programing this remote with your computer but fear NOT. Logitech's support is second to none at least in reference to this product any way.

Programmed it and everything seemed to be going swimmingly. But then it started developing hiccups. Setting to watch a DVD puts my TV on the wrong video input intermittently. Sometimes it does not change my video input at all. In addition, there could be better Media Center PC compatibility as there is no way to wake it from a sleeping state without using the Microsoft remote. Logitech simply wont do it.And at times the channel number buttons are hard to press. Other than that the remote is very logically laid out and it is easy to find the right key. I also like the fact that it seems to know when I am near and light up in the dark. Kind of spooky and cool at the same time.It has issues that are only small annoyances and do not outweigh the benefits of not having 5 different remotes on my coffee table."},{"rating":"2","title":"Easy to set up even with older a/v components","review":"I purchased the 550 for my parents as they had multiple remotes and a couple of them were starting to malfunction. Set up was straight forward and pretty easy even with a 15+ year old TV and 6 year old receiver. If you are technically challenged set up may take longer, but there are tutorials available to help with the process.The function of the remote is very straight forward. Most of the control button names are similar to the old remotes so it was easy to explain how to use the new remote.I recommend this remote for someone looking for a simple design, yet powerful enough to handle a variety of components of various types and ages."},{"rating":"2","title":"Does what they say","review":"I've found it very easy to set up and it does exactly what they say. I love the \\"activities\\" feature where it sets up the buttons for a given activity rather than a specific device. Volume controls the stereo but channel controls the DVR and the aspect button (had to add that one) controls the TV. Very friendly remote. Can't believe nobody thought of this sooner!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Very Good","review":"We had a difficult time programming this remote, but most of our components are 10 years old or more. We had to put in a similar model TV rather than our actual model since the software would not recognize our TV. We also had to manually add commands on to the end of our activities in order for everything to work ok. There are lots of hidden settings in the software that you need to go through if you are having problems. Be patient - it is worth it.Now that we have the remote working just the way we want it, we can put our other 5 remotes in a drawer and have just one remote control. We love it!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Cumbersome and painful","review":"I have suffered with this remote for the past year. The idea is nice that all buttons can be configured, but I really hate the following:-When switching between Activities the remote toggles the power on all of the devices within that activity. For example, switching between \\"Watch DVD\\" and \\"Watch Cable\\", the television switches off, and the remote is in the \\"Watch Cable\\" activity - which generally does not have an individual TV power on. So, using the activities button did not work for me.-The software is very regimented, such that you must go through their way of programming.-One positive thing is there are active forums which help when you encounter issues.I gave up and put all of the common devices in my main activity, so I don't switch between activities. I would not purchase this remote again."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good and Bad","review":"I finally bought a universal remote when I finally got tired of juggling 5 different remotes for my entertainment system.I like that you use your computer to setup the remote, and using the phone customer support, the technician can even change setting on the remote for you. However, I find the setup page for the remote very poorly laid out and confusing. And I'm a reasonably tech-savy person with lots of electronic gizmo's. I hate to think what a hard time someone with little tech-savy will have with the remote set-up. They will probably either chuck it out the window or return it.Logitech has a lot of fine-tuning left to do on this product."},{"rating":"1","title":"Replaced 3 times now dead again","review":"This is the most unreliable consumer device I have ever purchased. Within the first year I had it replaced under warranty 3 times. Now it is out of warranty and the display has gone blank.

See quick clip posted with this review. Logitechs solution, they sent me emails saying have it fixed by a third party, re-cover the back with plastic sheeting, buy a new remote from them at 10% discount so its only 30% more than you can buy it online. Will never buy another product from them. I have remotes that are 20 years old and the plastic shows no sign of degradation.

Mother is happy to be able to turn everything on with one button every time. Sometimes it takes a while for the volume control to respond but I think that our sound system needs to warm up before it can receive the signal. It turns everything off with one button too. Easy to read screen. I just used the batteries in it so far and it hasn't lost power yet."},{"rating":"2","title":"very good and powerful","review":"I got this remote for Christmas and really enjoy it. The basic setup was very easy, but as I used the remote I found a few items I needed to change. In particular my receiver is older and I have to use a tape input for the TV. This is a monitor loop so I had to figure out how to program the remote to turn the loop off when leaving the TV. It all works great, but took a little fiddling and searching of the Harmony website.This is such an improvement over the 5 or 6 remotes I had."},{"rating":"2","title":"Best remote company anywhere!","review":"I currently own 3 of these remotes.

The first one finally wore out and I wanted to save a little money and so chose the Harmony 550. While this remote has the same wonderful programming features of the more expensive units it was for me difficult to use and finally relegated to the end table drawer. If you are used to manipulating your remote by feel then this not the remote for you. The flush buttons are impossible to press without looking and then they are very small."},{"rating":"2","title":"This entire recording is absolutely beautiful!","review":"This collection is awesome! \\"It doesn't get any better than this!\\" -- like when we were on a 33 foot pleasure craft on our trip up the Mississippi listening to this recording while playing cards waiting for the locks to open up.

The Goo Goo Dolls are one of the best bands in the world any album of theres is a plus to your cd collection. Anyway Hold Me Up is one of there earlier albums that still retains there orignal hardcore punk sound from the 80's. This is a big part of the goo goo dolls as some of the tracks verge on what you here now on albums like Dizzy Up The Girl & Gutterflower. Back to the point the best track on this album are 2. Just The Way You Are, 4. There You are. But in fareness the stand out track on this must have album is Two Days In February. In conclusion i hate the people that say goo goo dolls older albums are there best as this is not true there music was good back then but it has evolved so much now the \\"Dizzy Up The Girl\\" and the \\"Gutterflower\\" albums are there best to date and the cover version of Supertramps \\"Give A Little Bit\\" is also cool.

You Know What I Mean) are great songs with great meanings that actually makes you want to think. An album that makes you laugh and think at the same time? I think you can say that's a great album :)"},{"rating":"1","title":"Bleahh","review":"Goo Goos make that song \\"Million Miles Away\\" -- and every othersong -- sound like some sloppy, drunken toss-off that was barelyrehearsed. Why must these modern bands insist on taking classic songs and playing them as though through a blender, completely trashing them? Is this cool? Or better yet, is this TALENT? Yes, I know the Goo Goos can also write their own songs....sort of. At least they *try* to write their own songs, I'll give them that, although it is, at best, just above the level of trained monkeys trying to write their own songs.

Bassist Robby does most the singing and writing which is a shame. Johnny's songs, however, show his amazing gift for lyrics. Most of the songs are really heavy and not at all like those on Dizzy. The only song that really stands out is \\"2 Days in February.\\" Great hint of what the Goo Goo Dolls have become. I'd try the newer albums first before going with this one.

The recent loss of her mother, the upcoming move to a new Army base, and Diane's romance with Dickie Mac coincide with Katie's sometime reluctant loss of childhood.The writing is emotionally wrenching. \\"I fold up my pajama bottoms into a neat square.

The problem is that the company shipping these things has no idea how to package something for shipping. The package is a single walled cardboard box which doesn't hold up in shipping. They are after all shipping large pieces of metal. My box had holes in it which was not good given the small screws which float around in the box. Some small parts were missing and the metal parts of the cabinet had the corners bent. Much worse than any description I read here and missing parts really pissed me off.

Nonetheless it has a few bent corners, dings, and small blemishes-- all minor and cosmetic. The instructions are relatively detailed and clear. It took me just over an hour to assemble (while watching television). Both a 7/8\\" and 1/2\\" nut-driver, wrench, or ratchet are required along with a philips screwdriver. Once assembled the unit seems solidly built. It weighs just under 60 lbs and includes hardware to attach to a floor or wall studs. The included locking mechanism locks the door on three sides. Overall, although not the best around, this probably has the best security-to-cost ratio of anything on the market."},{"rating":"1","title":"Don't buy from this company!!","review":"I ordered this cabinet as a Christmas present for my husband from Sportsman's guide. Without my authorization they linked my account information, including my email and payment info, to an account previously opened by my husband and put his name and email as the primary contact. They then sent an order conformation to him! So much for as a suprise christmas present. I left a message for a supervisor to call me about my complaint, which was never returned. When I finally did contacted a supervisor they said there was nothing that could be done about their system merging similar accounts together based on addresses. Wow how interesting is that!

This is one of those rare films where the film is not only great as a whole, but each scene and each shot seems perfect, from the boat on the lake accompanied by music from Mozart's Magic Flute to Kaspar's dream of the Caucausus to his wild, disorganized effort to play the piano to his interrogation by two clerics to his social display by Lord Stanhope.

And what about any British music for God's sake? The Beatles one appearance from the landmark appearance on the 2/9/64 show is the only hint that there was music made anywhere but the good old U.S.A.

Some of the music on this cd is only there to satisfy certain demographics and does not do justice to the miniseries...nor to the period it pretends to represent.

Even more scary because the potential victim is a defenseless baby. I first saw it 30 years ago when I was 11, it affects me more now, I guess that's what parenthood does to you. Just out of interest, the baby in the movie would be 35 by now.Probably works in Silicon Valley, drinking Starbucks and eating sushi.But the movie itself, a beautifully made and acted film, very underrated. An interesting period peice, complete with a San Francisco radio jingle of the time playing on the stereo in the apartment, with the cat lounging around. For some reason, I think that's a beautiful piece of cinematography. Very Hitchcock like. The poor pussy cat is right up there with the rabbit in \\"Fatal Attraction\\", simply a plot device for some thing bad to happen to. You do feel some sympathy for the villian, there are issues with both sides, but I'm so glad good (The baby) prevails in the end."},{"rating":"2","title":"a good 60's thriller","review":"Mark Robson directed this film set in San Francisco which is entertaining and has its exciting moments. Naive young woman, new in town, falls for handsome psycho...and then the fun begins.The great Ernest Laszlo did some fine cinematography, the John Williams score (except for that interminable, awful title song) is excellent, and the script by Larry Cohen and Lorenzo Semple Jr. has some well thought out scenes.Carol White (who looks and sounds a little like Julie Christie did during the same time period) is Cathy, the tormented woman, Paul Burke the strong and solid husband, and Scott Hylands is Mr. Weirdo, and they all do a nice job of giving you a few scares.This film is a piece of memorabilia for me, as an early \\"Vernon\\" portrait hangs on the wall of Cathy's apartment...so many thanks to Charles Thompson, who did the Set Decoration, for having such eclectic (and good !) taste in art."},{"rating":"1","title":"A Frightening Prequel to Fatal Attraction","review":"This movie is definitely unnerving, so don't watch it alone. Carol White plays a young woman who meets a handsome young photographer( even in the beginnig he uses sadistic ways to meet her or be around her) who has some mental problems to say the least. When she becomes pregnant he throws her out and she gets an abortion. Months later she meets a wonderful man and after they are married they have a son. Her ex finds out about her and finds a way to manipulate his way back into her life, still resenting the fact that she aborted his baby. He eventually kidnapps the baby with disasterous consequences. I acctually wanted to see this because it was one of Ron Masaks earlier roles. ROn, best know as sheriff Mort Metzger on Murder She Wrote, was reduced to a few seconds on screen with someone else doing a voice-over for him."},{"rating":"2","title":"Underrated thriller","review":"If you haven't come across this movie yet, do so..it is worth it. An late 60's 'Fatal Attraction', Carol White stars as a budding artist who arrives in San Francisco and falls for the charms of the dangerously psychotic Scott Hylands. When she becomes pregnant, and doesn't want the baby, well, I won't tell you the rest, but with a cast including Paul Burke and Mala Powers, and James Sikking in an early role, and the gorgeous scenery of San Francisco, taut direction by Mark Robson (who's last movie 'Valley of the Dolls' a year earlier proved he could keep an audiences interest, despite the over the top dialogue...'Valley', not this one)it keeps you on the edge of your seat, including the nail biting finale..Carol White is excellent as Cathy, but a word of warning: she comes across as a bitch, and somewhat unsympathetic at times. But Scott Hylands is down right sinister as Kenneth. A well done shocker, worth your time and money."},{"rating":"2","title":"Not many texts out there","review":"There doesn't seem to be as many texts out there on Shi'a Islam, and this is an excellent and well translated primer on the sect.

Tupac's acting and Maya Angelou's poetry were perhaps the only truly commendable aspects of the film. The plot, in attempting to cover too much ground, becomes muddled and confused, and unfortunately Janet Jackson gave a very lacking performance of the character of Justice (in the theatre, people were laughing as she attempted to act dramatically). Some of the plot was also contrived, and the characters fell pray to the standard stereotypes. Overall, this is a film with a lot of potential, that turned out poorly."},{"rating":"2","title":"This is a great film!","review":"Poetic Justice is about a girl named Justice (Janet) who writes poetry and is trying to get through hard times that have happened in the past and start over.

The other women characters in this film also did not come across well, because Singleton has yet to learn how to deal with them onscreen. The story rambled at times, and a few times, some plot points were not explained. Why did the male stylist in the beauty shop break down after receiving a phone call?

In writing a statement such as: at least Tupac is dead only proves that even in death Tupac Shakur still holds the power to strike anyone good or bad. Truth be told, whether you loved him or hated him he stole the entire show. Not even a superstar like Janet Jackson had the ability to shine brighter than Tupac and anyone who has taste in movies knows this. Even if Tupac were a horrible actor that gives no one the right to trifle his death. The movie was good period. Hey Dennis, even in death Tupac has more class than you. Honestly, Tupac will never be dead and if you don't understand the meaning behind that, you're the moron."},{"rating":"2","title":"Janet saves this movie...","review":"\\"Poetic Justice\\" is a decent movie.

He was willing to go through so much crap at work and with his child's mother just to take care of her. As for Janet, I think she did a terrific job portraying a young woman in mourning. This was a role that could've been overacted very easily. Some people said she wasn't \\"ghetto\\" enough. What is the definition of ghetto? How many times was she supposed to roll her neck or crack her gum to be taken seriously? The truth is, Janet could've stood on one foot and recited Shakespeare blindfolded and some people still would've hated her simply because she is a Jackson. That's silly.

Brazilian Nights was produced by acoustic guitarist Jack Jezzro, who also wrote all the tunes except one. His supporting musicians include Pat Coil (the one musician I had previously heard of) on keyboards, Craig Nelson on acoustic and electric bass, Eric Darken and Glen Caruba on percussion, with appearances by George Tidwell on flugelhorn and Denis Solee on flute.

The glare is only a problem if you position the light to shine directly on the center of the screen... so don't do that and you won't have a glare problem. It still gives plenty of light if you position it towards the edge of the screen and point it at an angle.It tends to be a little loose (it can wiggle a little), but that's to be expected since I'm using it on the wrong device and I broke of that plastic ledge.

The only problem that affects the GameBoy advance is its lack of a backlit screen. In normal light, this usually isn't a problem, but for naturally dark games (like \\"Castlevania\\") and playing in poorly lit conditions, it can be an issue. Alas, the Wormlight does nothing to fix the problem. In many ways, it makes it worse. Instead of providing a broad, soft light to enhance the screen, this light produces a narrow, harsh glare. The glare created practically washes out any ability to see what is happening on the screen. Check out some other lights or just go completely without one rather than wasting money on this one."},{"rating":"1","title":"AWFUL! STAY AWAY!","review":"I recently got a Wormlight Advance(purple, but not clear purple) and this thing is really a horrible piece of plastic.

It is OK if you put a Game Boy Color Game in the system -- then the voltage in the link port is higher and the light is brighter. If you are looking for a good light buy a Light Shield Advance for ($) at your local GameStop/Babbages.

I bought 50 feet of spool and somebody at quality assurance taped 2 ends of the speaker wires together from the manufacturer. Unbelievable.

Costner, a doctor, loses his wife in a tragic accident in and begins to get strange feelings and signs that she is perhaps alive or that she is trying to give him a sign from the other side? Thompson, wonderful from TV's Once and Again, is haunting and lovely in playing his doctor wife.With the help of the children on the cancer ward, Costner's character gets clues from his wife about the accident, but what does it all mean. The clues will keep you guessing along with Costner. Is he crazy, is he sane? He won't give up until he finds the answers out. And the truth will leap out and grab you heart and soul.DVD extras like the deleted scenes are wonderful, especially because they show how much of a different movie it would have been had they remained in.

I suppose it's a rhetorical question because, whenever a movie asks such a question, its answer is invariably \\"No way!\\" Otherwise, there would be no movie.There is the hope/dream/belief in almost all mankind that there is something beyond life as we know it. But, I suspect that, if anyone called you from the beyond the way Kevin Costner's dead wife does in \\"Dragonfly\\", you'd wind up in a mental institution before you found out what she was trying to reveal is kind of neat. Too bad the movie's makers felt it neccessary to resort to obvious and pedestrian storytelling.Sadly, \\"Dragonfly\\" does nothing to revive the flagging career of Mr. Costner, who is entirely wrong for the role. He can be a rather good actor, and I hope his fortunes turn in the near future.

Kevin does his usual part, the director (let's not waste time saying his name) has the Reader's Digest idea of what suspense is, and the writer wrote things like: \\"Por favor, go home, señor\\". Do they really believe that we, latinamericans, speak like that (in Spanglish)? I am very sorry that Mr. Costner hasn't had a hit in a while, but it is also a shame that his name is in such a horrible and mediocre film like this one.

The contact information for hotels was outdated in many cases.Typically I am very satisfied with Lonely Planet guides, however this one is not up to their usual standard.I would recommend Independent Travelers Greek Island Hopping instead if you plan to spend any time on Greek islands."},{"rating":"2","title":"Lonely Planet Greece","review":"Excellent book meeting standards set by the series. Was very useful to plan our trip to Athens and the Greek Islands last Oct. would strongly recommend to other travellers. Look for latest edition tho."},{"rating":"1","title":"A disappointment!","review":"Having started reading Sharyn McCrumb's books with the Appalachian series, I have to say that I was disappointed in the Elizabeth MacPherson books. They just don't have the depth of her other series (even \\"Bimbos of the Death Sun\\" is more interesting) and just don't capture my interest."},{"rating":"1","title":"Not the best","review":"I read this as a book club selection - and we all wondered why we'd picked it. Not the best storylines to say the least. The one that involves the dolphin is especially ridiculous."},{"rating":"1","title":"ridiculous","review":"I bought the book because I absolutely loved \\"The Song Catcher\\" and the title intrigued me. However, this book is not up to McCrumb standard. What was she thinking???Why would you put some assinine story about a relationship with a dolphin! in with the rest of this book? The other \\"stories\\" in the book wove together nicely as a good mystery. Why, oh why, add that nonsense about the dolphin? I may never read another of her books because of this. I can't believe the difference between this and the incredible \\"Song Catcher\\""},{"rating":"1","title":"A huge dissapointment","review":"Granted Sharon McCrumb wrote this book in the middle of her extremely well written ballad series, continuing the saga of foresinc anthropologist Elizabeth McPherson. Perhaps she has become bored with the McPherson character. Or prehaps she just wanted a venue to rant about the excesses of liberal academia. In either case, this book is best forgotton. Sorry, Sharron."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bookclub Bomb","review":"The person who picked this selection for our bookclub nearly got 'egged' when she walked in the door. We all agreed it was a shallow, dull book. Never again for this author!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Has it all: humor, mystery, science, history, and feminism","review":"Sharyn McCrumb has succeeded brilliantly in writing a novel that is a decent murder mystery and yet also so much more. She manages to incorporate some interesting bits of Civil War-era history and lore, some little-known facts regarding the nature of a certain poison that figures prominently in the story, and also some thoughtful insights into the nature of contemporary American sexism and women's varying reactions to it. Through it all, McCrumb manages to keep her reader laughing; as she spins out the various threads that comprise her tale, she exhibits a devastating wit which she employs to perfection in illustrating the foibles of her characters and of human life in general.This was a book that once started, I had a hard time putting down. McCrumb always writes with grace and wit, and this is one of her very best efforts."},{"rating":"2","title":"You'll never think of dolphins the same way","review":"I enjoyed this book, though it's much darker than the rest of the light-hearted series. I'm sorry Ms. Mccrumb gave up on Elizabeth MacPherson, but at least we have this fine swan song for her. Enjoy!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Moving and fun mystery about human relationships","review":"Another visit with Clan MacPherson. Elizabeth is back in the states mourning Cameron, who is lost at sea, and working as an investigator for her brother's law firm.Her parent's divorce is final and Elizabeth's mother has decided to be a political lesbian. Her brother is handling a murder case where the wife of a bigamist is accused of murdering her husband, and also helping a woman marry a dolphin. Bill MacPherson's law partner, A.P. Hill, is also handling a murder case where a woman shot her ex-husband and his new wife in cold blood.Not a particularly restful way for Elizabeth to deal with the disappearance of her beloved Cameron. It does make for some fun and fascinating reading for the audience. It will also make you think about the relationships in your own life."},{"rating":"2","title":"A thought provoking book disguised as a light mystery.","review":"McCrumb has written a thought provoking book disguised as light mystery. Returning heroine Elizabeth McPherson, mourning the disappearance of her husband, joins her brother's law firm as an investigator. The plot revolves around a suspicious death in the present that mimics an unsolved murder from 100 years earlier. To solve one, means to solve the other. Elizabeth uses her expertise as a forensic anthropologist to do just that. What makes this book stand apart from the other Elizabeth McPherson books is the thread that runs throughout of spousal abuse and abandonment. The title is from a quote overheard from an abused woman: \\"If I'd killed him when I met him, I'd be out of jail now.\\" While the mystery is entertaining, the undercurrent of abuse, abandonment, and loss of faith, leaves the reader with an aftertaste that is slow to go away. One must wonder what events were occuring in the author's life as she penned this novel."},{"rating":"2","title":"Read this one - you will never forget it.","review":"Lighter than the author's more serious books, nevertheless this story has an edge to it.Entertaining with surprises as well as social consciousness.Try to catch up with this one - I don't think you'll regret it."},{"rating":"2","title":"Sharyn McCrumb is one of the best authors. Ever.","review":"I started reading the ballad novels years ago. I can't wait until she writes another book. I hope she hurries!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Hilarious, very good read!","review":"Before I retired the only chance I had to read wa s when I went to bed. This book made me laugh so much my husband asked me to read in the living room because I was keeping him awake! It was such a good read that I recommended it to all my friends, and before it was over with I couldn't remember who borrowed it from me last. It was such an honest story and reminded me so much of characters that I had met in my life. Bill is the perfect brother, and Elizabeth's letters are so like so many I've read. Anyone with a sense of humor will appreciate this great story. McCrumb outdid herself!"},{"rating":"2","title":"McCrumb turns a phrase with the best of them!","review":"I recently was blessed to stumble across a book I had bought for my wife sometime back. Sharyn McCrumb's \\"If I Had Killed Him When I met Him\\" is an excellent mystery novel. McCrumb's ability to write a mystery novel full of clever dialogue, social commentary, and interesting characters. Multiple myseteries unfold that compel the reader to remain up late at night to read \\"just one more chapter.\\" McCrumb's ability to move the plots along (all of them) and keep the reader from getting distracted makes this a GREAT novel rather than just a good read. Some of her other novels are not quite the same caliber, but Sharyn strikes a finely tuned chord with this novel. I highly recommend it."},{"rating":"2","title":"couldn't find this size in town","review":"I went to home Depot and OSH. No one had this size. I cut through plastic and wood without issue. I made three cuts so I won't speak to longevity"},{"rating":"2","title":"sharp, fast, accurate","review":"I bought this hole saw to cut holes in a poker table for cup holders. Even with a cordless drill it was no problem to cut clean, accurate holes. I didn't need them really accurate as the insert will cover some problems with a cut but the cuts are clean enough that I could use them exposed with just a little sanding if I needed to.Make sure to put a backing board behind the material being cut so that this hole saw goes all the way through without splintering. It even did a nice job on a board that had laminate on it. I may have been extra careful on that but I am not sure I needed to be as it worked great."},{"rating":"2","title":"Health of body, mind and soul","review":"Like all of Ellen White's writings the language is that of the Victorian age, and might be difficult for modern readers to understand. However, the scope of the book, and the ideas it presents that apply to physical, mental, and spiritual health are well worth our attention and thought, and to realise the book was written before modern ideas on medical practice and psychological understanding had changed so much, and written by a woman without advanced education and covering so many aspects of health and wellbeing, is cause for wonder.A very useful book that is well worth reading and then thinking about."},{"rating":"2","title":"Truly a good read","review":"It astonishes me how ahead of her time Mrs. White was. Also how today they are just afirming what she taught"},{"rating":"2","title":"A must have for your Home Library","review":"A very inspiring book. It contains many helpful tips for healthy living, for the entire family. I enjoyed reading it so much that I am reading it again, so I don't miss anything."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great book for beginners!","review":"This book is great for the beginning computer user! One of the few computer books that include complete table of contents and glossary. Read the third chapter FIRST for a complete look of the history of computers and a brief description of computer components and an overview of computers and their functions. This chapter takes the \\"mystery\\" out of computers. The second chapter opens the doors to the Internet - what it is, how to use it, etc. Finish with the first chapter for the best of the Web. Great for families learning together that \\"Computers REALLY don't byte\\"!"},{"rating":"2","title":"Know the Modern World of French Wine","review":"You might buy this book because it's a beautiful coffee table book - the beautiful pictures and the layout...Or you might buy it because it's great for reference material.If you love wine, simply buy it for that reason alone. It is very up-to-date, the author, no stranger to French wine, a true professional, uncovers the latest trends and troubles in the various wine regions of France. He talks with growers and vintners, producers and negociants - providing perspective from all angles.Beyond reading the latest issue of Decanter or Wine Spectator, this is perhaps the most informative and concise manner of learning about the \\"now\\" of French wine. Like other Mitchell Beazley publications, the focus here is on the great presentation and the high level of scholarship/research/journalism. This book will nourish your curiosity."},{"rating":"1","title":"Moisture affected book","review":"Disappointed with the quality of book received not matching the description - in that it appears to have been stored in damp conditions = dust cover slightly mouldy and the pages don't lay flat. If I had seen this book in a bookstore i would not have purchased"},{"rating":"2","title":"Somm must have","review":"I found this book as a recommendation in Raj Parr's new book, which is also quite good. The vigneron profiles are excellent and focus on people doing interesting work, like Jacques Puffeney in the Jura. The author has a solid writing voice. It reminds me a bit of Hugh Johnson from his World Atlas of Wine - personal, informed, thoughtful. The best wine book purchase of the year for me."},{"rating":"2","title":"excellent book!","review":"One of the rare books! Thanks to University of Michigan and HP for making it available to everyone!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not typical DeWalt quality","review":"In the past I've been impressed with the quality of my DeWalt tools. Not this time. The welds of the hole saw body weren't carefully completed or completely smoothed down. The chuck threads weren't cleaned after they were cut, or chased after the saw was painted, meaning it was very hard to screw on the first several times and I kept fearing that I was cross threading it. And the whole body of the saw is about 1/8 inch out of true so it wobbles as you drill, making it bind slightly and drill a hole larger than it is rated for. The white Lennox and other orange brand hole saws I have from the big box home centers are much higher quality, though more expensive. You could get better quality and a cheaper price on a hole saw from Harbor Freight and Northern Tool."},{"rating":"2","title":"really nice for the price...","review":"you definitely get what you pay for.these speakers are a good deal; i checked out the klipsch promedia 2.0's, but went with the creatives.first...they look great, great design. bass & treble controls, rear input AND a front input.they sound...pretty good. good volume, impressive bass for their size.my biggest gripe: the top mounted port; it's a bass-enhancing port, but, ultimately...it's a hole. sort-of an invitation for dust. oh well...these are desktop speakers, not audiophile speakers, so for what they are:excellent!recommended."},{"rating":"2","title":"Great sounding, especially for not having a subwoofer","review":"Nice speakers. About the best that I could find for 2.0, meaning without a subwoofer. Easy to hook up. Simple controls and they sound really nice. The bass is pretty darn good too, especially since this set does not have a subwoofer.These speakers are solid and weigh enough that they aren't going to be easily bumped around. Because they have a tweeter, the highs are crisp.I bought these to replace the Klipsch 2.0 speakers. No regrets.The only negative is the port on the top, which will collect dust and anything that falls into it."},{"rating":"2","title":"!Perfect ! DeskTop Speakers","review":"Perfect for CD, DVD, Music streams, MP3 and even \\"Cassette Tapes\\" - lows levels or high volume.To quote Webster:1 a: being entirely without fault or defect : flawless <a perfect diamond> b: satisfying all requirements : accurate c: corresponding to an ideal standard or abstract conceptd: d:faithfully reproducing the original; specifically : letter-perfect e: legally valid."},{"rating":"1","title":"Over priced","review":"Performance is not really good. The bass controller is a complete waste for these speakers. I can't turn it up past 3 or the speakers distort horribly. At $90.00, I got hosed. If these were $15 to $20 dollars, I would say they are great. Quality wise, they sound okay at a low volume, maybe if you use them in your office at work they would be fine. I am a musician and am very demanding when it comes to my speakers. I am not currently using them. They are of no use to me. I gave them to my girlfriend."},{"rating":"1","title":"I spent $XX.xx on computer speakers and recieved?!?!","review":"These speakers sound good;for the money I spent I wanted great.Harmon brand dell speakers are a better buy for the money.The only plus that you get is extremely high clear treble.I did receive a box with missing parts but managed to salvage the cables needed from a laptop.My suggestion, for the money test the t10 first.If they are not what you are looking for due to the treble,than jump on the t20 train.The bass is not what you would expect considering the bassXports but it is not bad.It is a comfortable balance when used correctly, the highs can get extremely high with the t20, toooo high, almost ear piercing high.At the end of the day I spent around $80.00 a micro hi-fi system with aux in would be a better purchase.Personally the T10 did it for me, worth the money for the sound quality."},{"rating":"2","title":"That'll do pig, that'll do...","review":"I was looking to replace my Logitech Z-10 (horrible horible sounding speakers by the way. i bought them at a compusa going out of 'all sales are final' busines sale) speakers and narrowed it down to the Bose Companion 3 II and the T20's. I went with the T20's because well, they're a helluva lot cheaper than the Bose and they sound pretty tight.I've heard you need to give these speakers time to \\"break-in\\" for them to reach their true potential and I've just gotten them a few short hours ago and they're sounding like I expected--pretty good. As for a high pitch whining or noise coming from them that some have mentioned, I hear none of that. They are completely silent when nothing is being played.(ahh yes, the blue light is kinda bright but now i can see my keyboard in the dark, score!!)"},{"rating":"2","title":"Fabulous PC Speakers","review":"For a two piece desktop speaker system, it's truly remarkable how well they reproduce the audio spectrum. Warm lows, and clear mids and highs. No booming bass here, since there is no monstrous sub-woofer. And it isn't shrill and dry like laptop and cheap desktop speakers.This product is for PC users who want a clear, detailed and warm sound at their desk. Right now i'm listening to some Baroque and it sounds very warm with alot of clarity. Jazz, new age, classic rock and electronica sound great on these as well. I've actually used these in mixing a few songs (I make ambient/electronica). These really aren't reference monitors, but for amateur musicians it's pretty decent. Klipsch and Bose make similar products at this price range, but I doubt they sound significantly different from the T20.My only gripe with this is the bright blue LED. It gets annoying sometimes when the lights are off, so I cover them."},{"rating":"2","title":"You get what you pay for with these speakers.","review":"These 2.0 speakers sound great (and not just for their size), are adjustable, small, and good looking. I'm about half deaf and every speakers with a separate woofer had too much bass when I turned the volume up so I could understand human speech. I'm happy I spent the money. These are real quality in my opinion."},{"rating":"1","title":"White Noise.","review":"These speakers were ideal, and I was really happy with them for the first 3 months... before they became just a couple of really attractive shelters to house static.This seems to be a reoccurring theme with this model from what I've been able to learn so far.Three months of reliable play from a set of brand new speakers is flat out unacceptable. There's no excuse for that."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good sound but unreliable","review":"Sound is really good for a two speaker system. Unfortunately, after three months as it suddenly began making large static noises. This occurred even after I pulled out all audio ports off the right speaker. It only stopped once I turned off the speakers. I had to disconnect and reconnect the AC power to the right speaker several dozen times before the problem went away. I'll be getting another pair eventually as I figure this system won't last much longer."},{"rating":"1","title":"Crappy sound.","review":"These sound really crappy for a $99 pair or speakers. Consider a 2 speaker set from Klipsch or Bose instead. I now own the Kilpsch which sound worlds better than this Creative set.Build quality on the Creative feels better than the Klipsch or Bose, but what use is the build if they sound horrible.The Creatives also wimp out on power. Jack them up to full volume and you'll be left wishing for more power. The Klipsch or Bose won't disappoint you power-wise or for sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good, Clear sound...lacks Bass","review":"I purchased these speakers to replace my original Boston Accoustics 2.1 speakers that had a sub-woofer; but were not very good on midrange clarity. These GigaWorks speakers are Very clear sounding with good mid-range and highs. Even with the bass ports they do lack deep bass tones, which is to be expected I guess. I'm very pleased with them...they bring my World of Warcraft experience alive with very clear sound effects. Very pleased with the quality for the money!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Not so Happy with these","review":"Sound is good for the size. Bass is ok for just a pair of desktop speakers. Volume is very minimal hooked to my home computer. Ended up putting my old Altec Lansing speakers back to the PC. Disappointed with these. Nice package but not so powerful sound."},{"rating":"2","title":"unbelievable","review":"I just bought them and installed them. Unbelievable, period. one of the best buys I've done on amazon.com. I was looking for speakers that have some bass but don't want to sacrifice bass for clarity in the sound quality. I've had some in the past that will cut the voice for the bass which is unacceptable. I was planning on buying some 50 dollar speakers which looked like they would suffice. When I read the reviews, however, I realized that there were major issues with those. I canceled that order and ordered these and for something like 40 dollars more, I had the ability to know that I was getting quality sound and an extended life of the speakers. Only issue I have now is making sure that the bass isn't to loud for the rest of the people in the house. Very pleased. hope you enjoy just as much."},{"rating":"2","title":"Big sound, small footprint","review":"I was looking for a good sound in a small speaker set and found it in this product. I've been pleased with my purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"GigaWorks T20 - excellent speakers!","review":"These are the best 2.0 speakers I've heard in this price range! I bought these online (untested in any store) and was basically going by what others were saying about them, and I gotta say I'm happy I took the chance on them because they are well worth the $80 (that I paid)!They are powerful speakers, with crystal clear highs and low mid range tones. I wasn't expecting the bass to sound as good as it does without a subwoofer, but I was pleasantly surprised at how much of a punch they actually deliver. If you're expecting to listen to rap or loud rock, I suggest looking elsewhere, but for everyday PC speakers these can't be beat! I use them for music as well as games, and they both sound fantastic! highly recommended!"},{"rating":"1","title":"A Creative Lemon...","review":"They sounded beautiful for about two months until the tweeter blew out on me.I would like to point out that I babied these speakers and did not abuse them.I never had any of the levels past 1/2 of the way.Do yourself a favor and DO NOT THROW YOUR MONEY AWAY ON THESE LEMONS!"},{"rating":"1","title":"DON'T BUY!","review":"Our MCSE consultant spent 77 hours installing and dealing with their inept tech support.

As the liner notes state, these songs are somewhat random and more casual in their approach. But what better way to play and record the blues? The title track is awesome, and from the album's first notes you can tell that this is music from the dark muddy jealous heart. Slow, thick, and Southern, a very worthwhile collection of songs, moods, and stories. Lightnin' is an amazing guitar player. My only hold-back is that, due to its \\"assemblage\\" nature, the album lacks a certain coherence overall that in no way detracts from its individual songs.

Todd went to so much trouble to set up the picnic and it wasn't even their annivarsary it was just a year since Liz wrote for the 1st time on the Oracle.and not many guys try to cook and make the picnic perfect but then again guys usually don't even remember these kinds of date s so I think Liz should realize how LUCKY she is to have TODD and she SHOULD STOP CHEATING ON HIM because TODD AND LIZ'S LOVE IS ONE OF A KIND.I can't believe that when Jessica thought it was Christain she was seeing it was really his younger brother who looked a lot like Christain.The only reason Jess hadn't met him was because he was at his school."},{"rating":"2","title":"A Great book","review":"this was a good book because two schools almost get in a fight, like they did in a different sweet valley book"},{"rating":"1","title":"Typical Blah Blah Blah","review":"Typical mainline thinking that's so in the box it's reminiscent of what the church was like.

I have two."},{"rating":"1","title":"Bad stitching and dissolving material","review":"I'm reviewing this about 10 months after buying it. Two things have occurred in those 10 months that should discourage you from buying this comforter.One, within the first two months of buying, the internal stitching (that keeps the \\"down\\" material evenly spread throughout the comforter) came apart internally. This means that all of the artificial down floats around in the comforter. It is lumpy and unattractive. It also makes parts of the blanket not insulating (and makes it feel flat and cheap.)The second thing is after about 6 months the outer material began dissolving at certain points. That is, it wore so thin that a hole appeared where the internal material falls out. I have had to stitch five separate holes, making it look almost comical.Neither of these problems were created by harsh washing (it's practically impossible to get this thing in a washing machine anyways.) While initially I loved this comforter, it did not last even a year."},{"rating":"2","title":"Good Buy","review":"I bought this comforter after reading all the good reviews. I live in Denver, CO. and I thought this would be a nice warm blanket to use this winter. Although some say this comforter is heavy I didn't think so. So far after a few weeks of use my wife and I love this comforter. I leave my thermostat set at 65 at nights and this keeps us nice and warm. On those really cold nights when the temp outside is below 20 I just put on a pair of fleece pajama pants and I am toasty; sometime too warm.I would recommend this to anyone who is looking for a good comforter w/o the feathers poking you."},{"rating":"2","title":"Comforter comfort","review":"Very warm comforter....like an instant heater.

I bought two of these comforters for my kids beds. I always wash clothes and bedding before using them and that was when I discovered how sub par the quality of these comforters are. After being washed and dried per the manufacturers instructions, the filler clung together in a large ball inside each baffle. It is no longer evenly distributed and I can't get it to unclump. Even more disappoining is that some of the baffles have no filler in them at all! Ridiculous. These were Christmas gifts for my kids and I should have pulled them out and inspected them as soon as I got them as now that we have opened them we are past our return date and I am left with two unusable comforters and no more money to replace them. I wouldn't even feel good about donating these to the Goodwill or Salvation Army.

However, I am extremely disappointed by the quality of the video. Atrocious. Its like I am watching something in lower resolution on YouTube. I had previously downloaded a HD copy from iTunes and the quality is much better. This DVD was produced by XO Digital and they apparently have the exclusive rights to the BCS and SEC game reproductions.

It's so bad I thought my player was messing up. I honestly can't believe that XOS Sports and the BCS would allow a product that is this bad to ever reach the shelves of the retailers. It's an embarrassment to them. It's so painfully obvious that this was never watched before the final was approved for mass production.

Never before has there been a shutout in a BCS Championship game. Roll TIDE!

This is my second pair. The only draw back is the leather inserts which can occasionally come apart due to weakness in the adhesive depending on how often the gun is removed from the hangers. I certainly recommend the product and the shipping price was reasonable since these hangers are heavy duty."},{"rating":"1","title":"Poor product not suited to it's advertised purpose","review":"I purchased this product with the intention of hanging a shotgun above my closet door for quick access in an emergency. This wall mount is tiny and not suitable for mounting any modern firearm. It looks like it's designed to hold an old musket or similar very thin rifle. Not anything with any bulk to it.Also the eyelets for mounting screws are open-ended. This makes it very easy for the mounting screw to slip out of the \\"notch\\" under the weight of a weapon. Very unsafe! The last thing I want is a loaded shotgun falling off the wall in the middle of the night.I bought this product but will not use it. Was a waste of money."},{"rating":"1","title":"Brass should shine","review":"I recently purchased a set of the Hoppe's decorative hangers to go along with the rifle case I purchased. Serriously? I thought brass was supposed to shine. I opened the package to get a better look and it looked like it had been in the package for years. The shipper apparently ever served in the armed forces and had to use Brasso. That's what I did for two hours straight to get the shine it should have. Would not recommend this at all"},{"rating":"2","title":"Elegant","review":"They look great and keep the rifle up out of reach of the kids. The brass finish goes with every decor."},{"rating":"2","title":"great for black powder rifles","review":"These Hoppes brass wall mounts worked great for displaying my Hawkens smokepole. the only critique would be to cast it with full wrap mounting holes( not adding that much more brass) and should be used with dry wall mollies if going to hang to drywall. Can not see using for anything like modern weapons, large forearm pumps and like weapons. The brass goes so well with the brass patch box in stock and double set trigger guard.Minus one star for mounting flaw in my opinion."},{"rating":"2","title":"Quick delivery","review":"Delivered insanely fast, a day ahead of the earliest estimated delivery day in fact. Item as described, although the photo online is a completely different colour.

The installation was easy into a wood panelled wall. I think installation into drywall would require special fasteners which do not come with the hangers. The finish looks to be polished brass but not polished to a mirror finish. They are thick material and very strong so that if they are fastened to the wall securely they should be able to hold significant weight.These hangers are attractive but do not overwhelm the object being displayed. All in all, I'm quite satisfied with this purchase."},{"rating":"2","title":"Mosin Nagant Hangers","review":"For the longest time I wanted to mount my Mosin Nagant on my wall but wanted something quality to do so and these were my solution.The mounts are VERY sturdy and mount securely enough to hold a Mosin Nagant 91/30. They have a felt pad where the rifle sits too so they wont damage/ dent any wood on the rifle which is very nice. I would highly recommend these hangers."},{"rating":"2","title":"Smaller than I thought.","review":"These served my purpose of mounting a Muzzleloader to the wall with a little finaggling. They are much smaller than I had imagined them being. The screws it came with were short so my husband used a different screw to ensure that it hit the stud so that the gun did not fall off the wall. All and all it worked."},{"rating":"1","title":"Cracked.Scratched","review":"This is the SECOND solid brass gun display hangers I've received from Amazon. This set, similar to the first, has places on the brass supports that are cracked from one side of the support to the other. On this set, it looks like they tried to buff over the cracks, and overdid the buffing resulting in scratching of the brass coating. Also, on the one end that goes against the wall, the brass coating is pocketed and missing - just like on the first set.These products must be rejects from Hoppe's otherwise excellent suppliers."},{"rating":"1","title":"all grown down!","review":"Do not watch all grown up at all.Its one of the stupidest shows ever made.The only good one is iterview with a campfire .

It goes into detail about specific places used in the series that actually exist (or are based on) in Japan! It also goes in depth on characters and their backgrounds of Japanese mythology, religion, etc. An example: the three talismans that belong to Uranus, Neptune, and Pluto are based on the talismans related to the myth pertaining to the birth of the first Japanese emperor.

They hook on to boom cymbal stands as well as drums, but they are hard to position on drums. If put on a cymbal stand, the mic rattles a little in the recording.Other than that, these mics are awesome. I gave this 5 stars because the quality of the mics out do the irratating clips.You will not find a better mic kit for this price."},{"rating":"2","title":"An intriguing read...","review":"JDC is an excellent writer and is completely conversant with the subject matter. However, the reader is cautioned to also see the 3 volume set of writings on similar matters by N. T. Wright as well, for another (and more credible) take on much the same material. A very well presented volume regarding First Century Judaism...and its relationship to early Christianity, vis-a-vis the aims, beliefs and intentions of Jesus."},{"rating":"2","title":"Correction","review":"Just to correct a previous reviewer, Crossan does identify himself as a practicing Christian. In a recent interview on NPR's Fresh Air, he claimed that though he does not attend church regularly, he does pray and attempts throughout his life to live as Jesus lived. He stated that he trusted God, trusted Jesus, and, referencing Paul, that he loved God with all his heart, all his might, and all his mind. While of course Crossan is not a fundamentalist Christian (and is in fundamental disagreement with that camp), it would be unfair to say that he is not a Christian at all. If he calls himself a Christian, none but he and God (if such a thing exists) are fit to judge otherwise."},{"rating":"1","title":"Whoa--Too Pedantic","review":"Maybe I'm just not very smart (I only have 3 degrees) but I had a lot of difficulty with this book. I never did figure out what most of the exhaustive quotes had to do with the Historical Jesus. I guess I thought the author would try to demonstrate that Jesus was a historical figure or else that He wasn't. But if he did it escaped me. He seemed to try very hard to show the reader just how extremely erudite he is--and I have no doubt that he is indeed a very learned man but the constant pedantry just wore me out--he should learn how to simply tell a \\"story\\". Sorry--the book was a disappointment to me"},{"rating":"2","title":"Not for amateurs","review":"Crossan's work is a complex and thorough approach to the Jesus material in the New Testament, as well as to the socio-political period in which Jesus lived. In his preface, Crossan clearly outlines the assumptions that undergird his understanding of both; and I would caution any reader to keep those assumptions in mind. Taking that caveat into account, however, this is a brilliant magnum opus by an outstanding scholar; but one that will take considerable effort for someone not already familiar with the field to understand."},{"rating":"1","title":"J.D. Crossan does the impossible","review":"John D. Crossan has almost done the impossible. He wrote a 600 page book on the subject of the historical Jesus, and almost never mentioned Jesus. There is an extensive portrait of first century Palestine, and a detailed description of the life of a commoner. We learn everything there is to know about Josephus, get the opinion of seventeen different archeologists about what Gallilee was like. But there is no Jesus. It's as if Titian painted the death of Socrates, but left the main character out of the picture. Very disappointing."},{"rating":"1","title":"Disappointing","review":"What a rip off. I expected to learn about the historical being, Jesus. Instead the author tells me about the whole Mediteranian. He includes miscellaneous material as if to impress me with his knowledge, but I had to read 250 pages of a 500 page book to even have Jesus mentioned. I suggest if you buy this book, use it as a book end. It is not a buy for $14.00. I wish Mr. Crossan had stuck to material on which the book is entitled. The author has written the book to impress himself. He sure will not impress any readers."},{"rating":"1","title":"Rationalism, Not Scholarship","review":"This book shows little more than Father Crossan's rationalistic biases. These center about an a priori denial of the possibility of miraculous events. The ensuing denial of the authenticity of the Gospels as historical documents then becomes little more than a foregone conclusion."},{"rating":"1","title":"Good outside, Bad inside","review":"The outside case seems well constructed and looks very good, but inside the individual cd envelopes may be removable by feature but they do not like to stay in on their own accord. Every time I flip through the case one or two fall out."},{"rating":"2","title":"Skeletal System Anatomical Chart Laminated","review":"Nice teaching and learning aid at a reasonable price that was delivered on time."},{"rating":"1","title":"Shipper could care less!","review":"I was all excited to begin my son's Medical School Year with Really Accurate Body System Plastic Coated Posters. So far, 2 of the 4 posters arrived. To my surprise, rather than the sender packaging them in poster tubes, they arrived All Crumbled in a Box. There are at least 8 deep creases running across each poster, making them useless for display. In addition, spending nearly $80.00 for pure useless garbage reminds me why I'll never order from Amazon again!!!"},{"rating":"1","title":"Horrible Packaging","review":"I was so excited to get this in the mail. I want to work in forensics and I figured this would be a good studying tool (along with books)for learning the bones. Its funny because when I went to check what I got, the girl pulled out this oversized, long, rectangular box and I was like, \\"What is that?!\\" Im 5'6 and this box almost came up to my breasts! The packaging was ridiculous and unnecessary. I dont understand why it didnt come in a tube like all posters do. This was folded in three, which resulted in deep creases on the poster. And since it wasnt secured, every bump the box has, shows on the poster. The poster is very detailed and would make a great studying tool, but they need to ship things off right. I'm sending it back the way it should have come, in a tube."},{"rating":"2","title":"great value","review":"I received this poster very quickly, and overall I am very impressed with it! The poster looks great on my wall. Initially, I was a little worried as to if the descriptions would be visible, but they are extremely visible and quite nice."},{"rating":"2","title":"Exactly What It Says","review":"I got this book for my dad for Christmas, not knowing what it was like or anything. It is pretty much formatted like an encyclopedia would be, hence the name. As far as quality of the book, it is similar to the average school textbook...nice hard cover and about the size of the average math, history, etc. book. It has some pictures in it, all black and white, and the western movies are listed in alphabetical order through the book. Very good reference if you are just wanting to know what a movie is about, who is in it, the director, year, what company produced it, etc. It runs fairly recent up to Young Guns and possibly some other recent movies. My dad is an avid western collector, so now he has something to reference them by."},{"rating":"2","title":"A great gift for the western-nut","review":"This book is a walk down memory land for those of us who grew up on western movies. I gave it as a gift to a friend who is truly addicted to westerns. Now if someone would only write a book on the movie horses the stars rode, we'd all be fascinated."},{"rating":"1","title":"Seriously, Honeywell!? Styrofoam componentry & NO AIR FLOW!?","review":"I have three other Honeywell air filters (I'll put in model numbers later - two of one model and one of another model) and they're all really very good. This one, however, mystifies me because the internal fan cowl is made of styrofoam, and not even high density styrofoam, it's similar to to what the unit came packed in for shipping. Even if that's acceptable on some deranged level of engineering logic (I'm sure management thinks this is just nifty) - the air flow from this thing is pitiful! The smallest honeywell unit I have pushes five times the output on high than this one does on high. This thing is going back, asap. On that note, thanks Amazon for making returns hassle free and easy!!UPDATE:I bought this one instead, it's been working great for 45 days straight on Medium or High.Honeywell 50250-S 99.97% Pure HEPA Round Air Purifier"},{"rating":"2","title":"Great product - worth every penny","review":"This air purifier is the best.
